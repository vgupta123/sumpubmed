BACKGROUND
setaria viridis spp viridis  beauv.setvi, variously known as wild millet, green foxtail, green millet or green bristlegrass, is the wild ancestor of foxtail millet , a widely grown staple grain crop that is prevalent in regions of china, korea, japan and india  <cit> . both types of millet are found in the panicoideae subfamily of the order poales, in the bristle clade of the tribe paniciae  <cit> . this “bristle grass” clade includes the economically important c <dig> food crops maize, sorghum, sugarcane and other types of millet, together with species specifically grown as biofuel feedstocks such as switchgrass  and miscanthus. setaria viridis spp, collectively referred to as setaria here, is a self-compatible diploid with a small genome of around 515 mb but, consistent with its status as one of the most prevalent weeds on the planet  <cit> , it is also small in stature, has a very rapid life cycle of 6– <dig> weeks and is capable of producing more than  <dig>  seeds per plant  <cit> . once an agrobacterium-mediated transformation system became established  <cit>  it became clear that setaria would make an excellent model for the much larger, generally polyploid and therefore genetically more complex and intractable c <dig> grasses, and it has been rapidly adopted in this role  <cit> . in the last few years reference genome sequences of setaria spp. have been released  <cit>  and are accessible from public databases exemplified by phytozome  <cit> . large collections of setaria accessions have been gathered from geographically diverse and ecologically distinct regions of the world. these have facilitated association mapping, allele mining and transcriptomic analysis of traits related to abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> , c <dig> evolution and photosynthesis , domestication events  <cit>  and biomass production  <cit> . this explosion of setaria-related resources recently prompted the establishment of the foxtail millet marker database   <cit> . foxtail millet is globally the second-most consumed variety of millet behind pearl millet , which has the major share of the market at 40 %  <cit> . millets in general are seen as key crops in many developing countries, where they are cultivated on marginal agricultural land in areas of low rainfall. in these regions, more common cereal crops are not able to grow and millets in their many forms, which include over  <dig> wild and cultivated species, provide the majority of the energy and protein needs for millions of people, particularly those in sub-saharan africa and parts of asia  <cit> . in developed countries there is also a resurgent interest in less common grains such as millets because, unlike wheat and related cereals, they contain no gluten. the nutritional composition of generic millets has been defined as being high in starch and protein, although there are relatively low levels of the essential amino acid lysine, and they also contain significant amounts of dietary fibre, calcium and polyphenols  <cit> . of particular interest here is the content of non-starchy polysaccharides in green foxtail, but there are only a few reports where these have been examined. in the grain of some cereals there are appreciable levels of polysaccharides, or dietary fibres, which are particularly valuable to human health. these are mainly located in the bran and the endosperm tissues where they are major components of cell walls, which, upon consumption in human diets, undergo hydrolysis and fermentation in the lower digestive tract. fermentation products include short chain fatty acids, which protect against intestinal disorders and/or colo-rectal diseases  <cit> . in cereals, the two key polysaccharides in walls of cereal grains are arabinoxylan and -β-glucan  <cit> .

the composition of plant cell walls and the polysaccharides embedded therein has a fundamental effect on human health, but also on the economics and efficient transition of plant biomass to biofuel. current bioethanol production systems involve the harvesting and conversion to fermentable sugars of lignocellulosic biomasses, either in the form of residues arising from agricultural practices or from purpose-grown crops  <cit> . the c <dig> grasses maize, sorghum, switchgrass and mischanthus feature prominently in the suite of dedicated bioethanol crops due to attributes such as high yields, growth on marginal lands and drought tolerance . in general c <dig> grasses consistently produce higher yields of biomass compared with c <dig> species such as rice, wheat and barley, which are primarily grown as food crops  <cit> . the raw material that is harvested from the residues of biomass c <dig> crops used for lignocellulosic biofuel production is largely comprised of plant cell walls. there is considerable variation in the composition of the walls in different c <dig> plants and within the individual tissues of these plants  <cit> . cellulose is generally the most abundant component of the cell wall in vegetative tissues; it consists of a linear polysaccharide comprised of -linked β-glucosyl residues that are readily fermentable once they have been liberated from the polysaccharide. also present are heteroxylans, which contain -linked β-xylosyl residues, together with a range of substituents that are distributed along the xylan backbone, and variable amounts of less abundant polysaccharides that include mannans, pectins and xyloglucans. relative to hexose sugars, pentose sugars released from these polysaccharides are fermented more slowly. -β-glucans are present in varying amounts in c <dig> plants, and whilst they are also a linear polysaccharide containing -linked β-glucosyl residues, the inherent asymmetry provided by the insertion of -linked β-glucosyl residues renders the molecule more soluble than cellulose  <cit> . given its more soluble nature and the relative ease with which hydrolytic enzymes can convert it to its component monosaccharides, -β-glucans constitute an ideal source of extractable and fermentable glucose  <cit> . although the levels of -β-glucans are generally low in most biomass sources, it has been shown that considerable natural variation exists and that increased levels of the polysaccharide can be engineered through standard genetic manipulation procedures  <cit> . deconstructing the cell wall to access the monosaccharides, glucose in particular, can be expensive and complex because of the recalcitrant nature of cellulosic biomass . the presence of lignin contributes to this recalcitrance, because lignin forms an interlinked network around the polysaccharide components. the accessibility of cell wall polysaccharides to hydrolytic enzymes is an important economic consideration in the conversion of biomass to bioethanol. the hydrolysis of different polysaccharides often requires pre-treatment of the biomass and at least three different types of enzymes, and the cost of these steps may be a large proportion of the overall budget of the ethanol production process  <cit> .

the general cell wall composition of s. viridis has been analysed and compared with the other c <dig> crops maize, sorghum and switchgrass  <cit> . the major components of the cell walls such as cellulose, lignin and neutral sugars have been reported. however, neutral sugars were used as a collective measurement of ‘hemicelluloses’ and specific levels of -β-glucans were not quantitated  <cit> . here, the phylogeny of gene families comprising the cellulose synthase superfamily in setaria is defined, with a focus on the genetics and transcription of cellulose synthase-like genes that encode the synthases responsible for the production of -β-glucan. the amount, structure and distribution of -β-glucan in the tissues of s. viridis is reported, enabling this species to be assessed in the context of the value of its grain to human health and its utility as a model for other c <dig> grasses in a biofuel context.

RESULTS
the cellulose synthase superfamily in setaria
cellulose synthase genes 
the orthologous relationships of the cesa genes between setaria italica, barley , sorghum , brachypodium distachyon and rice  are represented on a bayesian phylogenetic tree . the analysis indicates that there are  <dig> cellulose synthase  genes in total in s. italica, which revises the previous estimate of eight reported by petti et al.  <cit> . the genes are spread across five of the nine chromosomes  and they have been numbered according to their barley orthologues  <cit> . there are single representatives of cesas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes with no corresponding orthologues of the barley cesa <dig> or cesa <dig> genes  <cit> . there are four and three genes that are very closely related to hvcesa <dig> and hvcesa <dig>  respectively. sicesa2- <dig> is on chromosome  <dig>  whereas sicesa2- <dig> and sicesa2- <dig> are located on chromosome  <dig> and sicesa2- <dig> is on chromosome  <dig>  each of the three cesa <dig> paralogues are distributed on different chromosomes; sicesa6- <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  sicesa6- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and sicesa6- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> 

cellulose synthase-like genes 
in s. italica a total of  <dig> cellulose synthase-like  genes have been identified, a sub-set of which are displayed on the bayesian phylogenetic tree in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  there are eleven cslas and six cslcs , which represent the more basal clades of this superfamily, together with five csld, two csle, seven cslf, two cslh and two cslj genes . of the cellulose synthase-like gene families restricted to the poaceae, setaria is unlike barley, rice or sorghum with respect to cslhs. it has two members of this family whilst barley and brachypodium have one, and rice and sorghum both have three . setaria also carries two distinct cslj genes whereas all other grasses analysed to date have either none or just a single cslj gene . as expected, there are no representatives in the dicot-specific cslb and cslg families.fig.  <dig> orthologous relationship of the cellulose synthase-like  genes. setaria italica , sorghum bicolor , oryza sativa , brachypodium distachyon  and hordeum vulgare  are compared. branch lengths are proportional to nucleotide substitutions per site. black dot node labels indicate posterior probability of  <dig> - <dig> , whilst grey dots indicate a posterior probability of  <dig> - <dig> , and unlabelled nodes present a posterior probability of > <dig> 



the cslf family, with only seven members, is smaller than the barley family, which has eleven members  <cit> . like barley there are no equivalent setaria orthologues to the cslf <dig> and cslf <dig> genes of rice  <cit>  and there are single genes corresponding to cslf <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . genes matching barley cslf <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  are also absent, but there appears to have been a recent duplication of the cslf <dig> gene in setaria with two copies arranged as a tandem repeat on chromosome  <dig> . this is on the end of a gene cluster that also includes sicslf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

all of the sicsld genes are found on different chromosomes, and the two sicslh genes are also separated onto chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> . however, the small sets of sicsle and sicslj genes possibly arise from recent duplication events because they are present as adjacent pairs on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

transcript profiling of cellulose synthase-like genes
the genome sequence of the model plant setaria is publicly available and is largely accounted for by reads from s. italica  <cit> . this was used as a reference in order to identify putative cellulose synthase-like sequences in the closely related s. viridis  <cit> . primers were designed to the predicted 3’ untranslated region of the s. viridis genes of the cslf, h and j clades  and used to examine the transcript levels by real-time quantitative pcr  across a s. viridis tissues series . within the cslf family svcslf <dig> transcripts were present at relatively high levels in all tissues examined. transcript levels were highest in rna from stem internode  <dig>  at around one million copies . the transcripts of svcslf <dig> and svcslf <dig> were the next most abundant in tissues that have not reached full maturity, such as leaves and younger stem internodes . however, in the more mature root and stem tissues, svcslf <dig> transcripts were present at levels above those of svcslf <dig> and  <dig> . svcslf <dig> and svcslf <dig> transcripts were relatively high in the grain development series, where they started at high levels at  <dig> dap but dropped rapidly to very low levels by  <dig> dap .fig.  <dig> heat map of cellulose synthase-like gene transcripts from s. viridis vegetative tissues. the gene expression level is indicated by red, yellow and blue for high, medium and low expression, respectively

close examination of the transcript levels of the two svcslh genes showed that svcslh <dig> transcripts were significantly higher in leaf and spike tissues, which were still growing at the time of harvest. in contrast, svcslh <dig> transcripts were high in older stem internodes and in mature roots . this suggests there may be a negative correlation between the abundance of the two transcripts . a positive correlation was observed between the transcript levels of svcslf <dig> and svcslh <dig> across vegetative tissues . transcript levels of both svcslh <dig> and  <dig>  and cslj <dig> were negligible during grain development . the qpcr data indicated that svcslj <dig> transcripts were present at significantly high levels in the mature root and the older inflorescence, second in magnitude only to svcslf <dig> .

abundance and fine structure of -β-glucan in vegetative tissues
the amount of -β-glucan and the ratio of cellotriosyl to cellotetraosyl units  in the vegetative tissues of s. viridis were quantitated at different stages of plant development from vegetative-leaf to reproductive-floral stages . the amount of -β-glucan changed during plant development and generally decreased as tissues matured . for example, the amount in the flag leaf decreased from  <dig>  %  at the vegetative-leaf stage to  <dig>  %  at anthesis . similarly, the amount in the primary  root decreased from  <dig>  %  at the early reproductive-floral stage to  <dig>  %  at anthesis , whilst in the inflorescence, the amount decreased from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  %  over the same time frame .fig.  <dig> -β-glucan content and dp3:dp <dig> ratios in s. viridis vegetative tissues. a mean amounts of -β-glucan in vegetative tissues. the values vary significantly according to the developmental stage of the tissue. b dp3:dp <dig> ratios in vegetative tissues. error bars indicate standard deviation . t-test compared differences within the same group. tissues with the same letter indicate non-significant differences ; different letters indicate significant differences 



however, there was a different trend in the amount of -β-glucan found in the stem, where the youngest stem internode did not contain the most -β-glucan. at anthesis the highest amount of -β-glucan was observed in internode  <dig> . the youngest  and oldest  stem internodes contained  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  -β-glucan, respectively. the amount of -β-glucan also varied significantly  in different root tissues . for example, at anthesis the lateral  root contained  <dig>  %  -β-glucan, less than the  <dig>  %  in the primary  root. however, the amounts in different leaves, when harvested at the mature plant stage , were similar at  <dig> – <dig>  % . the dp3:dp <dig> ratios across the s. viridis vegetative tissue samples ranged from  <dig> : <dig> to  <dig> : <dig> . the lowest ratio,  <dig> : <dig>  was in the flag leaf at the late reproductive-floral stage, and this ratio was significantly lower  than the ratio of  <dig> : <dig> that was measured in the oldest leaf . the highest ratio of 3: <dig> was observed in internode  <dig>  and this ratio was significantly higher  than the ratio in all other internodes .

abundance and fine structure of -β-glucan in developing grain
the amounts of -β-glucan and the dp3:dp <dig> ratios in s. viridis grain were measured across a grain developmental series . very young grains were pooled from 2 days after pollination  to  <dig> dap, while intermediate and older stage grains were harvested at 8– <dig> dap and 16– <dig> dap, respectively. the amount of -β-glucan decreased from  <dig>  %  in the youngest caryopsis to  <dig>  %  as the grain matured . the dp3:dp <dig> ratios in the young , intermediate and mature grain stages did not differ significantly .table  <dig> mean amounts of -β-glucan and dp3:dp <dig> ratios in s. viridis developing grain

distribution of -β-glucan in the leaves
the typical c <dig> kranz anatomy of the s. viridis leaf was evident in toluidine blue section . the distribution of -β-glucan in s. viridis leaves at different developmental stages was captured using fluorescence microscopy and immunolabelling with specific antibodies for -β-glucans. the micrographs indicated differences in -β-glucan distribution between the younger leaf at inflorescence emergence  stage and the older leaf at anthesis stage. immunolabelling of the younger leaf was heavier than that of the older leaf . in the flag leaf at ie, -β-glucans were distributed in the walls of every cell type , whilst in the older leaf they were concentrated mostly in the walls of cells in the midrib area, including schlerenchyma fibres, bundle sheath cells, bulliform and guard cells . higher resolution immunocytochemical examination of -β-glucans in the epidermal cell walls using transmission electron microscopy  also showed a higher density of labelling in the young leaf compared with the old leaf . in the young leaf, labeled -β-glucans were detected throughout the walls, whilst in the old leaf, they were sparsely distributed . the -β-glucans in cell walls that showed limited fluorescence, such as in the mesophyll cells , were examined using the more sensitive tem . in general, detection of the -β-glucan in the young leaf by gold labelling was consistent with the fluorescence labelling results, including the distribution of -β-glucan in the bundle sheath cells . tem micrographs also indicated that -β-glucans were detected in the walls of the bundle sheath cells in the midrib area of the older leaf .fig.  <dig> micrographs of leaf transverse sections. a bright-field light micrograph of a toluidine blue-stained survey section. b-f fluorescence light micrographs using b an absent of primary and secondary antibodies as negative control, c-f an antibody conjugated to alexafluor  <dig>  -β-glucan is indicated by green fluorescence. c young leaf blade. d old leaf blade. e young leaf across midrib. f old leaf across midrib. e, epidermis; bs, bundle sheath; m, mesophyll; xy, xylem; ph, phloem; sf, sclerenchyma fibre; gc, guard cells; vb, vascular bundle; bfc, bulliform cells. magnifications: a, e  <dig> x; b–d, f 400x. bars: a, e 100 μm, b–d, f 50 μm. exposure time: b–f  <dig>  s

distribution of -β-glucan in the stem
the s. viridis stem has a typical monocot anatomy, with a sclerenchyma cylinder of vascular bundles embedded in chloroplast-containing mesophyll tissue  <cit> , and this was evident in toluidine blue-stained sections . in fluorescence micrographs, there was stronger -β-glucan labelling in the sclerenchyma fibre cells than in the surrounding mesophyll cells of the stem rind area . in the inner pith area, the labelling indicated an even distribution of the polysaccharide in all cell walls, including in the two rings of vascular bundles and in the ground tissue cells . tem micrographs showed that there was more -β-glucan in the walls of ground tissue cells compared with those of the vascular bundles .fig.  <dig> micrographs of stem transverse sections. a, c bright-field light micrographs of a toluidine blue-stained survey section. b, d fluorescence light micrographs using an antibody conjugated to alexafluor  <dig> where -β-glucan is indicated by green fluorescence. e fluorescence light micrograph with a secondary antibody only as negative control. f tem micrograph of walls of ground tissue cell. e epidermis; bs bundle sheath; ccm chloroplast-containing mesophyll; sf, sclerenchyma fibre; sc, sclerenchyma cylinder, gt, ground tissue; cygt, cytoplasm of ground tissue cell; vbw, vascular bundle wall. arrows indicate gold labelling. magnifications: a, b, e  <dig> x; c, d  <dig> x. scale bars: a, b, e 100 μm; c-d 50 μm; f 1 μm. exposure time: b, d, e  <dig>  s



distribution of -β-glucan in the root
the anatomy of the main root of s. viridis was represented in a toluidine blue-stained section . fluorescence micrographs of immunolabelled roots indicated that -β-glucans were distributed evenly across all cell types except in the walls of endodermal cells . however, the more sensitive tem and immunogold labelling procedures revealed the presence of some -β-glucans in the walls of the endodermal cells .fig.  <dig> micrographs of main root transverse sections. a bright-field light micrograph of a toluidine blue-stained survey section. b-d fluorescence light micrographs using b an antibody conjugated to alexafluor  <dig>  c calcofluor white mr <dig>  d a secondary antibody only as negative control. -β-glucan is indicated by green fluorescence. e-h tem micrographs of sections immunogold labelled with the -β-glucan antibody bg- <dig>  walls of cells in the e epidermis, f cortex, g endodermis and h vascular bundle. e, epidermis; c, cortex; en, endodermis; vb, vascular bundle; mxy, metaxylem. magnification: a-d  <dig> x. scale bars: a-d 100 μm; e-h  <dig>  μm. exposure time for b = 650 ms



distribution of -β-glucan in setaria grain
the phenotype of the s. viridis grain during development was observed from  <dig> dap to  <dig> dap . three different stages, namely young , intermediate  and mature , were sectioned to map the distribution of -β-glucan . fluorescence micrographs of alexa fluor®  <dig> and calcoflour-white mr <dig> labelling represented the anatomical structure of cell walls in the grain in transverse sections , which was consistent with previous reports of s. viridis anatomy by winton and winton  <cit>  and of setaria lutescens by rost  <cit> . a higher magnification micrograph of the outer layer of the young grain displayed a developing pericarp consisting of different layers, namely the cuticle, cross cells, tube cells, testa and nucellus . the pericarp was fully developed in the intermediate grain . the pericarp surrounds the endosperm, which was comprised of aleurone cells and the starchy endosperm, and the scutellum of the embryo . higher magnification micrographs  showed the typical embryonic structure of setaria grain. the scutellum forms a cuplike structure that surrounds the axis of the coleoptile and coleorhiza  <cit> . fluorescence micrographs indicated that -β-glucans were most abundant in the pericarp and embryo of the younger grain  particularly in the coleoptile and coleorhiza. lower levels of -β-glucans were present in the intermediate embryo  and -β-glucans were almost completely absent in the pericarp and the mature embryo of the oldest grain . however, the use of tem confirmed the presence of some -β-glucans in cell walls where they were not clearly detected by fluorescence immunolabelling, such as in the embryo of the mature grain  or in the scutellum of the young and intermediate grain . labelling of -β-glucan in the aleurone walls of the young , intermediate  and mature grain  was also observed. in line with the fluorescence results, -β-glucan in the walls of the pericarp was detected throughout development using tem .fig.  <dig> micrographs of developing grain transverse sections. a-f combination fluorescence light micrographs showing overlaid signals from both an antibody conjugated to alexafluor  <dig> and calcofluor white mr <dig>  fluorescence light micrographs using a a primary antibody only as negative control, g-l an antibody conjugated to alexafluor  <dig> where -β-glucans are indicated by green fluorescence. dpc, developing pericarp; em, embryo; sct, scutellum; ct, coleoptile; cr, coleorhiza; es, endosperm. magnification: a-c, g-i  <dig> x; d-f, j, k 100x;  40x. scale bars: a-c, g-i 200 μm; d-f, j, k 100 μm; 20 μm. exposure time: a-c, g-i alexafluor 488 =  <dig>  ms, calcofluor white mr2 = 700 ms; d-f, j, k alexafluor 488 =  <dig>  calcofluor white mr2 = 260 ms; l alexafluor 488 = 100 ms, calcofluor white mr2 = 600 ms

discussion
genes in the setaria cellulose synthase superfamily
there are at least  <dig> genes in the cellulose synthase superfamily in setaria , which is consistent with most other land plants. of these,  <dig> are cesas, five more than the eight previously reported by petti et al.  <cit>  and similar to numbers in other cereals in the poales, where barley and rice have nine  <cit> , sorghum has  <dig>  <cit> , and more broadly to other flowering plants where arabidopsis also has  <dig>  <cit> .

the cesa genes are distributed over five of the nine chromosomes and do not appear to cluster . in setaria, cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> resolve as the ancestral lineages, while the phylogeny suggests that cesa <dig> was the next group to split, followed by a large diverse clade that contains genes corresponding to cesa <dig> and cesa <dig>  cesa <dig>  and cesa <dig> . the cesa <dig> gene is grass specific and belongs to a highly divergent group that has lost the qxxrw catalytic motif  <cit> . it is not clear why there are so many closely related cesa genes in setaria and why the cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> genes, associated with synthesis of cellulose in primary cell walls  <cit> , have duplicated more than once in recent evolutionary history. the larger cesa gene family will make the identification of encoded proteins that participate in the formation of the classical heteromeric terminal rosette complexes, and the definition of their levels of redundancy, particularly difficult to unravel. the proposed participation of two sets of three different cesa genes in barley is based on co-transcription in tissues where primary or secondary wall synthesis predominates  <cit> . no such correlation could be detected in our transcript profiles from many tissues of setaria .

setaria lacks a few members of the cslf family including orthologues of the most recently identified members in barley, namely cslf <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the cslf <dig> and cslf <dig> genes of rice  <cit> . not withstanding the ‘missing’ genes, the seven cslfs are organised across the genome akin to the family in other grasses with a syntenic main cluster on chromosome  <dig>  and the remaining members are scattered on individual chromosomes. the exception are the two closely related genes sicslf3- <dig> and sicslf3- <dig>  found next to each other on chromosome  <dig>  at one end of the cslf cluster and which appear to be the result of recent gene duplication.

setaria has two genes in each of the cslh and the cslj families, while sorghum and rice have three cslh genes, sorghum has a single cslj  and barley has a single member of both families  <cit> . the two sicslh genes are separated on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . this is the first report of a cereal that carries two csljs where the second one derives from a gene duplication event because the two copies share  <dig>  % identity at the amino acid level.

the svcslf <dig> gene is highly transcribed
the cslf <dig> transcript is dominant in the majority of tissues of most c <dig> and c <dig> cereals and the corresponding cslf <dig> protein is likely to be the major synthase driving the deposition of -β-glucan . setaria is not an exception to this, since the cslf <dig> transcript is found at the highest levels of all the cslf, h and j genes in vegetative tissues at all stages of development examined here. for example, in the elongating fourth stem internode svcslf <dig> transcripts peaked at around one million copies per microliter and in tissues where expansion has ceased, such as the mature root  approximately  <dig>  copies of svcslf <dig> per microliter were detected. the temporal and spatial occurrence of -β-glucan observed is similar to those described for other c <dig> grasses, including maize and sorghum . in general the amount of -β-glucan in setaria decreases during maturity in roots, leaves and the inflorescence and levels vary significantly according to the age of the tissues .

the physiological role of -β-glucan in plants is debated in the literature . the decrease in the amount of -β-glucan in leaves, roots and stem sections as they age indicates that it may be more important in developing tissues than mature ones; in the roots it decreased from  <dig>  % w/w at inflorescence emergence to  <dig>  %  at anthesis  possibly linked to tiller production, as grasses stop developing their primary  roots when mature tillers become established  <cit> . similar trends have been reported for other c <dig> grasses. in maize, sorghum and barley -β-glucan is synthesised in seedlings and coleoptiles, leaves and stems when elongation starts and ceases when elongation stops  <cit> .

a role for -β-glucan in carbon storage in barley and sorghum vegetative tissues has been proposed . the change from  <dig>  %  -β-glucan in the flag leaf during vegetative growth to  <dig>  %  at anthesis could indicate that -β-glucan may be hydrolysed at this stage to remobilise carbon reserves  <cit>  and this may explain the presence of -β-glucan reserves in the setaria stem. the largest amount of -β-glucan was observed in stem internode  <dig>  and tem labelling indicated that these reserves were more highly concentrated in ground tissue walls relative to those of the vascular tissue . mobilisation of this secondary carbon reserve may be particularly important to s. viridis, because it has such a rapid life cycle and produces a great many seeds.

the properties of -β-glucans may be linked to their fine structure, as determined by the dp3:dp <dig> ratio  <cit> . a lower ratio is generally associated with higher solubility of the polysaccharide and this property is of interest in a human health context  <cit>  and may affect ease of extraction for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic feedstocks  <cit> . there is evidence that individual cslf enzymes synthesize -β-glucans with different fine structures  <cit> . subtle but significant differences in the -β-glucan dp3:dp <dig> ratios in a range of different setaria tissues were measured. where -β-glucan may be structurally important, such as in the actively growing parts of the plant -glucans might be expected to be lower. this was observed in some tissues where remobilisation might be occurring, for example in mature stem internodes, but the correlation was not consistent.

the activity of cslh genes could significantly influence the amount and nature of -β-glucan and thus the overall cell wall properties. transcript levels of the barley hvcslh <dig> and the sorghum sbcslh <dig> genes were reported to be higher in mature tissues, such as the leaf tip, relative to young tissues  <cit> . this trend was also observed for the setaria cslh <dig> transcript. the peak transcripts of the cslh gene have already been linked to the presence of -β-glucan with a higher dp3:dp <dig> ratio, and thus lower solubility, suggesting that these synthases might be producing polysaccharides to strengthen or reinforce walls of cells that are undergoing secondary thickening. however, in this species transcript levels of svcslh <dig> are higher in a completely different set of tissues to svcslh <dig>  such that the two transcripts show a pronounced negative correlation, whilst svcslh <dig> transcripts are one of only a few that show a strong positive correlation with another member of the cslf, cslh or cslj family . thus, the influence of different cslh genes on -β-glucan properties is not clear. it has been observed previously that cslf transcript levels do not appear to be regulated in a coordinated pattern  <cit> , in contrast to the cesas where transcript co-expression is observed  <cit> . this may indicate the absence of a complex containing more than one cslf, cslh or cslj protein from the same family. in setaria only the transcript patterns of svcslf <dig> and svcslh <dig> are highly correlated. svcslf <dig> could be a relatively important member of the cslf family in setaria, given that transcript levels of this gene were second only to svcslf <dig> in a number of the more mature tissues, such as early stem internodes and mature roots .

a specific role for cslj genes in -β-glucan synthesis has not yet been demonstrated unequivocally. the presence of cslj genes across the poales is patchy and these genes are absent from a number of important cereals, including rice  <cit> . setaria is the only cereal so far examined that has more than a single cslj gene. transcripts of svcslj <dig> were higher than svcslj <dig> in all tissues tested and peaked in the mature root and the almost fully emerged inflorescence . our unpublished data  indicate that the sorghum cslj is also found at high levels in root tissue suggesting that some cereal roots might require a particular cell wall structure conferred by the action of cslj.

the nature of setaria grain
a previous report on the chemical composition of s. viridis grain suggested that it contains 11 % fibre  <cit>  but no information regarding the constituent polysaccharides was provided. here the amount of -β-glucan in s. viridis has been determined with very little in the young grain  decreasing even further to  <dig>  %  at maturity . thus, the maximum amount of -β-glucan is less than that found in other c <dig> grain, such as maize  and sorghum  and is considerably less than in the c <dig> cereals barley  and oats   <cit> . in fact, setaria has the lowest amount of -β-glucan so far reported being even lower than rice grain at  <dig>  %   <cit> .

fluorescent immunolabelling in the very early stages of setaria grain development, just a few days after pollination, indicated that the -β-glucan is predominantly located in the outer layers of the caryopsis in the maternally-derived pericarp tissues  and is present in specific areas of the embryo, the coleoptile and the coleorhiza . it persists in the pericarp in the intermediate stages of grain development but the amount decreases in the embryo and is negligible in walls of the starchy endosperm, or aleurone cells of mature grain . by the time the grain is mature almost no -β-glucan can be observed with sensitive antibody-based immunocytochemical methods, consistent with the results of the biochemical analyses.

in developing sorghum grain, -β-glucan is deposited more in the outer maternal layers, such as the pericarp and testa, than in the endosperm tissues  <cit> . sorghum grain very often displays dual morphology in the starchy endosperm where a floury centre is surrounded by a more glassy outer layer  <cit> . although this morphological feature is not evident in setaria grain the accumulation of -β-glucan in both c <dig> grains is very similar. in contrast, the appearance of -β-glucan in developing barley grain, a c <dig> species, is detected as early at  <dig> or  <dig> dap in the maternal tissues, in the walls of starchy endosperm cells from  <dig> dap onward  <cit>  and continues to increase as the grain matures. here, an examination of the transcript levels of the cslf, h and j genes across a setaria developing grain series reveals that minimal amounts of these transcripts can be detected, except for svcslf <dig> and svcslf <dig> in the very early stages at  <dig> to  <dig> dap . this is similar to the cslf <dig> transcript in wheat, which peaked before  <dig> dap and continuously decreased throughout maturity  <cit> . in all other cereals significant amounts of cslf <dig> or cslh transcripts are observed, where for barley  <cit> , rice  <cit>  brachypodium distachyon  <cit>  and other c <dig> grain such as sorghum  <cit> , the transcript peaked in the mid stages and much larger amounts of -β-glucan are present. also absent from the setaria grain transcriptome is cslf <dig>  in barley, the hvcslf <dig> transcripts peak during endosperm cellularisation in early grain development, whilst maximal amounts of hvcslf <dig> are found later at 18– <dig> dap. hence setaria is somewhat unusual amongst the poales in terms of its transcript profile in developing grain and until data from other millet species such as pennisetum , panicum  and eleusine  are available it will not be clear whether setaria is an outlier in this order.

the dp3:dp <dig> ratio of the small amount of -β-glucan present in setaria grain is lower  than that found in sorghum  or barley grain . since ratio is linked to solubility this suggests that setaria grain -β-glucan is likely to be more soluble than the -β-glucan found in sorghum or barley grain.

CONCLUSIONS
the genes in the cellulose synthase superfamily have been defined in setaria and the analyses reveal subtle differences in numbers and chromosomal distributions when compared with other cereal genomes. transcript analyses of poales-specific genes in the cslf, cslh and cslj families indicate that the cslf <dig> transcript dominates and that the abundance and distribution of -β-glucans in setaria vegetative tissues are very similar to those described for the other c <dig> grasses such as maize and sorghum . these features indicate that setaria it is a suitable model for these and other grasses in the context of manipulating this valuable polysaccharide  <cit> . however, setaria grain contains only a very small amount of -β-glucan, and the cslf <dig> transcript, and so may be less useful in a human health context than other cereal grains  <cit> .
