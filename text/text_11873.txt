BACKGROUND
chickpea is a member of the leguminosae family, which includes  <dig>  species, grouped into  <dig> genera  <cit>  grown in semi-arid regions of the world. chickpea, the world's third most important food legume is grown in over  <dig> countries representing eight geographically diverse agro-climatic conditions. in addition to being a major source of protein for human food in semi-arid tropical regions, chickpea crop plays an important role in the maintenance of soil fertility, particularly in the dry, rainfed areas  <cit> . the crop is a self-pollinated diploid  with a relatively small genome size of around  <dig> mb  <cit> . considering the small genome size, short seed-to-seed reproductive cycle of approximately three months and most importantly high economic importance as a food crop legume, chickpea is an interesting system for genomics research.

majority of the world's chickpea is grown in south asia and india being the largest producer with an estimated annual production of  <dig>  million tonnes . total world production averages up to  <dig>  mt  <cit> , but there remains a gap between demand and supply due to the losses in the productivity caused by various abiotic and biotic stresses. global annual production losses due to abiotic stresses alone are estimated to be around  <dig>  mt, which amounts to 40-60% average loss.

drought and salinity are two of the most important abiotic stresses that alter plant water status and severely limit plant growth and development. drought causes a considerable  annual yield losses. chickpea often suffers from terminal drought which delays flowering and affects yield. plants adapt to drought stress either through escape, avoidance or tolerance mechanisms. tolerating drought by developing deep root systems has been observed in chickpea  <cit> . salinity is no less an important constraint for chickpea yield reduction. the continued depletion of ground water level and demand for irrigation has led to the salinization of arable lands. hence, it is imperative to develop sustainable cultivars tolerant to drought and salinity. factors such as high morphological and narrow genetic variation of the chickpea make it difficult to produce superior cultivars with durable resistance to the biotic and abiotic stresses through conventional breeding approaches. in this context, molecular markers or genes associated with resistance/tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses should facilitate breeding practices by using marker-assisted selection  <cit> . in crop such as chickpea, where limited genomic resources are available, identification of stress-responsive genes can be undertaken by generating expressed sequence tags  from stress-challenged tissues. est sequencing projects have been contributing to gene discovery and marker development e.g. simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms , as well as providing insights into the complexities of gene expression patterns and functions of transcripts in several crop species  <cit> . in the case of chickpea, however only a limited number of ests  are available in the public domain  <cit> . very recently a set of  <dig>  chickpea sequences of  <dig> bp have been added through supersage technique  <cit> . however, lack of availability of a chickpea reference genome limits the value of supersage tags, as only a fraction of them could be annotated.

in view of the above, the present study was undertaken to generate a comprehensive resource of drought- and salinity-responsive ests in chickpea with following specific objectives:  to generate drought-responsive ests from water-stressed root tissues of both drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive genotypes,  to generate salinity-responsive ests from root tissues of nacl treated plants of salinity-tolerant and salinity-sensitive genotypes,  to identify unigenes of chickpea based on ests generated in this study as well as public domain ests,  to functionally annotate the identified chickpea unigenes,  to identify correlated expression between genes, and  to discover ssrs and snps for developing potential markers.

RESULTS
the relative effects of drought and salinity on the growth pattern were observed in all the objectives of the study. the growth of the drought-tolerant genotype  was observed to be better compared to drought-sensitive genotype  in all the cases of drought stress implications. similarly, the salinity-sensitive genotype  exhibited a relatively more stunted growth pattern than salinity-tolerant genotype  when these genotypes were exposed to salinity stress. it was observed that the genotype jg  <dig> withstood salt stress  to a greater extent in comparison to iccv  <dig>  however, when compared to the control set of plants in each case, growth of stressed plants was decreased. root tissues from both drought and saline stressed plants were harvested for total rna extraction and subsequent cdna library construction.

generation of drought- and salinity-responsive ests
a set of four genotypes i.e. icc  <dig> , icc  <dig> , jg  <dig>  and iccv  <dig>  that represent parents of two mapping populations i.e. icc  <dig> × icc  <dig> and jg  <dig> × iccv  <dig> segregating for tolerance to drought and salinity, respectively, were employed for generating ests. a total of  <dig> cdna libraries including  <dig> from drought challenged tissues and  <dig> from salinity challenged tissues were generated. by using the sanger sequencing approach,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests were generated from icc  <dig> and icc  <dig> cdna libraries. similarly,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests were generated from cdna libraries derived from salinity stressed root tissues of jg  <dig> and iccv  <dig>  respectively. details of est generation from different cdna libraries are given in figure  <dig>  in brief, a total of  <dig>  ests were generated and after a stringent screening for shorter and poor quality sequences,  <dig>  high quality ests were obtained. the average length of these high quality ests was  <dig> bp. all est sequences were deposited in the dbest division of genbank .

est assembly
assembly analyses was done for different datasets of ests to define the unigenes for  drought-responsive ests,  salinity-responsive ests,  drought- and salinity-responsive ests, and  the entire set of chickpea ests including those from the public domain. these unigene  sets are referred to ug-i, ug-ii, ug-iii and ug-iv, respectively. the ug-i comprised of  <dig>  unigenes  based on cluster analysis of  <dig>  high quality drought-responsive ests. likewise, the ug-ii included  <dig>  unigenes  after cluster analysis of  <dig>  high quality salinity-responsive ests. based on the clustering of all the <dig>   <dig> high quality ests generated in this study, the ug-iii was defined with  <dig>  unigenes . detailed cluster analysis of the  <dig>  ests identified  <dig>   unique to icc  <dig>   <dig>   to icc  <dig>   <dig>  to jg  <dig> and  <dig>  to iccv  <dig>  inclusion of  <dig>  ests available in the public domain at the time of analysis , the entire set of chickpea ests , the ug-iv was defined with  <dig>  unigenes . the assembly size in terms of number of ests aligned in each contig varied from  <dig> est members  to  <dig> est members  with an average of  <dig>  .

sequence annotation
sequence annotation was performed for all four unigene datasets  using standalone blastn and blastx algorithms. for blastn analysis, significant similarity was considered at threshold e-value of ≤1e- <dig>  blastn similarity search for all the four unigene datasets was carried out against ests of closely related legume and model plant species. for instance, analysis of ug-iii unigenes showed high similarity to medicago , followed by soybean , lotus , poplar , arabidopsis , groundnut , and least to rice . the blastn similarity results across different plant species for ug-iii found  <dig>   unigenes with significant similarity to ests of atleast one analysed legume species,  <dig>   unigenes with significant similarity to ests of atleast one of the analysed model plant species and overall  <dig>   unigenes with significant similarity to ests of atleast one of the analysed plant species. in contrast,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes did not match ests of any legume or model plant species respectively. results of the detailed analyses of the four unigene sets are given in table  <dig> 

blastx search results for all four unigene sets against the uniprot database, found varying numbers of unigenes from different unigene sets with significant similarity at different thresholds. for ug-iii , for instance,  <dig>  unigenes had significant similarity against the uniprot database at e-value ≤1e- <dig>   <dig>  unigenes at e-value ≤1e- <dig> and  <dig>  unigenes at e-value ≤1e- <dig>  based on these findings, for further analyses of the blastx hits in this study, a threshold e-value ≤1e- <dig> was considered. using this criterion, ug-i, ug-ii, ug-iii and ug-iv had significant similarity to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   unigenes, respectively . details of blastn and blastx analyses against closely related legume and model plant est databases and the uniprot database for all the four unigene sets are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

functional categorization
transcripts with significant blastx homology  to annotated ests were further classified into functional categories. as expected only a small percentage of unigenes  could be thus classified. the gene ontology annotation of transcripts helped classify functional descriptions into three principal ontologies: molecular function, biological process and cellular component. like in earlier studies of this nature  <cit> , one gene product could be assigned to more than one multiple parental categories. thus, the total number of go mappings in each of the three ontologies exceeded the number of unigenes analysed. details on go analyses for all four unigene sets are provided in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  as an example, go analysis has been described below for one unigene set .

the go analysis of  <dig>   unigenes from ug-iii set  revealed that  <dig>   unigenes had go descriptions for gene products:  <dig>  were categorised under biological process,  <dig>  under cellular component and  <dig>  under molecular function. of the functionally categorised unigenes, the largest proportion fell into cell part  followed by cellular process , nucleotide binding , metabolic process , organelle , catalytic activity  and response to stimulus  categories. unigenes with significant similarity that could not be classified into any of the categories were grouped as 'unclassified'. unigenes coding for housekeeping functions such as cellular process and metabolic process in the biological process ontology, cell part and organelle part in the cellular component ontology, and genes with binding and catalytic activity in molecular function category are over-represented in similar proportion in all unigene datasets . enzyme commission ids were also retrieved from the uniprot database, to get an overview of the distribution of transcripts putatively annotated to be enzymes. the three largest groups of enzyme classes included transferases, hydrolases and oxidoreductases with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the distribution pattern of enzymes was observed to be similar across all four unigene datasets.

correlated gene expression pattern analysis
to understand the patterns of gene expression and correlations between the  <dig> libraries from which ests were generated, the contigs generated in ug-iii set were analyzed using the r stekel statistical test  <cit>  of ideg. <dig> tool to identify the most significant expression and large differences in the abundances of ests in each contig. of  <dig>  total contigs in this dataset, only  <dig> returned a true positive significance  and were used for hierarchical clustering analysis. the expression level of each gene/contig  has been graphically represented by a colour/heat map .

the expression profile of the  <dig> contigs with significant expression and their derivative libraries were classified into four major clusters  with the minimum similarity of  <dig>  using hce version  <dig>  beta web tool. on the basis of their high expression level in a specific library, cluster ii and iii were further sub-clustered  that contained  <dig>  to  <dig> contigs  representing different genes . the cluster analysis showed higher number of differentially expressed genes in salinity libraries as compared to drought libraries. furthermore as suggested by mantri and colleagues  <cit> , more transcripts were observed in severe stress-challenged libraries. in general, the cluster analysis revealed high expression of genes related to biotic stress signaling , drought response , transporter proteins , reactive oxygen species  scavenging  and transcriptional, translational regulation  and uncharacterised proteins  categories.

in addition, the clustering of different libraries was also analysed. the grouping/clustering of the  <dig> libraries was found consistent with their origin and genotypes. for instance, libraries were clustered into two main clades/clusters according to drought and salinity treatments. icc 4958_drought_field and icc 1882_drought_field libraries were grouped into the first clade, while the remaining libraries were grouped into second clade. the second clade was further divided into  <dig> clusters with both consisting of homogeneously segregating drought related libraries, while jg 11_salinity and iccv 2_salinity cdna libraries clustered heterogeneously within the hierarchical cluster. in both clades, libraries generated from similar conditions tended to cluster together, regardless of the genotype from which they derived, thus reflecting their relationship.

development of functional markers
in recent years, molecular markers have been developed from genes/ests and are popularly referred to as genic molecular markers   <cit>  or functional markers  <cit>  as a putative function can be deduced for majority of such markers. functional markers  were identified using unigene assembly ug-iv.

identification of genic ssrs
est-ssr markers can assay the functional genetic variation and also exhibit more transferability across taxonomic classes than genomic ssrs  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  chickpea unigenes compiled in the present study  were analyzed using misa  tool  <cit>  for the identification of ssrs. as a result, a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified in  <dig>   unigenes at the frequency of 1/ <dig> bp in coding regions. majority of ssrs, however, were monomeric repeats . among other classes of ssrs,  <dig> dimeric ssrs,  <dig> trimeric ssrs,  <dig> tetrameric ssrs,  <dig> pentameric ssrs and  <dig> hexameric ssrs were also present . out of  <dig>  ssrs, primer pairs were generated for  <dig>  ssrs. after excluding the primers for monomeric repeats, a set of  <dig> primer pairs were considered. considering minimum repeat number criteria such as six for di- and tri- nucleotides and four for tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides, a sub-set of primer pairs were developed for only  <dig> ssrs.

the potential of  <dig> ssr markers for detection of polymorphism was assessed on a set of  <dig> chickpea genotypes. out of  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig> primer pairs yielded scorable amplicons. these ssr markers provided  <dig>  to  <dig>  alleles with an average of  <dig>  alleles per marker. only  <dig> primer pairs had more than one allele in the genotypes examined. the polymorphic markers showed a pic value in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  .

identification of snps
as large number of ests were generated from four genotypes, these est datasets were analysed for identification of snps. snp discovery was performed on contigs/multiple sequence alignments  containing two or more ests from more than one genotype. out of  <dig>  contigs , snps were detected in  <dig>  contigs, while  <dig> did not have any snp. a total of  <dig>  snps were identified in  <dig>  contigs. while  <dig>   snps were identified in  <dig>  contigs with 2- <dig> ests, the remaining  <dig>  snps were identified in  <dig> contigs composed of  <dig> or more ests.

in order to perform cost-effective and robust genotyping assay for the  <dig>  snps detected in  <dig> contigs, attempts were made to identify the restriction enzymes that can be used to assay snps via cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  assays. the analysis suggested that  <dig>  snps could be assayed in  <dig> contigs by caps methods .

discussion
a number of drought-responsive and salinity-responsive genes have been identified, cloned and characterized from an array of plant species and notably in model plant species such as medicago  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , lotus  <cit>  and poplar  <cit> , etc. in contrast, in case of chickpea, where crop production is adversely affected by drought and salinity, not much information is available on candidate genes or molecular markers associated with tolerance/resistance to these stresses. this study attempted to develop a comprehensive transcriptomics resource of chickpea.

cdna libraries, ests and unigenes
plant roots are the primary sites for perception and injury during water stress, including salinity and drought. in many circumstances, it is the stress sensitivity of the root that limits the productivity of the entire plant  <cit> . plants are known to use more than one mechanism to resist unfavourable environmental conditions. for example, under drought conditions, plants may 'escape' the stress by undergoing rapid phenological development, completing their lifecycle before the onset of serious water deficit  <cit>  or 'avoid' the stress by maintaining relatively high tissue water potential even at low soil-moisture content, balancing between water loss and turgor  <cit> . therefore, root tissues were targeted for generating the drought and salinity-responsive ests in the present study.

with an objective of compiling as many drought-responsive and salinity-responsive ests as possible, different kinds of drought stress treatments  induction, dehydration, slow drought stress  in greenhouse and slow drought stress in field conditions) were imposed on drought-responsive genotypes, while salinity-responsive genotypes were stressed using  <dig> mm nacl. this study provided  <dig>  ests,  <dig>  drought-responsive unigenes ,  <dig>  salinity-responsive unigenes , and a total of  <dig>  chickpea unigenes . this is the first report on the generation of such large number of ests based on sanger sequencing in chickpea. in the past, ests have been generated at icrisat  <cit>  and by other research groups that represented a total of  <dig>  ests in the public domain at the time of analysis in march  <dig>  <cit> . thus the present study contributes a  <dig> fold increase in ests.

characterization of chickpea unigenes
four sets of unigenes were characterized in terms of their similarity with ests from other legume species available in the public domain and to deduce a putative function and assign them to a particular go class. all the four unigene sets showed highest similarity with medicago  and least similarity with groundnut . other legume species showed similarity with chickpea unigenes in the range of  <dig> % -  <dig> % as shown in table  <dig>  the similarity of chickpea unigenes with other legume species is in general agreement with legume phylogenetic tree displaying relative order of speciation  <cit> . medicago is the most closely related species in the phylogenetic tree which explains the larger number of significant hits with medicago sequences. there were some exceptions however; chickpea unigenes showed higher similarity to soybean  as compared to lotus  whereas the phylogenetic distance between chickpea and lotus is less than it is with soybean. the smaller est dataset available in lotus  as compared to soybean  is probably responsible for this observation.

while analysing sequence similarity of compiled chickpea unigenes  with other legume species,  <dig>   unigenes had significant similarity to ests of at least one analysed legume species. conservation of  <dig>  unigenes across the legume species was observed. sequence comparison of ug-iv unigenes with other plant species i.e. rice, poplar and arabidopsis showed  <dig>   unigenes sharing significant similarity with ests of atleast one of the model plant species and  <dig>   conserved across all three model plant species, while  <dig>  of total chickpea unigenes shared significant similarity with ests of all the plant species analysed. this suggests that  <dig>  chickpea unigenes can be considered conserved in plants;  <dig>  unigenes can be considered conserved across legumes. it is also interesting to note that  <dig>  chickpea unigenes did not show any homology with any of the legume est datasets searched. this indicates that at least  <dig>  new unigenes without legume homologs in the public domain have been contributed to through this study. about  <dig>  chickpea unigenes did not show any similarity with sequences from any of the plant species est datasets searched or uniprot database and may thus be considered novel.

in terms of blastx analysis, a putative function could be deduced for  <dig>   of  <dig>  unigenes and  <dig>  could be functionally categorised based on ests generated in this study. analysis of the entire chickpea unigene set  revealed that only  <dig>   out of  <dig>  unigenes could be functionally categorised. the functional annotation will be very useful in selecting unigenes for developing microarray or functional molecular markers  <cit> .

the functional categorization of each unigene dataset into go categories revealed a similar percentage distribution of genes in the four categories: cellular process, metabolic process, binding and catalytic activity. these four functional categories described were also reported as major categories in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and also in barley  <cit> .

clustering analysis to identify patterns of gene expression
clustering analysis identified patterns of gene expression which are unique to different libraries. the profiles of some of the interesting gene families and genes that could play an important role in stress response were investigated .

the majority of the genes in cluster i  are those highly expressed in icc 1882_drought_gh library. apart from very highly represented 'isoflavone-7-o-methyltransferase 9'  , an isoflavanoid biosynthetic enzyme which plays a role in plant resistance to pathogens  <cit> , many transcripts with putative annotations to nucleic acid binding, protein binding activity classes were co-expressed in this cluster. two un-annotated contigs  identified in this cluster were considerably expressed in icc 1882_drought_gh library with transcript numbers of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. considering the expression ratio difference of these uncharacterised proteins, further studies may reveal their possible role during stress conditions in plants.

the sub-cluster iia contains genes specifically expressed in the icc 4958_dehydration root library. two contigs homologous to the biotic stress-responsive 'probable pleiotropic drug resistance'  protein  and 'phenylalanine ammonia-lyase'   were identified. both pdr and pal are involved in the phenylpropanoid and flavanoid/isoflavanoid pathways leading to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in plants in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . the relative transcript counts of pdr and pal signify their associated role in stress signaling processes.

the gene coding for 'dead ringer protein homolog'  was found to be highly induced in icc 1882_peg_induction library of subcluster iib. functionally, these proteins protect other proteins from denaturation by heat  <cit> . their up-regulation in the drought tolerant genotype suggests a significant role in imparting tolerance against drought.

all  <dig> contigs in the sub-cluster iiia were highly expressed in the iccv2_salinity library. uniprot classification of these contigs indicated that a large fraction of them  were involved in cellular processes and nine contigs homologous to different stress related proteins. 'aba responsive'  related transcripts were observed higher in drought- and salinity-sensitive genotype specific libraries such as icc 1882_peg and jg 11_salinity libraries. higher accumulation of abr transcript levels has been reported in stressed plants  <cit> . similarly, high accumulations of 'heat shock cognate  <dig> kda protein'   was observed in stress-sensitive genotype related iccv2_salinity root library as compared to jg 11_salinity and icc 1882_drought_glasshouse libraries. this implies a significant role of 'hsps' in protecting the plant cells during abiotic stresses. interestingly, the co-expression of contig <dig>  contig <dig> and contig <dig> corresponding to 'nadh-dependent 6-deoxychalcone synthase' , 'isoflavone-7-o-methyltransferase 9'  and 'isoflavone reductase' , respectively were observed in the subcluster iiia. all these genes were involved in the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway and isoflavanoid phytoalexin has been reported to occur principally in legumes during defence response of plants  <cit> .

the sub-cluster iiib represents genes that are highly expressed in the icc 1882_dehydration library, accounting for  <dig> % of all contigs in the hierarchial cluster. six out of eight genes co-expressed in this cluster have been putatively annotated and categorized to stress response related genes. contigs coding for 'dehydrin' dhn <dig>   and hydrophilic 'late embryogenesis abundant  protein 1'   were co-expressed in this cluster. involvement of lea- <dig> genes has been reported during seed development at low water potentials  <cit> . the presence of protective compound such as 'sugar transport protein 13'  during water stress conditions  <cit>  in this cluster suggests a protective reaction to osmotic stress in sensitive genotypes as compared with tolerant genotypes. similarly, the occurrence of 'glycine-rich cell wall proteins'   involved in cell wall lignification during pathogen attack  <cit> , 'pathogenesis-related protein 1a/1b precursor'  and 'chitinase-3-like protein  <dig> precursor'  in this cluster signifies their protective role during stress response. these observations suggest the possible involvement of the above mentioned genes in protection and repair of damaged cell walls caused under stress.

the sub-cluster iiid includes  <dig>  contigs whose transcripts are highly expressed in both the icc 4958_drought_field library and icc 1882_drought_field library and also contains a majority of stress-responsive functionally important genes. up-regulation of membrane spanning genes such as 'probable aquaporin pip-type' , which mediate regulation of root hydraulic conductivity in response to environmental stimuli  <cit>  were observed also in iccv2_salinity library as well as their significant expression in the other two libraries mentioned above and is not unexpected since its involvement is well reported in plant drought stress response. it is noteworthy that the transcripts annotating to 'metallothionein- like proteins'   involved in heavy metal detoxification and accumulate in response to high metal concentration, nutrient deprivation and heat shock  <cit> , identified in this cluster were highly expressed in icc 4958_drought_field library and even more so in iccv 2_salinity library. their high expression level in the iccv 2_salinity library may be correlated with their putative role in detoxification of salts accumulated in salinity stressed roots. contigs similar to classical 'arabinogalactan proteins'  , abundant in the plant cell wall and plasma membrane  <cit>  were identified to be highly expressed in the icc 4958_drought_field library. 'fasciclin like arabinogalactans'  is a class of agps known to be regulated both during developmental processes and stress responses. different classes of flas have been associated with aba and down-regulated by drought stress  <cit> . likewise, a high copy number of transcripts corresponding to the abr gene  were highly expressed in icc 1882_drought_field library , icc 4958_drought_field library  and moderately expressed in iccv 2_salinity library . the predicted expression pattern of agps and abrs identified in this study is also consistent with experimental observations in arabidopsis  <cit> .

it is important to note that although a high number of transcripts annotated to genes known to be involved in stress responses have been identified in clusters iib, iic, iiic and iv, their functional inter-relativity could not be explained. in addition, many uncharacterised and unknown proteins with significant expression levels have also been identified in these clusters. further investigation of these genes is required to understand their importance in stress signaling and/or tolerance mechanisms in chickpea. although these genes have been identified in response to abiotic stress, many of these genes are likely to be involved in conferring resistance to biotic stresses as well, since a crosstalk between signal transduction occurring during biotic and abiotic stress is well known phenomenon  <cit> . in summary, these candidate genes will be very useful to integrate in genetic maps and link them with qtls for abiotic/biotic stress tolerance as well as targeting them in genetic engineering or reverse genetics approaches.

transcriptome resource for developing functional markers
the chickpea unigene dataset   defined in the present study can be used to develop a variety of molecular markers as stated by varshney and colleagues  <cit> . in case the polymorphism detected by a particular type of molecular marker correlates with variation in coding region affecting gene function, the molecular marker could become a candidate marker for a trait of interest.

mining of  <dig>  unigenes  showed occurrence of  <dig>  ssrs, however majority of these ssrs represent mononucleotide repeats . this is a common feature of database mining of ests for identification of ssrs  <cit> . after excluding the monomeric ssrs, higher proportion of ssrs was dominated by dimeric ssrs  followed by trimeric ssrs . in general, studies dealing with mining of ests for ssrs reported higher abundance of trimeric ssrs  <cit> , however there are several studies  <cit>  that show exceptions as well. indeed the number and distribution of ssrs of a particular class also depends on the criteria and tool used for mining the ests  <cit> .

in terms of converting identified ssrs into potential ssr markers for chickpea genetics and breeding, primer pairs could be designed for  <dig> ssrs . this increases the repertoire of ssr markers available in chickpea  <cit> . the est-ssr markers developed in this study were compared with those developed earlier and available in public domain  so that only non-redundant set of ssr markers should be developed. as a result, for validation purpose, only  <dig> ssr primer pairs with preferred criteria were synthesized. fifty of these newly developed ssr markers on  <dig> chickpea lines, had varied alleles  per locus with an average pic value of  <dig>  per marker. this suggests a moderate discriminatory power of this new set of ssr markers. di-nucleotide ssrs  with atleast  <dig> repeat units and compound motifs  had relatively higher number of alleles  and high pic values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . such correlation between number of alleles, maximum number of repeat units and pic value has been observed in other earlier studies  <cit> .

the present study also provided  <dig>  snps in  <dig>  unigenes that can be used for converting into snp markers. snps are the most abundantly found co-dominant polymorphic sites in greater proportion both in intronic and exonic regions of the genomes, occurring with variable frequencies and becoming very popular in plant genetics and breeding due to their amenability for high throughput genotyping. est mining has been a popular approach for large scale identification of snps  <cit> . however, the error rates in est sequencing may sometime lead to erroneous snp calls. therefore, to enhance more reliability of snps identified, deep multiple alignments  were considered. in case of chickpea, although a few snp markers have been reported  <cit> , the present study, probably provides the first comprehensive set of snps for chickpea. although high-throughput snp genotyping platform such as goldengate assay of illumina are available that allows genotyping of large number of snps  in parallel  <cit> , conversion of snps into caps assay is a cost effective method that can be used in low-tech laboratories  <cit> . the present study provides  <dig> candidate genes where snps can be assayed by caps.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study provides  <dig>  new chickpea ests  including  <dig>  ests  from drought challenged libraries and  <dig>  ests  from salinity challenged libraries. including the  <dig>  public domain chickpea ests in the analysis defined chickpea unigenes to  <dig> . five hundred and fifty two  chickpea unigenes were conserved across legume species,  <dig>  conserved across analysed plant species and  <dig>  unigenes were specific to chickpea. this study provides an overview of expression patterns of  <dig> contigs/genes that were up- or down-regulated in response to imposed abiotic stresses, validated either by over expression or tilling . these genes together with  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> genes with snps provide a comprehensive resource for integration and development of the transcript map of chickpea. the est resource generated in this study will significantly impact chickpea genetics, and breeding in general and for improving the crop for drought and salinity tolerance in particular.
