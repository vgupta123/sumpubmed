BACKGROUND
we are interested in understanding how specificity proteins  govern extracellular matrix deposition during bone formation. the sp proteins are a family of transcription factors with three zinc-fingers that bind gc-boxes and assist the further binding of the multiprotein complex tfiid promoting the initiation of gene transcription  <cit> . gc-boxes have the consensus sequence gggcggg. sp <dig> and sp <dig> are associated with chondrocytic differentiation by regulating the alpha <dig> procollagen gene , a chondrocytic marker. sp <dig> has been shown to be an activator and sp <dig> a repressor of col2a <dig> transcription  <cit> . despite the ubiquitous expression of sp <dig>  sp <dig> null mice suffer from specific skeletal defects associated with a delay in osteoblast differentiation, having reduced ossification and impaired bone formation and show a decrease in the expression of osteocalcin, an osteoblast specific gene  <cit> . sp <dig>  also known as osterix, is required for osteoblast differentiation since in sp <dig> null mice bone formation does not occur  <cit> . previously, we cloned two isoforms of human sp <dig> that are generated from distinct promoters upstream of exon 1a and exon 1b  <cit> . we identified another human sp gene that is closely related to sp <dig> and named it sp <dig>  recently, sp <dig> null mice have been described  <cit> . note that the mouse mbtd gene  <cit>  is sp <dig> and not a specific homologue of the drosophila gene buttonhead   <cit> . however, btd is a member of the sp family  <cit> . sp <dig> null mice have a well-defined phenotype, having severe truncation of all limbs and no tail. their malformed brains have defective closure of the anterior and posterior neuropores that leads to exencephaly and spina bifida. sp <dig> is required for proper maintenance and maturation of the apical ectodermal ridge, a signalling centre, which forms at the limb bud apex and governs the outgrowth of the limb during development. here we describe the sequence of two isoforms of human sp <dig> 

RESULTS
in our search for additional sp transcription factors, we performed a tblastn search of the human genome with the sequence of sp <dig>  <cit> . the most closely related sequences were found on genomic dna bac clones cta-324d <dig> and ctb-86d <dig> that were in the draft stage . this new gene was named sp <dig> since it is closely related to sp <dig> 

human sp <dig> cdnas
utilising the sequences of the two bac clones, pcr primers were designed to amplify probable cdnas. two different cdna clones were obtained by rt-pcr from the human mg- <dig> osteosarcoma cell line and sequenced . successful amplification and sequencing required methods designed to overcome problematic gc-rich regions. these transcript variants differed at their 5' termini. clone  <dig> comprises exon 1a and  <dig>  and together they encode the long protein isoform of sp <dig> . clone  <dig> comprises the untranslated exon 1b and exon  <dig>  exon 1b contains an in-frame stop codon and no initiation methionine codon. together they encode the short protein isoform . the first atg codon of sp8l is in excellent sequence consensus for an initiation methionine having a guanosine residue at positions - <dig> and + <dig>  and that of sp8s is in good sequence consensus having a guanosine at - <dig>  <cit> . the orf is gc rich . another sp <dig> cdna clone was isolated from the osteoblasts of a patient with osteoporosis. this has a glycine- <dig> deletion; having lost one of the five sequential ggc codons  .

human sp <dig> gene
after the completion of the human genome the location and structure of the human sp <dig> gene was identified by mapping the sequences of sp8l and sp8s cdna clones. the human sp <dig> gene maps to 7p <dig>  between the multidrug resistance protein  and ribosomal protein l <dig> genes and is separated by  <dig>  mbp from the related sp <dig> gene by seven genes encoding two ribosomal proteins, four putative genes of unknown function and a gene similar to argininosuccinate synthetase. the sp <dig> and sp <dig> genes are linked to the homeobox gene cluster hox a, which is  <dig>  mbp away. the human sp <dig> gene spans  <dig>  kb and has three exons . exons 1a and 1b encode different transcript variants that are likely to be initiated from distinct promoters. the first two exons are separated by a  <dig> bp intron 1a, followed by a shorter,  <dig> bp intron 1b. all splice donor/acceptor sites contained consensus gt/ag dinucleotides. the gene possesses a cpg island upstream of exon 1a . computer analysis of the immediate human sp <dig> promoter preceding exon 1a contains a number of rna polymerase ii promoter elements including a tata-box, ccaat-box and two gc-boxes that are conserved in rodents and fish.

comparison of the human sp <dig> protein with those of other species
the orf of sp8l clone  <dig> encodes a 508-residue protein with a  <dig>  da molecular mass and an isoelectric point  <dig> . the first atg codon of clone  <dig> corresponds to the second atg of clone  <dig>  thereby omitting the first  <dig> residues of the orf, encoding a 490-residue protein with a  <dig>  da molecular mass and an isoelectric point  <dig> .

the human sp <dig> protein belongs to the sp/krüppel like factor  family of proteins that are characterised by three cys2-his <dig> zinc-fingers  <cit> . the zinc-fingers are located towards the cooh terminus and are involved in binding dna in a sequence specific manner. however, the sp proteins are distinguished from the klf family by an amino-terminal hydrophobic domain called the sp-motif with the consensus sequence plalla and a buttonhead box  with the consensus sequence cxcpc prior to the zinc finger domain.

database searches identified complete sp <dig> genes and protein sequences from other vertebrate species. the chimpanzee gene is located on chromosome  <dig> ; the mouse gene at 12f <dig> ; the rat gene at 6q <dig> on bac clone ch230-1k <dig> and the zebrafish within bac clone ch211-180p <dig>  a comparison of the protein sequences shows that sp <dig> is well conserved through vertebrate evolution . the human and chimpanzee proteins are very similar with one conservative substitution and an additional glycine residue. the mouse sp <dig> protein  <cit>  has 97% identity and the zebrafish 79% identity to human sp <dig>  an amphibian sp <dig> est from xenopus laevis was identified by our database search . the mammalian sp <dig> proteins differ from that of the zebrafish by the insertion of two poly-alanine and a poly-glycine region in the amino-half of the protein.

database searches also showed that homologues of the vertebrate sp <dig> genes are found in insects, but not in nematodes, yeasts and higher plants . the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster, d-sp <dig> gene is a homologue of sp <dig> and not, as the name implies, sp <dig> nor sp <dig> as previously stated  <cit> . the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum, sp <dig> protein  <cit>  has 43% identity and 80% similarity to human sp <dig>  however, d-sp <dig> differs from the vertebrate and beetle sp <dig> proteins possessing a much longer, glutamine and histidine-rich carboxy-terminus. the possession of sp, btd and zinc-fingers domains in a protein is characteristic of sp proteins in general; these domains in these three sp <dig> proteins are very highly conserved. outside these domains, a motif of unknown function is located towards the amino-terminal with the sequence gkgfhpwkks and is unique to sp <dig> proteins.

by comparison with other sp proteins, the sp <dig> protein can be divided up into  <dig> domains. the amino-terminal domain a  is highly conserved in sp <dig> proteins from other species. two alpha-helices, residues 3– <dig> and 15– <dig>  are predicted in this domain; whereas the rest of the protein appears to lack any secondary structure except for the zinc-finger domain. domain a is also found in the sp <dig> proteins. domain b, residues 54– <dig>  is a low-complexity region, having poly- serine, alanine and glycine stretches that are not present in fish sp <dig> proteins. domain c, residues 168– <dig>  is similar to the same region of sp <dig> and sp <dig> that has been shown to be involved in transcriptional activation  <cit>  and contains a basic region  that probably contributes to a nuclear localization signal and a btd-box, a highly conserved region that is present in all sp family members. the btd-box was first described as a 10-amino-acid region in the drosophila zygotic gene, buttonhead  <cit> . domain d, residues 374– <dig> contains three classical zinc finger structures  of the cys2-his <dig> type where the conserved cysteine residues in two short beta-sheets and the histidine residues in an alpha-helix tetrahedrally co-ordinate a zinc ion  <cit> . between the fingers are five-residue linker sequences with the consensus sequence tge+x. the negatively charged carboxy-terminal domain e, residues 457– <dig>  contains a glycine-rich region .

tissue distribution of sp <dig> mrna
the expression of sp <dig> in human and murine adult tissues was examined by reverse transcriptase pcr using primers located in the 3'utr. human sp <dig> mrna expression was detected in a wide range of tissues at a low level, being found in heart, brain, placenta, liver, pancreas, prostate, testis, ovary and colon, but was below the limit of detection in lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, thymus, small intestine and peripheral blood leukocytes . murine sp <dig> mrna expression, relative to the expression of beta-actin mrna, was detected in all tissues examined, with the highest levels being found in brain and prostate and the lowest in spleen .

expression of human sp <dig> mrna in osteoblast-like cells
the expression of both transcript variants mrnas encoding sp8l and sp8s in osteoblast-like cells was examined by reverse transcriptase pcr using primers specific for each isoform . the sp8l was most abundant in the osteosarcoma cell lines hos and mg <dig> and was present in adult and craniofacial osteoblasts, but was below the limit of detection in foetal osteoblasts and chondrocytes. the sp8s was most abundant also in the osteosarcoma cell lines hos and mg <dig> and was present in craniofacial and foetal osteoblasts, but was below the limit of detection in adult osteoblasts and chondrocytes. runx <dig>  a transcription factor important for osteoblast differentiation, and beta-actin, a housekeeping gene, were expressed in all the osteoblast-like cells.

bmp- <dig> regulation of sp <dig> mrna expression in the murine cell line in c3h10t1/2
bmps are potent secreted factors that promote osteoblast differentiation during development and bone remodelling. since sp <dig> was found in human osteosarcoma cell lines and is important in skeletal development  <cit>  we examined the regulation of sp <dig> by bmp- <dig> in the murine pluripotent embryonic cell line, c3h10t1/ <dig> that can be induced to form a chondrogenic/osteoblastic phenotype by treatment with bmps  <cit> . sp <dig> mrna expression, normalised to that of beta-actin, was measured by rt-real time pcr and was induced by  <dig> ng/ml bmp- <dig> after one day and remained upregulated at  <dig> days . data normalised to the housekeeping gene g3pdh gave similar results  indicating that sp <dig> was upregulated and that beta-actin was not down-regulated.

discussion
in the human genome three sp gene pairs had been described previously; being maximally separated by  <dig>  mbp, transcribed in opposite directions, being orientated 5' to 5' manner and colocalized with a specific hox gene clusters  <cit> . sp <dig> and sp <dig> are located on chromosome 2q <dig> ; sp <dig> and sp <dig> on 12q <dig>  and sp2-sp <dig> on 17q <dig> -q <dig>  a search for a partner to sp <dig> located on 7q <dig> -q <dig> revealed a putative eighth sp gene most similar to sp <dig> suggesting that sp <dig>  like sp <dig>  may play a role also in skeletal development. consequently, we used rt-pcr to amplify sp <dig> cdnas from a human osteosarcoma cell line and isolated two transcript variants clones that encode a full-length protein  sp8l and an amino-terminal truncated protein  sp8s, with  <dig> and  <dig> residues respectively. we found a glycine- <dig> deletion mutation in an additional cdna clone isolated from a patient with osteoporosis. the length of this poly-glycine region is conserved in primates and rodents, but is absent in fish. we speculate that this sp <dig> mutation, and other mutations yet to be discovered, may play a role in susceptibility to osteoporosis, and since sp <dig> plays an important role in neuropore closure be a candidate gene for spina bifida  <cit> .

the sequence of our sp8l clone is similar to that of two other human clones, but the other two clones lack  <dig> and  <dig> bp of the low-complexity, b domain . these deletions may be caused by incomplete reverse transcriptase reactions occurring during cdna library synthesis, presumably because the high gc content  generates strong secondary structure in the mrna in this region. these deletion-carrying clones are unlikely to be generated by the presence of cryptic intron since no suitable donor or acceptor splice sites are present in the genomic dna sequence. one of the deletion-carrying clones, aah <dig>  possesses a polymorphism, cac>cgc, at nucleotide  <dig> that results in a his>arg mutation at residue  <dig>  his- <dig> is located in the third zinc- finger and is conserved in all sp proteins and, by homology with sp <dig>  is likely to contact dna  <cit> . this mutated protein would be expected to be deleterious, having reduced affinity for gc-box binding sites in promoter regions.

we found that in man sp <dig> has two transcript variants utilising two different first exons. sequence analyses of mouse and zebrafish genomic and est data support this gene structure for sp <dig> in vertebrates and not a gene structure with two untranslated 5' exons that has been suggested for murine sp <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the drosophila d-sp <dig> gene, a sp <dig> homologue, also has two transcript variants, encoding long and short protein isoforms   <cit> . both sp <dig> and sp <dig> have a similar exon structure, being three-exon genes with two transcript variants with different first exons  <cit> . the long protein isoforms use translated first exons that encodes seven residues and the short protein isoforms use untranslated first exons; overall, the proteins have  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity. both the sp8s and sp7s proteins lack an 18-residue amino-terminus thereby disrupting a hydrophobic region termed the sp domain that is conserved in other sp proteins. the conservation of the two protein isoforms through evolution suggests that they have differing roles. although the function of this hydrophobic region is unknown, other zinc-finger transcription proteins often have a conserved protein-protein interaction domain at their amino-terminus . this indicates that the sp motif may also be involved in a protein-protein interaction and that the short protein isoforms do not have this protein interaction domain.

amino-terminal spliced variants expressed from separate promoters are a feature of other important transcription factors that regulate skeletal development. an oestrogen regulated protein in osteoblasts, klf <dig> is another member of the sp/krüppel-like factor family that has two amino-terminal variant isoforms generated in a similar way to those of sp <dig>  these isoforms are named the tgfβ-inducible early gene  and the early growth response gene-alpha  <cit> . runx <dig> has two major amino-terminal isoforms that exert different functions during the process of osteoblast differentiation; the runx2-type-i isoform is widely expressed in osteoprogenitor cells and active osteoblasts, whereas the runx2-type-ii isoform is restricted to cells lining mineralised bones  <cit>  and bmp- <dig> preferentially upregulates the runx2-type-ii isoform  <cit> .

sp <dig> does not initiate bmp-mediated signalling during apical ectodermal ridge formation, but may function downstream of the bmp receptor-1a in the signalling cascade  <cit> . the signalling events downstream of the bmp receptor that result in tissue-specific gene expression and skeletal development have been only partially elucidated. we found that sp <dig> expression was induced by  <dig> ng/ml bmp- <dig> only after  <dig> hours in c3h10t1/ <dig> cells. bmp- <dig> has been shown to induce several other transcription factors that promote differentiation such as runx2/cbfa <dig>  sp7/osterix and znf <dig> in addition to the negative regulator id <dig>  <cit> . induction of these genes in c3h10t1/ <dig> cells occurs within  <dig> hours, preceding that of sp <dig>  suggesting that sp <dig> is not directly regulated by bmp signalling and that it may be induced by one or more of the bmp-early-induced genes.

the sp <dig> gene has a wider phylogenetic distribution than sp <dig>  being found in coelomates, whereas sp <dig> is limited to vertebrates. in view of the close similarities between human sp <dig> and sp <dig> in gene structure and amino acid sequence we speculate that they evolved from an ancestral sp <dig> gene during a duplication of a sp/hox gene cluster  <cit> . the sp <dig> gene has retained its function in regulating appendage/limb growth  <cit>  and that sp <dig> has subsequently evolved a novel function, namely, regulating cartilage/bone formation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in humans, there are two transcript variants of sp <dig> that utilise different first exons encoding long and short protein isoforms. these two isoforms are conserved being found also in the zebrafish suggesting that they have distinct functions. sp <dig> is upregulated by bmp- <dig> in the murine pluripotent cell line c3h10t1/ <dig> and may play a role in mesenchymal differentiation.
