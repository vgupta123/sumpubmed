BACKGROUND
copepods are arthropods in the aquatic environment and the extremely abundant free-living species are an essential part of the first levels of the marine food chain. although copepods comprise the largest animal biomass on the earth, relatively limited biological information is available at the molecular level and no model species exists.

the salmon louse  is an ectoparasitic copepod feeding on skin, mucous and blood from salmonid hosts. recently it was shown that l. salmonis infections in farmed fish induce epizootics in wild fish  <cit> . the life cycle of l.salmonis consists of  <dig> developmental stages separated by ecdysis  <cit>  and after the final molt, females develop into mature adults that continuously produce eggs for life. the first free-living larvae  hatch directly from egg-strings attached to adult females and all three larval stages  can be transported by the ocean currents over large distances depending on hydrographical conditions  <cit> . after host settlement the infectious copepodids stage molt into chalimus. the four chalimus stages, all separated by molting, are anchored to the host by a frontal filament  <cit> , which restricts the feeding area. however, in the succeeding pre-ad i and -ii and adult stages the salmon louse can move unrestricted on the host surface resulting in increased virulence  <cit> .

sexual maturation and vitellogenesis are major physiological and behavioral changes in most animal life cycles. germ cells are typically established early in development but arrested in development until the onset of sexual maturation. the generation of gametes is most conserved in males whereas variation is seen between different species for the development of female gametes. the ovum  is a highly complex cell that is energetically expensive to produce. in order to produce high quality ova the females must undergo physiological adaptations that initiate further gamete development and maturation. since the reproduction strategy is highly variable between different species and different life strategies  the processes of sexual maturation and the production of eggs also varies. however, there are some common hallmarks that are expected in most animals. after fertilization, the egg must contain sufficient energy to ensure development until external energy sources can be utilized. the ovarium is the site of initial development for female gametes during sexual maturation and reproduction. at ovulation, oogonia are released from the ovarium into the oviduct where growth and maturation take place. this process is typically divided into pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic development. during vitellogenesis, yolk proteins are incorporated into the oocytes. a molecular hallmark for this process is the transcription of genes encoding egg yolk proteins like vitellogenins . depending on animal group, the transcription of vgs takes place in different cell types like liver , fat body  and hepatopancrease . the vgs are subsequently transported by the blood or hemolymph to the maturing oocytes, where they are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . production of vitellogenin is controlled by steroid hormones, which induce transcription of the target gene through binding of a steroid-receptor complex to the gene promoter. in arthropods, including crustaceans, ecdyson  has been shown to bind to the heterodimeric ultra-spinacle  and ecdysteroid receptor  to an ecdysteroid response element  in the vitellogenin promoter  <cit> . ecdysteroids are also a key regulatory component in arthropods molting and development  <cit> .

the salmon louse reproductive systems have been described at the anatomical and histological levels  <cit>  but there is no information regarding the timing of the different events during sexual maturation. it has been proposed that males depositing spermatophores triggers the egg-production in other parasitic copepods   <cit> , but according to our observations using unfertilized laboratory animals, adult female l. salmonis produce eggs and external egg string also when males are not present . unlike crustaceans like shrimp, that produce eggs in seasons and grow/molt their entire life, salmon louse have a final molting, stop growing when egg production has started and then continuously produce eggs for life. it has been shown that l. salmonis can produce up to  <dig> sets of egg-strings from a single fertilization  <cit> . however, immediately following the last molting, the adult female salmon louse is not fully developed. prior to egg production the animal matures in a process that includes a large increase of the genital segment and the abdomen, whereas the frontal cephalothorax appears unchanged .

in order to link transcripts to the morphological and anatomical changes that takes place during the transition from pre-adult ii to egg producing females we have combined est sequencing and microarray analysis. the microarray analysis revealed three distinct groups of transcripts that correspond to molting, post molting growth and egg production. the possible function of the regulated transcripts is discussed in relation to the anatomical and physiological changes taking place. initial analysis of est sequences of l. salmonis revealed a large proportion of transcripts with no significant hits in public databases. in order to obtain some initial information regarding copepod proteomes we compared at set of l. salmonis proteins to some selected crustaceans, insects and vertebrates and shows that the salmon louse proteins are equally similar to all species.

RESULTS
est analyses
during the course of the present study  <dig>  ests from five cdna libraries  were sequenced . the initial annotation of the individual ests revealed that 43% of the sequences had no significant hit in genbank and 5% showed significant hits with proteins with unknown function . nine percent of the ests gave hits with proteases, 8% with ribosomal proteins and 6% with mitochondrial transcripts, of which  <dig> % were 16s rrna  <cit> . the high number of novel transcripts in l. salmonis was also evident when we compared our ests against the recently available first crustacean genome of daphnia pulex  <cit> . compared to the d. pulex proteins, 51% of our validated nuclear l.salmonis ests  gave non-significant hit. assembly of all non-mitochondrial sequences with a length over  <dig> bp  resulted in  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> singletons . the majority of the  <dig> contigs contained 2– <dig> ests and initially only two clusters contained more than  <dig> est. contig <dig> contained  <dig> ests encoding trypsin  transcripts  <cit> , while contig <dig>  encodes a novel gene with no detectable conserved domains in the putative protein  encoded by the open reading frame .

* sequences with a remaining length over  <dig> after vector trimming and quality assessment.

about  <dig>  clones were not included in the contig assembly, primarily due to lack of high quality sequence data but also due to insert sizes less than  <dig> bp  or empty clones/e. coli sequences . based on these considerations, the proportion of singletons  in the clustering results and the proportion of mitochondrial sequences , the number of additional salmon louse transcripts among the  <dig>  clones without sequence data were estimated to be approximately  <dig>  this indicates that the  <dig>  clones, from which cdna probes were printed on the microarray, represent up to  <dig>  different l. salmonis transcripts.

the initial annotation  showed no clear high correlation with homologous genes from any specific animals of animal groups, for instance other arthropods. in fact sequence comparison of  <dig> l. salmonis proteins with homologous proteins in humans, insects , crustaceans  and zebrafish  revealed an almost identical sequence identity  for all  <dig> genes independent of whether the l. salmonis sequences were compared with terrestrial arthropods, crustacean, fish or humans .

post-molting growth of adult female l.salmonis
the salmon louse is characterized by four main body parts. after the final molt into adult females, the genital segment and the posterior abdomen showed a substantial growth, whereas the large anterior cephalothorax and the small free thoracic segment remained constant . at 10°c the metamorphosis from t1–t <dig> was finalized in approximately 13– <dig> days and adult female t <dig> lice continued to produce a new set of egg strings approximately every  <dig> days. the growth correlated with the presence of maturing egg strings within the genital segment. maturing oocytes were observed at t <dig> and the presence of ova evident at t <dig>  after the mature egg-strings were extruded at t <dig>  two new immature egg-strings entered the "empty" genital segment. between each time point external egg-strings were extruded as new eggs continuously matured within the genital segment.

microarray analysis
microarray analysis was performed on a total of  <dig> female l. salmonis, representing the pre-ad ii stage and  <dig> different time points after the last molting . ests were grouped according to expression profiles using self-organizing map   <cit>   neuron map). the som revealed three clusters with a substantial increase in gene transcription during adult development  and two  with a significant decrease . all other som clusters showed very little variance within clusters. although the groups sampled are not clear-bordered developmental stages but rather transitions in time, correspondence analysis   <cit>  of the complete dataset  revealed consistency among the  <dig> biological parallels selected according to the genital segment/cephalothorax ratio . with the exception of one obvious pre-ad ii outlier, samples were located in adjacency with other samples from the same group or in the vicinity of a neighboring time point. the developmental group membership, and the single outlier, of individual samples were also evident in a  <dig> ×  <dig> neuron heat som .

correspondence analysis using trimmed mean values for all lice from each time point, reducing the influence of outliers, shows that the main direction genes are connected with the respective developmental time point . the two first principal axes explain 89% of all variation in the data set. the vectors corresponding to time point's fall into an anti clockwise pattern for the sequential transition during time and, as expected, the vectors representing the most different developmental stages are on opposite sides in the plot. most microarray probes show little variation in gene expression over the time points measured. these ests are found in the centre of the ca plot while differentially expressed ests that are clearly connected with developmental stages are located far from the centre and along one of the development stage vectors. two major and one minor cloud of ests, strongly separated from the centre, are evident in figure  <dig>  the two main patterns; 1) up-regulated from t <dig> to t <dig> and 2) up-regulated from pre-ad ii to t <dig> followed by down regulation from t <dig> to t <dig>  accounts for 14% of all ests and are almost completely correlated to the first principal component analysis. a third minor group of ests strongly correlates with the pre-ad ii group and consists of ests transcribed in the pre-ad ii stage but down regulated in adult t <dig> 

group  <dig>  defined from the  <dig> ×  <dig> som, contain  <dig> ests , group  <dig>  contains  <dig> ests  while group  <dig>  defined from the ca contains  <dig> ests. the data underlying the corresponding expression profiles were re-examined for quality  and  <dig> ests were kept . only one of the remaining ests encodes a housekeeping gene that could be expected to be unregulated . since the array contains a high number of 16s rrna mt probes and ests encoding ribosomal proteins, this demonstrates a low number of false positives hybridizations. in addition, within contigs  <dig> % of the individual ests encoding the same gene had the same transcription profiles. due to this low error rate quality-checked singletons were also included in the further analysis. all the final contigs and singletons were in silico re-annotated after manually inspecting and editing the contig sequences, and after re-sequencing the singletons using both vector primers. orfs larger than 130aa were used in blastp search in genbank against the non-redundant  database and the entire cdna sequences were used in translated  search. the highest scoring sequences were used to indicate the putative function with emphasis on identifying groups of biological function. after the sequence re-examination, group  <dig> and  <dig> contained a total of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons while group  <dig> contained  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons but the numbers of novel genes were still high in all groups 1– <dig>  38%, 43% and 30%, respectively . various functions were suggested for the non-novel genes . some of the annotation results may be biased by the fact that out of the  <dig> contigs/singletons showing significant regulation in the microarray analysis,  <dig> had two or more overlapping orfs larger than 130aa, and several of the alternative orfs gave significant hits in blastp searches. in fact multiple reading frames were evident in many full-length l. salmonis transcripts. out of the  <dig> full-length transcripts used for comparison with homologous genes in other species,  <dig>  had additional orf encoding putative proteins over 130aa , including orf with highly significant annotation hits. for example, on the transcript encoding l.salmonis actin , 376aa orf on the poly a strand , a 277aa orf on the negative strand  encodes a putative protein highly similar  to a hypothetical protein in chimpanzee and a putative mrna splicing factor in nasonia vitripennis . the hypothetical chimpanzee protein is on chromosome  <dig> and not on the same chromosome as chimpanzee actin-like genes.

the majority of the annotated group  <dig> and  <dig> "early genes"  were similar to cuticula proteins , especially barnacle cypris larva-specific gene  from balanus amphitrite  <cit> , a marine crustacean, but the e-values were high . in addition, 8% of the group  <dig> genes were similar to genes involved in other growth related processes. most group  <dig> contigs were also down regulated in adult male lice compared to pre-adii males , pointing towards sex independent functions. however, in group  <dig>  all but one gene was unregulated in males.

all the salmon louse contigs homologous to cuticula-like proteins were compared to each other and based on the size of the encoded protein they separated into two sub-groups. these sub-groups could be divided into several other groups based on sequence similarity. some short proteins  are similar to bcs- <dig> while other cuticula proteins  are similar to cuticula protein  <dig> in insects. aligning these sequences to a selection of sequences from insects revealed some degree of conservation  indicating similar functions. the contig <dig> and contig <dig>  similar to horseshoe crab  cuticular protein have a conserved domain, a chitin binding peritrophin-a domain  found in chitin binding proteins in the perotrophic matrix proteins of insects  <cit> . interestingly, a perotrophic membrane is not described in l. salmonis.

the highest scoring sequences among the "late genes", up-regulated during adult female maturation, gave hits with genes involved in reproduction. two large contigs  showed high level of identity with two different arthropod vitellogenins  <cit>  and contig <dig> had similarities to a nucleolar protein in starfish  only transcribed in growing oocytes  <cit> . furthermore, except for one gene  all group  <dig> genes were up regulated in females only .

none of the  <dig> "early genes"  were in contigs consisting of more than  <dig> ests compared to  <dig> of the  <dig> "late genes" , including  <dig> genes encoding novel proteins . five "late genes" , within the group of genes with miscellaneous functions, were also in large contigs  indicating a high transcription level. the contig <dig>  that contains more ests  than both vitellogenins, gave strong hits with a cathepsin l-associated protein in artemia  <cit>  mainly because it contains three fas <dig> domains typically seen in cell adhesion molecules  <cit> .

the microarray transcription profiles were confirmed by northern blot analysis using  <dig> genes in group  <dig>  and  <dig> genes in group  <dig>  .

discussion
salmon lice included in the present microarray study are female pre-adult ii  and adults at different time points  during the post molting growth towards egg-production . the microarray analysis of approximately  <dig>  different transcripts revealed a total of  <dig> regulated genes divided into  <dig> patterns, down regulated from pre-ad ii to adult t <dig> , up-regulated from pre-ad ii to t <dig> and then down regulated , and up-regulated from t2-t <dig> . a typical feature of group  <dig> and  <dig> is transcripts resembling cuticula proteins, while the group  <dig> typically includes female specific transcripts, including vitellogenins, with many ests  compared to the contigs in group  <dig> and  <dig>  the diversity of transcripts is largest in group  <dig> 

cuticula encoding genes are transcribed prior to the final molt and prior to the post molting growth of adult female salmon louse
animals with an exoskeleton, like the salmon louse, grow through molting and each instar typically shows limited increase in size. developmental stages in salmon louse  are also separated by molting  <cit> . however, the present study clearly demonstrates a substantial growth in females after the final molt. post molt growth has been described in another parasitic copepod, lernaeocera branchialis, where substantial growth and metamorphosis in adult females after the final molt have been reported, resulting in a 20-fold size increase of the abdomen  <cit> . they observed extensive cuticular folds , associated with expansion of the cuticle following the final molt, which could account for some of the size increase . based on ultra structural observation they concluded that additional mechanisms , like large-scale cuticule secretion must account for the large size increase. in l. salmonis small folds  have been observed in the cuticula of chalimus larva  <cit> , but currently there is no detailed description of the development of salmon louse after the final molt. our preliminary observations on t <dig> and t <dig> lice indicate clear differences in cuticula structure, particularly on the genital segment and abdomen. immature adult l. salmonis  has cuticular folds but to what extent these folds can explain the large increases in size during the post-molt growth observed in the present study is not clear. prior to the final molting  and at the start of the post molting growth  an increase in transcription of genes believed to be involved in growth related process in arthropods  was observed. during the post molting growth these transcripts were down regulated while female specific transcripts were up regulated. egg strings, from which the offspring  is released, were not produced until this post molting growth was completed. this indicates that the post molting growth is connected to sexual maturation for egg production  and an increased capacity for food  uptake . the high proportion of cuticula and growth related genes identified in group- <dig> and - <dig>  indicates that the group- <dig> and  <dig> genes, including the novel proteins , primarily consists of genes involved in copepod growth. many of the pre-ad ii and t <dig> transcribed cuticula annotated genes  resemble bcs- <dig>  known to be transcribed prior to barnacle larval attachment and metamorphosis  <cit> . for pre-ad ii lice this could be related to the fact that the louse is attached to the salmon host through a frontal filament during molting. however, this is somewhat contradicted by the fact that the pre-ad ii transcribed bcs- <dig> like genes are not regulated in males. since both group  <dig> and  <dig> genes are down regulated after t <dig>  when the post-molting growth of adult female salmon louse takes place , growth from t <dig> to t <dig> is phenotypically delayed in time relative to transcription and probably do not include cell division growth. this is consistent with the fact that the new cuticula is produced beneath the old pre-ad ii cuticula, prior to the molting when the group  <dig> genes are transcribed. therefore in order to increase in size some kind of stretching/swelling must occur after the old cuticula has been shed, starting at t <dig> when the group  <dig> genes are transcribed. based on the present study it is therefore likely that the group  <dig> and  <dig> cuticula proteins are an important part of a two-step process of cuticula formation at the final molt of l. salmonis.

abdominal growth and gene regulation
after the final molt, the l. salmonis abdomen grows from approximately  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm . it is likely that this increases the capacity for food digestion, which could be visualized as increased transcriptions of digestive peptidases. the l. salmonis microarray contains more than  <dig> peptidase ests but only seven of the regulated genes  were identified as proteases . none of the putative digestive serine peptidases previously identified in the salmon louse  <cit>  were among the regulated transcripts. however, trypsin-like peptidases likely to be involved in digestion may also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> , and hence would not be detected in a transcriptome analysis.

peptidases from the different families may be involved in a wide range of cellular and biological processes making it difficult to infer the function based on database searches. host blood is a major component of the food for the salmon louse  <cit>  particular for adult females. a wide range of organisms  utilize blood as nutrition. to keep blood in an easy accessible form metazoan species typically produce components with anticoagulation properties. in addition, it has been shown for several hematophagus organisms that digestion of blood and particular haemoglobin demands the action of a set of peptidases  <cit> . it appears that aspartic- cysteine- and metallo-peptidases are key players in blood and haemoglobin digestion from different parasitic species  <cit> . of the regulated peptidases in the present study three are metallopetidases and one is cysteine peptidase. contig <dig>  is a cysteine peptidase resembling the trophozoite cysteine proteinase  from malaria   <cit> . interestingly, the tcp is believed to be involved in degradation of erythrocyte haemoglobin, which also could be the case in the salmon louse as they ingest blood from their salmon host. in addition, contig5new, which resembles a kuniz-like serine peptidase inhibitor, is up-regulated from t <dig> to t <dig>  serine peptidase inhibitors are involved in a wide range of biological processes including blood coagulation/anticoagulation, hence, it is possible that contig5new could encode an anticoagulant, which is up regulated due to the abdominal growth and the corresponding increase in blood feeding during egg production.

egg production and gene regulation
the female specific nature of all but one gene up-regulated during the t1–t <dig> growth of adult females  and the two identified vitellogenins, points towards genes involved in reproduction. no gene libraries were normalized and the high number of ests in many of the group  <dig> contigs, compared to group  <dig> and  <dig> contigs , therefore points towards functions where a high transcription level is typically seen. both vitellogenin contigs  contains approximately 100est which is in compliance with the high transcription level typically seen for vitellogenins. the equally transcribed contig <dig>  encoding a protein containing  <dig> fas <dig> domains, gave genbank hits with cathepsinl-associated protein in artemia where it is most abundantly expressed in encysted eggs and embryos  <cit> . it is therefore likely that contig <dig> encodes a highly expressed protein with cell adhesion properties involved in egg production. in insects, fas <dig> containing proteins are primarily described as neural cell adhesion molecules but they have also been reported to be present on the surface of eggs and also to be expressed in several non-neural tissues in the embryo  <cit> . further information on the biological function of this gene and other genes in group 1– <dig> will be revealed through ongoing knock down studies.

induction of the genes up-regulated during the post molting maturation of adult females appears to take place at time point t <dig> . this is at the time when the first immature eggs are observed in the genital segment and 32% of the observed size increase has taken place. this, and the fact that similar growth appears in the abdomen, indicates that the final size of the genital segment in mature adults cannot be a result of stretching due to the presence of immature eggs only. from t <dig>  the genital segment is gradually filled up with maturing eggs that are extruded as two separate strings . based on these observations and the induction of a range of growth related genes  at t <dig>  it is likely that the observed size increase includes addition of more components into the exoskeleton rather than stretching.

hormonal regulation and transcription profiles in the salmon louse
in the present study salmon lice go through three distinct processes, molting from pre-ad ii to adult, post molting growth and egg production, three processes that correlates with regulation of the three groups of transcripts . in arthropods, the ecdysteroid 20-hydroxyecdysone  and juvenile hormone  are key participants in regulating growth , sexual maturation and egg production  <cit> . in hematophagous mosquito a blood meal trigger the vitellogenesis, which is characterized by a specific gene expression pattern tightly controlled by the 20e  <cit> . in drosophila short day photoperiods at low temperatures induce ovarian diapause and suppressed ecdysteroid production  <cit> . temperature upshift results in an increase of steroid hormone levels, diapause termination and onset of vitellogenesis. currently there is no available data about ecdysteroid levels in l. salmonis. in crustaceans  information is also limited but it has been demonstrated that ecdysteroids are involved in molting, reproduction and embryogenesis  <cit> . in addition, ecdysteroid levels in free living copepods are known to fluctuate during the life cycle  <cit> . a recent microarray study in drosophila assesed the genomic response of 20-hydroxyecdysone  during metamorphosis  <cit> . by using rnai to knock down ecr they were able to identify ecr-dependent genes. a total of  <dig>  genes were regulated in ecri animals at one or more of the examined times points, indicating that approximately 30% of the drosophila transcripts are affected by ecr directly or indirectly. dana et al.  <cit>  examined ~ <dig>  transcripts related to blood feeding in anopheles gambiae and found that approximately 20% of the examined genes were regulated as a response to the blood meal. these regulated transcripts could be separated into early, middle and late responding genes, similar to the present study, and were suggested to be controlled by the fluctuating titers of jh and 20e either as inducers and/or repressors of transcription.

the observed post-molt growth in l. salmonis is likely to be regulated at the transcription level since distinct peaks in transcription of cuticula and growth related genes is evident in pre-ad ii, where new cuticula is produced, and in newly molted adult females prior to the post molting growth. recently, it has also been shown that transcription of cuticular proteins can be induced by 20e in the beetle tenebrio monitor  <cit> . hence, it is likely that a 20e homolog is a key participant in inducing the transcription profiles observed in the present study, probably acting both as an inducer and repressor.

it has been proposed that fertilization is the trigger for the egg production  in parasitic copepods  <cit> . however, at least in l. salmonis this is not the case since in the present study normal post molt growth, including production of external egg strings , was observed in female only populations. furthermore, since egg producing l. salmonis females can be found on salmon throughout the year at all temperatures and light conditions, environmental factors do not seem to be a likely candidate. although, egg producing females feed extensively on blood, and this high energy food is probably important for egg production, blood can be part of the diet at all parasitic stages indicating that vitellogenesis is not triggered by a blood meal either.

recently it was shown that in drosophila growth and sexual maturation is coupled, coordinated by the dhr <dig> nuclear receptor  <cit> . dhr <dig> is part of the ecdysone-triggered cascade both as a repressor  and an inducer of the β ftz-f <dig> competence factor. by using dhr <dig> mutants it was suggested that dhr <dig> is involved in assessing critical weight and duration of larval development, linking 20e signaling to this process. it is possible that a similar molecular signaling is present in copepods and that the size of immature l. salmonis is the trigger for the onset of vitellogenesis. however, further studies are necessary to verify this hypothesis.

many novel genes in the l. salmonis genome
the initial analysis of individual l. salmonis est sequences revealed that approximately 43% had no significant hits in genbank using the nr-database. even the re-annotation of the contigs identified by microarray analysis revealed a total of 41% novel proteins. similar high proportion of novel genes was one of the interesting discoveries when the first non-mammalian genomes were sequenced. when the first metazoan animal  was completely sequenced the initial analysis revealed that more than 50% of the  <dig>  genes were classified as novel  <cit> . similar figures were seen in other "early" sequenced genomes. obviously the most important reason for the high number of novel genes was that few organisms were completely sequenced and, hence, few "complete" dataset were available for comparison. this is illustrated in the worm book  <cit> , where at present only  <dig> % of the c. elegans protein coding genes are classified as "function unknown". currently, no copepod genome has been sequenced and the closest sequenced relatives to the salmon louse are insects like drosophila and anopheles. this is obviously the main reason for the high number of novel proteins in the salmon louse but considering the increasing number of sequenced genomes, 40–50% novelty indicates that the copepods have a distinct proteome  compared to terrestrial arthropods. this is further indicated by the fact that searching the  bang database  <cit>  crustacean section with  <dig> novel proteins  only resulted in six marginal  hits . the large proportion of novel transcripts in l. salmonis was further demonstrated by the fact that of  <dig>  validated nuclear l.salmonis ests 51% showed hits with insignificant values when compared to the only and recently available crustacean genome   <cit> .

considering that reproduction processes have been intensively studied in many organisms, the number novel genes  differentially transcribed during l. salmonis egg production , was surprisingly high. the fact that conserved proteins in l.salmonis genes have the same low identity with homologous proteins in humans and the much closer related crustaceans and insects, further demonstrates the potential for discovery of unknown genes and "new" biological processes by sequencing genomes representing unstudied groups like copepods, instead of new species in already well studied groups.

CONCLUSIONS
we have analyzed  <dig> ests from the parasitic copepod lepeophtheirus salmonis. annotation demonstrated high level of novel genes  and sequence identity analysis demonstrated that the identity of lepeophtheirus salmonis proteins with homologous proteins in crustaceans and terrestrial arthropods is not higher than with homologous proteins in fish and humans. we have used  <dig> k microarrays to identify  <dig> genes, of which 40% are novel, involved in sexual maturation and egg production.
