BACKGROUND
most mitochondrial mrnas in trypanosomatid parasites such as trypanosoma, and leishmania species undergo rna editing  <cit> . this post-transcriptional process produces mature and functional mrnas through a series of coordinated steps catalysed by a multi-protein complex that inserts and deletes uridylates  specified by guide rnas . one hypothesis posits a structural and functional subdivision of the editosome into insertion and deletion subcomplexes  <cit> . editosome proteins with endonuclease   <cit> , terminal uridylyl transferase   <cit> , 3' exouridylylase , ligase   <cit> , and helicase   <cit>  activities have been identified and functionally characterized. sets of proteins related by sequence similarity exhibit both unique and common functions. for instance, ren <dig> is an endoribonuclease that is specific for rna editing deletion sites whereas ren <dig> is specific for rna editing insertion sites. ret <dig> is implicated in the addition of the non-encoded 3'-oligo u tails to grnas but ret <dig> adds us to pre-edited mrnas. rel <dig> may be involved in u-deletion editing and rel <dig> in u-insertion editing. six additional editosome proteins, krepa1-a <dig>  have varying degrees of sequence relatedness with each protein containing a c-terminal motif associated with an oligonucleotide-binding  fold  <cit> . recent results point to both rex <dig> and rex <dig> as candidates for the rna editing exouase responsible for deletion of the 3' overhanging u residues from the mrna 5' cleavage fragment. a u-specific exonuclease, rex <dig>  has been partially purified from l. tarentolae  <cit> . the reconstitution of precleaved u-deletion in vitro with recombinant l. tarentolae rex <dig> and rel <dig> proteins and the in vivo rnai down-regulation of rex <dig> expression in t. brucei suggest that rex <dig> is the exouase. however, the closely related rex <dig> protein  may be the putative exouase since tagged t. brucei rel <dig> sub-complex consisting of rex <dig>  rel <dig> and krepa <dig> catalyze accurate u removal and ligation   <cit> . thus, the exact roles of rex <dig> and rex <dig> in the editosome complex are unclear and the consequences of the presence of two related proteins are not fully understood.

comparative sequence analysis indicates that both rex <dig> and rex <dig> contain a putative c-terminal endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase  domain as well as a region exhibiting subtle, but significant similarity to a known 5'->3' exonuclease domain   <cit> . whether rex <dig> and rex <dig> have 5'->3' exonuclease activity in the editing complex is unknown.

in this study, we extend our previous analysis of the rex <dig> and rex <dig> eep domains  <cit> . we use sequence analysis, homology modeling and phylogenetic analysis to enhance understanding of the structure and functions of rex proteins, as well as the relationships amongst eep family members. our results suggest that while these enzymes have diverged at the sequence level, the eep domains share a common catalytic site. our three-dimensional modeling studies suggest that the rex eep domains fold in much the same way as other eep domains whose structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography. we identify features of the rex eep domain that distinguish it from other family members and hence subfamily specific determinants of catalysis and substrate binding.

RESULTS
trypanosomal rex proteins
the rex <dig> and rex <dig> proteins from three trypanosomatids show considerable sequence similarity suggesting they are encoded by paralogous genes . since the genes are present on non syntenic chromosomal regions in l. major and t. brucei  it is likely that the ancestral genes diverged prior to the fission/fusion events which resulted in the modern day trypanosomatid genomes.

sequence and phylogenetic analysis of eep domains
the eep domains in proteins from a variety of eucarya and bacteria were modelled and analyzed using an hmm-based approach. members of the eep domain family include magnesium dependent endonucleases   <cit> , exonucleases   <cit> , and phosphatases of lipid second messengers   <cit>  . although these proteins have diverse substrate specificities, rex eep domains possess the conserved sequence motifs that have been used to characterize other eep domains . a phylogenetic tree of eep domains indicates that rex and ape proteins form distinct subfamilies . eep domains in i5pp proteins are more rex- than ape-like.

homology modelling of t. brucei rex <dig> and rex <dig> and l. major rex1
the x-ray crystal structures of the eep domains in two dna repair enzymes   <cit>  were used as the templates to build homology models of the eep domains in three rex proteins . h. sapiens ape <dig> and e. coli exoiii are functional homologs that possess apurinic/apyrimidinic  endonuclease activity and which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond of dna at the ap sites by cleaving the dna in intact strands  <cit> . although exoiii also has 3'->5' exonuclease activity, its biological role remains unclear. following cleavage by exoiii or ape <dig> the bacterium e. coli uses dna polymerase i  to fill in the single-nucleotide gap whereas the eucaryote h. sapiens uses dna polymerase β . pol i has also a 3'->5' proof-reading activity which allows the removal of misincorporated nucleotides  <cit> . although pol β is prone to high error   <cit> , it lacks the proof reading mechanism found in pol i  <cit> . instead, ape <dig> acts as an exonuclease that trims off nucleotides from dna ends that do not terminate in correct basepairs  <cit> .

as would be expected, the four-layer α/β fold observed in the crystal structures of the templates  is reflected in the three-dimensional models of the target proteins . the roles of amino acids in the conserved sequence motifs found in eep domains  were examined in ape1/1hd <dig> and exoiii/1ako . based on high resolution x-ray crystal structures, the similar overall catalytic mechanism of ape <dig> and exoiii involves the abstraction of a proton from a water molecule by a residue acting as a general base  <cit> . the resultant nucleophilic hydroxide ion attacks a scissile phosphate. the major difference between ape <dig> and exoiii is that the catalytic residue which deprotonates the water molecule in ape <dig> is asp in motif iv whereas in exoiii it is the his in motif vi . in addition, exoiii appears to be a relatively more powerful 3'-exonuclease than ape <dig>  <cit> . this enhanced activity has been attributed to the fewer hydrophobic residues in the active site of exoiii  <cit>  .

putative activity and mechanisms of action of rex proteins
to gain insights into the enzymatic activity of the rex proteins, we measured the rmsd values of the superposed models of each of rex eep domain model to ape1/1hd <dig> and exoiii/1ako. the rex2_tbrucei model is closer to ape1/1hd <dig> than to exoiii/1ako . in contrast, both the rex1_lmajor and rex1_tbrucei models are closer to exoiii  than to ape1/1hd <dig> . these results suggest that rex2_tbrucei may have more in common with ape1/1hd <dig> whereas rex1_lmajor and rex1_tbrucei may be more related to exoiii/1ako. the latter data suggest that rex <dig> exoribonuclease activity in both leishmania and trypanosoma species may share a similar catalytic mechanism with exoiii  <cit> . these results also raise the possibility that if rex2_tbrucei is similar to ape <dig>  the potential proof-reading function of trypanosoma rex <dig> may remove  the extraneous u residues added during tutase activity  <cit>  and  the us that result from tutase function within a u-deletion site  <cit> . current data indicate that leishmania rex <dig> lack a c-terminal eep domain  and hence potential proof-reading activity. although this function could be compensated for by the related rex <dig> protein , the absence of an eep domain could be explained by less extensive editing in leishmania species compared to trypanosoma family members. while both ape <dig> and exoiii are known to act as endonucleases, such activity has not yet been demonstrated for the rex family of proteins.

in addition to the primary catalytic residues, the active site of ape1/1hd <dig> and exoiii/1ako contains a bulky hydrophobic pocket that has been proposed to act as a sequence specific "gate-keeper" able to accommodate only abasic sites  <cit> . in ape1/1hd <dig>  the hydrophobic pocket is composed of phe <dig>  trp <dig>  and leu <dig> . the equivalent pocket in exoiii/1ako is larger and consists of trp <dig>  leu <dig>  and ile <dig> . mutations of the ape <dig> hydrophobic pocket that results in smaller residues , can enhance its 3'-exonuclease activity  <cit> . exoiii possesses a hydrophobic pocket containing only one aromatic residue and the enzyme is a better 3' exonuclease than ape <dig>  these two findings support the idea that the hydrophobic pocket in eep domains plays a significant role in nucleotide binding and specificity. our sequence and structural analysis suggests that rex <dig> and rex <dig> do not have a bulky hydrophobic pocket but instead share a pocket composed of smaller residues. the pocket is formed by arg <dig>  gly <dig>  and ala <dig> in rex2_t.brucei, thr <dig>  gly <dig>  and ser <dig> in rex1_tbrucei, and by ser <dig>  gly <dig>  and ser <dig> in rex1_lmajor . the equivalent of trp <dig> in ape1/1hd <dig> or leu <dig> in exoiii/1ako is gly <dig> in rex1_tbrucei, gly <dig> in rex2_tbrucei, and gly <dig> in rex1_lmajor. thus, we predict that rex <dig> and rex <dig> have the potential to accommodate an extrahelical residue  downstream  of the scissile bond. the conserved polar ser/thr in rex <dig>  and positively charged arg in rex <dig> may form hydrogen bonds with the extrahelical base . in rex <dig>  a ser in leishmania is a thr in trypanosoma . this suggests altered substrate specificity for leishmania species, which may partially compensate for the absence of an eep domain in rex <dig> 

comparison of the rex subfamily of eep domains with that of the b. taurus dnase i  and inositol polyphosphate 5'-phosphatase  family members reveals a conserved his in motif iii   <cit> . in dnase i, this residue is part of the essential his-glu catalytic pair located within the active site and is proposed to act as a general acid acting to stabilize the leaving group  <cit> . mutagenesis of glu in dnase i has also shown the importance of this residue for catalytic activity. however, the sequence analysis of the rex and other family members of eep domains does not reveal a conserved glu or other negatively charged residue that could pair with the his residue   <cit> . therefore, we predict that in the rex eep domains, the his residue forms a hydrogen bond to and further polarizes the scissile phosphate, as previously proposed for the i5pp family of proteins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using a variety of computational approaches, we have identified conserved motifs and a critical substrate binding pocket in the rex subfamily of eep domains. our results suggest experiments that could be performed to examine the distinct catalytic roles of rex proteins in the editosome.
