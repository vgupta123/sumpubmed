BACKGROUND
the gram-negative pathogen francisella tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia and is classified as a category-a biological-threat agent
 <cit> . natural transmission of tularemia to humans is complex, occurring via the inhalation of infective aerosols, ingestion of contaminated water, handling sick or dead animals, ingestion of infected food-stuffs, or bites of infected arthropods such as ticks, biting flies or mosquitoes
 <cit> .

the genus francisella includes a number of closely related but ecologically distinct species that can be divided into two main genetic clades
 <cit> . these bacteria exhibit a large variety of lifestyles, including specialised intracellular pathogens of mammals  and fish , francisella-like endosymbionts   and freely living generalists  causing disease predominantly in humans with a compromised immune defense
 <cit> . the taxonomic boundaries of francisella have recently been debated, in particular for f. novicida <cit> . recent breakthroughs in sequencing techniques have enabled public access to whole-genome sequences that can shed light on previously unknown diversity within the francisella genus. the mode of genetic inheritance varies within the genus: the overall recombination rate is 34% of the genes within the francisella core genome, although recombination is virtually non-existent in f. tularensis and f. noatunensis <cit> . these ecological and reproductive differences which lead to genetic diversity make francisella an ideal choice for evaluation of diagnostic pcr-based dna markers and developing sample sequencing methods for phylogenetic analyses.

over the last decade, pcr methods have been successfully applied for the rapid identification and classification of francisella isolates
 <cit> . an obvious drawback with dna-based approaches is the possibility of cross-reactivity with non-pathogenic but closely related francisella subspecies occurring naturally in the environment
 <cit> . this could distract biological surveillance systems, such as the biowatch program
 <cit> , and give false-positive alarms
 <cit> . therefore, primer pairs need to be defined so that an unknown isolate is identified and attributed to the correct species or subspecies. previously published sequence markers designed for identification or detection of francisella have been developed without taking into consideration the current knowledge of genetic diversity of the genus, in particular the recently discovered species f. noatunensis and f. hispaniensis.

the specificity of francisella detection assays has often been controlled by testing reactivity with non-francisella bacterial species. typically, no other species besides f. tularensis , f. novicida and f. philomiragia have been included as representatives of the francisella genus
 <cit> . as with pcr detection, current knowledge on the diversity of the francisella genus affects the choice of genetic markers used for obtaining true phylogenetic trees by pcr-based sequence-typing analysis. for f. tularensis, multi-locus typing schemes targeting overlapping, as well as separate, genes have been described
 <cit> . however, the resolution was limited, allowing discrimination of only the major genetic clades of the species. recent advances in sequencing and the increased availability of publicly accessible genomic sequences have enabled phylogenetic trees obtained by analysing sequence markers to be evaluated. whole-genome sequencing is not always desirable for large bacterial sample sets, as such analysis normally generates large amount of data which requires substantial increase in labour and time. therefore, multiplexed target amplification of selected genomic regions using next generation sequencing  have recently been proposed
 <cit> .

a considerable effort in the study of bacterial pathogens has been devoted to evaluating alternative evolutionary histories by comparing topologies
 <cit> . in order to facilitate these comparisons, various topological distance metrics have been proposed, such as the robinson-foulds  or symmetric distance
 <cit> , branch-score distance
 <cit> , path-length metrics
 <cit>  and nearest-neighbour interchanging
 <cit> . to quantify similarity, all these metrics focus on topological features  and/or branch- or path-length differences . an alternative approach would be to construct and test a parameter describing the degree of incompatibility  between topologies. to the best of our knowledge, no such straightforward metric exists for this particular purpose of quantifying the level of incompatibility. alternative topologies could be compared with a reference topology obtained from, e.g. the literature, a large set of concatenated genes or a source of high-quality whole-genome data. ideally, such reference topology should mimic the species phylogeny as accurate as possible.

in this study, we evaluated the specificity of detection and classification of francisella by first comparing published pcr primers against whole-genome sequences representing the known diversity of the genus. second, we examined the sequence-marker robustness and resolution by comparing different sets of one to seven markers using a modified version of the rf metric. finally, we showed that optimal sets of markers outperform other combinations with respect to phylogenetic robustness and resolution.

RESULTS
overall fit between dna-markers and whole-genome sequences of francisella
a total of  <dig> publicly available francisella genome sequences were screened for sequences  of  <dig> published markers .  <dig> markers had incomplete sets of marker sequences . the lack of 16s marker sequences in fsc <dig>  fsc <dig>  ma <dig>  ga <dig>  and ga <dig> was probably due to the low quality of the genome sequences, which were all sequenced with early versions of  <dig> sequencing technology. the lack of sequences for the remaining  <dig> markers was most likely because they were designed for real-time pcr molecular detection or possibly due to uncovered regions in the sequence .

francisella genomes included in this study selected to represent the known diversity of francisella:  <dig> strains representing the public health perspective of f. tularensis  and  <dig> strains of f. noatunensis and f. philomiragia  representing a fish farming industry and health perspective.

the primer specificities of the  <dig> dna markers were calculated, resulting in scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  . importantly, the calculation was performed for francisella species besides those included in the publication from which the marker originated. a primer score of zero represented a perfect match without any mispriming events or gaps, while the maximal score of  <dig>  corresponded to two mismatches in the 3’ region and a gap of  <dig> bases within the region targeted by a primer . all primer scores are presented in figure
 <dig> and summarised in table
 <dig>  the limit for possible amplification was assumed to be a score value of two, in agreement with the ncbi primer-blast default primer specificity stringency setting. scores below two  are denoted as low score and score above two  are denoted as high score

evaluation of dna markers
the marker 01-16s
 <cit>  targeting 16s rrna was the only marker with a low score  for all the investigated genomes. a total of nine markers  had scores <  <dig> in all subspecies. however, some of these markers, e.g. 23-lpna, showed a clear difference in scores between clade  <dig> and clade  <dig>  as clade  <dig> yielded almost perfect matches, while scores in clade  <dig> were always >  <dig> 

most of the included primers amplified sequences of f. tularensis  and f. novicida of clade  <dig> and less frequently amplified sequences of f. noatunensis and f. philomiragia, of clade  <dig>  fifteen markers  gave low scores for clade  <dig> and high scores for clade  <dig>  marker 38-uup also had low scores in one isolate of philomiragia, and the marker 19-iglc had low scores in f. noatunensis subsp. orientalis and in two isolates of f. philomiragia.

of these fifteen markers, twelve  had low scores for f. hispaniensis fsc <dig> and/or w. persica fsc <dig> as well as low scores in clade  <dig>  only three  out of the fifteen markers consistently differentiated clade  <dig> from the rest of the francisella genus.

the marker 10-fopa was the only marker completely specific for clade  <dig> and only marker 24-lpnb was specific for f. noatunensis. both of these exhibited lower specificity for f. noatunensis subsp. orientalis genomes.

several markers displayed complex amplification patterns. seven markers  had high scores in one or more species or subspecies, e.g. the marker 09-fopa had a low score in all included strains except in f. hispaniensis fsc <dig> and w. persica fsc <dig>  similar results were observed for 02-16s-itr-23s, 29-pgm, 33-rpob and 34-sdha.

four detection markers  had missing data  for all clade  <dig> isolates plus w. persica. the markers 16-ftt <dig> and 17-ftt <dig> had missing sequences for f. hispaniensis and f. tularensis subsp. novicida, except the isolates fsc <dig> and ga <dig>  respectively. the marker 21-isftu <dig> had missing sequences as well as mismatches in almost all subspecies represented. a summary of the dna-marker evaluation can be found in table
 <dig>  and more detailed information, including earlier published results for each marker, can be found in additional file

successful amplification was defined as having a primer score below two in both the forward and reverse primers.

evaluation of sample-sequencing approaches for phylogenetic analyses
in the phylogenetic comparison analysis, we focused not only on the entire francisella genus, but also analysed clades  <dig> and  <dig> separately. these sub-populations exhibit different lifestyles and environmental niches and are therefore of interest to different scientific fields
 <cit> . the differences between the poorest and best resolved single marker topologies of the entire genus compared to the whole-genome reference topology  are highlighted in figure
3a-c. all topologies are shown in additional file
 <dig>  the parameter estimates of the phylogenetic analysis are summarised in additional file
 <dig>  in general for the analysis of the entire genus, the optimal substitution model was parameter rich, i.e. typically the generalised time-reversible 
 <cit>  or hasegawa-kishino-yano 
 <cit>  models with either invariant sites parameter  or rate heterogeneity over sites . moderate or even low parameter-rich substitution models were favoured in the separate clade analyses, in particular for clade  <dig>  where jukes-cantor 
 <cit>  or hky <dig> models were found to be the optimal choice without α or Г. for clade  <dig>  it was important to include the proportion of invariant sites parameter in the analyses, because of detected recombination events
 <cit> .

throughout the study, to facilitate the phylogeny comparisons, we made use of two metrics: degree of incongruence  and difference in resolution . the two topologies compared were the reference topology, obtained from whole genome data, and the single-sequence or the concatenated marker sequences topology. results from comparing single-sequence topologies against the reference phylogeny based on whole-genome sequences are summarised in additional file
 <dig>  the comparisons varied in inc, and sometimes considerably so. in the analysis of the entire genus, the 37-trpe topology did not exhibit any incongruence compared to the reference , although the resolution was poor. for other markers, such as 08-fabh, 27-parc, 03- <dig> s + its +  <dig> s, 04- <dig> s + its +  <dig> s, 25-muts and 36-tpia, the topology comparisons indicated few mismatched bipartitions , whereas the opposite result was found for 11-fopa-in, 29-pgm and 30-prfb . as expected, for some single-marker topologies, particularly those with the lowest inc scores, the sh test did not reject congruence compared to the reference phylogeny.

separate clade  <dig> topologies exhibited a lower average incongruence than topologies of the entire genus  and clade  <dig> topologies . in several cases, clade  <dig> topologies were totally congruent with no mismatched bipartitions. some of these topologies were also congruent in clade 2: . the low level of incongruence was verified by the results of the sh-test, which showed that congruence in the topology comparisons could not be rejected with the exception of 19-iglc. reported incongruences in clade  <dig> mostly occurred in f. novicida. most assignments deviating from the reference in clade  <dig> were due to misplacements of subspecies f. philomiragia and f. noatunensis subsp. noatunensis.

in the separate analysis of clade  <dig>  most strains not assigned according to the reference were due to poor resolution, notably topologies of markers 32-rpoa, 37-trpe, 25-mdh, 24-lpnb and 19-iglc. the average resolution  in topologies of clade  <dig> was significantly higher than clade  <dig>  and the entire genus . the correlations between the incongruence and resolution metrics were ρ =  <dig>  and ρ =  <dig>  for clade  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

 <dig>  results of the optimisation analyses of the separate clades are not shown. compared to random concatenation of sequence markers, the francisella genus topology from an optimised set of markers reduced the difference in resolution by on average  <dig> - 59% and totally eliminated incongruences. the suggested combination of five gene fragments in
 <cit>  resulted in a topology comparison with res =  <dig>  and inc =  <dig> , whereas the corresponding optimal topology resulted in res =  <dig>  and inc =  <dig> . the average bootstrap support of the optimised topologies compared to the average bootstrap of random marker topologies was significantly higher for congruence at the  <dig> marker level ,  <dig> marker level , and  <dig> marker level , as well as for resolution at the  <dig> marker level .

discussion
knowledge about theoretical limitations of marker assays is important for the successful detection and identification of bacteria in research as well as public health contexts. existing methods for detection and identification of francisella were developed with limited knowledge about the genetic diversity within the francisella genus. from a clinical perspective, the lack of knowledge of diversity in the environment may be of minor importance since diagnostic sampling is performed on humans or animals suspected of having the disease. in contrast, use of the same detection assays for environmental sampling can lead to problems with false positive results. the recent increase in publicly available genome sequences enables development of improved detection and identification methods for both purposes. the emergence of high-throughput typing of large collections of bacterial strains targeting single amplicons is likely to mean that the targeting of single-marker regions will continue to be important in the future
 <cit> .

in this study, we evaluated  <dig> published markers  against the current known diversity of the francisella genus. it is important to note that the studies from which the markers were gathered differed widely in scope. some studies were designed to only cover a specific species and exclude others, whereas in other studies it was not of interest or even possible to study all the francisella species included here. several of the included markers were amplifying sequence products for species not included in previous studies of francisella, e.g. f. hispaniensis, f. noatunensis and w. persica. as many as one third of the markers amplified all the included subspecies and approximately half of the markers amplified products for f. hispaniensis and/or w. persica together with clade  <dig> or clade  <dig>  this indicates that strains belonging to f. hispaniensis, w. persica, f. noatunensis are responsible for several false identifications. it should be pointed out that we have only considered sequence based markers here. other type of markers and marker combinations can be fruitful, in particular for construction of sub-species specific assays, which has been shown by e.g. combining variable-number of tandem repeats  and insertion-deletion  markers
 <cit>  or snp and indel markers
 <cit> .

specificity is especially important for markers designed for detection. the results of the investigated detection markers suggested that the specificity was questionable for the majority of them. the marker 22-lpna
 <cit> , designated for f. tularensis detection, was found to also amplify f. hispaniensis fsc454
 <cit> . in the present study, the primers of the genus-specific marker 13-fopa
 <cit>  were not predicted to amplify any of the included f. philomiragia, whereas in the original publication they were reported to amplify all included f. philomiragia isolates. probably a large unknown diversity exists within this species. for almost all  <dig> detection markers for francisella tularensis, there was a significant risk of false-negative results caused by unwanted mismatches for isolates that should be detected. in conclusion, primer sequences need to be continually evaluated and redesigned using up-to date knowledge of the genetic diversity of the targeted sequences to minimise the likelihood of false-positive or -negative results. a similar conclusion was published by
 <cit>  where false-positive and -negative hits of primers against publically available sequences in various species of bacteria were evaluated with the result of high degree of primer mismatch in haemophilus influenza, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. hence, primer miss-match seems to be a general problem within prokaryotes. our evaluation approach for primers could subsequently be of benefit to the microbiological community.

in order to compare analyses based on pcr-based sequence data with analyses based on whole-genome data for making phylogenetic inferences, we partitioned the popular rf metric into two separate metrics, incompatibility and resolution, to enable comparison of an alternative topology with a reference topology. these two metrics explain different characteristics, which allow a particular question to be considered when evaluating the phylogeny of bacteria given the reference topology. in the genomes of francisella analysed here, these two metrics were correlated and therefore displaying similar metric characteristics, albeit with some exceptions, particularly in the clade  <dig> analysis. the incompatibility metric was negatively correlated with nucleotide diversity, whereas the opposite was found for the resolution metric, which highlights differences in the characteristics of these metrics. this finding suggests that single-nucleotide polymorphisms  in marker-sequence regions increase the resolution but may also compromise the phylogenetic signal. one possible explanation for the incompatibility of snps and whole-genome phylogeny is the presence of recombination within sequence fragments, which has been suggested by several previous analyses of pathogenic bacteria populations; i.e. neisseria meningitidis <cit> , staphylococcus aureus <cit>  and escherichia coli <cit> . nonetheless, for analysis of large numbers of bacterial strains showing conflicting topologies using different combinations of markers, our proposed comparison metrics are useful measures. to determine whether the observed topological differences could have occurred by chance, our comparison approach can be combined with a statistical test, such as the sh test applied here or an alternative test, e.g.
 <cit> .

most incompatibilities were associated with the topologies that included all strains, whereas the level of incompatibility was significantly lower for clade  <dig>  with topologies being totally compatible in many cases. these results indicate that the clonal frame is maintained within the f. tularensis clade, but it is disrupted at the genus level and in clade  <dig>  most incompatibilities were a result of f. philomiragia, f. novicida, w. persica and f. hispaniensis strains that were misplaced in the single-marker cases, which suggests that recombination is the main evolutionary force that promotes incongruences in francisella, as pointed out by, e.g.
 <cit> . the reduction of recombination rate in clade  <dig> might, in turn, reflect barriers to gene flow between ecological and geographical clusters among sub-species
 <cit> .

our result suggests that no single-marker topology of the entire genus is able to assign all strains to the subspecies defined by the whole genome topology. in fact, some marker topologies, such as 02- <dig> s + its +  <dig> s and 24-rpob, made deviating assignments in more than 70% of the cases. the reason for the low success rate of assigned strains to their corresponding sub-species is mainly poor resolution, which meant that typically all f. tularensis strains displayed identical sequences. most topologies assigned all strains to the same main clades as in the whole genome phylogeny, with a few exceptions: 33-rpob assigned f. hispaniensis to clade  <dig> and 19-iglc assigned w. persica to clade  <dig>  in subgroup f. noatunensis subsp. orientalis . this is an interesting observation as rpob was recently suggested as an alternative marker to 16s rdna in metagenomic studies
 <cit> .

the level of incompatibility and difference in resolution compared to the whole-genome reference topology were decreased, in some cases by a considerable amount, by selecting an optimal combination of markers. moreover, topologies based on an optimal set of markers significantly increased the average statistical support . generally, both the degree of compatibility and resolution were improved by concatenating sets of two to seven markers in all possible combinations. however, some combinations, in particular considering incompatibility, might result in poorer topologies than for an estimated topology based on a single marker. this observation is consistent with previous work where concatenation of sequence data have resulted in biased phylogenetic estimates
 <cit> . all incompatible phylogenetic signals were removed in topologies based on optimised sets of two to seven markers, in contrast to random concatenation. totally congruent topologies were obtained by concatenating as few as only two markers . these two markers were included in all optimal sets. hence, by selecting an optimal set of markers, a large improvement in resolution and compatibility can be obtained over random concatenation.

an exhaustive search strategy was employed to find the optimal set of markers since the total number of available markers was relatively small. it should be pointed out that the number of possible marker combinations increases rapidly with the number of markers considered and soon becomes computationally intractable. as all the  <dig> gene fragments of the core genome in the analysed population have recently become available in
 <cit> , an interesting extension to the current work would be to find the optimal set of markers based on all those genes. such an optimisation could be carried out by utilising one of the myriad of available optimisation techniques, such as a simulated annealing approach
 <cit> . it should be noted that we do only try to minimize the value of the objective metrics, incongruence or resolution difference, with respect to the whole-genome topology. there is no guarantee that the whole genome topology accurately resembles the true underlying species topology as systematic errors and statistical inconsistencies in the phylogenetic inference method could be amplified when analyzing whole genome data
 <cit> .

by demonstrating the potential of establishing robust bacterial phylogenies using sample sequencing of only a few markers, we believe that the framework presented here could serve as a foundation for population analyses as well as for identifying and attributing unknown pathogenic strains to the correct subspecies.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study suggest that several of the investigated markers designed to be diagnostic exhibit a considerable level of unspecificity. hence, several of the currently used primers need to be redesigned to avoid false-positive results. this arises because of a previous lack of knowledge about genetic diversity within the francisella genus represented by, e.g. strains belonging to f. hispaniensis and among fles. by employing sample sequencing of dna markers to make phylogenetic inferences, we revealed incompatibilities among topologies that included all considered francisella strains but not among topologies that included only clade  <dig> strains containing f. tularensis. an estimated topology based on optimised combination of markers drastically reduced incompatibility and resolution differences compared to topologies obtained by random concatenation and at the same time improved the average bootstrap support, using the whole genome phylogeny as a reference. implementation of such an optimisation framework based on accurate reference topology would help to improve assays for detection and identification purposes, which are of considerable importance in a number of research fields, such as for improving biosurveillance systems and inferring evolutionary histories.
