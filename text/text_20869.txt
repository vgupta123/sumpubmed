BACKGROUND
harpins are multifunctional proteins produced by gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the first-characterized  <cit>  and well-studied harpin  <cit> , hrpnea, is secreted by erwinia amylovora, the bacterial pathogen that causes fire blight disease in rosaceous plants  <cit> . multiple functions of harpin proteins, especially in eliciting plant defense responses, were also elucidated initially by studies using hrpnea as a paradigm  <cit> . early studies demonstrated that the external application of hrpnea was able to induce resistance in a variety of plant species  <cit> , and that the induced resistance effectively protected plants from attacks by insect herbivores  <cit> . hrpnea-induced resistance to insects first was suggested based on observations of field-grown peppers. plants that had been treated with hrpnea incurred fewer injuries from the european corn borer than comparable untreated plants  <cit> . a deterrent effect on striped cucumber beetles was observed in hrpnea-treated cucumber; striped cucumber beetles preferred to colonize untreated control plants rather than hrpnea-treated plants  <cit> . hrpnea-induced resistance was also effective in impeding infestations of aphids, an important type of phloem-feeding herbivores  <cit> . in cucumbers grown under environmentally controlled conditions, hrpnea treatment had a deterrent effect on colonization by the muskmelon aphid aphis gossypii , which preferred to colonize control plants rather than hrpnea-treated plants  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana , moreover, hrpnea-induced resistance was shown to repress infestation of the green peach aphid myzus persicae , a generalist phloem-feeding insect  <cit> .

phloem-feeding insects are highly specialized in their mode of feeding  <cit>  and present a unique stress on plant fitness  <cit> . these insects use their slender stylets to feed from a single-cell type, the phloem sieve element  <cit> . the feeding process can be monitored by the electrical penetration graph  technique  <cit> . pivotally, a stylet puncturing of the host plant cell, shown as a probe in the epg, may lead to uptake of the phloem sap. in order to prevent protein clogging inside the sieve element, ejection of watery saliva is essential in feeding from the phloem  <cit> . this ejection is detected in the epg as e <dig> salivation and always precedes phloem sap ingestion  <cit> . during ingestion from the sieve element, the watery e <dig> salivation occurs, and this e <dig> saliva is added to the ingested sap, thought to prevent phloem proteins from clogging inside the capillary food canal  <cit> . therefore, salivation is a crucial event during the phloem-feeding process for insects to overcome a number of phloem-related plant properties and reactions  <cit> .

in response to the phloem-feeding stress, plants defend themselves specifically using the phloem-based defense  mechanism  <cit> , which can be also activated by other cues, such as wounding  <cit> , besides insect attacks  <cit> . proposed components of pbd include the phloem protein  <dig>  and phloem protein  <dig> , which represent a type of the most abundant proteins in the phloem sap  <cit> . pp <dig> is a phloem lectin conserved in plants  <cit>  and is believed to play a role in the establishment of pbd induced by insect attacks  <cit>  and other stresses, such as wounding  <cit>  and oxidative conditions  <cit> . in pumpkin, pp <dig> monomers and pp <dig> dimers are covalently cross-linked via disulphide bonds, forming high molecular weight polymers that close the sieve pores  <cit> . this response is induced by oxidative stress  <cit>  but normally accompanies the synthesis of the β- <dig> -glucan callose by callose synthase  <cit>  that accumulates on sieve plates after different stress treatments  <cit> . phloem protein plugging and callose closure of sieve pores, and callose coagulation on sieve plates as well, is hypothesized to serve as a physical barrier to prevent the insect from phloem-feeding activity  <cit> . nevertheless, evidence for the function of phloem proteins in insect defense has been in paucity.

in the completely sequenced arabidopsis genome, pp <dig>  genes were identified as a large multigene family constituted of  <dig> members  <cit> , atpp2-a <dig> to atpp2a- <dig> and atpp2-b <dig> to atpp2-b <dig>  <cit> . to our knowledge, however, little has been known about bioprocesses affected by these genes and properties of the encoded proteins. although arabidopsis mutants that represent multiple mutation alleles of atpp <dig> have been generated  <cit> , subsequent biological effects have not been studied, and especially, effects of atpp <dig> mutations on the plant resistance to insects are unclear. for example, different types of arabidopsis mutants were generated by t-dna insertion at distinct locations in the atpp2-a <dig> dna sequence; atpp2-a1/p/- <dig> resulted from the insertion at nucleotide residue - <dig> in the promoter region. when grown on an artificial medium, the atpp2-a1/p/- <dig> mutant performs as the wild-type  plant in response to infestations of m. persicae adults and newborn nymphs in  <dig> hours after colonization by the adults  <cit> . there is as yet no evidence to show if atpp2-a1/p/- <dig> impacts longer behaviors and feeding activities of the insect and if other mutation alleles of atpp2-a <dig> have biological effects  <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to obtain genetic evidence that could elucidate a function of atpp2-a <dig> in arabidopsis resistance to m. persicae. we began with determining the effect of atpp2-a <dig> on phloem feeding of aphids that colonized the plants treated with hrpnea according to previous evidence that the hrpnea treatment and m. persicae infestation had some degrees of overlapping effects on the induction of plant responses. for example, formation of the pp2-pp <dig> complex needs reactive oxygen burst in cucurbit  <cit>  while reactive oxygen burst is a conserved response in arabidopsis treated with any harpins  <cit> . m. persicae infestation induces an elevation of the ethylene level  <cit>  and triggers modest induction of ethylene-dependent responses  <cit> , whereas, hrpnea induces resistance to m. persicae by activating the ethylene-signaling pathway  <cit> . therefore, we devised to determine the possibility that hrpnea-induced resistance involves the pbd mechanism to encounter with m. persicae infestation. in order to further test this hypothesis, we generated atpp2-a1-overexpression plants and investigated them to elucidate the supposed function of atpp2-a <dig>  in this article, we report evidence that harpin-induced expression and transgenic overexpression of atpp2-a <dig> induce a repression in the phloem-feeding activity of m. persicae.

RESULTS
hrpnea treatment in arabidopsis induces a repression in phloem feeding and colonization by m. persicae
the hrpnea protein used in this study was produced by prokaryotic expression with a vector that carried a hrpnea gene insert; the hrpnea-absent empty vector preparation  that contained inactive proteins but not hrpnea was used as a control  <cit> . we investigated activities of m. persicae feeding from arabidopsis  wt plants following treatment with evp and hrpnea, respectively. because a period of five days is usually required for the induction of plant defense responses  <cit> , plants at the fifth day posttreatment  were artificially colonized with uniform ten-day-old apterous  agamic m. persicae females transferred from an arabidopsis nursery. aphid feeding activities were studied by the epg technique applied to  <dig> aphids that colonized leaves of arabidopsis plants treated with evp and hrpnea, respectively. feeding activities were depicted as different waveform patterns recognized according to the standard previously established  <cit>  and widely used  <cit> . based on the epg patterns, all the  <dig> aphids tested in five repetitions of the experiments for each treatment accomplished major steps of the feeding process, but aphid activities varied greatly depending on feeding stages .

*sd, standard deviation. **insignificant difference at p <  <dig> .

based on the four-hour epg record, the proportions of times within the pathway phase and time to the first phloem phase were much longer, suggesting the impediment to aphids in locating the ingestion site within the vascular tissue, in hrpnea-treated plants compared with control plants . on hrpnea-treated plants, moreover, aphids took fewer actions to puncture cells  and to enter the phloem phase  after the first entry of phloem phase. these results suggested that phloem properties of hrpnea-treated plants were changed as unfavourable to aphid feeding. in consistence with this notion, total duration of the phloem phase was markedly shorter in hrpnea-treated plants than in control plants . noticeably, duration of the phloem phase in the second hour of the epg monitoring, being  <dig> in hrpnea-treated plants and  <dig> min in control plants, on average, strongly suggested the deterrent effect of the hrpnea treatment on the phloem-feeding activity of m. persicae.

in the phloem phase, e <dig> and e <dig> salivations were recognized by dissecting the epg waveform patters . compounds of e <dig> and e <dig> saliva produced by aphids after stylet entry of the phloem are believed to function in preventing protein clogging inside the sieve element and preventing phloem proteins from clogging inside the capillary food canal, respectively  <cit> . thus, e <dig> and e <dig> salivations play an important role in ingestion of the phloem sap by the insects  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  durations of both e <dig> and e <dig> salivations were much shorter in hrpnea-treated plants than control plants, confirming the deterrent effect of the hrpnea treatment on the phloem-feeding activity of m. persicae.

to correlate repression in the phloem-feeding activity with colonization of arabidopsis by m. persicae, we monitored a large-scale population of the insect and surveyed a 24-hour fluctuation in leaf colonies. a total of  <dig>  uniform individuals of apterous and agamic m. persicae females were monitored in four repetitions of the experiments for plants treated with evp and hrpnea, respectively. the number of aphids that stayed in their colonies on leaves was counted and the number of aphids that run away from the leaf colonies was calculated at intervals in  <dig> hours . at each time point, the number of aphid individuals run away from their colonies on leaves of hrpnea-treated plants was greater than the number of the insect run away from colonies on leaves of control plants . proportions of aphids escaped from leaf colonies in control plants were close at the different intervals, but much higher proportions of aphid escapes from leaf colonies in hrpnea-treated plants were observed in the short period of two to four hours. and this period was critical to the effect of hrpnea treatment on colonization of the plant, consistent with the effect on the phloem-feeding activity . in  <dig> hours, a total of  <dig> % aphids on average run away from their colonies on leaves of hrpnea-treated plants, in contrast to totally  <dig> % aphids escaped from leaf colonies in control plants . in subsequent days, aphids that had run away from the original leaf colonies were found in a drifting status, died, and appeared as white carcases on other different parts of the plants. these observations indicate that the hrpnea treatment impairs the stability of arabidopsis colonization by m. persicae.

arabidopsis atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> mutant pampers m. persicae in phloem feeding
to gain information about relationships between previously identified  <dig> atpp <dig> genes  <cit>  and hrpnea-induced repression in the phloem-feeding activity of m. persicae, we studied expression of these genes in hrpnea-treated wt arabidopsis plants. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  was performed using the ef1α gene as a reference  <cit>  to detect the expression of  <dig> atpp2-a genes and  <dig> atpp2-b genes  <cit> . as shown in figure 3a, transcript levels of the genes, except atpp2-a <dig> and atpp2-a <dig>  in hrpnea-treated plants were similar when tested at the 24th hour posttreatment  as tested at  <dig> hpt . however, both atpp2-a <dig> and atpp2-a <dig> were expressed at enhanced extents in hrpnea-treated plants. subsequent real-time rt-pcr analyses using the ef1α and actin <dig> genes as references  <cit>  revealed a greater expression level of atpp2-a <dig> than atpp2-a <dig>  relatively, atpp2-a <dig> and atpp2-a <dig> transcripts accumulated in  <dig> hours were  <dig> and  <dig> times more, respectively, in hrpnea-treated plants than in control plants .

to correlate the role of hrpnea in enhancing gene expression with the role in repressing phloem feeding of m. persicae, we investigated arabidopsis mutants previously generated by t-dna insertion at atpp2-a sequences. two atpp2-a <dig> sequence-indexed lines were chosen for the test because the atpp2-a <dig> protein had been shown to affect weight gain in m. persicae nymphs  <cit> , and the other eight atpp2-a-modified mutants were considered for comparison because the atpp2-a genes differed from atpp2-a <dig> in response to hrpnea . the ten mutants were confirmed for the presence of t-dna insert according to available information ; they were named conventionally after lowercase gene symbols, suffixed with the insert locations, including gene dna components  and nucleotide residue sites at the gene dna sequences. mutants were compared with wt in expression of the corresponding genes and aphid behaviors on leaf colonies.

a distribution seeds of atpp2-a1/p/- <dig>  atpp2-a10/p/- <dig> and atpp2-a3/i/ <dig> are from confirmed lines and t <dig> or t <dig> generation for the other mutants.

parallel rt-pcr analyses of rna samples isolated at  <dig> and  <dig> hpt revealed that the atpp2-a genes performed differently in corresponding mutants compared with the wt plant . both the basal expression  and hrpnea-induced expression  of atpp2-a <dig> was detected in the atpp2-a1/p/- <dig> mutant as in wt but not in the atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> mutant . this result was confirmed by northern blot hybridization . and this result conformed to the place web signal scan  <cit> , which revealed  <dig> types of cis-acting regulatory dna elements present in the predicted 344-bp promoter of atpp2-a <dig>  eighteen elements exist as a single copy and  <dig> elements have multiple copies, located at distant  <dig> sites in the promoter sequence. however, none of the elements was disrupted by t-dna insertion and this might account for atpp2-a <dig> expression in atpp2-a1/p/- <dig>  similarly, none of  <dig> types of cis-acting regulatory dna elements scanned in the upstream - <dig> region of the atpp2-a <dig> dna sequence was disrupted in atpp2-a14/p/- <dig>  this mutant performed as wt in both the basal expression and hrpnea-induced expression of atpp2-a <dig> . the other eight mutants behaved differently in expression of the corresponding atpp2-a genes. atpp2-a <dig>  -a <dig>  -a <dig>  and -a <dig> were not expressed in their corresponding mutants atpp2-a3/i/ <dig>  -a11/e/ <dig>  -a13/e/ <dig>  and -a15/e/ <dig>  in contrast, atpp2-a10/p/- <dig>  a11/p/- <dig>  a12/p/- <dig>  a14/p/- <dig> performed as wt in the expression of the corresponding atpp2-a genes. in atpp2-a12/p/- <dig> and atpp2-a12/p/- <dig>  t-dna insert did not disrupt any dna regulatory motifs present in atpp2-a <dig> and atpp2-a <dig> promoters. in atpp2-a10/p/- <dig>  t-dna insert disrupted the pollen-specific transcription activator element agaaa   <cit>  located between - <dig> and - <dig> in the atpp2-a <dig> sequence. in atpp2-a11/p/- <dig>  the myb recognition site tggttt   <cit>  located between - <dig> and - <dig> in the atpp2-a <dig> sequence was disjoined by t-dna insertion. however, both mutations did not affect basal expression of the genes . in the ten mutants, therefore, only atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> represents an effective mutation allele, which may be responsible for a transcriptional stop of atpp2-a <dig> in the plant and result in experimental compromises in both the basal expression and hrpnea-induced expression of the gene.

the ten atpp2-a-modified mutants were compared with the wt plant in terms of colonization and feeding by aphids. based on monitoring of large-scale populations of apterous and agamic m. persicae females , the insect colonies on leaves of atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> were stable, shown as a smaller rate of the population decrease in  <dig> hours, than those on wt and the other nine mutants . in atpp2-a1/e/ <dig>  the deterrent effect of hrpnea on colonization by the insect was little, but the effect was evident in the other mutants as in wt . based on the four-hour epg record, total durations of nonpuncturing and pathway phases had little and insignificant differences between wt and atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> under the same condition, hrpnea treatment or control . then, the four-hour epg record of aphid feeding from leaves was analyzed to particularly calculate total duration of the phloem phase , which well reflected hrpnea-induced repression in aphid feeding from the wt phloem . apparently, aphids preferred to feed from atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> . in the mutant, total duration of the phloem phase in  <dig> hours was much longer than that in the other mutants and wt as well . both the second and fourth hour of the epg record indicated significant deterrent effect of the hrpnea treatment on aphid feeding from the wt phloem , but the deterrent effect was lost in atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> . duration of the phloem phase in the second-hour epg was much shorter in wt plants treated with hrpnea vs. evp, but the duration was close in atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> in despite of treatments . these results suggest that atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> pampers m. persicae in phloem feeding and that atpp2-a <dig> plays a role in hrpnea-induced repression of the phloem-feeding activity.

*insignificant difference at p <  <dig> .

to gain information about the general function of atpp2-a <dig> in arabidopsis resistance to m. persicae, we compared atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> with the other nine mutants and with wt as well in the effects on multiplication of the insect and subsequent nymph activities. the reproduction rate was scored as the ratio between total numbers of newborn nymphs and total numbers of aphid adults that stayed on leaves in five days after colonization. as shown in figure 4d, reproduction rates were much smaller under the condition of hrpnea treatment vs. control  irrespective of the plant genotypes, suggesting that hrpnea-induced repression of m. persicae multiplication  <cit>  was not related to the atpp2-a <dig> gene. the gene, however, showed a repressive effect on plant colonization by newborn nymphs. nymph colonies were more stable on atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> with a smaller proportion of the population decrease than the other mutants or wt . in atpp2-a1/e/ <dig>  the deterrent effect of hrpnea on colonization by nymphs was little, but the effect was evident in the other mutants as in the wt plant . evidently, atpp2-a <dig> does not affect aphid reproduction, but instead, the gene plays a role in repressing plant colonization by nymphs as by adults.

atpp2-a1-overexpression confers repressed phloem feeding of m. persicae
the atpp2-a <dig> gene was cloned into the binary vector pbi <dig> under control by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter , creating pbi121::35s::atpp2-a <dig> . transformation of wt arabidopsis with the recombinant unit generated pp2oetat  plants. ten pp2oetat lines were selected and designated as pp2oetat <dig> through pp2oetat <dig> according to atpp2-a <dig> expression levels . transformation of the wt plant with the empty pbi <dig> vector, containing neither uida nor atpp2-a <dig>  generated the transgenic control plant, which behaved as wt in all the tests . also, wt, transgenic control and pp2oetat plants did not have evident differences in morphology. homozygous t <dig> progenies of the pp2oetat lines were compared the wt and transgenic control plants in atpp2-a <dig> expression and in colonization and feeding by apterous m. persicae females.

real-time rt-pcr was conducted with rna samples from leaves and primers specific to atpp2-a <dig>  as shown in figure 5b, levels of the atpp2-a <dig> transcript varied with the different pp2oetat lines, and levels of the transcript were greater in all the pp2oetat lines than the transgenic control plant. compared with the transgenic control plant, pp2oetat lines seemed more resistant to colonization and feeding by aphids. smaller populations of aphids were able to stay for  <dig> hours on leaf colonies of pp2oetat than the transgenic control plant . consistently, aphids preferred to feed from the transgenic control plant rather than pp2oetat . total duration of the phloem phase in the four-hour epg record was much shorter in pp2oetat than in the control plant .

based on statistical analyses , the ten pp2oetat lines differed significantly from the transgenic control plant in levels of atpp2-a <dig> expression , the number of aphids that were able to stay for  <dig> hours on leaf colonies , and durations of the phloem phase . in the ten pp2oetat lines, the number of aphids that were able to stay for  <dig> hours on leaf colonies was increased , but durations of the phloem phase was decreased , with increases in levels of atpp2-a <dig> expression . the pp2oetat <dig> line showed as the greatest expresser of atpp2-a <dig> and the greatest repressor of colonization and feeding by m. persicae. in addition, a greater repression of phloem feeding by aphids was observed in the presence than the absence of hrpnea treatment , suggesting that original and introduced versions of the atpp2-a <dig> gene might be able coordinate their functions and might function simultaneously, in pp2oxta <dig> 

atpp2-a <dig> expression in different organs of pp2oetat <dig> is consistent with repression of phloem feeding by m. persicae
pp2oetat <dig> was further investigated in the genomic integration of the introduced atpp2-a <dig> gene, organ specificity of the gene expression, and the effect of m. persicae feeding from the phloem. the southern blot of specifically ingested genomic dna hybridized with the atpp2-a1-specific probe revealed that the introduced atpp2-a <dig> gene had been integrated into the genome and existed as a double copy in pp2oetat <dig> . overexpression of the gene was confirmed by northern blot of leaf rna samples hybridized with the probe specific to atpp2-a <dig> .

real-time rt-pcr analyses revealed that atpp2-a <dig> expression varied greatly in different organs of pp2oetat <dig>  the expression of atpp2-a <dig> was conspicuous in leaves, stems, calyces, and petals but little transcript was detected from flower stalks . amounts of the atpp2-a <dig> transcript were much greater in leaves, stems, calyces, and petals of pp2oetat <dig> than the transgenic control plant. however, close amounts of the transcript were detected from flower stalks of both plants. this result suggested the overexpression of atpp2-a <dig> in all the organs except flower stalks of pp2oetat <dig>  levels of the gene overexpression were higher in leaves, calyces, and petals compared with stems .

the organ-differential levels of atpp2-a <dig> overexpression were negatively correlated with the extents by which apterous agamic m. persicae females fed from the different organs. based on total duration of the phloem phase in the four-hour epg record , aphids preferred to feed from leaves, calyces, and petals, but aphids were also able to feed from stems and flower stalks. however, durations of the phloem phase were much shorter when aphids were feeding from leaves, stems, calyces, and petals of pp2oetat <dig> compared with the transgenic control plant , suggesting that the phloem-feeding activity was repressed in the different organs of pp2oetat <dig>  inversely, the phloem phase of aphid feeding from the pp2oetat <dig> flower stalk lasted as longer as feeding from the same organ of the transgenic control plant , suggesting that aphids did not have a preference between both plants in feeding from flower stalks.

expression of atpp2-a <dig> promoter-gus is organ-unspecific
because the introduced copies of atpp2-a <dig>  are under direction by 35s , the organ-differential expression in pp2oetat <dig>  does not offer significant information about organ specificity of the gene expression. lack of the organ specificity was indicated by the transcript detected from different organs of the transgenic control plant . in an experimental design to test whether the organ-unspecific atpp2-a <dig> expression was related with activity of the atpp2-a <dig> promoter, the promoter placed in front of the uida reporter gene  was able to drive the gene expression in the uidaetat  plant . six uidaetat lines were observed. they seemed to resemble each other closely and were also similar to the transgenic control plant . in the uidaetat <dig> line, uida was expressed markedly in the stem, flower stalk, calyce, and petal, whereas, stronger expression was found in the leaf . the uida gene encodes β-glucuronidase  enzyme  <cit> . gus activity was detected in the root, stem, calyce, and petal of pp2oetat <dig> . gus activity was not found in the flower stalk , possibly due to no uida expression or little gus beyond detectable level. in addition, uidaetat <dig> showed as tolerant as the transgenic control plant to phloem feeding by m. persicae . this result indirectly suggests that atpp2-a <dig> plays a role, only when expressed itself, in repressing the phloem-feeding activity.

discussion
although harpin proteins and their functions as proteinaceous elicitors in eliciting plant defense responses have been found for decades  <cit> , many aspects of the mechanisms that underlie harpin-induced defenses remain unclear. important questions include, for example, how a harpin protein as an exogenous signal is perceived by plants and how the signal perception is connected to a transducer to trigger a cellular pathway. great attentions have been paid to plant signal transduction in harpin-induced resistance to pathogens  <cit>  and insect herbivores  <cit> . we have used hrpnea, the first-characterized  <cit>  and well-studied harpin  <cit> , as a model of proteinaceous elicitors to characterize induced resistance against insect herbivores  <cit> , particularly the green peach aphid m. persicae, a generalist phloem-feeding insect  <cit> . it has been shown that the hrpnea treatment and m. persicae infestation have some overlapping effects on the induction of plant responses  <cit> , especially the pbd mechanism that is suggested to involve the lectin-type phloem protein pp <dig>  <cit>  as a component  <cit> . although  <dig> members of the pp <dig> multigene family have been identified in arabidopsis  <cit>  and atpp2-modified arabidopsis mutants generated  <cit> , little is known about biological effects, especially on resistance to insects, of the genes and mutants http://www.arabidopsis.org. the purpose of this study is to elucidate the function of atpp2-a <dig> in resistance to m. persicae in arabidopsis plants when treated with hrpnea and under the condition of atpp2-a <dig> overexpression.

we show that the treatment of arabidopsis with hrpnea induces a repression in m. persicae feeding from the plant phloem  and colonization of plants by the insect . based on the epg patterns, applying hrpnea to wt arabidopsis impedes aphids in stylet puncturing of the plant cell, en route to the vascular tissue while looking for the phloem, and, especially, in the phloem-feeding activity. so the hrpnea treatment is likely to induce changes in cell wall properties unfavorable to aphid feeding, but this notion remains to be examined. hrpnea-induced deterrent effect on the phloem-feeding activity has been found in the epg data analyzed either by hour or based on the four-hour record as a whole . the phloem-feeding activity could be reflected in the epg by duration of the phloem phase composed of e <dig> and e <dig> salivations , which are essential for ingestion of the phloem sap  <cit> . shortened duration of the phloem phase, in both e <dig> and e <dig> salivations , suggests that the insect's effort in ingestion of the phloem sap is repressed under the hrpnea treatment condition compared with control. it is also pertinent to propose that the hrpnea treatment impacts the insect-plant interaction. in terms of the insect, e <dig> and e <dig> saliva are believed to prevent protein clogging inside the sieve element and prevent phloem proteins from clogging inside the capillary food canal  <cit> , respectively. in the plant side, phloem protein plugging of the sieve element presumably serves as a physical barrier to aphid feeding from the phloem  <cit> . the lectin-type phloem protein pp <dig>  <cit>  is supposed to play a role in plant response to the feeding stress  <cit> .

molecular and genetic evidence supports a role of arabidopsis pp <dig> gene atpp2-a <dig> in hrpnea-induced repression of m. persicae feeding from the plant phloem. rt-pcr analyses  suggest that atpp2-a <dig> is the most hrpnea-responsive gene of  <dig> members of the pp <dig> multigene family  <cit> . place web signal scan  <cit>  provides a clue to molecular basis of hrpnea response and the atpp2-a <dig> induction as well. for example, the gene promoter contains three copies of the consensus gt- <dig> binding box ga/ga/taaa/t   <cit> . this element is involved in the regulation of salicylic acid signaling  <cit> , which otherwise can be activated by hrpnea treatment in arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, previous studies have shown that hrpnea-induced resistance to m. persicae is regulated by the ethylene signaling pathway  <cit> , which essentially involves perception of the ethylene signal by the receptor etr <dig>  the signal transduction to the integral membrane protein ein <dig>  <cit> , and the regulation of ethylene responsive factors   <cit> . the w-box tgacc/t  present in the atpp2-a <dig> promoter has been shown as required for wounding-induced activation of the erf <dig> gene  <cit> . the erf <dig> protein is a regulator of ethylene signaling  <cit> , which otherwise is activated to regulate induced resistance to m. persicae in arabidopsis plants responding to hrpnea treatment  <cit> . thus, atpp2-a <dig> is pertinently thought a part of the signaling pathway that is required for hrpnea response, at least during induction of the plant resistance to m. persicae  <cit> . a role of atpp2-a <dig> in the induced resistance has been elucidated by evidence obtained from investigating ten mutants  in comparison with the wt plant. the investigation demonstrates that deterrent effect of the hrpnea treatment on aphid feeding from the phloem requires a functional atpp2-a <dig> gene in the plant . this notion is especially supported by the absence of hrpnea-induced repression of the phloem-feeding activity in the atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> mutant . this result offers a novel angle to further understanding on the pbd mechanism. previously, this defensive mechanism was known as a result of plant responses to attacks by phloem-feeding insects  <cit>  and other stresses, such as wounding  <cit> . now, the pbd mechanism is known to occur as a result of plant response to hrpnea, a proteinaceous elicitor of plant defenses  <cit> . this notion, however, remains to be examined in regard to how atpp2-a <dig> contributes to pbd in response to the hrpnea treatment.

the function of atpp2-a <dig> in conferring repression of the phloem-feeding activity is further supported by evidence obtained from investigating pp2oetat  plants . levels of atpp2-a <dig> expression are significantly greater in the  <dig> tested pp2oetat lines than in the transgenic control plant, conforming to the experimental design for the gene overexpression. in the different pp2oetat lines, durations of the phloem phase are decreased with increases in levels of atpp2-a <dig> expression, suggesting that atpp2-a <dig> overexpression confers a repression in the phloem-feeding activity of m. persicae. these observations also identify the pp2oetat <dig> line as the greatest expresser of atpp2-a <dig> and the greatest repressor of colonization and feeding by the insect. reminiscently of cell-to-cell pp <dig> rna movement in cucurbits  <cit>  and distant phloem transport flowering signals  <cit> , little amount of the atpp2-a <dig> transcript in flower stalks  may result from organ-to-organ trafficking to fulfill the requirement for flower development. in the other organs, however, atpp2-a <dig> expression is consistent with the repression of aphid feeding from the organs . the organ-unspecific feature of atpp2-a <dig> expression and function is also suggested indirectly by investigating the transgenic plant uidaetat <dig>  in the plant, uida expression under direction of the atpp2-a <dig> promoter is found in various organs , but these organs do not have a repressive effect on aphid feeding . this result indirectly supported that atpp2-a <dig> plays a role, only when expressed itself, in repression of the phloem-feeding activity. consistent to our observations on uidaetat <dig>  a previous study detected gus activity in different organs of transgenic plants that expressed uida under direction by the atpp2-a promoter  <cit> . in the present study, both uida transcript and gus activity were detected in different organs of uidaetat <dig> . due to our failure in obtaining transgenic plants that had been designed to express atpp2-a1-uida under control by the atpp2-a <dig> promoter, now we can not provide more convening evidence for coincident organ localization in atpp2-a <dig> expression and aphid feeding repression. however, repression of the phloem-feeding activity seems a consistent attribute of the different pp2oetat lines  and a consistent attribute of the different organs of pp2oetat <dig>  as well, owing to atpp2-a <dig> overexpression in both cases. in the case of pp2oetat <dig>  whenever the level of atpp2-a <dig> expression is greater in an organ than in the others, aphid feeing from the organ incurs a stronger repression . these observations offer a convincing support for the function of atpp2-a <dig> in conferring the plant resistance shown as a repression in phloem-feeding activity of the insect. the results also indicate a defensive significance of ubiquitous organ-unspecific expression of pp <dig> genes in plants demonstrated previously  <cit>  and observed in this study .

the contribution of lectin-type phloem proteins, such as pp <dig>  to the pbd mechanism is believed owing to their functions as a physical barrier that prevents insects from phloem feeding  <cit> . a preceding event is the formation of the pp1-pp <dig> complex, which, however, has been demonstrated only in cucurbits, whereas, other plant families do not have any pp1-like protein  <cit> . the role of pp1-pp <dig> aggregation in the clogging of sieve plates has been the matter of long standing debates that have not yet been solved, and still remains a hypothesis that is beyond elucidating scopes of the present study. lectin-type phloem proteins take only a small proportion of phloem sap proteins that have potential of defensive significance in plants under attacks by phloem-feeding insects  <cit> . thus, lectin-type phloem proteins are only one of different pbd components and are not likely to play an entire role in plant resistance against attacks by the insects  <cit> . subtle differences in aphid population, the insect escape from leaf colonies, for example, between hrpnea-treated plants and control plants , between atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> and wt , and between pp2oetat and transgenic control plants , also imply components alternative to atpp2-a <dig> in impacting aphid behaviors while colonizing the plants. alternative defense components are further indicated by hrpnea-induced impediments to aphid feeding activities observed in the first-hour epg monitoring . however, we do not have evidence yet to show a proportion of atpp2-a1's contribution to resistance against m. persicae in arabidopsis plants either when treated with hrpnea or under the condition of atpp2-a <dig> overexpression.

moreover, atpp2-a <dig> is a member of the pp <dig> multigene family  <cit>  and atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> is one of atpp <dig> mutation alleles in arabidopsis  <cit> . the other atpp <dig> genes and atpp2-modified mutants seem not involved in hrpnea-induced repression of aphid feeding from the phloem . this result suggests that different members of the pp <dig> multigene family may have different functions in the plant. so far, atpp2-a <dig> is the only phloem protein demonstrated as a lectin with the ability to bind n-acetylglucosamine oligomers, and recombinant atpp2-a <dig> has been shown to affect weight gain in m. persicae nymphs in an artificial diet  <cit> . the induction of atpp2-a <dig> may be an indirect effect of the hrpnea treatment, which is multifunctional, inducing plant growth enhancement  <cit> , resistance to pathogens  <cit> , insects  <cit>  and drought stress  <cit> , and resistance-associated cell death  <cit> . these multiple effects have been determined separately; and so whether they are simultaneous is unclear. it is also unclear if other pp <dig> genes affect plant defenses rather than resistance. in several species of angiosperms, including arabidopsis, different pp <dig> genes are expressed in various organs during plant growth and development  <cit> . the ubiquitous organ-unspecific pp <dig> expression suggests that different pp <dig> genes may fulfill distinct functions at a special stage of plant growth and development. it is possible that a particular pp <dig> gene may have different functions depending on plant growth and development processes or depending on an immediate requirement for encountering with distinct challenges, such as attacks by insects and infection by pathogens. studies to test this hypothesis represent an interesting avenue for further research.

CONCLUSIONS
the hrpnea treatment has a deterrent effect on the phloem-feeding activity of m. persicae and the deterrent effect occurs in wt arabidopsis rather than the atpp2-a1/e/ <dig> mutant. the phloem-feeding activity can be also repressed as a result of atpp2-a <dig> overexpression. both sets of evidence support the conclusion that atpp2-a <dig> plays a role in arabidopsis resistance to the insect, particularly at the phloem-feeding stage. the accompanied change of aphid population in leaf colonies suggests that the function of atpp2-a <dig> is related to colonization of the plant and may have a broader importance for the plant-insect interaction.
