BACKGROUND
hedgehog  signaling is a pivotal signaling pathway in embryonic pattern formation, stem cell/cancer stem cell self-renewal, as well as induced pluripotent stem cells induction . an early study showed the hh-signaling inhibitor, cyclopamine, is enriched in veratrum californicum. this plant when consumed by pregnant sheep resulted in a midline differentiation defect in offspring . hh-signaling activation can lead to reprogramming by driving the expression of bmi <dig>  and the endogenous smoothened activator, oxysterol, can facilitate reprogramming  <cit> .

similar to other core development related pathways, deregulated hh-signaling due to the mutation or overexpression of pathway components and/or pathway ligand induces a variety types of cancers including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, bladder cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas cancer, head and neck cancer, lymphoma and non-small cell lung cancer . the pivotal role of hh-signaling in cancer development makes hh-signaling an attractive target for drug development . for example, the fda in  <dig> approved gdc- <dig>  an hh pathway inhibitor targeting smoothened for basal cell carcinoma treatment  <cit> .

hh signaling pathway is controlled by membrane proteins patched  and smo. when there is no ligand bound to ptch, ptch inhibits smo and keeps the downstream pathway inactivated. when ptch binds to hh ligand, the inhibition of ptch on smo is relieved and the hh-signaling pathway is activated. one of the broadly accepted mechanisms of hh-signaling target genes response is through the binding of gli family transcription factors to gli-binding sites in the regulatory sequence of hh regulated genes.

esrrb belongs to the nuclear receptor family . it is important in early embryo development as genomic knock out of esrrb is embryonic lethal due to the placenta deformation resulted from early differentiation of trophoblast stem cells  <cit> . recent research showed that esrrb was found to be a core reprogramming factor in inducing pluripotent stem cells . c-myc and klf <dig> of yamanaka factors  can be replaced by esrrb . esrrb was also reported to drive sox <dig> transcription to induce reprogramming in a single cell reprogramming system, revealing its central role in differentiation  <cit> . in addition, esrrb was found to play an important role in tumorigenesis in both in vitro and in vivo studies. it is down-regulated in prostate cancer and re-expression of esrrb in prostate cancer cells inhibited cancer cell proliferation through tumor suppressor cdkn1a/p <dig> induction  <cit> .

esrrb has been reported to be constitutively active in the absence of a ligand and this is supported by the evidence that esrrg, which shares over 80 % of its ligand binding domain with esrrb, has a transcriptional active conformation similar to e2-activated estrogen receptor . another explanation for this endogenous activity is that esrrb binds to an unknown endogenous ligand. the esrrb endogenous ligand hypothesis is supported by a report that culturing the cells with charcoal-stripped serum-containing medium can eliminate the transcriptional activity of esrrb on sfre/erre  <cit> .

knocking down esrrb in mouse embryonic stem cells was shown to affect the transcription of several hh-signaling pathway related genes, including gli <dig> and several wnt family members, indicating esrrb can potentially regulate hh driven gene expression  <cit> .

although gli transcription factors are relatively well known for transmitting hh-signaling to target genes, other factors mediating the hh-signaling activity are not well studied. for example, dner, fbn <dig>  hsd11b <dig> and brak are hh responsive genes in fetal prostate, but overexpression of gli <dig> or gli <dig> cannot affect the transcription of these  <dig> genes. however, the expression of active smo significantly increased the mrna concentration of these genes  <cit> , indicating there is at least one other mechanism accounting for the hh-signaling target gene transcription regulation.

due to the importance of both esrrb and hh-signaling in development and tumorigenesis, we hypothesized that esrrb can regulate hh-mediated transcription regulation and can serve as a regulator of hh-signaling target genes. by employing mrna profiling, we emphasized on the discovery of esrrb-regulated hh-signaling pathway-targeted genes and we report  <dig> genes that differentially respond to hh-signaling activation with esrrb present.

RESULTS
establishment of model cell lines
with the purpose of exploring whether esrrb can regulate hh-signaling targeted genes, we require a hh-responsive cell line. nih3t <dig> cells are commonly used as hh-responsive cell line. additionally, this cell line does not express esrrb, making it a good model that provides clean background of esrrb. to make the nih3t <dig> cells esrrb positive, we stably transfected esrrb into nih3t <dig> cells. the control vector transfected nih3t <dig> cells  have no esrrb expressed as mentioned before. in contrast, nih3t <dig> cells transfected with esrrb expression vector  have significantly increased esrrb protein concentration . compared to hek <dig> cells, which have endogenous esrrb expressed but lack of detectable hh-signaling response, the concentration of overexpressed esrrb in nih3t <dig> cells attained a physiological relevant concentration .fig.  <dig> characterization of model cell line. a expression of esrrb is confirmed by western blot. two replicates of esrrb transfected cells showed successful expression of esrrb protein and b 1 % hh-cm treated nih3t3-pc <dig>  showed increased concentration of gli <dig> protein



hedgehog signaling and esrrb regulated genes
to comprehensively characterize hh-signaling driving mrna changes in our system, we performed rna-seq analysis on the mrna isolated from nih3t3-pc <dig>  cells treated with vehicle control or 1 % hh ligand conditioned medium . hedgehog signaling pathway activation after hh-cm treatment was confirmed by significantly increased concentration of gli <dig> by westernblot . after the hh-cm treatment, we distinguished a total of  <dig>  altered mrnas . we collected published hh-signaling target gene sets generated by activating the hh-signaling pathway or gli transcription factor overexpression/knock-down in different model cell lines or tissues as ref. . for all of the non-redundant  <dig> genes from previous reports, we found  <dig> genes  that overlapped and another  <dig> new hh-signaling responsive genes .fig.  <dig> hh-signaling target genes. previously reported hh-signaling targeted genes were retrieved, only the genes that have more than twofold change are kept. the hh responsive genes from our assay were compared to the reported genes. venn diagram shows known hh-signaling genes with the hh-signaling responsive genes from our study were compared. the  <dig> overlapped genes  contain  <dig> hh-signaling up-regulated genes, and  <dig> down-regulated genes

we also surveyed the gene expression in nih3t3-esrrb cells.  <dig> genes were differentially expressed by esrrb expression . we compared esrrb-regulated genes to hh-induced genes, and found there are  <dig> genes, fabp <dig>  phex, ccl <dig>  tagln, aldh1a <dig>  lmod <dig>  cesla, igf <dig>  mafb, steap <dig>  pfkfb <dig> and hlf, which are up-regulated or down-regulated by either hh ligand or esrrb expression . the presence of these genes implies that hh-signaling and esrrb have functional overlaps in the regulation of these genes.

hh-signaling regulated genes in the presence of esrrb
next we treated nih3t3-esrrb cells with hh-cm to test gene response. esrrb expression with hh-cm treatment led to the largest amount of altered mrnas . supportively, spearman ranking correlation of all mrna profiles in four different conditions showed that each condition generates different mrna profiles, and correlation between hh-signaling pathway stimulation in the presence of esrrb expression and the no esrrb no hh stimulation control resulted in the lowest correlation coefficient in all pairwise comparisons .

theoretically, mrna profiling from four different conditions  generates six different differentially expression pairwise comparisons. since the comparison “hh-cm vs. esrrb” lacks of apparent interest, only five comparisons were left . every gene can be differentially expressed or not in any of the five given comparisons, therefore the comparison results can contain  <dig> different possibilities for each gene.

we defined a group of genes as “hh differentially response genes” as they response to hh-cm when there is no esrrb, while when esrrb is expressed, their response to hh-cm is further enhanced, depressed or lost. these genes will indicate esrrb can regulate hh-signaling pathway activity. to find hh differentially response genes, we used computer assisted gene sorting . the genes that fit our definition of “hh differentially response” were found in groups # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig> . using the indicated filters of fold change and rpkm value described in “methods”, we classified  <dig> genes that differentially respond to hh-cm treatment when esrrb is expressed . we confirmed the concentration of  <dig> highly expressed mrnas  by qpcr. pearson correlation coefficients between rna-seq and qpcr are at least  <dig>  . among tested mrnas, we found that when esrrb expressing cells are treated with hh-cm, sfrp <dig> , saa <dig> , prl2c <dig> , stmn <dig> , hp , hoxd <dig> , tubb4b , top2a  and dpt  had different mrna concentrations compared to hh-cm treatment in cells without esrrb. these differences are more likely due to a proportional additive effect of esrrb expression on altered baseline expression of the mrnas . in contrast, igf <dig> , pdcd <dig>  and smoc <dig>  lost their response to hh stimuli when esrrb was present . on the other hand, hsd11b <dig> , igfbp <dig>  and ogn  responded to hh-cm better when esrrb was expressed .fig.  <dig> quantitative pcr validation of the top  <dig> hedgehog signaling differentially responsive mrnas. hh-signaling differentially responsive genes as determined by rnaseq were confirmed by qpcr after nih3t3-pc <dig>  and nih3t3-esrrb cells are treated with hh-cm. each mrna concentration is normalized to housekeeping gene gapdh, and further normalized to that ratio in nih3t3-pc <dig> . y-axis represents relative fold change to no esrrb expressed no hh-cm treated control. a esrrb altered the hh-cm treatment response, due to a proportional additive effect from esrrb expression. when esrrb is expressed, the genetic response to hh is different than the condition without esrrb expressed, asterisk means p <  <dig>  and b genes respond to hedgehog signaling better when esrrb is expressed as well as genes losing hh response when esrrb is expressed, asterisk means p <  <dig>  number sign means “not statistically significant”



discussion
we distinguished  <dig> hh-signaling altered mrnas, among which are  <dig> known hh-signaling target genes and  <dig> newly discovered targets . most importantly, we characterized  <dig> genes that behave differently in response to hh ligand in the presence versus the absence of esrrb expression. this group of genes contains genes as igf <dig>  which respond to hh ligand treatment in the absence of esrrb, but when esrrb is expressed, hh ligand treatment cannot modify its transcription ; genes as hoxd <dig>  which has differential expression in response to hh stimulation when esrrb is expressed, though this different response comes from the effect of esrrb on basal level mrna concentration . we also observed genes like hsd11b <dig> , igfbp <dig> , and ogn , which indicate that esrrb and the hh-signaling pathway synergistically regulate these genes . these results demonstrated that esrrb is capable of interacting with hh-signaling pathway and potentially regulate hh-signaling downstream targets.

in the canonical hh-signaling pathway model, the activation of smo transmits the hh signal to gli transcription factor through the activation and inactivation of several pathway components including fused  <cit>  and suppressor of fused . however, the evidence that the transcription of hsd11b <dig>  fbn <dig> and brak respond to active smo transfection, but not gli <dig> or gli <dig> overexpression, indicates that smo activation has a gli-independent function in regulating gene expression  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, we listed all the transcription factors; chromatin remodeling factors and transcription co-factors that response to hh-signaling activation for future reference .

there are  <dig> genes  that respond to hh-signaling but only when esrrb is present  .  <dig> of them are up-regulated and  <dig> is down-regulated. this indicates esrrb has the ability to expand the transcription regulation of the hh-signaling pathway.

additionally, we found cortisol-cortisone converting enzyme hsd11b <dig> is correlated to hh-signaling activation from several reports in several model systems including fetal prostate, prostate cancer and embryonic fibroblast cell lines  <cit> , indicating cortisone converted from cortisol by hsd11b <dig> may account for part of the hh response gene profile. surprisingly, we found the classic glucocorticoid receptor  target gene, mt <dig>  along with  <dig> hh-signaling activation inhibits all other genes that have glucocorticoid response elements in their promoter regions, aldh1a <dig>  ankrd <dig> and ism <dig> are repressed in response to hh treatment . although esrrb does not change the expression of hsd11b <dig>  hh treatment with esrrb expression further increased the mrna concentration of hsd11b <dig>  accompanied by statistically significant alterations in concentrations of mt <dig>  aldh1a <dig>  ankrd <dig> and ism <dig> . our discovery strongly supports the idea that metabolite downstream of smo can also be mediators of hh-signaling responses. interestingly, gr overexpression and the activation of its target genes are strongly associated with anti-androgen treatment in prostate cancer therapy. gr target genes overlap with those of the androgen receptor and have been determined to be involved in antiandrogen treatment enzalutamide resistance  <cit> . inhibiting gr can restore enzalutamide sensitivity. esrrb’s activity in increasing hsd11b <dig> indirectly represses gr activity by potentially lowering the gr ligand cortisol, and thus activating esrrb may lead to better response of antiandrogen treatment and eliminate or postpone the resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provided useful reference marker genes for both hh-signaling and esrrb function. in addition, we also showed that esrrb has a role in the regulation of hh-signaling driven genes. the mechanism of hh-signaling was also expanded and a new layer of regulation of the hh pathway through esrrb was revealed, which may lead to improved treatments in hh-signaling driven diseases.
