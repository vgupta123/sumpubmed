BACKGROUND
genetic association studies using accessions of unknown pedigree are increasingly used in plant biology to identify genes explaining variation of traits. indeed, when compared to quantitative trait loci  analyses, these studies present the advantage of i) comparing concomitantly several alleles, ii) avoiding laborious population constructions and iii) exploiting the recombination events that have occurred over several generations  <cit> . for association studies, two approaches are possible base on the pattern of linkage disequilibrium  decline  <cit> . the first one is the candidate gene approach used for populations showing a rapid ld decline. the second one is the whole genome scan approach used for populations showing a slow ld decline  <cit> . these two approaches have been mainly used for analysing the genetic variability of a species through core collections. however, core collections are often genetically structured, thus leading to the detection of spurious associations between the polymorphism of markers and traits  <cit> . in order to circumvent the detection of spurious associations, different methods of data analysis have been developed that take into account the core collection's substructure  <cit> . nevertheless, the use of these methods allows only to study the intra-group variability while leaving the inter-group variability unexploited. ideally, the best plant material for association studies should be multi-allelic and without any substructure. this is the case in synthetic varieties, obtained after several panmictic multiplication generations, as shown by auzanneau  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports concerning association studies on synthetic plant varieties.

perennial ryegrass is the most sown forage and turf grass species in temperate climate and it is considered as a model for genomics in forage grasses  <cit> . in this species, like in all forage grasses, leaf length is an important trait affecting: i) vegetative yield  <cit> , ii) intake rate by dairy cows  <cit> , iii) plant survival under light competition conditions  <cit> . furthermore, it is a quantitative trait presenting a large variability and a high heritability  <cit> .

gai plays an important role in plant growth in several species by acting on the gibberellin signal  <cit> . mutants of this gene exist in various species, with dwarf or giant phenotypes. some dwarf mutants are osgai in rice  <cit> , rht-d <dig> in wheat  <cit>  and gai in arabidopsis  <cit>  and some giant mutants are slr <dig> in rice  <cit> , sln in barley  <cit> , and spy in arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, gai is mapped on linkage group  <dig> in rice  <cit> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=13699786&itemid=65&view=gbwithparts and on linkage group  <dig> in perennial ryegrass  <cit> . in addition, a qtl of leaf length was found on linkage group  <dig> in the region of gai  <cit> .

the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that an association study following the candidate gene approach is possible in synthetic varieties. this demonstration is based on an example of association between the gibberellic acid insensitive gene  polymorphism and leaf length polymorphism in 'herbie', a synthetic variety of perennial ryegrass  which presents no substructure and a short ld decline  <cit> . moreover, a core collection of perennial ryegrass was used in order to compare the phenotypic variability observed in 'herbie' against the variability present within the species.

methods
plant materials
we studied  <dig> plants of the 'herbie', a synthetic variety chosen because of its large variability and because ld decreases rapidly  <cit> . it was registered for the first time in  <dig> in france. we used the fourth generation of multiplication after the initial polycross in which  <dig> parents with  <dig> different origins were involved . seeds were sown in summer  <dig> in individual pots and stored above 10°c with at least  <dig> hours of light per day in a greenhouse in order to avoid vernalization until the 24th of february  <dig>  at this date, three clones per plant of one main tiller were produced for phenotyping in spring and one clone was produced for conservation. this last clone was used to produce three new clones in autumn. we used  <dig> ecotypes  chosen in an eurasian core collection in order to maximise the number of geographical origins . for convenience, we named these  <dig> ecotypes: core collection . seeds of this collection were sown in february  <dig> in individual pots and stored above 10°c with at least  <dig> hours of light per day in a greenhouse until the 30th of september  <dig>  at this date, three clones per plant of one main tiller were produced.

phenotyping
two experiments with three replicates each were conducted in a greenhouse: the first in spring  <dig> with herbie genotypes and the second in autumn  <dig> with herbie and cc genotypes. for each plant, one main tiller with its daughter tillers was planted at both periods. plants were watered and nitrogen supplied in order to avoid any stress. after a growth period of three weeks, plants were cut back. the third and fourth uncut leaves that appeared after this defoliation were measured on one tiller per plant, three times a week from the time of their emergence until they reached maturity. thermal time was calculated in growing degree days  using a simple sum of mean daily air temperature above 0°c taking the day of cutting as a starting point. the spring experiment began on march  <dig>   <dig> and finished on may  <dig>  however, the plants were followed until the end of july in order to confirm their vegetative state by the absence of floral stem. the autumn experiment began on october  <dig>   <dig> and finished on january  <dig>   <dig>  during the autumn experiment, the greenhouse was heated to maintain a temperature higher than 10°c.

final leaf length and leaf growth kinetics of the third and fourth uncut leaves were used as phenotypic character for the association analysis. in order to estimate the parameters of leaf growth kinetics, leaf length measurements for each plant and leaf against thermal time were fitted a function inspired from the euler integral  <cit> , such that:

  y=ym⋅1+te-tte-tm⋅t-tcte-tcte-tcte-tm 

for tc ≤ t ≤ te and tc ≤ tm < te. for t > te, eq.  <dig> is reduced to y = ym.

y  is the leaf length at any time, ym  is the final leaf length, tc the time when leaf growth starts , tm is the time at which the maximum leaf elongation rate is reached  and te is the time when leaf growth ends . model fitting was performed by using the nlin procedure of sas  <cit> . parameters were optimised using the levenberg-marquardt iterative method with automatic computation of the analytical partial derivatives  <cit> . seed values were as followed: tc ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> increasing by 1; tm ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  increasing by  <dig> and te ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  increasing by  <dig>  for each leaf, ym value was given by its maximum measured length. only plants with data on both the third and fourth leaves were analysed. an example of the eq.  <dig> fitted to data is given in figure  <dig> 

it follows from eq.  <dig> that the leaf elongation duration, led, expressed in thermal time units , is given by difference te - tc. however, because the fitting procedure yielded a few negatives values without physiological meaning for tc, and in order to avoid incoherent estimates of led, we numerically estimated the time at which any leaf was  <dig> mm long, and called this value tc <dig>  led was then estimated as:

  led=te-tc <dig> 

the first derivative of eq.  <dig> gives the leaf elongation rate, ler, at any time such that:

  dydt=ym⋅1+te-tte-tm⋅t-tcte-tcte-tcte-tm-1te-tm-t-tcte-tcte-tcte-tmte-tm 

the maximum leaf elongation rate, lermax, for each leaf was numerically obtained from eq.  <dig>  summarising, three variables were studied at two growing periods, spring and autumn: final leaf length , leaf elongation duration  and maximal leaf elongation rate .

dna extraction
for each herbie genotype, dna was extracted from  <dig> g of young leaf using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide  protocol  <cit> . dna quantity and quality of each sample were assessed on agarose gel.

genotyping
herbie plants were genotyped using one ssr marker per linkage group : b4d <dig> on lg <dig>  g02- <dig> on lg <dig>  g07- <dig> on lg <dig>  g03- <dig> on lg <dig>  pps <dig> on lg <dig>  g04- <dig> on lg <dig> and g02- <dig> on lg <dig>  <cit> . pcr reactions and separation of amplified products were performed as described for ssrs in barre  <cit> .

in order to amplify a fragment of the gai gene in lolim perenne l., degenerated primers were designed on an alignment between osgai http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=13699786&itemid=65&view=gbwithparts, rht-d1a , sln- <dig>  and dwarf <dig>  homologous gai gene in rice, wheat, barley and maize, respectively. a sequence of  <dig> bp in gai was amplified in the coding region . pcr reactions were set up in  <dig> μl volumes in 96-well pcr plates. each pcr reaction was performed with  <dig> ng of template dna,  <dig>  μm of each primer ,  <dig> mm mgso <dig>   <dig>  mm dntp,  <dig> u platinium taq dna polymerase high fidelity  and 1x pcr buffer . the amplifications were performed using a ptc <dig> thermal cycler with the following program:  <dig> min at 94°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> °c for  <dig> min and 68°c for  <dig> min, a final extension of  <dig> min at 68°c. pcr product of each sample was purified using qiaquick multiwell pcr purification kit  and sent to millegen, toulouse, france for direct sequencing of pcr products with the forward primer. the direct sequencing of the pcr products allowed to obtain the genotype of each snp but not the phase between snps. sequences of gai were obtained for  <dig> 'herbie' genotypes.

phenotypic data analysis
for 'herbie' and cc separately, analyses of variance were conducted using glm procedure  in sas  <dig>   <cit> . genotypic effect for each trait in each experiment was analysed using the model:

  yij=μ+ gi+ bj+ eij, 

with yij the value of genotype i taken in the block j, μ the population average, gi the effect of genotype i, bj the effect of the block j and eij the residual. for each trait, the broad sense heritability  was estimated as:

  h2 = σge2 σge2 + σe <dig> 

genotypic variance  and residual variance  were estimated using the varcomp procedure of sas with the method residual maximum likelihood algorithm reml  <cit> .

for 'herbie', a general analysis of variance taking into account the two periods of measurement  was also performed. plants used in spring and in autumn were independent clones, so the model used was:

  yijk=μ+ gi+ pk+ g ×pik+ bjpk + eijk 

with yijk the value of genotype i taken in the block j for the period k, μ the average of the population, gi the effect of genotype i , periodk the effect of period k , ik the effect of the interaction genotype × period , bj  the effect of block j nested in period k  and eijk the residual . g and p effects were tested using g × p interaction as residual and g × p interaction was tested using the model residuals.

for each trait, the broad sense heritability  was estimated as:

  h2 = σge2 σge2 +σgexperiod2+σe <dig> 

genotypic variance , genotype × period interaction variance  and residual variance  were estimated using the varcomp procedure of sas with the method reml  <cit> .

pearson's correlations between traits were calculated on the adjusted means by genotype  using the corr procedure of sas  <cit> .

population substructure analysis
structure software version  <dig>   <cit>  was used to estimate the substructure of 'herbie'. the length of the burn-in period was  <dig>  and the number of mcmc replications after the burn-in was  <dig>  for each. the given number of populations  was varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  computing was performed  <dig> times for each k value.

gai polymorphism analysis
the identity of amplified sequences was checked using a blastn on ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/. the sequences were aligned and manually checked using staden package  <dig> . <dig> http://staden.sourceforge.net/. data were formatted using tritipol http://bioweb.ensam.inra.fr/tritipol/ and refseqv <dig> . haplotype phase between snps was estimated using phase  <dig>  software  <cit> . haplotype number and haplotypic genotype for each individual were inferred.

ld analysis
the r <dig> values of gametic ld between snps were determined according to hill and robertson  <cit>  on the haplotypes inferred by phase using dnasp software  <cit> . genotypic ld between each pair of snps or ssrs was calculated using genepop software  <cit> .

association study analysis
the association study was carried out independently for each period of measurement by using adjusted means per genotype. three different approaches were used to test the association between the polymorphism of gai and leaf elongation parameters:

1) a multiple linear regression analysis between leaf elongation parameters and snps. the stepwise method was used to fit a linear model of the general form:

  yi= β0+ β1x1+ β2x2+ … + βnxn+ εi 

where yi is any dependent variable ;x <dig>  x <dig> ..., xn are the independent variables , β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> ..., βn, the regression coefficients and εi the error term. it was computed with the stepwise option of reg procedure in sas  <cit> .

2) a scheffe's multiple comparison analysis for orthogonal linear contrasts  <cit>  in order to test the effect of presence versus absence of each not rare haplotype . it was computed with the glm procedure in sas  <cit>  following the model given by eq.  <dig> 

3) a tree-scanning analysis of the phenotypic data against the haplotype tree. it was performed with treescan  <dig>  http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/treescan.html <cit> . this method allows testing the mean difference of a trait between two groups obtained for each branch of a phylogenetic tree. haplotypes present more than  <dig> times in the population were used to construct a phylogenetic tree with phylip  <dig>  http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html using maximum parsimony. in the execution of the treescan program the number of permutations was  <dig>  <dig>  and the minimum class size was set to five.

RESULTS
phenotypic analysis
llength, lermax and led were determined for  <dig> plants of 'herbie' in spring and autumn and on  <dig> plants of a perennial ryegrass core-collection  in autumn. three replicates were used. genetic effect was highly significant for all traits for both herbie and the cc and for both growing periods. heritability was high for llength and lermax and medium for led . for all traits, a significant genotype × period interaction was detected in 'herbie' and moderate heritabilities were found for both periods . the variability of 'herbie' was as high as the variability of the 'cc' . correlation values between variables are presented in table  <dig> for 'herbie' including both spring and autumn measurements. for the 'cc', correlations between variables during autumn were highly significant  between llength and both lermax  and led , but not significant  between lermax and led. in both 'herbie' and the 'cc', leaf length was significantly correlated to both lermax and led with higher values for lermax. on the other hand, lermax and led were not or were weakly correlated. leaf parameters measured in spring were correlated to those measured in autumn with a stronger correlation for llength and lermax than for led.

population substructure analysis
results from the analysis with structure software, using one single sequence repeat  marker per linkage group, showed no evidence of substructure in 'herbie' . furthermore, as expected between unlinked markers in a population presenting no substructure, no significant genotypic ld was detected between pairs of ssrs.

gai polymorphism
twenty snps were detected in the  <dig> bp gai sequence of 'herbie' . this corresponds to an average of  <dig> bp between two consecutive snps. among these snps, six presented rare alleles with frequencies lower than 10% and one  was not synonymous. phase software revealed the existence of  <dig> haplotypes . nine of them were present in more than  <dig> genotypes.

the frequencies refer to the first  allele of each locus presented in column polymorphism

the nine most abundant haplotypes are indicated in bold. in these haplotypes, snp <dig> is underlined

ld analysis
gametic ld decreased rapidly with the distance . indeed, r <dig> values became lower than  <dig>  beyond  <dig> bp. genotypic ld results were in agreement with gametic ld results . for distances lower than  <dig> bp, more than 35% of snp pairs presented a significant ld . nonetheless, beyond  <dig> bp, snp pairs did not present any significant deviation from linkage equilibrium.

association study between gai and leaf growth parameters
three statistical methods were used to detect the association between the phenotypic polymorphism and gai polymorphism.

the first method was a stepwise regression between leaf parameters and the  <dig> snps of gai found in 'herbie' . the results are summarized in table  <dig>  it showed that, depending on the leaf parameter, three to six snps explained 8-14% of the phenotypic variance . one snp, named snp <dig>  appeared to be particularly interesting since it explained 2-5% of each parameter variance in both spring and autumn. it explained a difference of leaf length equal to  <dig> mm, for average leaf length of  <dig> mm, in spring and a difference equal to  <dig> mm, for an average of  <dig> mm, in autumn. it is noteworthy that the highest values of leaf growth parameters were obtained for heterozygous individuals showing a superdominance effect at snp <dig> 

results of stepwise regressions for leaf length , leaf elongation rate  and leaf elongation duration  in spring and autumn on 'herbie'. are indicated: significant snps , the part of the phenotypic variation explained by each snp , the part of the phenotypic variation explained by all snps , the average value of each trait and the genotype effect compared to the average

* 1/ <dig> and 2/ <dig> indicate the two homozygous classes and 1/ <dig> indicates the heterozygous class

a pr > f is the is the probability of having a tabulated f value at least as extreme as the calculated one

the second method consisted of a scheffé analyses in order to test the effect of presence versus absence of the different haplotypes on each trait . the comparisons of means for the significant contrasts are presented in table  <dig> 

p-values  of scheffé analyses for the effect of presence  versus absence  of a haplotype for leaf length , maximum leaf elongation rate  and leaf elongation duration  in spring and autumn on 'herbie'. the nine most abundant haplotypes were tested. the numbers of samples including the haplotype  or not  are indicated. the values below  <dig>  are in bold

the third method was a tree-scanning analysis of associations between haplotypes and leaf parameters. the haplotype tree is presented in figure  <dig> and the results of the treescan analysis is presented in table  <dig>  the strongest effect of phylogenetic groups on all traits was on lermax in spring between the group of haplotypes:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the group of haplotypes:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  these two groups can be separated by polymorphism at snp <dig> . this separation had also an effect on llength in spring. an effect was found on lermax in spring and in autumn between the group of haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  and the group including all the other haplotypes. these two groups can be separated by snp <dig> and snp <dig> which were in complete linkage disequilibrium when considering the nine most abundant haplotypes . for all tests, the corrected permutational p-values after monotonicity were higher than  <dig> .

discussion
phenotypic analyses
the phenotypic variability of 'herbie' was very high and similar to the one observed in a core collection . this high variability of 'herbie' was also observed on molecular data  <cit> . such variability can be explained by the high number of parents  in the initial polycross. this diversity shows that selection should be efficient even within a variety.

high heritability values were observed for leaf length and maximum leaf elongation rate  within each period of measurements. lower heritabilities were observed when taking into account both spring and autumn periods. these results are in accordance with values from different studies in forage grasses  <cit> . the significant genotype × period interaction indicates that the response of genotypes to environmental conditions did not follow the same trajectories. this is reflected by the correlation values between spring and autumn leaf length or lermax which were only moderately high . as previously observed by ghesquière  <cit> , leaf elongation duration  had a lower heritability. this could be partly explained by a lack of precision in the led estimates since no measurement could be performed at the beginning of leaf growth, during the hidden phase.

spring and autumn leaf length averages in 'herbie' were not significantly different. however, these similar leaf lengths were not reached by the same dynamics of leaf growth. it was observed a higher lermax and a shorter led in spring than in autumn, that could be explained by higher temperatures in spring  than in autumn .

the correlation between leaf length and lermax was higher than the one between leaf length and led in spring and in autumn for both 'herbie' and the core collection. similar results were observed by ghesquière  <cit>  in a collection of late heading perennial ryegrass ecotypes with correlations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  between adult leaf length and average leaf elongation rate and led, respectively. it could be explained by the fact that at the beginning of leaf growing process there is a long period of slow growth with no significant effect on the final leaf length. however, depending on the plant material, the impact of lermax and led on final leaf length could differ greatly . since these two traits appear poorly correlated, a given final leaf length can result from different combinations of a wide range of led and ler values.

gai polymorphism
the density of snps was very high but comparable to that obtained in other genes in perennial ryegrass, bearing in mind that this parameter is highly variable over the genome  <cit> . nevertheless, the number of haplotypes observed in 'herbie' is relatively weak compared to the haplotype numbers expected. knowing that there were  <dig> individuals in the initial polycross of the 'herbie' variety and considering that they were unrelated,  <dig> haplotypes were expected under the assumption of total absence of ld. however, only  <dig> haplotypes were observed, and among those,  <dig> had a frequency lower than 2%. this implies that the parents of 'herbie' were related and some haplotypes were highly selected.

substructure and ld analyses
based on the analysis of  <dig> plants, we confirmed that herbie presents no substructure and that ld decay was very short in the gai gene as reported by auzanneau  <cit>  based on the analysis of  <dig> plants. the absence of substructure and this rapid decline of ld with the genetic distance in herbie were expected owing to the high number of parents and the variability in the initial polycross of the variety. moreover, ld decline in perennial ryegrass is generally rapid and become not significant beyond about  <dig> kb due to its outbreeding reproductive system  <cit> . this rapid ld decline and the absence of substructure allowed a "candidate gene" approach in this genome region  <cit> 

association study between gai and leaf growth
this study in the highly diverse variety herbie revealed that the gai gene had a significant effect on leaf growth parameters: leaf length, maximum leaf elongation rate and leaf elongation duration, in both spring and autumn growing periods. this gene co-localized with qtl of lamina length found in spring and with qtl of leaf length and ler found in winter on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> . one snp, snp <dig>  explained a part of the variability of all leaf length parameters in both spring and autumn. it was also found significant in the tree-scanning analysis. however this snp does not induce an amino acid variation. considering the rapid ld decline, the mutation responsible for leaf growth variability in 'herbie' should be very close and highly linked to snp <dig>  in arabidopsis, wheat and maize, mutants responsible for dwarf phenotypes present a deletion on the della domain  <cit> . an association study on the whole gene sequence would be of interest to find the causal mutation. the possible association between the variation of the snp <dig> and the variation of leaf length in 'herbie' only by chance without any physical link between the snp <dig> and the causal mutation  can be considered. this would imply that the snp <dig> and a causal mutation elsewhere on the genome were in linkage disequilibrium. this ld can't come from a population substructure as we demonstrated the absence of structure in the population. it could come from a drift due to the sampling of a limited number of individuals  but this seems unlikely regarding the high significance of the snp <dig> on leaf length. nevertheless, in order to test the real physical association between the snp <dig> and a causal mutation for leaf length, it would be interesting to create populations with gg or cc at the snp <dig> and to compare their leaf length.

a superdominance effect was found for all leaf growth parameters on snp <dig> except for lermax in autumn. this could be due to two very close snps with dominant effects with the favourable alleles in repulsion. this superdominance effect could also be explained by a real complementary effect of both alleles at a single snp. whatever the origin of the superdominance effect, this observation should have consequences on breeding strategies. the objective of molecular assisted selection could thus be to associate two alleles instead of fixing favourable alleles.

the results of the three methods used for the association study were all in agreement. nevertheless, the maximum number of associations was found with the regression analysis using snps which seems more effective since it explained a higher level of phenotypic variance than the other two methods. a possible explanation is that haplotypes cumulate alleles of several snps which could have opposite effects leading to a decrease in the difference between haplotypes.

in the present study a single panmictic population, a synthetic variety, allowed us to detect a strong association between a snp polymorphism and a trait. in the study of skot  <cit>  a strong association was detected between one snp: <dig> of the lphd <dig> gene and heading date . nine populations of perennial ryegrass, each including  <dig> plants, were used. despite an overall association of snp: <dig> and hd, this association was more or less strong depending on the population. this shows that ld varies between populations leading to associations in some populations but not in others. regarding this observation, it would be of interest to perform association studies within panmictic populations rather than to use individuals from several populations. indeed, different associations can be found depending on the population used.

unlike the findings of thornsberry  <cit>  in maize, we did not observe an effect of gai gene on heading date in 'herbie' . however, we studied only a small part of the gene.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we showed that i) association studies can be performed following the "candidate gene" approach on a synthetic variety with a wide genetic basis, and ii) the detection of association between phenotypic polymorphism and sequence polymorphism was more powerful using snp polymorphism than haplotypic polymorphism. these observations could impact the way of using molecular information in plant breeding, in particular in outbreeding species. indeed, the genetic basis of important traits could be directly detected in breeder populations and molecular markers used to increase favourable alleles.
