BACKGROUND
one of the basic requirements for the development of higher taxa in animal phylogeny was the acquisition of complex gene regulatory networks. besides alternative splicing, rna interference  is recognized to be one of the key regulators of the post-transcriptional eukaryotic gene expression. animal mirnas  belong to the class of endogenous small interfering non-coding rnas. they direct the regulation of gene expression by binding partially complementary target sites in the 3' untranslated regions  of mrnas  <cit> . it was noticed early that especially the 5' end of mirnas is important for the binding of target mrnas  <cit> , in particular nucleotides 2- <dig>  sometimes referred to as the 'seed'  <cit> . mirnas have been identified in numerous vertebrates including primates, rodents and fish but also in invertebrates e.g. worms and flies as well as in viruses  <cit> . a large number of mirnas is highly conserved among related species indicating their role in crucial cellular processes such as stress adaption and hormone signaling  <cit> . during evolution more and more mirna families were added to metazoan genomes and once incorporated into regulatory networks, few shifts of the mature sequence have occurred. these observations led to the hypothesis that morphological complexity is in part directed by the acquisition of new mirna families during animal phylogeny  <cit> . while several hundreds of human mirnas are known, limited data sets are available for other species. according to mirbase release  <dig>   <cit> , the number of noted human and murine mirnas exceeds  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. beside these species, the coverage of the mirnaome from other mammals e.g. pig remains scarce. to date  <dig> porcine mirna sequences have been deposited in mirbase release  <dig>  and recently  <dig> novel and conserved mature mirnas were identified in a porcine tissue pool while only  <dig> precursor molecules were identified  <cit> . another recent study also based on searching for conserved mirnas resulted in  <dig> identified precursors in swine skeletal muscle  <cit> .

besides their importance in livestock production, pigs are of particular biomedical interest because of their phylogenetic relation to humans. in this context and because human intestinal samples are limited and valuable tissue is only available after ileostomies or colonoscopies, rodents have been introduced as common models for human gastrointestinal studies. but limitations like differences in intestinal morphology, enteric microbiota, body mass, life span and different food intake raise concerns about the suitability of the rodent model. obvious differences between mammals concerning the degree of intestinal maturation at birth should be taken into account. rodents are born after a short gestation period with a premature intestinal tract. in contrast, pigs are born after a long gestation showing advanced intestinal development at birth. therefore, pigs are closer to human intestinal development during fetal and neonatal periods  <cit> . in addition, the porcine anatomy and the physiology of digestion are very comparable to those of humans  <cit>  favoring the piglet model as a suitable animal model to investigate human gastrointestinal diseases  <cit>  and to understand signaling pathways related to mucosal development. for example, a piglet model of dextran sodium sulfate -induced colitis was used to successfully evaluate mucosal immunity and therapeutic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease   <cit> . apart from crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis  is one of the major idiopathic ibd. interestingly, wu and colleagues have recently shown that mirnas are dysregulated in humans with uc. while three mirnas showed significantly decreased expression, eight others were significantly increased in patients with uc  <cit> . however, to better investigate and understand regulatory networks of such exemplified diseases in the porcine model, a deeper coverage of the intestinal mirnaome is needed. recently, we have reported  <dig> novel porcine mirnas after introduction of a new concatameric cloning strategy  <cit> . deep sequencing enables the immediate generation of a vast number of sequence data. as a proof of principle that deep sequencing can be used to discover hundreds of novel mirnas from a single sample, we have introduced a method based on downstream sequence analysis using the algorithm mirdeep to detect ~  <dig> previously unannotated canine mirnas  <cit> . thus, next generation sequencing methods provide the opportunity for detecting mirna molecules at an unrivalled depth. in this study, we have applied deep sequencing followed by bioinformatical analysis of the acquired data to discover novel porcine mirnas from a pool of porcine intestinal samples. after identification of novel porcine mirnas including their precursors, the intestinal mirnaome was deciphered along the entire porcine intestinal tract including duodenum, proximal and distal jejunum, ileum, ascending and transverse colon.

RESULTS
deep sequencing unravels the expression of more than  <dig> potential porcine intestinal mirnas
we have applied deep sequencing to analyze the expression of regulating mirnas in the porcine intestine. for this purpose, a total rna pool of samples from distal jejunum and ileum of four piglets at the age of  <dig> days was established in equal shares.

in total  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated by deep sequencing of the small rna fraction . of those  <dig> , <dig> reads mapped to the pig genome perfectly. after specific selection  of eligible reads, mirna predictions were made using mirdeep, an algorithm to identify known and novel mirnas in deep sequencing data. mirdeep uses the mapped reads as guidelines for excising potential mirna hairpins from the genome. each hairpin is assigned a score, which reflects the probability that the hairpin is a genuine mirna precursor  <cit> . altogether,  <dig> were scored by mirdeep and chosen for further analysis, of which  <dig> were known mirnas .  <dig> hairpins were reported by mirdeep passing the cut-off score of - <dig>  of which  <dig> were estimated to be false positives, representing a signal to noise ratio of  <dig> . hairpin forming precursors  predicted by mirdeep exhibited low minimal free energies  ranging between - <dig>  and - <dig>  kcal/mol . the hairpin structures of eight precursor sequences are exemplified in figure  <dig> . among them were novel porcine mirnas  that possessed low or no conservation among other mammals but also four putative viral mirnas. because of the imperfect coverage of the pig genome assembly an additional search of conserved mammalian mirnas was performed. this approach yielded  <dig> porcine mature mirna candidates that did not map to the pig genome assembly and  <dig> mature mirna candidates that did map to the genome but had not been reported by mirdeep. blast searches against known mirnas  revealed  <dig> novel and conserved mature mirnas .

microarray experiments verify the expression of  <dig> novel mirnas
we have used the newly identified potential mirna sequences as well as known porcine and human mirna sequences to perform the first mirnaome analysis along the entire intestinal tract of a mammalian organism by using customized microarrays . this approach served also as verification of mirdeep predicted data. pooled samples from different intestinal loci  of four healthy  <dig> days old piglets were subjected to mirna microarray analysis. miame-compliant data relative to the applied platforms as well as processed and raw sample data were submitted to the ncbi geo repository  <cit>  and accession-numbers were assigned . for selection of highly reliable expression data and validation of the mirdeep prediction, we decided to apply a stringent selection strategy. the predicted mature as well as relating star sequences were synthesized in seven replicates on a febit biochip. after background subtraction and variance stabilizing normalization  of array data, only expression values of mature sequences higher than  <dig> were considered. this threshold is chosen as a cut-off for selecting bona fide signals. from the eliminated data also those were considered with a signal intensity of the star sequence higher than  <dig>  in our microarray experiments, we detected  <dig> mirnas showing consistently higher signal intensities of their star strands compared with the predicted mature molecules . after choosing this high level of quality assurance by simultaneous detection of the mature as well as star sequence we have verified the expression of  <dig> mirdeep predicted mature mirnas. we considered another  <dig> sequences as genuine mirnas, which showed no signal on microarrays but were conserved among animals. consequently, we have identified  <dig> apparently novel porcine mirnas out of  <dig> mirdeep predicted sequences . as mentioned above  <dig> predicted precursors possessed a score above the cut-off - <dig>  of which an estimated  <dig> were false positives. according to the microarray experiments, we have identified  <dig> false positive mirnas representing a signal to noise ratio of  <dig>  and underlining the robustness of the mirdeep prediction.

by regarding also the identified conserved mature mirnas not covered by mirdeep and the known porcine sequences deposited in mirbase, we have verified the expression of  <dig> mirnas expressed in the porcine intestine including  <dig> apparently novel porcine mirnas  corresponding to 61% . taken together, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were found to be expressed in different intestinal loci, while the percentage of novel porcine mirna varied between  <dig> and 68% depending on the locus analyzed .

a high number of analyzed mirnas showed overlapping expression in morphologically related intestinal loci shown by the venn diagrams in figure 3a-c. there was an overlapping expression of  <dig> mirnas in distal jejunum and ileum  corresponding to 71% and 70% of totally expressed mirnas in distal jejunum and ileum, respectively . consistent expression was also determined in both colonic loci,  <dig> mirnas were expressed both in transverse and ascending colon representing 65% and 67% of regarding totally expressed mirna . for comparative expression analysis among the intestinal loci, we have applied the strategy of using a common reference representing a pool of all samples. as shown in figure 3d,  <dig> mirnas showed ubiquitous expression in all loci including the common reference. for evaluation of comprehensive microarray data and to allow for comparison of spatial mirna expression, we have calculated the log ratios of those  <dig> mirnas for every locus and their counterparts from the common reference. in consistence with the venn diagrams, hierarchical clustering of both genes and samples revealed similar expression profiles in morphologically related intestinal tissues. both colonic loci clustered together, they formed a superior group with the distal jejunum and ileum while duodenum and proximal jejunum clustered together . at the gene level we have identified several clusters, while five of which were of particular interest. cluster i  shown in the hierarchically clustered heatmap harbored only mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which were highly expressed in the proximal parts of the small intestine . consequently, we searched for predicted targets using targetscan  <cit>  and subjected the outcome to pathway analysis using the tool david  <cit>  and considering the affected biocarta and kegg pathways. this revealed that these mirnas seem to have an impact mainly on pathways that determine cellular differentiation and proliferation such as tgf-beta, erbb, insulin and mtor signaling pathways. cluster ii consisted of mir- <dig> and mdm <dig> showing increased levels of expression in both colonic loci. the downstream analysis indicated that cell cycle determining pathways such as cyclin e and e2f destruction pathways but also cell to cell adhesion signaling were affected by these mirnas. cluster iii harbored mirnas that show ubiquitously high expression along the intestine. two other clusters of mirnas showed a decreased or increased expression in distal jejunum and ileum, respectively . the first one harbored known mirnas such as mir-26a, mir-27a, mir-125b, mir-130a and mir- <dig> but the latter was mainly composed of novel and not conserved mirnas. the mirnas outlined in cluster v have predominant impact on intracellular signaling pathways such as mapk/erk, notch and wnt signaling but also on mets affected macrophage differentiation and p <dig> signaling pathway.

in addition four mirnas were identified, which partly matched known viral mirnas. mdm <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> may represent novel porcine specific viral mirnas being partly identical to hsv1-mir-h <dig>  rrv-mir-rr1- <dig>  mdv2-mir-m18-5p and mdv2-mir-m <dig>  respectively . while mdm <dig> and mdm <dig> were expressed along the entire intestine, mdm <dig> was only detected in proximal jejunum and the expression of mdm <dig> was below the detection limit .

in our microarray approach we also included known human mirnas obtained from mirbase  <dig>  allowing also a heterologous approach between human probes and porcine mirnas. after selecting the mirnas being expressed in all loci including the common reference, we have identified  <dig> mirnas, which were chosen for clustering analysis as described above. interestingly, there was consistent clustering of intestinal samples, as described for the homologous approach above. all related intestinal parts clustered together, while in concordance to the homologous approach the colon and the distal parts of the small intestine formed a superior cluster . conserved mirnas showed comparable expression patterns and clustering revealed consistency between both approaches, e.g. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were combined in the same cluster and together with mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and let-7d showed increased expression in colon compared with other loci . after selecting mirnas with consistent signal detection i.e. with overlapping detection in the homologous and heterologous approach ,  <dig> mirnas were selected for correlation analysis between both approaches. the pearson correlation coefficients were calculated depending on the locus and were between  <dig>  in duodenum and  <dig>  in ascending colon . the global pearson correlation coefficient calculated from all loci was  <dig>  . the calculated local as well as general coefficients pointed to high linearity between both approaches .

correlation coefficients were calculated between heterologous hybridizations  and homologous hybridizations .

identified porcine mirnas are chromosomally duplicated and partly clustered
after comparative expression analysis among the intestinal loci, we were interested if and how the identified mirna precursors are organized within the porcine genome.

therefore, we firstly sorted out only mirdeep predicted novel precursors whose expression was validated by microarray experiments in any of the intestinal parts or which were conserved among animals, respectively. thereby, we have identified  <dig> apparently novel porcine mirnas . to find out the genomic location and organization of the identified precursors, sequences were blasted against the porcine high throughput genomic sequence  database at ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/blastgen/blastgen.cgi?taxid= <dig>  as shown in figure 2b, the chromosomal location of 86% of the identified mirnas was determined. most of the precursors were located on the chromosomes  <dig> followed by chromosome  <dig>  and only 1% was organized in the chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the chromosomal location of 14% of the precursors was not determined. detailed information on genomic organization of the identified mirnas is given in the additional file  <dig>  in addition to the identified genomic duplications and clustering of mirnas, we were able to predict alternative precursors for the same mature mirna . interestingly, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were both duplicated and located on chromosomes x and  <dig> and clustered within a  <dig> bp chromosomal region. alignment of duplicated chromosomal regions revealed 100% identity of the nucleotide sequence . the secondary structure analysis of this chromosomal site including both precursors revealed another hairpin structure, which was not covered by mirdeep and possessed the conserved seed of mir- <dig> . the precursor of mir- <dig>  for example, was located on chromosome x and was clustered with the known mirna ssc-mir-374a within a distance of  <dig> bp, while no obvious hairpin was detected in between . as shown in table  <dig>  joining hairpin forming precursors were predicted for several mirnas. for example, two alternative hairpin forming precursors were predicted for the mirna with internal ids mdm <dig> and mdm <dig> . both possessed low mfe  and were located within a fragment of  <dig> bp on chromosome  <dig> and may represent two alternative dicer substrates .

the chromosomal organization of selected mirnas that were identified by mirdeep either showing valid expression in microarray experiments or being conserved was determined by blasting against the porcine htgs database at ncbi. identified genomic duplications, clustering and alternatively predicted precursors are shown. abbreviation: nd, not determined

discussion
pigs represent an important model for biomedical research to study human disease, development or nutrition. as introduced, the porcine gastrointestinal model provides several benefits over other animal models such as rodents. like humans, pigs are omnivorous implying very similar principles of the physiology of digestion and associated metabolic processes  <cit> . in mammals, the principal internal interaction between host and microorganisms or other antigens takes place in the intestinal tract. because of the morphological as well as physiological similarities particularly the piglet intestinal model is suitable to study gastrointestinal disease both in adults and infants  <cit> . it is known that cellular differentiation is governed by mirnas, for example it was recently shown that mir- <dig> directs the intestinal development in danio rerio  <cit> . moreover, monzo and colleagues found a correlation between the mirna expression profiles in human embryonic colonic mucosa and colorectal carcinoma. they found that the mir-17- <dig> cluster regulates cell proliferation pointing to the important role both in embryonic intestinal development and aberration of this epithelium  <cit> .

in our study a model of weanling piglets at the age of  <dig> days has been used. as we have discussed in an earlier study, there are two waves of antigen exposure in a newborn mammalian organism: directly after birth and at weaning. the second is rated as an important period in the intestinal development that is characterized by massive exposure to food and microbial antigens followed by architectural reorganization of the small intestine  <cit> . it was reviewed that beneath the changes along the horizontal intestinal axis pronounced changes occur in the vertical axis  during intestinal development. this represents a gradient replacement of the cells of an immature phenotype with other cells that differ e.g. in transport functions. these changes are related to the rate of cellular turnover because there is a slow cell replacement at birth while an increase takes place at weaning together with a decrease of enterocyte lifespan  <cit> . since mirnas are key regulators of cellular proliferation and differentiation, we hypothesize that the weaning phase is accompanied by massive regulation of specific mirnas governing the reorganization of the intestinal cellular response. moreover, the randomization of our approach by using rna pools of four piglets minimizes the bias in the mirnaome by possible biological variation.

in an earlier study, we have identified several porcine mirnas applying a novel cloning strategy based on synthesis of concatamers  <cit>  followed by expression profiling using a mirna specific quantitative pcr approach  <cit> . here a more straight forward approach was chosen based on new technologies to generate comprehensive data in a less time consuming manner. the validation of sequence data by means of customized microarray expression profiling allowed us not only to verify the generated porcine data, but also to include known human mirna sequences. since mirna sequence data are not available in depth for all mammals, heterologous hybridization approaches may be the only alternative to perform expression studies in less common species. supporting results from an earlier study  <cit>  and the remarkable correlations between the heterologous  and the homologous approach presented here, show that in phylogenetically close species the heterologous approach may be considered as a suitable alternative. however, the high number of novel and potentially porcine specific mirnas discovered in this study argues against a heterologous approach.

we have identified several genomic clusters one of those including the porcine mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  braun and colleagues  <cit>  have reported that these mirnas also belong to a human cluster, which is induced by the tumor suppressor p <dig>  it was shown that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are highly expressed in normal colon tissue while their expression is dramatically decreased in colon cancer. they conclude that these mirnas seem to suppress cancerogenesis through p <dig> accumulation and cell cycle arrest. in another recent study, hino et al.  <cit>  published that human mir- <dig> expression is induced by the transcription factor hnf-1α promoting intestinal epithelial differentiation. they identified two genomic clusters in the human genome either encoding mir-194- <dig> and mir- <dig> on chromosome  <dig> or encoding mir-194- <dig> and mir- <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to human, both porcine clusters are 100% identical encoding only mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  in our microarray experiments, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> showed the same expression pattern along the entire intestine, underlining the fact that both may derive from one transcript. however, the expression was highest in duodenum and proximal jejunum compared with other loci. these results are in good concordance with the data derived from human studies. on the one hand, reorganization of the intestine at weaning is associated with high proliferative activity contributing to an increase in crypt depth and villus height  <cit> . consistently, in distal parts of the intestine we determined diminished expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  respectively pointing to a higher proliferative activity in the distal parts. on the other hand, in the proximal parts of the small intestine particularly a high level of differentiation rather than proliferation takes place at weaning in order to adapt to the new nutritional conditions by acquiring new transport functions. the pathway analysis revealed mainly cell signaling networks to be affected that control differentiation e.g. the mtor pathway. in addition to regulating cell growth and proliferation, this pathway was reported to promote epithelial morphogenesis and differentiation in vertebrates  <cit> . consequently, increased expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in duodenum and proximal jejunum are probably involved in promoting epithelial differentiation in order to replace cells that differ e.g. in transport functions.

our microarray experiments moreover revealed mirna clusters expressed ubiquitously in all intestinal loci and others, which are locus specific. the gene cluster composed of mdm <dig> and mir- <dig> belongs to the latter and was identified to be upregulated in both colonic loci. the pathway analysis of this particular cluster indicated an impact of these two mirnas on cell cycle regulation. accordingly, mir- <dig> expression was recently shown to be directly linked to cell cycle rate. decembrini and colleagues showed that mir- <dig> is one of four mirnas that are highly expressed in fast cycling retinal progenitors in xenopus governing cell fate decision and developmental timing  <cit> . in addition to mir- <dig> and mdm <dig>  mir-19b, mir-23a, mir- <dig>  mir-30b possessed increased expression in colon compared with other parts of the porcine intestine. interestingly, in another epithelial cell model it was shown that mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> contribute to lower cell growth when inhibited  <cit> . these mirnas seem to be part of a colonic cellular network promoting physiological cell turnover in colon during weaning as discussed above. the porcine intestinal lymphoid tissue comprises two types of peyer's patches: multiple discrete patches in the jejunum and a long and continuous patch in the ileum  <cit> . interestingly, porcine mirnas highly expressed in these loci  may target immune cell differentiation shown by pathway analysis, e.g via targeting the notch and wnt signaling. it was recently shown that activation of notch signaling promotes differentiation of conventional dendritic cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells via activation of the wnt pathway  <cit> . the mentioned mirnas seem also to influence mucosal innate immunity by affecting the anti-proliferative functions of pe-1/mets in macrophage differentiation. the concerted action of emphasized mirnas and other identified local clusters described here represents the first milestone to understand the complex gene regulation in the developing intestine of a mammal with a close phylogenetical relation to humans.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we report the first comprehensive mirna expression analysis along the entire intestine of a mammal. a considerable number of the reported mirnas expressed in the porcine intestine show low conservation among mammals. these mirnas may be regarded as porcine specific. on the other hand, the reported mirnas may share orthologs in other mammals such as human still to be discovered. our microarray experiments along the entire intestine revealed different clusters of mirnas, which are expressed in a locus specific manner. this underlines their specific regulative impact on locus specific cellular processes. future research will highlight distinct functions of the identified mirnas in biomedical research deciphering cellular reorganization during juvenile intestinal development.
