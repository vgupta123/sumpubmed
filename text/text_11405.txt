BACKGROUND
mutations of the superoxide dismutase  <dig>  gene cause degeneration primarily at the level of the spinal cord motor neurone pool and this detrimental effect may be accelerated by environmental stressors. sod <dig> gene mutations have been found in approximately 20% of individuals with the inherited form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  motor neuron disease , a rapidly progressive and fatal neurological disorder  <cit> . neurodegeneration in als may result from genetic factors predisposing motor and glial cells to a higher level of vulnerability to different types of injuries, like mechanical stress  <cit> . retrospective studies have shown how spondylotic myelopathy, a history of bone fracture and of surgical treatment are significantly more represented among als individuals compared to the general population  <cit> . likewise, als appears to be  <dig> to  <dig> folds more prevalent in italian professional footballers  <cit> . if mechanical stress plays a part in the unravelling of als as suggested by these epidemiological observations, it would be important to understand how the cascade of stress-induced molecular events precipitates or simply accelerates the development of als in genetically susceptible individuals.

we have recently shown that a mild compression spinal cord injury  and the over-expression of the g93a-sod <dig> gene in the rat can induce the time-dependent transcriptional regulation of the same molecular responses modulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation, membrane ion transport and the neurofilaments homeostasis  <cit> . these molecular pathways have already been extensively investigated in these animal models of spinal cord degeneration  <cit> . the detrimental effect of neurofilaments aggregation on axonal transport is widely acknowledged  <cit> , whilst the identification of motif deletions of the heavy neurofilament subunit gene  and of an increase in the levels of nfh in the cerebrospinal fluid from als patients support the hypothesis that these cytoskeletal proteins are central in the pathogenesis of als  <cit> .

high-penetrance genetic defects like mutations of the sod <dig> gene may not only lead to a neurodegenerative disorder but could also increase the nervous tissue susceptibility to trauma in a pre-symptomatic stage. g93a-sod <dig> toxicity has already been shown to increase the vulnerability of motor neurons and muscles to sciatic nerve injury, by reducing the post-injury motor unit survival whilst impairing the muscle contractile characteristics  <cit> .

in this study, we have investigated by large-scale gene expression analysis how the g93a-sod <dig> gene mutation modifies the acute molecular response to a mild compression injury in a pre-symptomatic rat. the low-intensity mechanical stress employed in this study causes no major tissue damage and healthy rats normally undergo full locomotor recovery within a short-time from injury  <cit> . we have also evaluated the post-injury expression profile of nfh in the g93a-sod <dig> transgenic rats and in their wild type  littermates, together with the determination of spare white matter, of macrophage infiltration, of microglial activation and of the number and size of motor cells in the spinal cord segment immediately caudal to the site of injury. in the same one-week post-injury time-frame, we have compared the recovery of locomotor functions of the g93a-sod <dig> rats to the one observed in wt rats after compression sci. this study provides further insight into the toxic effects induced by a sod <dig> gene mutation, showing how the molecular response to a mechanical trauma can be profoundly modified by this genetic defect in an otherwise pre-symptomatic rat.

RESULTS
the g93a-sod <dig> rats display a poor locomotor recovery in the first week following mild spinal cord compression
we have previously reported the significant locomotor improvement that wt animals undergo in a  <dig> day time-period following compression spinal cord injury   <cit> . prior to surgery, the mean baseline locomotor performances measured using the bbb open-field locomotor rating scale as previously reported  <cit> , were found not to be significantly different between the g93a-sod <dig> and the wt groups . however, comparative bbb scoring of wt and g93a-sod <dig> rats in the 1-week observation period following compression sci showed significant differences . the g93a-sod <dig> animals appear slightly less impaired at  <dig> hours and at  <dig> day from compression sci than their wt littermates, although this difference was not statistically significant. the g93a-sod <dig> animals show only a marginal improvement after compression sci throughout the period of observation, whilst wt rats display a locomotor recovery between the first and the second day after compression sci, followed by a much higher level of recovery throughout the  <dig> day period compared to the g93a-sod <dig> rats . the bbb scale describes changes in the articulation of movements of the hip, knee, ankle, tail and posterior feet position. at the  <dig> day post-injury time period, the wt animals achieved a mean bbb locomotor rating score of  <dig> which is classified as "...constant weight support in the plantar step, constant hindlimbs and forelimbs coordination". at the  <dig> day post-injury time period, the g93a-sod <dig> rats achieved a mean bbb locomotor rating score of  <dig>  which is categorized as "... frequent or consistent weight support in the dorsal step and no support in plantar step, soft movements without supporting the body weight"  <cit> . the molecular basis of genetic vulnerability of g93a-sod <dig> to trauma was further investigated.

comparative analysis of the gene expression changes in g93a-sod <dig> and in wild type spinal cords following mild compression spinal cord injury
we have used an illumina bead-chip platform to compare the post-injury gene expression profile in spinal cord from g93a-sod <dig> transgenic rats to the genetically homogeneous age-matched wild type  littermates subjected to the same mild compression sci procedure. we have pooled spinal cord samples containing the epicenters of injury obtained from wt or g93a-sod <dig> transgenic rats sacrificed at different time points from the compression sci . we have focussed our studies on the first  <dig> days after injury, since post-traumatic cell loss by necrosis and apoptosis involving large ventral horn motor neurones and glial cells is at its highest levels in this time-window  <cit> . the data obtained from the gene expression analysis have been submitted to gene expression omnibus , and can be found in this repository with the series entry gse <dig> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig>  supplementary files can be retrieved using appropriate links available from the same database series entry.

the number of differentially regulated genes in injured wt and g93a-sod <dig> spinal cords compared to genetically-matched uninjured tissues is reported in figure 2a, for each of the chosen post-injury time-point. at the  <dig> minutes,  <dig> hour and  <dig> days time points, the total number of differentially regulated genes after compression injury was higher in wt than in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord. comparison of down-regulated versus up-regulated genes  revealed that the increased number of differentially regulated genes in the wt spinal cord at the  <dig> day time-point compared to g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord was due to down-regulated genes. the spinal cords from the g93a-sod <dig> transgenic rats showed a larger number of up-regulated genes compared to wt spinal cords at the  <dig> hour post-injury time point. figure 2a and 2b also show that sham surgery in g93a-sod <dig> and wt animals induced the differential regulation of a number of gene candidates, particularly in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at  <dig> minutes from compression sci . the correlation analysis  between the wt and the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord expression profiles after injury and genetically age-matched naïve tissues corresponds to the differences seen in the raw number of differentially regulated genes reported above. whilst r <dig> values for the correlation between sci and naïve tissues are comparable for g93a-sod <dig> and wt spinal cords at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after injury , the correlation coefficients diverge significantly at the 7-day time point, with a r <dig> of  <dig>  for the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord and a r <dig> of  <dig>  for the wt spinal cord. a lower correlation coefficient indicates a higher level of differential regulation of the bead-array  <dig>  test-genes in the spinal cord samples under investigation. the r <dig> value of the technical replica experiment performed probing two separate bead-arrays with the same rna sample was  <dig> .

we have used high throughput go-miner as previously reported  <cit>  to obtain an integrated ontological analysis of the gene expression datasets of injured g93a-sod <dig> and wt spinal cords. this program identifies gene categories within the gene ontology  database that are enriched with the differentially regulated genes under investigation and display a significant false discovery rate , a value which indicates the statistical significance of the identified gene category by eliminating probe signals detected only by chance  <cit> . of the  <dig> gene categories computed by high throughput go-miner,  <dig> with a broad biological significance and not related to any specific functional or biological mechanism  were excluded from further analysis, as were  <dig> gene categories showing the same temporal distribution and level of fdr significance in g93a-sod <dig> and in wt spinal cord. the time dependent expression of the remaining  <dig> gene categories has been graphically displayed in a heat-chart, where the fdr value for each gene category at a specific time point is represented with a colour-code . the selected gene categories are grouped into functional headings, according to their "parent-child" relationship and biological affinity. gene categories found to be up-regulated in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord, those up-regulated in wt spinal cord, those down-regulated in g93a-sod <dig> and those down-regulated in wt spinal cord are reported in figure 3a, b, c and 3d respectively. those gene categories up-regulated predominantly in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord seem to be mostly detected at  <dig> hours post-injury , whereas those differentially regulated in wt spinal cord are identifiable mainly at the  <dig> hour and  <dig> day time points . the key changes shown in figure  <dig> will now be briefly reviewed:

the  <dig> min time point
only four gene categories are differentially regulated at the  <dig> minutes post-injury time point, all of which are up-regulated in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord and mainly involved in transcriptional mechanisms and in cell motility.

the  <dig> hour time point
among those gene categories activated only in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at this time point, some supervise the development of neuronal and myeloid cells, the differentiation of lymphoid organs and the regulation of the synaptic plasticity . at this time point, gene candidates with a pro-apoptotic effect and involved in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, become significantly up-regulated in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord, together with other genes involved in macrophage migration, in the interleukin- <dig> and tnf-alpha molecular cascades and in the regulation of t-cell proliferation and cytokine production. the only gene category selectively regulated in wt spinal cord at the  <dig> hour time-point contains gene candidates involved in angiogenesis .

the  <dig> hour time point
as previously reported  <cit> , wt spinal cord presents, at this post-injury time point, gene expression changes with a likely pro-survival effect, such as the up-regulation of genes involved in lipid transport . other molecular responses that may be detrimental to spinal cord functional recovery are also prominent, including the activation of macrophage and interleukin- <dig> molecular pathways . unlike g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord tissue, wt spinal cord up-regulates gene candidates involved in cell cycle control as previously reported in a rat model of mild spinal cord injury  <cit> .

the  <dig> day time point
this time-point is characterised by further up-regulation of pro-survival signals in wt spinal cord, including gene candidates involved in cell adhesion and in the formation of the extra-cellular matrix. as reported above, the 7-day time-point after compression sci displays the most remarkable difference between g93a-sod <dig> and wt spinal cord in the post-injury period in study . this is represented by the down-regulation only in wt spinal cord of  <dig> genes , which are part of  <dig> gene categories according to our high throughput go-miner analysis . these down-regulated genes supervise the homeostasis of intermediate neurofilaments, cholesterol and isoprenoid metabolism, striated muscle contraction, ion and neurotransmitter transport, and cell-cell signalling.

more detailed analysis of the bead-array results indicates that the genes included in the intermediate neurofilaments go category , and particularly the neurofilament heavy chain , show a significant drop in expression in wt spinal cord at  <dig> days from injury, whilst its expression transiently increases between  <dig> and  <dig> hours from compression sci . g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord shows a similar pattern of temporal expression change for nfh, but this intermediate neurofilament maintains a higher level of expression compared to wt spinal cord and no significant drop in expression between  <dig> hours and  <dig> days . the sci-induced differential regulation of nfh has been further characterised by real-time rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry as reported below. another relevant feature of the post-injury spinal cord molecular profile at the 7-day time-point is the up-regulation of a gene category involved in retinoid metabolism . this gene category contains  <dig> genes which control retinol metabolism and the homeostasis of vitamin a,  <dig> of which are reported in the bead-array utilized in this study. the post-injury up-regulation of go: <dig> is shown in both spinal cord genetic types in this study,  at  <dig> days post-injury, with a higher level of statistical significance for the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord  compared to wt spinal cord . our bead-array analysis shows that retinol binding protein  <dig>  and cellular retinoic acid binding protein  <dig>  display a significant level of up-regulation at  <dig> days compared to naïve and genetically matched spinal cord tissue in both wt and g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord, whilst only g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord shows up-regulation of alcohol dehydrogenase  <dig>  and of aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig>  member a <dig>  .

gene expression changes after laminectomy
our gene expression study indicates that sham-operation induces the differential regulation of a smaller number of genes in the spinal cord at both the  <dig> minutes and at the  <dig> hours post-injury time points, when compared to the amount of gene expression changes generated by mild compression sci . high throughput go-miner computation of the gene expression changes induced by laminectomy in these spinal cord tissues at the  <dig> minutes and at the  <dig> hours post-injury time points has disclosed a total of  <dig> gene categories. like for the compression sci experiment,  <dig> general gene categories were excluded from further analysis, whilst  <dig> gene categories appeared to have the same pattern of expression and level of significance in g93a-sod <dig> and in wt spinal cord. figure  <dig> shows the remaining  <dig> gene categories with a fdr <  <dig>  in either g93a-sod <dig> or wt spinal cord, at  <dig> minutes and  <dig> hours from laminectomy. most of the differentially expressed gene categories are up-regulated in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord,  <dig> hours after laminectomy. the genes included in these categories encompass a wide range of functional processes including nitric oxide metabolism, cell adhesion, ion homeostasis, transcription, apoptosis, mitochondrion organization and biogenesis, and interleukin- <dig> biosynthesis . eight gene categories containing a wide range of genes related to the muscle cytoskeletal structure  are significantly down-regulated only in wt spinal cord  <dig> minutes after laminectomy .

direct comparison of g93a-sod <dig> vs wt spinal cord tissue
using beadstudio- <dig>  we have been able to directly compare the expression profiles of g93a-sod <dig> and wt spinal cord tissues harvested at the selected time-points after compression sci. we have identified  <dig> gene candidates with a significant level of differential regulation. further evaluation of the nature of the differential regulation of these gene candidates in each tissue type was performed using genetically and age-matched naïve tissue as reference. the differentially regulated genes are reported in figure  <dig>  along with their reference go categories. in each tissue type, genes are reported as up-regulated or down-regulated . in bold are those genes whose expression changes in both the wt and the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord, and those gene categories that have been selected by the high throughput go-miner analysis  and that contain these differentially regulated genes.

at  <dig> days after injury, the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel  <dig>  appears to have one of the highest levels of differential regulation when directly comparing g93a-sod <dig> to wt injured tissues. this is the result of its up-regulation in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord and of its remarkable down-regulation in wt spinal cord . hcn <dig> is represented in a number of "parent-child" gene categories according to the go database, which contain functionally related gene candidates involved in cell-cell signalling  and ion transport . other genes involved in membrane ion exchange and synaptic transmission show the same temporal pattern of down-regulation in wt spinal cord , including the voltage-gated sodium channel type iv beta subunit  and the atpase ca transporting plasma membrane  <dig> . the same pattern of over-expression in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord and of down-regulation in wt spinal cord has been identified for the microtubule-associated protein b  <dig>  at  <dig> hours and for the microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase family  <dig>  at  <dig> days from compression sci . mapb <dig> has been reported to bind to microtubules promoting their stabilization within axons, and to facilitate the interplay between the microtubule system and microfilaments. microtubules play a dominant role in the central growth cone and are essential for the maintenance and the elongation of the axon. mast <dig> becomes up-regulated in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at  <dig> days from injury, whilst its expression diminishes in wt tissue at the same post-injury time point. mast <dig> is part of the cell's scaffolding kinase activity, with a selective expression in oligodendrocytes and in white matter containing brain regions. among cytoskeletal gene candidates that behave differently in the two genetic types of injured spinal cord, we have identified the myelin protein zero  and nfh. mpz, an important constituent of the myelin sheet, undergoes a significant up-regulation in injured g93a-sod <dig> tissue a  <dig> days from compression sci, whilst the differential regulation of nfh  at  <dig> hours and at  <dig> days post-injury, is the result of a significant down-regulation only in wt spinal cord .

among those genes undergoing a selective up-regulation in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord and remaining unchanged in the wt tissue , we have identified alpha  <dig> defensin  and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig> . defa is known to have antimicrobial properties and to be localised in the granules of neutrophils from where it can be secreted. timp <dig> belongs to a group of matrix inhibitors of metalloproteinases, whose potential tissue repair-promoting effect has been recently exploited as a therapeutic target in acute brain injuries  <cit> . furthermore s100a <dig> and calcium binding protein  <dig> , both up-regulated in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord, are predominantly expressed in glial cells.

as previously reported  <cit> , among those gene candidates down-regulated in the g93a-sod <dig> uninjured spinal cord , we have identified constituents of collagen, components of the muscle contractile machinery like the human troponin i fast-twitch isoform  <dig> and  <dig>  genes, the myosin light chain  <dig> and  <dig> , the actin - alpha skeletal muscle  <dig> , the actinin -- alpha  <dig> , and the creatine kinase -- muscle type . the mitochondrial ribosomal protein l <dig>  is also down-regulated in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at  <dig> hours and  <dig> days from compression sci.

real-time rt-pcr
we have used real-time rt-pcr to confirm the differential regulation of hcn <dig>  nfh, timp <dig>  s100a <dig> and map1b, previously shown by bead-array analysis. figure  <dig> shows how both real-time rt-pcr and bead-array analysis display a significant up-regulation in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord of the selected gene candidates, although the degree of differential regulation varies between the two techniques. map1b differential regulation at  <dig> hours from injury, as demonstrated using real-time rt-pcr and bead-array analysis, results from its up-regulation in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord and from its down-regulation in wt spinal cord . the high g93a-sod <dig> to wt nfh expression ratio at  <dig> hours  is the result of a significant down-regulation of this gene in wt injured spinal cord as already reported .

expression of nfh and of synaptophysin
to confirm that the spinal cord regulation of nfh expression varies between wt and g93a-sod <dig> animals at different time-points from injury  we have carried out immunostaining for nfh in comparable sections of spinal cord caudal to the epicenter of compression sci, from wt and g93a-sod <dig> rats . nfh expression by immunostaining appeared tendentially higher in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at all the post-injury time points considered when compared to the wt spinal cord, although only the  <dig> hour time point displayed a statistically significant difference . this significant difference in nfh protein expression levels between the two groups at  <dig> h post-injury was further confirmed using western blotting .

we have also performed immunostaining of the similar sections for synaptophysin , a membrane glycoprotein of the pre-synaptic vesicles in neuron, whose expression does not seem to be altered following compression sci according to our gene expression analysis . both nfh and syn have already been described to become differentially regulated in neurological structures subjected to mechanical injury  <cit> . syn immunostaining shows selective staining of synaptic boutons, with no statistically significant difference between wt and g93a-sod <dig> tissues of the protein expression of this gene at the post-injury time points considered . in addition, the staining does not reveal any significant difference in syn regional distribution in the g93a-sod <dig> compared to the wt spinal cord. both these proteins have been previously demonstrated to become differentially regulated in neurological structures subjected to mechanical injury  <cit> .

histopathological assessment of the acute effects of mild compression spinal cord injury
we have used a luxol fast blue staining to examine spared spinal cord white matter following compression. the white matter appears to be mostly intact in the spinal cord segment caudal to the compression site . the comparison between the wt and the g93a-sod <dig> rats showed that the area of spared white matter was not significantly different between the two groups . previous studies have identified increases in ed <dig> immunopositive macrophage infiltration, ox <dig> immunopositive activated microglia and gfap immunopositive astrocytes in the spinal cord following injury  <cit> . at  <dig> days after spinal cord compression in the wt and in the g93a-sod <dig> rats, there was an increase in the number of ed1-, ox42- and gfap- immunopositive cells in the spinal cord caudal to the compression site .

reduced motor neurones size in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord following compression spinal cord injury
to examine motor neurones, nissl staining was used since the motor neurone marker choline acetyltransferase has been shown to be significantly reduced following spinal cord injury  <cit> . motor neurone morphology can be clearly seen in the ventral horn of a spinal cord region caudal to the injury epicenter  <dig> days after mild compression sci . at this post-injury time point, the number of motor neurones in the ventral part of the spinal cord of wt rats did not differ from the number of motor neurones in the g93a-sod <dig> rats . however, motor neurones in the anterior horns from the g93a-sod <dig> rats were significantly smaller in soma size  compared to those from wt littermates .

discussion
this study shows how the over-expression of the g93a-sod <dig> gene mutation modifies the molecular response to a mild mechanical compression in the spinal cord tissue from a pre-symptomatic rat. using a histopathological assessment of the compression injury, we have found no significant differences between the wt and the g93a-sod <dig> animals in the post-injury immunoresponse or in the amount of spared white matter following the trauma . hence, despite delivering comparable spinal cord compression injuries to pre-symptomatic wt and g93a-sod <dig> rats, g93a-sod <dig> rats displayed a significantly lower level of post-injury locomotor recovery than their wt littermates. we observe that the significant differences in the post-injury locomotor recovery between the wt and the g93a-sod <dig> rats are not due to differences in the induction of the injury, but rather to an intrinsically different molecular response to trauma in the two genetic variants of rats. a significantly low level of functional recovery has also been reported in g93a-sod <dig> transgenic mice after sciatic nerve injury, with an acceleration of the disease progression so that  <dig> day old mice show deficits that are normally only seen at the end stage in uninjured g93a-sod <dig> mice  <cit> .

whilst mutations of the sod <dig> gene account only for approximately 2% of the whole als population, other not yet identified predisposing or causative genetic factors may act along the same lines, reducing the neuroregenerative potential and escalating the level of disability after trauma. these observations may partially explain the observed higher occurrence of als cases among individuals that have been exposed to repetitive mechanical trauma or that have been subjected to other forms of mechanical stress or surgical procedures  <cit> .

for the purpose of our study, we have employed a well-characterised experimental platform of mechanical stress, which is known to cause only a mild damage to the spinal cord and to be associated with a good outcome in terms of post-traumatic locomotor recovery in rodents  <cit> . other forms of injury cause a significant level of tissue destruction and a more florid profile of gene expression changes, masking subtle transcriptional changes that may be induced by the sod <dig> gene mutation in an otherwise macroscopically healthy spinal cord. under the experimental conditions of mild sci, the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord displays a higher number of up-regulated genes compared to wt tissue at the  <dig> hour post-injury time point . these include a broad range of genes involved in the modulation of macrophages, toll-response, t and b-cell proliferation and in the production of interleukin- <dig> and tnf-alpha, featuring an early inflammatory response that surfaces only at a later time point in wt spinal cord . other gene expression changes unique to the g93a-sod <dig> animal are detected in two later time points within the experimental period. following the 4-hour time point, the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord displays characteristic apoptotic signals, like the activation of genes regulating cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. cytochrome c release is known to occur when the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes excessively permeable to ions, leading to energy failure and apoptosis  <cit> . the inflammatory milieu and the activation of cell-death signals in the spinal cord at this stage of the animal recovery may reduce the tissue repair potential contributing to the observed poor functional recovery observed in the g93a-sod <dig> rat.

the post-injury molecular profile of the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord does not show the down-regulation of a large number of genes  <dig> days from compression sci demonstrated in wt rats compared to naïve controls . for example, those genes that control cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis remain up-regulated in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at this time-point after compression injury. isoprenoids are biological precursors of carotenes and of coenzyme-q, retinol and tocopherol , compounds known to modulate mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress  <cit> . a previous report has documented a state of systemic dyslipidemia in individuals with als and this state of altered lipid homeostasis has been linked to a potential neuroprotective effect  <cit> . the presence of a sod <dig> gene mutation or of a genetic predisposition to develop als may be associated to a state of dysregulation of molecular pathways of cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis, both during the natural development of the disease and in response to a stressful situation like a mechanical injury.

also down-regulated in wt spinal cord at the 7-day post-injury time point are many genes that like hcn <dig> control cell-cell signalling and ion/neurotransmitter transport . previous experimental observations in animal models of als and brain ischemia have reported increased neuronal excitability in affected tissues, generated by the up-regulation of genes capable of modulating ion currents  <cit> . hence, the acquisition of a state of tissue hyperexcitability may represent a distinguishing feature of sod1-induced als, both during the natural development of the disease and also in a pre-symptomatic phase as a result of a stressful condition.

at the  <dig> day time-point, both the wt and the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cords up-regulate genes involved in retinol  metabolism including rbp <dig> and crabp <dig>  whilst only the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord tissue presents the additional up-regulation of adh <dig> and aldh <dig> . a link between the vitamin-a down-stream effects and the pathological changes observed in als has already been suggested  <cit> . early vitamin-a deprivation, for example, causes motor cell loss in rodents  <cit> . rbp <dig> and crabp <dig> are over-expressed in spinal cord from the end-stage g93a-sod <dig> rat, whilst surviving small motor neurons show selective immunostaining for specific retinoid receptors  <cit> . our observations in the acute post-injury phase may inspire potential neuroprotective therapeutic strategies, since both the alteration of ion current regulation and the activation of retinoid signalling can be pharmacologically modified.

we and others have already reported the post-injury down-regulation and/or accumulation of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated neurofilaments and of synaptophysins , the latter appearing to be linked to post-traumatic motor and cognitive deficits in different models of neurotrauma  <cit> . given the reported trauma-induced differential regulation of nfh and syn expression along the motor cell/axon/synapsis axis, we have evaluated the nfh and syn differential regulation in our injury model. at a rna level, nfh expression appears to be higher in injured g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord compared to injured wt tissue from the  <dig> hour time point onward . post-injury protein expression of nfh measured by immunohistochemistry is also tendentially higher in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at all the time points, with a significant level of differential expression at the  <dig> hour time-point, which was further confirmed with western blotting . this observation may indicate that neurofilaments expression is altered in a situation of genetic susceptibility to develop als, both under conditions of stress and during the natural development of the disease. intermediate neurofilaments like peripherin within spheroid-like structures are already known to accumulate in affected tissues from animal models of als and to possibly interfere with axonal transport  <cit> . we did not observe any significant differential regulation or any genotype-specific redistribution of syn in spinal cord after compression sci. failure to detect a post-injury change in syn expression or re-distribution in our study may be related to the relatively low force of impact or to the fact that changes in synaptic vesicle transportation as a consequence of a mild compression sci may have not yet occurred in its full scale in the 7-day time period. another indication that sod <dig> gene defects may act on the homeostasis of neurofilaments when nervous tissue is under stress is the up-regulation of mapb <dig> and possibly of mast <dig> in the post-injury g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord, both genes appearing to be down-regulated in wt spinal cord after compression injury . mapb <dig> binds to microfilaments linking them with the microtubule system, whilst remaining associated to the plasma membranes. mapb <dig> exerts a central role in the process of axonal elongation and branching  <cit> . the observed selective activation of map1b in g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord could be part of a compensative neuroprotective response that counters the intrinsic sod1-mediated vulnerability under conditions of stress. this survival program may be mediated by the activation of molecules involved in the maintenance of the cytoskeletal integrity as well as by the production of cholesterol and isoprenoids derivates as reported above.

microarray studies in spinal cord have shown that sham operation alone can induce gene expression changes similar to those caused by mild injury, but only in the first few hours after trauma  <cit> . our study confirms that simple laminectomy triggers the transcriptional regulation of a wide range of gene categories in both the wt and the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cords. however, gene categories involved in transcription, differentiation, ion homeostasis, apoptosis, organisation of mitochondrial function and interleukin- <dig> release become activated only in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord at  <dig> hours from laminectomy. it is clear from our experiments that both laminectomy and mild spinal cord injury provoke a mixture of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic expression changes, the latter being dominated by mitochondrial cell-death signals and interleukin-6-mediated inflammatory changes.

in this study, we have attempted to correlate the poor functional recovery observed in the g93a-sod <dig> rats during the acute post-injury phase with changes at the level of individual cell types in the affected spinal cord. we have shown only a trend towards an increase in microglia, macrophages and astrocytes in a cord segment caudal to the injury epicenter in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord compared to wt littermates under the same experimental conditions, but no significant changes in the number of these cells between the two groups. this observation is in line with a recent study that has analysed the effects of a longitudinal stab injury of the lumbar spinal cord region of the same pre-symptomatic animal model of als utilised in our study  <cit> . in this experimental paradigm of more invasive spinal cord injury, the level of host glial activation and the motor cell numbers at the site of the lesion in a 2-week post-injury period were not significantly different in the injured g93a-sod <dig> rats compared to the injured wt littermates  <cit> . our study demonstrates that the size of the anterior horns motor cells in the g93a-sod <dig> animals after compression sci is significantly reduced when compared to the wt motor cell population. previous studies on animal models of als have also shown a loss of the largest spinal motor neurons with the disease progression  <cit> . various attempts to clarify whether the late stage loss of large motor neurones is due to a higher vulnerability of these neurones, which may die or atrophy earlier than the small ones or whether motor cells never reach their maximal size before disease onset have not come to any conclusion  <cit> . it is also not known whether the loss or the atrophy of large motor neurons is the main determinant of the functional decline and ultimately of the loss of motor units observed in the overt phase of the disease. clearly, the same type of uncertainties may apply to the interpretation of our results. the presence of smaller motor neurones in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord one week after compression injury may play a part in the poor locomotor performances observed in the g93a-sod <dig> rats compared to their wt littermates under to the same experimental conditions. the overall molecular changes we have observed in the g93-sod <dig> spinal cord in the post-injury phase may also be responsible of the poor functional recovery described in the g93-sod <dig> rats.

similarly to a number of published investigations, our study has used wt littermates as control for the human g93a-sod <dig> rats, in order to ensure the maximum level of genetic homogeneity between the groups of animals. this choice is of particular importance when studying changes at a genetic level  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the human g93a-sod <dig> transgene does not affect the endogenous rat sod <dig> protein levels  <cit> . however, it has also been shown that the total sod <dig> activity in the g93a-sod <dig> rats is increased to 200-300% of the control level, as the result of the combined endogenous sod <dig> activity of the rat and of the added mutant g93a-sod <dig> activity  <cit> . this observation is clearly important in the interpretation of our results. in future studies, it will be useful to include rats with elevated non-mutant sod <dig> activity as an extra control group, in order to normalise whatever experimental approach to comparable levels of sod <dig> activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates a higher level of functional impairment in the pre-symptomatic g93a-sod <dig> rats compared to their control wt littermates after mechanical injury of the spinal cord, in the acute 1-week post-injury phase. comparative gene ontological analysis indicates that the molecular response to a mild compression sci or to a simple surgical stress in pre-symptomatic g93a-sod <dig> rats genetically-modified to develop als is distinctively different to that seen in control wt littermates. the response to sci in the g93a-sod <dig> spinal cord seems to replicate some of the most crucial gene expression changes described in the affected tissues during the natural development of als and to demonstrate the same changes in the morphology of the motor cell population observed in spinal cord from individuals and animal models of the disease in an advanced stage. the sustained recovery after injury observed in wt rats may be driven, at a molecular level, by a lower level of pro-apoptotic activity coupled with the significant over-expression of factors involved in transcription, angiogenesis, lipid transport and cell adhesion. the results presented here contribute to the understanding of how the genetic background affects the ability of nervous tissues to withstand a mechanical trauma, showing how a g93a-sod <dig> gene mutation creates a milieu of gene expression changes which has an unfavourable effect on functional recovery following a mild compression injury to the spinal cord.
