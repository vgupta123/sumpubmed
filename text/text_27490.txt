BACKGROUND
the brain is a major target of glucocorticoids  that are secreted by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to stress. in the brain there are two receptors for glucocorticoids, the mineralocorticoid receptor  and the glucocorticoid receptor , that differ in their expression pattern and affinity for gcs. gr is abundantly expressed throughout the brain both in neurons and non-neuronal cells such as microglia and astrocytes  <cit> . gr has a relatively low affinity for its ligand, cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents , and is activated when cort levels rise, for example during stress. upon cort binding, gr migrates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it is involved in the regulation of gene transcription.

transcriptional regulation by gr is complex and several molecular mechanisms have been described involving both homodimers and monomers of gr. direct binding of gr dimers to glucocorticoid response elements  in the vicinity of target genes, a process known as transactivation, is the classical mode of action which generally results in a potentiation of transcription  <cit> . however, gr also exhibits extensive crosstalk with other transcription factors , and besides simple gres composite sites exist that contain a binding site for another tf in close proximity to the gre, resulting in either a synergistic activation or a repression of transcription  <cit> . furthermore, gr monomers can also exert effects on gene transcription by indirectly binding to the dna via an intermediate dna-bound tf in so called tethering response elements  <cit> , mostly resulting in a repression of transcription of the associated gene, a process referred to as transrepression. this extensive crosstalk of gr with other tfs not only vastly expands the range of gr-control on physiological processes compared to the classical gre-driven transcriptional control in simple gres, but it also underlies the highly context-dependent action of gcs.

several tfs have been described that participate in this crosstalk with gr, including oct <dig>  ets <dig>  ap- <dig> and creb at composite gres and nf-κb, ap- <dig>  creb, oct-1/ <dig>  stat <dig>  smad <dig>  and pu.1/spi- <dig> at tethering sites  <cit> . however, most of these crosstalk partners of gr have been identified in studies on the immunosuppressive and the tumor suppressor properties of gr  <cit> , while very little is known about crosstalk partners in a neuronal context.

in neuronal cells gr regulates the expression of a wide diversity of genes involved in general cellular processes such as energy metabolism, cell cycle and response to oxidative stress, but also clearly is involved in regulating a wide variety of genes important for neuronal structure and plasticity  <cit> . despite the fact that many neuronal gc-responsive genes have been identified  <cit> , it remains unclear whether these genes are primary or downstream targets of gr. the onset of high-throughput sequencing combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation  has made it possible to characterize genome-wide binding sites of tfs and today several studies have used this approach to identify global primary gr-targets in a variety of cell types, including human lung carcinoma cells , mouse adipocytes , premalignant breast epithelial cells , murine mammary epithelial cells  and pituitary  cells  <cit> . these studies have yielded an unprecedented insight into genome wide gr targets as well as molecular mechanisms of gr-signaling, but perhaps one of the most striking findings is the low degree of overlap in gr binding sites when comparing different cell types, indicating that gr occupancy is highly cell type specific  <cit> . therefore, in order to gain insight into global gr primary target in neurons, it is essential to characterize gr binding in a neuronal context. so far no studies have taken a chip-seq approach to characterize gr-binding in a neuronal context.

the aim of the current study was to analyze genome-wide gr-binding sites  in rat neuronal pc <dig> cells using chip-seq. the pc <dig> cell line is derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla and can be differentiated into a neuronal phenotype by stimulation with nerve growth factor  <cit> . ngf- treated pc <dig> cells stop dividing, develop neurites, display electrical activity and develop many other properties similar to those of sympathetic neurons  <cit> . they are considered a useful model system for neurosecretion and neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and have been extensively used to study neuronal function in relation to gcs  <cit> . in this study, besides identifying the binding sites of gr in neuronal pc <dig> cells, we analysed which genes were located in the vicinity of the binding sites, which gene ontology classes were overrepresented, whether gr-binding resulted in regulation of gene expression of nearby genes and the motif composition of the binding sites.

RESULTS
identification and genomic distribution of gr binding sites in pc <dig> cells
chip-seq resulted in the identification of  <dig>  genomic regions that were bound by gr after  <dig> minutes of continuous dex-stimulation of neuronal pc <dig> cells. of this list,  <dig>  regions had a p-value < <dig>  and were considered to be significant and were used for further analysis. an example of the chip-seq data showing gr-binding upstream of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene  is shown in figure  <dig>  to get insight into the genomic distribution of gr binding, the shortest distance of the center of each significant gbs to the nearest gene was determined within a  <dig> kb region. approximately one third  of all significant gbs was located within a gene, while 47% did not overlap with a gene but were located within a  <dig> kb distance upstream or downstream of a gene . the remaining 22% of gbs were located further than  <dig> kb upstream or downstream from the closest gene. in total there were more gbs located upstream to genes than downstream: 38% vs 31% respectively.

based on their genetic location, the intragenic gbs were subdivided into the following groups: 5’utr and 3’utr , introns, exons and gbs overlapping an exon/intron junction . the majority  of intragenically located gbs were confined to intronic regions. only 16% of the intragenic gbs were located within the 5’utr, upstream of the coding sequence of the gene, a region classically considered to be involved in regulation of gene expression  <cit> . a list of the  <dig> most significant regions containing gbs and the most nearby gene is shown in table  <dig>  the full list of  <dig>  gbs is available in the additional material .

reliability of chip-seq data
to assess the reliability of the chip-seq data and the stringency of the applied statistical threshold, chip-qpcr experiments were performed in a new isolate of gr-bound dna on a total of  <dig> gbs which covered a wide range of p-values . the selection included five significant regions previously identified in other studies, in the vicinity of ddit <dig>  per <dig>  tle <dig>  frmd <dig> and ddc, which were also identified in the current study and served as positive controls  <cit>  figure 3a, b: grey bars). in addition,  <dig> novel gbs identified in this study in neuronal pc <dig> cells were selected for validation . all but one gbs  were successfully validated, showing that the selected cut-off of significant gbs  was appropriate. several of the novel gbs identified and validated in neuronal pc <dig> cells were associated with genes that have a known neuronal function, such as dopamine decarboxylase  and tyrosine hydroxylase , both important enzymes in the biosynthesis of catecholamines. other examples are voltage-gated potassium channel subunit beta- <dig> , nmda receptor-regulated gene  <dig> , period circadian protein homolog  <dig>  and neurofascin .

gr-binding sites and regulation of nearby genes
rna was isolated from neuronal pc12-cells to establish whether gr activation by dex-treatment induced expression of the genes closest to the validated gbs. six out of  <dig> genes  showed a significant upregulation upon gr activation and another  <dig> genes  a clear trend towards significance with p-values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . one gene, ddit <dig>  was downregulated by gr activation rather than upregulated. five out of the  <dig> genes tested did not show a change in expression at the time point measured, i.e.  <dig> hours after gr activation. eight out of  <dig> tested genes contained a gre, including the gbs near ddit <dig> 

overlap with gr-binding sites in other tissues is limited
we next compared the gr binding regions in rat neuronal pc <dig> cells to two previously published gr chip-seq studies performed in human lung carcinoma   <cit>  and mouse adipocytes   <cit> . this resulted in a list of gbs unique to neuronal pc <dig> cells and lists of gbs shared with either or both of the other cell types. the majority of gbs identified in pc <dig>   <dig>  in total, appeared unique to neuronal pc <dig> cells. only  <dig>  of the gbs identified in pc <dig> cells were shared with a <dig> cells and  <dig>  with 3t3-l <dig> cells . a similar degree of overlap was observed comparing gbs of a <dig> and 3t3-l <dig> cells, that shared a total of  <dig> gbs being 12% and 6% respectively. only  <dig> gbs  of all pc <dig> gbs were common to all  <dig> cell types.

pc12-specific gbs are located nearby genes with a neuronal function
to analyse which biological processes are likely to be affected by gr-binding in neuronal pc <dig> cells, the genes nearest to the gbs were analysed for overrepresentation of specific gene ontology classes using david  <cit> . genes closest to  <dig>  sites uniquely identified in pc <dig> cells were used as input in the analysis. the genes near pc12-unique gbs had a high representation of go-terms linked to neuronal function and clustering of all identified go-terms revealed that the most enriched cluster in this group was “neuron development”, with other neuron-related clusters being “neuron projection”, “synapse” and “biogenic amine biosynthetic process” .

gene ontology analysis of genes associated with gbs identified in neuronal pc <dig> cells. the  <dig> most enriched functional go clusters in gbs that are uniquely found in neuronal pc <dig> cells. analysis was performed with the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery . per cluster, the first go-term is shown. in addition, the category to which the go term belongs to is indicated, i.e. biological processes , molecular function  or cellular compartment . the enrichment score indicates the geometric mean  of p-value of the go cluster.

these results indicate that in neuronal pc <dig> cells the majority of gr binding is to genomic regions that are nearby or within genes with a known neuronal function. the full list of go terms of the genes associated with the pc12-unique gbs are available in the additional material .

gr binding sites represent both transactivation and transrepression modes of action
screening the significant gbs with meme and tomtom for presence of known dna-motifs revealed that  <dig>  regions contained a glucocorticoid response element . the identified gre-motif was similar to the motif identified by others and also had a comparable prevalence  <cit> . this indicates that more than half of the gbs are most likely involved in transactivational effects of gr on gene transcription. we subsequently subdivided the list of gbs into a group of gbs with gres, in which gr presumably exerts its actions via transactivation and the remainder without gres, in which gr in all probability operates via transrepression of other transcription factors. strikingly, the most significant gbs were enriched for gres, while non-gre containing gbs tended to have a lower p-value in the chip-seq data . more than 80% of the top  <dig> most significant gbs contained a gre, dropping to approximately 50% for gbs ranking lower in the list from position  <dig> downwards.

not only the significance of the gbs differed between gre and non-gre containing binding sites, but also their composition in terms of motifs for transcription factor binding differed considerably. both groups were subjected to de novo motif discovery to investigate the prevalence and identity of other motifs representing transcription factor binding sites within the binding regions. a total of  <dig>  of the  <dig> gre-containing gbs represented simple gres, only harbouring a gre-like sequence but no other motifs . however, the majority of the gre-containing gbs represented so called composite sites and also contained one or more other motifs besides the gre. in the group of gre-containing genomic regions a motif for binding of activator protein- <dig>  was most frequently observed, followed by motifs for binding of ga binding protein transcription factor, alpha subunit , zinc finger protein  <dig>  and paired related homeobox  <dig>  . an entirely different distribution of motifs was observed in the genomic regions that did not contain a gre. interestingly, two motifs were identified that were unique for the regions without a gre: a motif for binding of zinc finger and btb -domain- containing  <dig>  gene, present in over 80% of the regions, and a motif for binding of gata binding protein  <dig> , present in 15% of the genomic regions . besides differences there were also some motifs found in both groups, regardless of whether the regions contained a gre or not. for example, in both groups motifs corresponding to ap- <dig>  prrx <dig> and zfp <dig> were identified, albeit at different frequencies.

next, the co-occurrence of the various motifs was investigated. in the gre-containing group, 26% of the gbs contained an ap- <dig> site besides a gre, making it the most prevalent combination of transcription factor binding sites. other frequently observed combinations of motifs were a gre in conjunction with motifs for binding of gabpa, zfp <dig> and prrx <dig> . in the group without a gre, all frequently observed combinations of motifs included zbtb <dig>  the most frequently observed combination was zbtb <dig> in conjunction with prrx <dig> , followed by combinations of zbtb <dig> with ap- <dig>  gata <dig> and zfp <dig> 

different biological processes are regulated via transactivtion and transrepressive modes of action
we subsequently investigated whether gbs that contain a gre regulated different biological processes than those without a gre, representing transactivation or transrepression modes of action respectively. genes near gre-containing gbs showed an involvement in general cell functions and processes such as apoptosis, cell motion, protein dimerization activity and vasculature development . in contrast, genes near regions without a gre had a clear role in neuronal processes such as neuron projection morphogenesis, neuron projection regeneration, synaptic transmission and catecholamine biosynthetic process. the full list of go terms of the genes associated with gbs with and without gres are available in the additional material .

the  <dig> most enriched functional go clusters in gbs that do or do not contain a gre according to the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery . in both cases the go-term that best represents the annotation cluster is shown. in addition, the category to which the go term belongs to is indicated, i.e. biological processes , molecular function  or cellular compartment . the enrichment score indicates the geometric mean  of p-value of the go cluster.

discussion
gr is widely expressed throughout body and brain and is an important transcriptional regulator of a diversity of biological processes, ranging from glucose and lipid homeostasis to immune suppression and cell proliferation and differentiation. today several chip-seq studies have been published focusing on genome-wide discovery of gr binding in different cell types  <cit> , and these studies have contributed immensely to our understanding of gr-signalling. what has become apparent, is that gr-binding is highly cell type-specific with minimal overlap in gbs between different cell types. therefore, in order to gain insight into cell type-specific gr targets or mechanisms it is essential to investigate gr-signalling in a specific cell system or tissue of interest.

here we present the first genome-wide discovery of gr-binding sites in a neuronal context. gr is an important transcription factor in neurons and is known to exert effects on neuronal structure and plasticity. so far the focus on gr-mediated action of glucocorticoids in a neuronal context has remained largely in the dark and most of the knowledge on gr modes of action, gr responsive genes and pathways and crosstalk partners of gr has come from studies on peripheral tissues including the immune system, the respiratory tract, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue as well as various types of cancer cells  <cit> . approximately  <dig>  genomic binding sites of gr were identified in neuronal pc <dig> cells, the majority of which are novel and display only very limited overlap with gr binding sites in other non-neuronal cell types. moreover, most of the identified gr-binding sites were located in the vicinity of genes with a neuronal function. finally, we identified several motifs for transcription factor binding that may represent novel crosstalk partners of gr in neurons.

reliability of chip-seq data
we assessed whether our chip-seq data met different reliability criteria. first, a very high proportion  of chip-seq peaks covering a wide range of p-values could be validated using chip rt-qpcr in chromatin derived from an independent experiment. second, several gbs were located in the vicinity of known gr-target genes. third, 13% of the identified gbs overlapped with previously identified gbs in other tissues . finally, highly significant motifs resembling gres were detected in almost 60% of the peaks. together these criteria underscore the high quality of our chip-seq dataset of  <dig> gbs.

genomic binding sites of gr by far exceed gr-responsive genes
the number of gbs identified in pc <dig> cells  was relatively low compared to other studies, i.e.  <dig>  gbs in human lung carcinoma  and  <dig>  gbs in mouse adipocytes   <cit> . however, this could be the consequence of the high stringency we applied, supported by the high validation rate of gr-binding to  <dig> out of  <dig> selected gbs. we cannot exclude that the actual number of genomic regions exhibiting gr-binding in pc <dig> cells may be considerably higher. comparison of gbs between different tissues is hampered by the different thresholds used in different studies without a standard accepted cut-off for reliability of chip-seq data. nonetheless, the identified gbs still considerably outnumbered by more than 10-fold the differentially expressed genes observed after a single  <dig> nm corticosterone pulse in neuronally differentiated pc <dig> cells  <cit> . in fact, this is a more general observation that applies to several of the chip-seq studies on gr so far  <cit> . in a <dig> cells, for example,  <dig> hour of dex-stimulation resulted in the identification of  <dig>  gbs, whereas only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at this time-point. similarly in 3t3-l <dig> cells,  <dig>  gbs were identified and  <dig> genes were found to be dex-responsive after  <dig> hours. it therefore seems likely that gr-binding to genomic sites is a measure of the potential of gr to mediate effects on gene expression of nearby genes rather than a direct predictor of whether a gene is differentially expressed. whether this potential is converted to an actual effect on transcription most likely depends to a large extent on the availability and binding of other tfs.

to further examine the relationship between gr-binding and regulation of gene expression of nearby genes, we tested whether gr activation by dex regulated expression levels of the genes closest to the validated gbs. in approximately half of the cases we could validate differential mrna expression of the associated genes, illustrating the functionality of gr-binding. this percentage is quite high, considering that for the tested genes the gbs were often located at large distances from the genes we tested and not necessarily in classical promoter regions. in a recent chip-seq study on pax <dig> binding sites the overlap with responsive genes as identified by dna microarray was only  <dig> %, despite the fact that only binding sites for pax <dig> located within  <dig> kb of a tss were taken into account  <cit> .

however, this also means that in the other half of the cases we were not able to confirm an effect of gr-binding on expression of the closest gene. there are several possible explanations for this. first, maybe the nearest gene is not necessarily the most relevant gene for studying functional effects of gr-binding. another explanation is that we measured gene expression at the wrong moment. since gr binding precedes effects on gene expression, we chose to measure mrna expression after  <dig> hours of dex-exposure. we therefore cannot exclude that the genes that were not gc-responsive at this moment might still be regulated by gr, albeit at different time-points or under different conditions. temporal dynamics of individual genes are known to differ  <cit> , which may explain why not all genes with a nearby gbs are responsive to dex at one given time-point. investigating gene expression at other time-points would be necessary to determine this. in addition, measuring mrna may not be sensitive enough to pick up the effects of gr-binding on gene expression in all cases. conway-campbell et al. showed that administration of pulses of corticosterone to adrenalectomised rats resulted in pulsatile gr-binding to the per <dig> promoter region followed by a burst of transcription, which was measurable by qpcr of nascent heterogeneous nuclear rna but was not obvious from measuring mrna levels  <cit> , despite the fact the per <dig> is a well-established gr target gene. this may therefore also be the case for the genes in this study that showed no or a small change in expression  <dig> hrs after dex administration. finally, we can not exclude that some of the gbs are derived from unspecific binding at spurious genomic locations, due to the applied continuous dosing regime with the synthetic gc dex, rather than pulsatile exposure to the endogenous ligand, explaining why differential expression of the nearest gene was not observed.

genomic location of gbs
what is becoming increasingly clear is that the majority of gbs are not located in promoter regions upstream of the transcription start site of genes or in the 5’utr. in fact, only 9% of the significant gbs identified in the current study were located within 10kb upstream of the tss and an additional 5% were located within the 5’utr. in contrast, a higher number of gbs  were located at a distance >100kb upstream the tss. these distant regions might be functional, since it is known that transcription factor binding sites are able to exert effects on gene expression through chromosome folding and therefore can be effective at large genomic distances  <cit> .

a much higher percentage of gbs occurred in intragenic regions, almost exclusively in introns, representing 31% of the total list of significant gbs. a similar phenomenon was observed in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes, where 48% of the gbs were found in intragenic regions, either in exons or introns  <cit> . why intragenic regions show so much gr binding is at the least intriguing. studies using artificial constructs in luciferase reporter assays have suggested that intronic gbs contain gres with functional properties  <cit> .

the  <dig>  gbs identified in this study were associated with considerably fewer than  <dig>  different genes, given that there were many examples of multiple gbs being located in each others vicinity nearby the same gene. an example is disks large homolog  <dig> , that had  <dig> different gbs located nearby or tolloid-like protein  <dig>  with  <dig> gbs nearby. a question that still needs answering is whether the most nearby gene to a gbs is in fact the most likely candidate to be transcriptionally regulated by gr binding, or whether multiple genes could be affected. several gbs had multiple genes in their vicinity. to solve this point linking chip-seq studies on tf-binding with expression studies remains important, as well as performing studies in which gbs are mutated in their natural chromatin environment to investigate the effect on transcription of nearby genes.

tissue-specificity of gr-binding reveals a neural signature
the majority of the gbs identified in this study were novel and unique to neuronal pc <dig> cells and were located nearby genes with a high representation of go-terms linked to neuronal function. for example, one of the enriched go clusters among the genes near pc12-unique gbs was “biogenic amine biosynthetic process”, which refers to the biosynthesis of biologically active amines, such as norepinephrine, histamine, and serotonin, many of which act as neurotransmitters. indeed, we identified gbs in the vicinity of a number of genes involved in the synthesis of catecholamines, such as dopamine decarboxylase   and tyrosine hydroxylase  . “neuron projection” was another of the enriched go clusters and accordingly several gbs were located in the vicinity of genes that play a role in outgrowth of axons, such as the semaphorins sema3e and sema5a , proteins that act as axonal growth cone guidance molecules  <cit> . four other gbs were located nearby slit <dig>  and slit <dig> , molecules that act as guidance cues in cellular migration  <cit> . in addition, several gbs near genes involved in neurotransmission were observed, such as the serotonin receptors htr1a, htr1d, htr1f and htr2a  and  <dig> gbs located near a wide variety of voltage-gated potassium channel subunits, including kcna <dig>  kcna <dig>  kcnab <dig>  kcnc <dig>  kcnh <dig>  kcnh <dig>  kcnh <dig>  kcnk <dig> and kcnma <dig>  which play a role in neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release  <cit> . finally, several gbs were located nearby the synaptotagmins syt <dig> , syt <dig>  and syt <dig>  which are integral membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles thought to participates in triggering neurotransmitter release at the synapse  <cit> . these are just a few of the many examples of gbs located in the vicinity of genes with neuronal function. tissue-specific co-factors or transcription factors likely mediate binding of gr to the dna or alter chromatin accessibility, resulting in these distinct tissue-specific patterns of gr-binding.

the overlap in gbs with other tissues was low, with only 7% and 11% of the gbs overlapping with a <dig> cells 3t3-l <dig> cells respectively and is very much in line with what has been observed in expression studies and other gr chip-seq studies. for example, comparison of mouse mammary and mouse pituitary cells revealed an overlap of  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively of the total number of gbs identified in either of the cell types  <cit> . a similar high degree of tissue-specificity has also been observed for other tfs, such as stat <dig>  where an overlap of only  <dig> of  <dig>  identified stat <dig> binding sites was observed when comparing chip-seq data derived from  <dig> different tissues . according to allen brain atlas  <cit> , both maz and zfp <dig> are very highly expressed in the mouse brain, especially in the hippocampus. either one might be a novel crosstalk partner of gr in a neuronal context.

gabpa, also known as nuclear respiratory factor  <dig> alpha , is a dna-binding unit of the ga binding protein transcription factor which is involved in the nuclear control of mitochondrial function in neurons  <cit> . gabpa responds to an altered energy demand within primary neurons by altering the expression of mitochondrial genes  <cit>  and has been implicated in neuronal viability after brain injury  <cit> . prrx <dig> is a member of the paired family of homeobox proteins, and is mainly known for its essential role in orofacial development  <cit> . it was recently discovered to be a novel pituitary transcription factor  <cit> . otherwise very little is known on this tf and it has not been linked to gr-signalling before.

the transcription factor gata <dig> is known to play an essential role in hematopoiesis  <cit> . gr was reported to interfere with gata- <dig> function and inhibits the expression of erythroid structural genes  <cit> . zbtb <dig> was observed in over 80% of the gbs that did not contain a gre and was encountered in all frequently observed combinations of tfs binding sites in tethering gbs. zbtb <dig> belongs to a family of transcription factors, many of which are important for b and t cell differentiation. a recent modeling study indicated that zbtb <dig> may be a remote homologue of the drosophila gaga factor which is involved in both gene activation and gene repression and plays a role in the modulation of chromatin structure  <cit> . zbtb <dig> contains a btb domain, which plays a role in protein dimerization and transcriptional repression and interacts with histone deacetylase corepressor complexes such as ncor  and smrt   <cit> . relevance for the brain has not been indicated yet.

it must be noted that linking the de novo motifs to binding sites of known proteins is difficult and since in many cases more proteins can bind to a given motif, additional chip-experiments would need to be performed to address experimentally whether the tfs described above and predicted by tomtom actually bind to the dna at the identified genomic regions.

non-gre containing tethering gbs are associated with genes involved in aspects of neuronal function
more than half of the gbs  contained a gre. interestingly, the gre-containing gbs were located near other types of genes than those without a gre, as revealed by go-analysis of the most nearby genes. while the gre-containing gbs associated with more general cell functions such as apoptosis, cell motion, protein dimerization activity and vasculature development, the gbs without a gre were more often located near genes involved in neuronal function. motif analysis of the  <dig> sites in common between pc <dig>  a <dig> and 3t3-l <dig> cells revealed that 91% contained a gre . this suggests that there is a core set of ubiquitous gbs that regulate key cellular processes in multiple tissues by the transactivation mode of action. on the other hand, tissue-specific tfs appear to play a role in tethering gr to genomic regions in a cell type-specific manner, regulating particular biological processes relevant for the tissue of interest. of course many of the gre-containing gbs were also unique to neuronal pc <dig> cells. in these cases it seems likely that tissue-specific tfs facilitate binding of gr to the chromatin, guiding it to gres that are relevant for that particular tissue. it has been shown by john et al. that this cell type-specificity is predetermined by differences in chromatin landscapes which affect the accessibility of gr to bind to its targets  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we identified over  <dig>  gbs in neuronal pc <dig> cells, the majority of which were unique and exhibited very little overlap with gbs in other cell types. the pc <dig> unique gbs were located in the vicinity of genes involved in neuronal functions such as axonogenesis, neuron differentiation and neuron development. moreover, we confirmed that in more than half of tested gbs the most closely located gene was indeed gc-responsive, suggesting that these gbs play a role in gc-dependent transcriptional control. intriguingly, we found striking differences in the identity of genes near gbs with or without a gre. gbs containing a gre were more often located nearby genes involved in general cellular functions such as regulation of cell proliferation and intracellular signaling, while tethering gbs, in which gr is indirectly bound to the dna via another tf, were more often located near genes involved in neuronal function. finally, we characterized the motif content of the gbs and identified a number of binding sites for tfs that may represent novel crosstalk partners of gr in neurons, and would vastly expand the repertoire of tfs in the gr interactome. future studies should focus on confirming the binding of these predicted tfs within the identified gbs and on establishing their role as neuronal crosstalk partners of gr and their relevance in other neuronal cell types.

we conclude that the current chip-seq study in neuronal pc <dig> cells has provided insight into some exciting new aspects of gr-mediated action of glucocorticoids in a neuronal context, an area which has so far remained in the dark. understanding gr-signalling in a neuronal context is important given the profound effects of glucocorticoids on neuronal plasticity and consequently on brain function.
