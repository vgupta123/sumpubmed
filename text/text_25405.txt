BACKGROUND
pigeonpea  is an important food legume predominantly cultivated in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia and africa. it is a diploid , often cross-pollinated crop with a genome size of  <dig> mbp  <cit> . pigeonpea plays an important role in food and nutritional security because it is a rich source of protein, minerals and vitamins. pigeonpea seeds are mainly consumed as split pea soups or 'dal' but a significant proportion is also eaten as green pea vegetable and as wholegrain preparations. in addition, pigeonpea leaves, seed husks and pods are used as animal feed, whereas the stem and branches are used as firewood. the world acreage of pigeonpea is  <dig>  mha with an annual production of  <dig>  mt. india is the largest producer and consumer of pigeonpea  with an annual production of  <dig>  mt, followed by myanmar , malawi  and kenya   <cit> .

knowledge of the genetic basis of yield, resistance to diseases and insect pests and abiotic stress tolerance are important factors for deciding the breeding strategies for genetic improvement of pigeonpea. however, in comparison to other economically important crops, relatively less effort has been invested in understanding the genetics of important agronomic traits of pigeonpea. although there are ongoing efforts for pigeonpea improvement through conventional breeding, including hybrid technology, molecular breeding has a greater potential to accelerate the utilization of genetic resources in pigeonpea, especially among land races and related germplasm lines  <cit> . the availability of molecular markers that are tightly linked to important agronomic traits is a prerequisite for undertaking molecular breeding in plants. however, the genetic basis of most agronomic traits in pigeonpea has been worked out using conventional biometric techniques that have inherent limitations. the molecular basis of traits remains entirely unexplored and to date no molecular linkage map has been reported for pigeonpea  <cit> . this can be attributed to:  the low level of dna polymorphism within the primary  gene pool assessed by means of rapd, rflp, aflp and recently by diversity array technologies   <cit> ; and  a paucity of molecular markers available for genetic analysis in pigeonpea  <cit> .

simple sequence repeat  markers have the advantage of high abundance, random distribution within the genome, high polymorphism information content and co-dominant inheritance. however, genomic ssr markers developed from ssr-enriched genomic libraries or random genomic sequences are derived primarily from inter-genic dna regions, and therefore have uncertain linkage to the transcribed regions of the genome. in contrast, genic-ssrs specifically target the transcribed region of the genome and have increased potential for linkage to loci that contribute to agronomic phenotypes. as a consequence, when polymorphic genic-ssrs are identified in high value breeding lines they can have considerable utility for marker assisted selection   <cit> . genic-ssr markers can also facilitate better cross-genome comparisons because they target protein-coding regions that are more likely to be conserved between related species  <cit> . expressed sequence tags  based on sanger's sequencing technology have become increasingly abundant in public dna databases and are being used for genetic analyses, comparative mapping, dna fingerprinting, diversity analysis and evolutionary studies  <cit> ; but only a limited number of pigeonpea sanger ests are available in the public database  <cit> .

we report the development of a large expressed sequence dataset based on  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing of cdna pools from two popular cultivars of pigeonpea, which are parents of the reference mapping population. we mined and validated a large set of genic-ssr markers and describe their application for understanding the genetic relationship among selected pigeonpea cultivars and wild cajanus species. the dataset was also useful for in silico mining of polymorphic genic-ssr loci for the creation of an est-based intra-species reference genetic map.

RESULTS
assembly of non-redundant transcriptome shotgun assembly  contigs of pigeonpea
two runs of  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing generated  <dig> , <dig> high quality filtered expressed sequence reads from two separate cdna library pools of widely adapted pigeonpea cultivars 'asha' and 'upas 120'. in preparation for  <dig> sequencing, cdnas were sheared stochastically to randomly represent all transcripts. sequence data described in this paper can be found in the sequence read archive  public database of the ncbi . the total dataset represents  <dig>  mbp of sequence with an average read length of  <dig> bp. these reads were first assembled separately into  <dig>  tsa contigs for asha  and  <dig>  tsa contigs for upas  <dig>  using the  <dig> 'newbler' sequence assembler with average depths of coverage of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . to obtain a non-redundant set of unigene sequences, the total  <dig>  tsa contigs from the two cultivars were assembled together using lasergene seqman pro™ version  <dig> . <dig> software into  <dig>  unigene sequences with a total sequence length of  <dig>  mbp . of the  <dig>  mbp sequence,  <dig>  mbp was from  <dig>  sequence contigs common to asha and upas  <dig>   <dig>  mbp from  <dig>  contigs unique to asha, and  <dig>  mbp from  <dig>  contigs unique to upas  <dig>  this  <dig>  mbp of tsa sequence was  <dig> % of the estimated  <dig> mbp size of the pigeonpea genome and was used for in silico mining and validation of genic-ssr markers .

frequency distribution of different types of genic-ssr loci
a total of  <dig>  ssr loci were identified in  <dig>  tsa contigs, representing  <dig> % of the total  <dig>  unigene tsa contigs . this study did not include mononucleotide repeats, complex ssr or ssr loci with lengths less than  <dig> bp. among the ssr containing contigs,  <dig>   possessed single ssr loci, while  <dig> contigs  had 2- <dig> ssr loci each. on an average there was one ssr locus for every  <dig>  kbp of tsa unigene sequence, corresponding to one ssr for every  <dig>  tsa unigene contigs. dinucleotide was the most common repeat unit with a frequency of  <dig> %, followed by tri- , hexa- , tetra-  and pentanucleotide repeats  . ssr loci with di- and trinucleotide repeats constituted  <dig>   of the identified loci. the number of reiterations of a given repeat unit varied from  <dig> to  <dig> , and ssrs with five reiterations  were the most abundant. the frequency of a given ssr structure and the number of repeat units in it showed an inverse relationship . hence, ssr loci with less than five repeats are expected to be even more abundant but were not included in the present investigation because they would not be useful in the study of detectable polymorphism  <cit> . motifs showing more than  <dig> reiterations were rare with a frequency of <1% . ssr markers with a length of  <dig> bp, the low end cut-off for ssr retention, were the most frequent  followed by  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  lengths; the longest ssr locus was of  <dig> bp . from the  <dig>  genic-ssr sequences,  <dig> distinct repeat motifs were identified, . dinucleotide repeat units tc/ga, ag/ct and ta/ta were the most abundant with frequencies of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. among the trinucleotide repeat motifs, gaa/ttc and ctt/aag were the most abundant with frequencies of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .

development and validation of genic-ssr markers
pcr primers were designed from the unique sequences flanking  <dig>  ssr loci identified in the tsa contigs for the development of genic-ssr markers and were designated assr <dig> to assr <dig> . primers could not be designed for the remaining  <dig> ssr loci because their flanking sequences were either too short or the nature of sequence did not fulfill the criteria for primer design using batchprimer <dig> v  <dig>  software  <cit> . from the  <dig>  ssr markers,  <dig> loci with n ≥  <dig> bp including type i ssr markers  were selected for primer synthesis and validation due to their high chance of showing polymorphism on agarose gel electrophoresis  <cit> .

of the  <dig> genic-ssr loci for which primers were synthesized,  <dig> yielded pcr amplicons of expected size and we designated these as "validated genic-ssr markers", as shown in additional file  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> primer pairs amplified larger than the expected size products,  <dig> primer pairs amplified multiple products , and  <dig> primer pairs failed to amplify even when the annealing temperature was reduced by 7°c. all the  <dig> validated genic-ssr markers were scored for amplicon size polymorphism among eight pigeonpea varieties showing  <dig>  polymorphic loci. sixty-six of these polymorphic genic-ssr loci showed only two alleles each among the eight tested varieties; four loci possessed three alleles each, while one ssr locus  possessed five alleles. the pic values of the  <dig> polymorphic genic-ssr markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  . although a large proportion of the ssr loci was monomorphic in the eight pigeonpea varieties, some of these are likely to show polymorphism on analysis of a larger set of varieties. use of more sensitive techniques for dna fragment size analysis, e.g. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis, is also expected to show a higher rate of polymorphism.

annealing temperature for all  <dig> markers was 55°c. *primer details and gene annotation is shown in additional file  <dig> 

the  <dig> ssr loci were searched against the non-redundant  protein database of ncbi using blastx to assign functions to the tsa unigene sequences. this database includes all non-redundant genbank cds translations, pdb , swissprot, pir  and prf , excluding environmental samples from whole genome sequencing projects. the search output was used to categorize these expressed sequences into two classes:  putative known function, and  unknown function, similar to that used for rice genes  <cit> , except that there can be no hypothetical protein category here due to the transcriptomic origin of the sequences, hence matches with hypothetical protein annotations were also classified as unknown . putative known functions could be assigned to  <dig>  sequences that showed a significant homology to reported proteins. the remaining  <dig>  sequences were of unknown function, including  <dig>  sequences which did not show a significant match in the database and therefore may encode proteins that are unique to the pigeonpea genome, or may correspond to an untranslated region  and/or diverged c-terminal coding region. our analysis of the location of ssr markers within the tsa contigs revealed that among the  <dig> validated genic-ssr markers,  <dig>  were located in the protein coding region,  <dig>  in the 5'-utr and  <dig>  in the 3'-utr . analysis of polymorphism among the three categories of genic-ssr loci revealed that those located in the 3'-utr were the most polymorphic , followed by 5'-utr  and coding sequences . further annotation of all the  <dig>  tsa unigene contigs and single nucleotide polymorphism characterization between the reference varieties asha and upas  <dig> is in progress.

assessment of genetic diversity among pigeonpea varieties and related species
the  <dig> highly polymorphic genic-ssr markers designed in this study were used to assess the genetic diversity in a set of  <dig> genotypes representing diverse cultivated genotypes, wild species of cajanus and inter-specific derivatives . in total,  <dig> different dna fragments with an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus were amplified among the  <dig> genotypes. the number of alleles per ssr marker ranged from  <dig> for assr <dig> to  <dig> for assr <dig>  whereas the pic values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  per marker. as expected, a higher average number of alleles and pic values were observed for the wild species  compared to those for c. cajan cultivars  . jaccard's similarity coefficients were calculated for pair-wise combinations of all the genotypes and a dendrogram was constructed to resolve the members of the primary, secondary and tertiary gene pools in the two main groups . cluster i corresponded to the primary gene pool, including all the c. cajan cultivars in sub-cluster ia <dig>  while sub-cluster ia <dig> was represented by a single entry rhynchosia aurea. cluster ib included two genotypes of c. platycarpus, suggesting that it is closer to c. cajan than c. cajanifolius. intra sub-cluster similarity in cluster i ranged from  <dig> % to 52%. cluster ii included the remaining five wild species of the secondary and tertiary gene pool . cluster ii was divided into two sub-clusters iia and iib, at a cut-off similarity index of 26%. the three wild species, namely r. aurea, c. platycarpus  <dig> and  <dig>  showed close relatedness to c. cajan cultivars but were in the tertiary gene pool due to low crossability with cultivated pigeonpea. among the c. cajan cultivars, three pairs- pcmf40/pcmf43- <dig>  pusa 9/kudarat and ps 971/ps  <dig> showed the highest similarity .

in silico analysis of ssr polymorphism between asha and upas 120
one aim of the present investigation was in silico identification of ssr polymorphism between pigeonpea varieties asha and upas  <dig> for the development of an est-based intra-species reference genetic map. tsa contigs were first assembled separately for asha and upas  <dig> using the 454-newbler assembler and then aligned together using lasergene seqman pro™ version  <dig> . <dig> software to obtain the ssr size differences between asha and upas  <dig> varieties. a total of  <dig>  ssr loci were present in the  <dig>  tsa contigs common to asha and upas  <dig>  only  <dig> of these loci were type i ssr  of which  <dig> were polymorphic between asha and upas  <dig> with size differences of 2- <dig> bp based on the in silico alignments. further, only  <dig> of these loci showed allelic size differences of ≥ <dig> bp, which is considered amenable for analysis on gel electrophoresis. for wet laboratory validation of polymorphism we chose these  <dig> ssr loci and designated them as assr <dig> to assr <dig>  four of the markers  did not amplify any pcr product, one marker  showed a larger than expected product size, while nine markers amplified but did not show distinct polymorphism on agarose gel electrophoresis perhaps due to small product size difference , or actual lack of polymorphism. the remaining  <dig> primers  showed distinct size polymorphism between asha and upas  <dig> as expected from the in silico analysis . figure  <dig> presents such an example with assr <dig>  where agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the expected  <dig> bp size difference between asha and upas <dig> and a mendelian segregation ratio of 1:2: <dig> in the f <dig> mapping population derived from the cross between asha and upas  <dig>  thus, 40% of the  <dig> in silico identified polymorphic ssr loci were validated successfully by wet laboratory analysis.

discussion
conventional breeding of pigeonpea has continued entirely without the aid of molecular methods and made limited use of germplasm resources, resulting in a very narrow genetic base in the domesticated species. as a consequence, pigeonpea genetic improvement programs have made relatively little progress in addressing the primary constraints to crop production, which include a range of abiotic  and biotic  stresses. with the advent of next generation sequencing technologies several crop legumes have recently been subjected to intensive analyses, making marker-assisted breeding a reality  <cit> . margulis et al.  <cit>  demonstrated a 100-fold sequencing capability with  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing but with relatively lower accuracy at the homopolymer positions than sanger-based capillary electrophoresis sequencing. we used  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing to develop an extensive collection of expressed sequence reads from two parental pigeonpea cultivars and mined and validated a comprehensive set of genic-ssr markers.

a total of  <dig>  million high quality sequence reads were assembled to generate  <dig>  tsa unigene contigs, which together represented a large fraction of the pigeonpea transcriptome and helped develop a comprehensive set of genic-ssr markers. application of a subset of these markers in pigeonpea was sufficient to assess the genetic diversity among cultivars and position domesticated accessions relative to related species and genera. these markers represent a significant addition to the limited set of genic-ssr markers available in pigeonpea  <cit> .

only  <dig> % of the ssr-containing unigene sequences showed significant hits in the ncbi non-redundant protein database. this may be due to:  est fragments sequenced directly instead of after cloning; this leads to truly random sequencing of all the expressed genes that may facilitate the discovery of new rare transcripts as evidenced by emrich et al.  <cit> ; or  unique contigs being part of a consensus sequence representing 3'-utrs; c-termini or 3' sequences which are often less conserved than other transcript regions  <cit> .

the deep transcriptome sequence data allowed the discovery of a set of  <dig>  perfect ssr loci of ≥ <dig> bp length in pigeonpea. about  <dig> % of the pigeonpea tsa unigene contigs possessed at least one ssr- similar to previously reported ssr prevalence in the ests of wheat , higher than grapes , barley  and flax , but lower than coffee   <cit> . the genic-ssr frequency also depended on the parameters used in exploring ssr markers, e.g. the repeat length and number of repeat unit thresholds. the abundance of genic-ssr  in pigeonpea was  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  in rice,  <dig>  in wheat,  <dig>  in soybean,  <dig>  in tomato,  <dig>  in arabidopsis, and  <dig>  in cotton  <cit> . differences in genic-ssr abundance could be partly due to the size of the est unigene assembly dataset and use of different search criteria and data mining tools  <cit> . frequency distribution of est-ssr motifs in our study was not comparable with earlier work on pigeonpea by raju et al.  <cit>  because we developed tsa unigene contigs using flx- <dig> sequencing, instead of sanger sequencing. the number of ssrs identified in the present study was  <dig>  from  <dig>  unigene sequences, whereas raju et al. described  <dig>  ssrs from only  <dig>  unigenes. the main reason for the overestimation of ssr frequency by raju et al. is the inclusion of compound ssrs and homopolymers which are the most frequent repeats.

dinucleotide ssr loci were most frequent in the pigeonpea tsa contigs analyzed here, representing  <dig> % of the ssr loci identified, i.e. about double that of the trinucleotide ssr loci , the second most abundant motifs. this was in agreement with the genic-ssr distribution reported in peach, pumpkin, spruce, coffee and kiwifruit, where dinucleotide repeats are most frequent  <cit> . however, this is in contrast to a number of earlier reports showing trinucleotides as the most abundant class of ssr loci in ests  <cit> . a possible explanation for the high frequency of dinucleotide ssr loci in pigeonpea tsa is that these include large amounts of information representing utrs due to deep transcriptome sequencing. yu et al.  <cit>  reported 19% of dinucleotide repeats in the coding region and 81% in the 5'- and 3'-utrs, whereas 74% of the trinucleotide repeats were in the coding regions and only 26% in utrs. among the  <dig> validated ssr loci with n≥ <dig> bp in the present study, only  <dig>  were dinucleotide repeats and  <dig> were in the utr. most of the dinucleotide ssr loci showed a smaller size range of 10- <dig> bp . our study also showed that the overall proportion of polymorphic ssr markers was much higher in utrs compared to the coding region- there were  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers in utrs , whereas only  <dig> were polymorphic in the coding region, despite  <dig> % of all amplified ssr markers being located in the coding region. this is due to the tendency of sequence conservation in the coding regions.

only 80% of the  <dig> tested ssr primers amplified the target pigeonpea genomic dna. the success rate is comparable to barley, where 67-70% of the primers amplified  <cit> , but higher than sugarcane  and lower than flax   <cit> . a possible explanation for the lack of amplification could be flanking primers extending across a splice site with a large intron or chimeric cdna contigs  <cit> . although the majority  of the designed ssr markers amplified a single expected product size at the annealing temperature of 55°c, we optimized the annealing temperature of  <dig> additional primers to maximize the availability of genic-ssr markers for pigeonpea.

generally genic-ssr markers show a lower level of polymorphism than genomic-ssr markers  <cit> , but in this study the use of type i genic-ssr markers showed a high level of polymorphism. previous diversity studies with pigeonpea species using genomic-ssr markers reported an average of  <dig> - <dig>  alleles per locus with average pic values of  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> . an earlier study with genic-ssr markers in pigeonpea reported the average number of alleles per marker as  <dig> and an average pic value of  <dig>   <cit> . we observed a higher average of  <dig>  alleles per locus and an average pic value of  <dig>  by using type i genic-ssr markers. the possible reasons are:  choice of  <dig> highly polymorphic ssr markers for the diversity assessment on  <dig> genotypes after initial testing of  <dig> markers on eight varieties;  higher depth of coverage generated by the  <dig> gs-flx sequencing technology that produced larger sequence contigs including utrs which are more polymorphic;  use of a diverse genotype set including interspecific derivatives and wild cajanus species for diversity assessment. contrary to other plant species where dinucleotide repeats showed high polymorphism  <cit> , hexanucleotide repeats were highly polymorphic  in pigeonpea genic-ssr markers, followed by pentanucleotides  and trinucleotides . larger repeats have been linked to a higher degree of polymorphism in earlier studies  <cit> ; we also found the maximum polymorphism with 40- <dig> bp ssr length on agarose gel electrophoresis.

on the basis of ssr polymorphism, cluster analysis and earlier diversity studies involving rflp, aflp, rapd, ssr and dart markers, it is concluded that genetic diversity in the pigeonpea gene pool is very low  <cit> . the genic-ssr markers reported here open up new opportunities to assess the genotypic diversity in the pigeonpea germplasm. most of the earlier reported ssr markers in pigeonpea are of genomic origin except for  <dig> genic-ssr markers reported recently  <cit> . this study is the first report a comprehensive set of genic-ssr markers for pigeonpea.

wild species of crop plants are placed in different gene pools based on their crossability with the cultivated species. closely related and easily crossable species are placed in the primary or secondary gene pools, whereas species which are distantly related and are incompatible with the cultivated species, are placed in a tertiary gene pool. species in the primary and secondary gene pools can be readily utilized for varietal improvement. in this study, the "unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean" -based cluster analysis grouped the genotypes according to their gene pool. the variability within the c. cajan cultivars which easily cross-hybridize among themselves formed the primary gene pool , whereas four species that have poor crossability with the c. cajan formed the secondary gene pool . sub cluster ib  and sub-sub cluster ia <dig>  included species from the tertiary gene pool even though they were closely related to c. cajan based on the marker analysis. the varieties of c. cajan showed different levels of similarity, e.g. pcmf  <dig> and pcmf 43- <dig>  both inter-specific derivatives belonging to the short maturity group, shared 52% similarity between them and 40% similarity with pcmf 39- <dig> having similar pedigree. likewise, short duration variety pair  and long duration variety pair  were closer to each other than varieties belonging to different maturity groups. genotypes of secondary and tertiary gene pools clustered separately into two sub-clusters. r. aurea and c. platycarpus belong to the tertiary gene pool due to poor crossability with the cultivated pigeonpea, but they showed genetic similarities with c. cajan. these results are also supported by raju et al.  <cit>  who used  <dig> est-ssrs to study the genetic diversity of  <dig> cultivars and eight accessions of two cajanus species c. platycarpus and c. scarabaeoides. earlier, a close relationship was reported between c. cajanifolius and c. cajan using genomic ssr markers  <cit> , but our study based on genic-ssr markers showed that c. cajanifolius is more distant to c. cajan compared to c. platycarpus. upas  <dig>  ttb  <dig>  pusa dwarf and bahar genotypes belonging to different maturity groups were part of a single cluster. genotypes of secondary and tertiary gene pools clustered separately in two sub-clusters, but r. bracteata which belongs to the tertiary gene pool based on the crossability criteria clustered with genotypes of the secondary gene pool. the closeness between cajanus and rhynchosia is also supported by morphological and genetic evidence, i.e. the presence of strophiole, an important characteristic used to distinguish between the genera. seeds of cajanus and rhynchosia are generally described without strophioles. various species of rhynchosia, even though genetically closer to cajanas, fail to produce hybrids because of reproductive barriers, and therefore rhynchosia and cajanus are classified as separate genera. high resolution mapping of these genotypes using a large number of genomic markers for diversity analysis may provide different results because genic-ssrs represent the transcribed portion of the genome, while the repetitive heterochromatin portion of the genome plays a major role in the evolution of species  <cit> .

this is the first report of development and validation of a comprehensive set of genic-ssr markers in pigeonpea by deep transcriptome sequencing using next generation sequencing technology. a set of  <dig>  genic-ssr markers was developed, and  <dig> ssr markers from this were validated for robust amplification in eight pigeonpea varieties, that will be useful for diversity analysis as well as mapping and tagging of genes and quantitative trait loci for economically important traits in pigeonpea.

CONCLUSIONS
a dataset of  <dig>  tsa unigene contigs derived from  <dig>  million  <dig> gs-flx sequence reads of two pigeonpea varieties was produced. a comprehensive set of  <dig>  genic-ssr markers was developed and  <dig> of these were validated for amplification and polymorphism, which will be useful for the development of molecular maps based on genic markers. of the  <dig>   <dig> highly polymorphic markers identified all the individuals of a set of  <dig> genotypes including cultivars and wild species. due to conservation of genic sequences these markers have a higher chance of transferability across species, compared to genomic ssr markers which show high polymorphism but are less conserved between species. a combination of these genic-ssr markers, single nucleotide polymorphism markers being mined from the tsa contigs assembled in this study and genomic ssr markers developed in other laboratories will be a powerful resource for molecular taxonomic studies and construction of a reference molecular map of the pigeonpea genome. since genic-ssr markers belong to the gene-rich regions of the genome, some of these can be exploited for use in marker-assisted breeding of pigeonpea. therefore, the set of genic-ssr markers developed here is a promising genomic resource.
