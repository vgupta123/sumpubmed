BACKGROUND
adenoviridae are non-enveloped, double-stranded dna viruses with an icosahedral capsid  <cit> . human adenoviruses  belong to the genus mastadenovirus and are classified into six species  that were defined historically as subgenera on the basis of hemagglutination properties  <cit> . subsequently, oncogenic properties in rodents and dna homology were also used to define the subgenus   <cit> . recently a new strain of hadv was discovered and has been classified as hadv- <dig>  representing a putative new species g  <cit> .

human adenoviruses have long been recognized as pathogens causing a broad spectrum of different diseases depending on the type-related organotropism and virulence. for example, infections of the upper respiratory tract are caused by hadv-c <dig>  -c <dig>  -c <dig>  -b <dig>  and -b <dig>  <cit> , the more dangerous infections of the lower respiratory tract mainly by hadv-b <dig>  -b <dig>  -b <dig>  and -e <dig>  <cit> . the types hadv-d <dig>  -d <dig>  and -d <dig> are closely associated with severe epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. gastroenteritis and diarrhoea are caused by the enteric adenoviruses hadv-f <dig> -f <dig> and hadv-a <dig>  which are frequently found in infants and children.

moreover, immunocompromised patients can develop a sepsis-like, disseminated adenovirus syndrome that is associated with high levels of immunosuppression  as a crucial risk factor  <cit> . a wide range of organs can be affected and an effective antiviral therapy is not yet available. consequently, mortality rates of up to 60% were reported  <cit> . disseminated disease is mainly caused by species c adenoviruses. however, in recent decades, hadv-a <dig> has been increasingly reported as a etiologic agent for dissemination in immunosuppressed children following allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation  <cit> .

one of the essential sequence features for hadv types causing dissemination may be the viral rgd  motif of the penton base protein, because hadv-f types lacking the rgd motif have never caused a disseminated infection  in spite of their high prevalence  <cit> . in addition, recent studies have shown that the binding of blood coagulation factor  x to the hadv-c <dig> hexon protein facilitates infection of the liver and could also foster virus dissemination  <cit> . similar to hadv-c <dig>  f ix binding may promote hadv-a <dig> infection of epithelial cells  <cit> .

the outstanding clinical relevance of hadv-a <dig> is also documented by its significant association with immunosuppressed patients in comparison to immunocompetent patients  <cit> . this high incidence may be explained by reactivations of latent  hadv infections, which have been recently described for species c hadv  <cit> . a similar mechanism may be suspected for hadv-a <dig> although any conclusive data on its persistence is still lacking. so far, genetic analysis of hadv-a <dig> strains isolated from hsct patients showed significant differences even in the same clinical centre, suggesting reactivations rather than infection chains of de novo hadv-a <dig> infections  <cit> . however, hadv-a <dig> may also be transmitted easily in a nosocomial setting between immunosuppressed patients, as high amounts of hadv-a <dig> are spread with faeces  <cit> .

in spite of this increasing clinical relevance of hadv-a <dig>  the virus had not yet been completely sequenced. therefore, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the hadv-a <dig> prototype strain in order to search for unique sequence motifs which may be associated with its high virulence. in addition, we compared several virulence associated gene regions  of seven clinical isolates and the hadv-a <dig> prototype.

RESULTS
general properties
the complete genomic sequence of hadv-a <dig> is  <dig>  base pairs in length and was submitted to genbank as am <dig>  the plus strand has a base composition of  <dig> % g,  <dig> % c,  <dig> % a and  <dig> % t. the gc content is  <dig> %. as other mastadenoviruses, hadv-a <dig> is organized into four early, one intermediate and five late transcription units. we identified  <dig> coding regions that are homologue to previously described gene products of other human adenoviruses . the annotation of the predicted coding gene regions is listed in table  <dig> 

phylogeny
phylogenetic analysis of the whole genomic sequence of hadv-a <dig> was performed by using the neighbor-joining method. representative members of all hadv species were included in the analysis. hadv-a <dig> clustered as expected to the species hadv-a, close to hadv-a <dig> .

a global pairwise alignment was constructed using the mvista limited area global alignment of nucleotides   <cit>  in order to compare the predicted whole genomic sequence of hadv-a <dig> to the representative types of each species. the graphical alignments showed the close relationship between hadv-a <dig> and -a <dig> with the exception of the coding regions for immunogenic determinants . interestingly, the early transcription unit e <dig>  which is not under selective pressure by the immune system, also showed a significant divergence between hadv-a <dig> and hadv-a <dig> .

itr
hadv's inverted terminal repeats  and its flanking dna regions exhibit several binding sites for viral proteins and a set of cellular factors for efficient adenoviral dna replication  <cit> . hadv-a31's itrs are  <dig> bp in length. a nuclear factor iii  binding site described as conserved among most human adenoviruses as a 5'atgnnaatga 3' sequence motif   <cit>  was not identified in the hadv-a <dig> itr, but a 5'atgaagtggg 3' sequence at position bp 46- <dig> may function as a binding site for nf-iii. hadv-a <dig> also lacks the classical nf-iii binding motif but has the same 5'atgaagtggg 3' motif as hadv-a <dig> at bp 46- <dig>  the conserved nf-i binding site  was predicted for hadv-a <dig> at position 25- <dig> 

hadv-a <dig> itrs also revealed binding sites for the transcription factors sp <dig> and atfs. the binding of atfs to a 5'tgacgt 3' motif has been shown to be important for efficient viral growth of hadv-c <dig>  <cit> . whereas all other human adenoviruses  reveal exactly this atf binding motif, hadv-31's putative single atf binding site between bp  <dig> -  <dig> showed a c instead of the commonly observed t at the end of the motif. an sp <dig> binding site was present as a gc-rich region between bp  <dig> -  <dig> . the extreme termini of the itrs had the common 5'ctatctatat 3' motif that is required for viral replication and also protects the viral genome by orp-a binding from dnase-i digestion. the core origin of dna replication, which binds the complex of preterminal protein  and dna polymerase, was present in the highly conserved motif 5' ataatatacc 3' between bp  <dig> and  <dig> in hadv-a <dig> 

human elongation factor 1-alpha  is known to be an efficient factor for enhancement of e1a gene region transcription. hadv-a <dig> revealed only two putative ef-1a binding motifs , which are located within the itr region at bp 105- <dig> and 136- <dig>  whereas the five ef-1a binding sites are located upstream from the e1a promoter region of hadv-c <dig>  <cit> .

e1a coding region
e1a is the first gene expressed after adenoviral infection  <cit> . the predicted gene product of the hadv-a <dig> e1a orf was  <dig> amino acids in length with a molecular weight of  <dig>  k. most of the functional sites of e1a proteins are located in conserved regions cr <dig> - cr <dig>  <cit> ; homologue amino acid sequences at corresponding positions were found in hadv-a <dig>  the predicted e1a protein of hadv-a <dig> revealed a sequence  at position  <dig> -  <dig> that is homologue to the e1a protein of hadv-a <dig>  the latter was previously identified as a repressor for the presentation of mhc class i molecules on the surface of infected cells. essential for this function of hadv-a <dig> is a stretch of  <dig> amino acids, which could not be found in the e1a proteins of other hadv species  <cit> .

hadv-a <dig> revealed the essential rb-protein binding motif as a llcye sequence at residues 107- <dig>  a c-terminal binding protein  interacting motif , which is probably equivalent to pldls in other hadv types, was found near the c-terminus of the e1a protein. two zinc finger motifs cslc and cksc, both essential for transactivation of transcription  <cit>  are located in the cr <dig> region.

e1b coding region
two orf in the e1b gene region coded for predicted proteins of  <dig>  k and  <dig>  k molecular weight. the predicted  <dig>  k protein was  <dig> amino acids in length and homologue to the small t-antigen, which is known to have anti-apoptotic features  <cit> . while the stretch of the first  <dig> amino acids of the hadv-a <dig> e1b  <dig>  k protein shared a homology of  <dig> % to the corresponding gene product of hadv-a <dig>  the c-terminus is highly divergent .

the second e1b gene product was a predicted  <dig>  k protein,  <dig> amino acids in length and homologue to the large t-antigen. it defends the virus against the p <dig> mediated antiviral host cell response by binding to the dna linked p <dig> protein directly and repressing its function as a transcriptional activator. in addition to this direct interaction, a complex comprising the large t-antigen, the e <dig> orf  <dig> gene product and a set of cellular cofactors build an e3-ligase-complex that also degrades the p <dig> protein  <cit> . essential for the stability of this complex is a bc-box binding motif lxxxcxxx), present in the predicted e1b  <dig> k gene product of hadv-a <dig> as an alrpdctyki motif at amino acid position 156- <dig> 

amino acid comparison with the predicted large t-antigen of hadv-a <dig> revealed a high sequence divergence  between residues  <dig> -  <dig>  however, the c-terminus of large t-antigen, which was described as essential for repressing the function of p <dig> in hadv-a <dig> infected cells, showed a high sequence homology to hadv-a <dig> 

e <dig> coding region
e <dig> is divided into two transcriptional units, e2a and e2b. transcription of the e <dig> region is controlled by a well characterized rna polymerase ii promoter  on the complementary strand, which is transactivated by e1a and e <dig> orf6/ <dig> gene products. the e <dig> promoter region of hadv-a <dig> was located between bp c25299-c <dig>  it lacked at least one of the typical e2f  binding motifs as described for hadv-c <dig> and -c <dig>  however, a putative binding motif for e4f <dig>  was predicted. e4f <dig> is another cellular transcription factor that stimulates the transcription of e <dig> genes mediated by e1a gene products  <cit> . moreover, the e <dig> promoter of hadv-a <dig> had a binding motif for atf  and a tata-like sequence for binding tbp . within the e2a region an orf for a predicted protein of  <dig>  k was identified. the product was homologue to the dna binding protein  and revealed a zinc-binding domain at amino acid position 229- <dig> .

the e2b region of hadv-a <dig> encoded a predicted  <dig>  k protein homologue to the hadv dna polymerase protein, and a  <dig>  k gene product homologue to the precursor of the terminal protein , both on the complementary strand. the common nuclear localization signal of ptp was present as rlpvrrrrrrlp motif at amino acid position 351- <dig> 

e <dig> coding region
the e <dig> region is known to code for a set of proteins that are not essential for virus replication in vitro but are important factors for interfering with the host immune response  <cit> . six orfs were identified in the e <dig> transcription unit of hadv-a <dig>  encoding putative gene products of the following sizes:  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k, and  <dig>  k. the organization is similar to the e <dig> region of the closely related hadv-a <dig>  <cit> .

the  <dig>  k predicted protein was homologue to a  <dig>  k protein which is present in all hadv types beside the enteric hadv-f <dig> and -f <dig>  the sequence identity between hadv-a <dig> and -a <dig> was comparatively high .

the second and third reading frames, coding for a  <dig>  k  and a  <dig>  k  protein, revealed comparatively low identities of  <dig> % and  <dig> % to homologue e <dig> gene products of hadv-a <dig>  cr <dig> alpha and beta were described as species hadv-a specific gene products  <cit> . prediction of transmembrane domains suggested that both gene products were type ia transmembrane proteins. protein blast search of cr <dig> beta showed homologies between the putative gene product of hadv-a <dig> and proteins of the slam  family. patterns of predicted functional domains of hadv-a <dig> in comparison to hadv-a <dig> and -f <dig> are shown in figure 4a.

the  <dig>  k and  <dig>  k orf of hadv-a <dig> were identified to be homologue to the known rid  alpha and beta proteins, which are present in the e <dig> transcription units of all hadv. both proteins are non-covalently associated integral membrane proteins  <cit> . the n-terminal phosphorylation sites pattern of hadv-a <dig> rid-beta was more similar to hadv-c <dig>  whereas hadv-a <dig> lacked these phosphorylation sites completely . yxxo motifs and proline rich sequence stretches near the c-terminus, which are conserved among all hadv and may be part of a protein interacting domain  <cit> , were identified in the predicted rid beta protein of hadv-a <dig> . yxxo motifs function as signals for transport and internalization into lysosomes/endosomes.

rid alpha is a hydrophobic protein and appears in two isoforms  <cit> . depending on cleavage of the signal peptide, it either functions as a type i or a type ii transmembrane protein. an analogue cleavage pattern was predicted for the rid alpha protein of hadv-a <dig> by using the web based tmhmm v.  <dig>  software. as described for other human adenoviruses dileucine, dileucine-like and yxxo motifs are also present in the cytoplasmatic portion of the hadv-a <dig> rid alpha gene product.

the last orf of the e <dig> region encodes a  <dig>  k protein that is homologue with a sequence identity of  <dig> % to the  <dig>  k protein of hadv-a <dig>  a corresponding protein is present in all species of hadv species  <cit> . it has been shown to be located in the cytosol and nucleolus, functioning as an inhibitor of tnf mediated cell lysis. structure and function analysis of the  <dig>  k of hadv-c <dig> indicate that its biological function does not depend on single conserved subdomains but that critical amino acids are distributed throughout the entire protein. it has been shown that a set of three cysteine residues between amino acid  <dig> and amino acid  <dig> are essential for the function of the protein  <cit> . corresponding cysteine residues were identified in the predicted  <dig>  k protein of hadv-a <dig> 

e <dig> coding region
transcription of the e <dig> region on the complementary strand is stimulated by the e1a gene product and the cellular transcription factor e4f <dig>  an e4f <dig> binding motif acgtcac  was identified in hadv-a <dig> at bp c33513-c <dig> located upstream of the putative tata box at bp c33479-c <dig> 

corresponding to the e <dig> transcription units of other human adenoviruses , six orfs were predicted within the genome of hadv-a <dig>  these orfs encoded for respective proteins of  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k,  <dig>  k and  <dig>  k . the predicted gene product of the hadv-a <dig> orf6/ <dig> exhibited only a single bc-box like motif  slightly different to the consensus motif sequence lxxxcxxx. this is in contrast to hadv-c <dig>  which shows two bc-box motifs that are both required for degradation of p <dig>  <cit> .

virus associated rna
sequence coding for the va rna was predicted by comparison with hadv-a <dig> and is located at bp <dig> -  <dig> in the genome of hadv-a <dig> 

intermediate genes
two proteins are encoded in the adenoviral intermediate gene region, ix and iva <dig>  the protein ix of hadv-a <dig> was predicted as a  <dig>  k protein of  <dig> amino acids in length. it is a structural component of the virus and influences hexon-hexon interaction. a stretch of  <dig> amino acids is conserved among all hadvs and is supposed to be crucial for the incorporation of the protein ix into the capsid. corresponding amino acids were identified in the protein ix of hadv-a <dig> at position 14- <dig>  surprisingly, we identified an rgd motif in the amino acid sequence of hadv-a <dig> protein ix at amino acid position 102- <dig> . this rgd motif is only  <dig> amino acids distant from the c-terminus that is assumed to be exposed on the surface of the virus  <cit> . moreover, the rgd motif is located at the n- terminal end of a coiled coil region predicted by the coils web based software  <cit> . this prediction suggested that the rgd motif is possibly solvent exposed and may be functional in binding to alpha integrins.

the iva <dig> orf is transcribed from the complementary strand and codes for a  <dig>  k protein of  <dig> amino acids in length. the protein iva <dig> of human adenoviruses binds the a-repeat sequences at the left end of the genome and is involved in the process of viral dna packaging and virus assembly. furthermore, it is assumed to have a function as a transcriptional activator of the late adenoviral genes  <cit> .

late genes
the major late transcription unit  encodes the majority of the virus structural proteins and is organized into five subregions l1-l <dig>  the initiation of late gene transcription is controlled by a promoter region that is present in all human adenoviruses and termed as major late promoter   <cit> . based on sequence comparison, the putative inverted caat box  was identified at bp 5633- <dig> and the tata box at position 5684- <dig> in the genome of hadv-a <dig>  the l <dig> transcription unit encodes the 52/ <dig> k and the piiia protein. an orf coding for a  <dig>  k protein as a homologue of 52/ <dig> k that is known to be functionally relevant in the process of virion assembly was predicted. a second orf encodes the putative piiia protein of  <dig>  k that is associated with the hexon protein and present on the outer surface of the virion.

four orfs within the l <dig> region were identified: coding for the penton base protein , proteins v, pvii and the px. the predicted penton base protein of hadv-a <dig> is  <dig> amino acids in length and exhibits an integrin  binding rgd motif at amino acid position 301- <dig>  in addition to the rgd sequence, an ldv motif was present at amino acid position 285- <dig> of hadv-a <dig>  ldv motifs were described as interacting with another group of integrins   <cit> .

the predicted homologue of protein v has a molecular weight of  <dig>  k and is  <dig> amino acids in length. a  <dig>  k gene product is homologue to the pvii, and a predicted product of  <dig>  k represents the px protein of hadv-a <dig>  all three proteins are described as being core proteins and are associated with the virus dna  <cit> . the sequence generated for px protein of hadv-a <dig> was highly divergent from the hadv-a <dig> px sequence previously available in genbank  . therefore, this region was re-sequenced a second time and additionally sequenced for all seven clinical isolates; our previous result was confirmed. most likely, the databank sequence relates to a subtype of hadv-a <dig> or is mislabelled.

the l <dig> transcription unit encodes three proteins; we could identify orf for pvi, the hexon protein  and the virus encoded protease. the predicted pvi protein of hadv-a <dig> is  <dig> amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of  <dig>  k. it revealed two nuclear localization signals  close to its c-terminus. corresponding motifs of hadv-c <dig> play an important role in directing cytoplasmatic proteins to the nucleolus and thus might be functionally active as nuclear localization signals  <cit> . the mature pvi protein is a minor capsid component.

the predicted hexon protein of hadv-a <dig> has a molecular weight of  <dig>  k and a length of  <dig> amino acids. due to its serotype defining main neutralization determinant ε, it was highly divergent from the closely related hadv-a <dig> 

the predicted orfs of the l <dig> region of hadv-a <dig> encode putative proteins of  <dig>  k ,  <dig>  k ,  <dig> k ,  <dig>  k , respectively.

only one orf is present in the l <dig> region of hadv-a <dig>  encoding a  <dig>  k protein of  <dig> amino acids in length, representing the fiber protein , a major structural protein with the highly variable hemagglutination determinant in its terminal knob structure. the fiber shaft was found to be  <dig> amino acids  shorter than the fiber shaft of hadv-a <dig>  we detected a deletion in the 3rd non-consensus β-repeat of hadv-a <dig> fiber shaft and a klgxghxfs motif in the penultimate repeat instead of the classical klgxglxfd/n flexibility consensus motif of other adenovirus serotypes. this could affect the function of the flexibility regions and influence the cell attachment.

comparison of clinical isolates to the prototype sequence
the coding regions of the e1a, e <dig>  e <dig>  penton base, fiber knob, protein ix and px genes of seven clinical isolates were sequenced and compared. all strains have been isolated from paediatric patients with disseminated infections following hsct. overall, the px, ix, e <dig> rid alpha, e <dig> orf  <dig> and orf  <dig> nucleic acid sequences of all isolates were 100% identical to the prototype. the lowest amino acid identity was observed in the e <dig> cr <dig> beta gene with  <dig> %. in table  <dig>  gene product and amino acid substitutions of clinical strains are listed. lowest s/n ratios were calculated for the e <dig> cr <dig> beta , whereas only synonymous mutations were observed in the penton base protein of several clinical isolates. two isolates revealed an amino acid substitution in the penton protein at position  <dig> , which is close to the functional rgd motif and may influence integrin binding. interestingly, all wild type strains revealed the additional rgd motif in protein ix of the hadv-a <dig> prototype strain. all motifs described for the hadv-a <dig> prototype strain were conserved in the clinical isolates.

the coding regions which showed amino acid substitutions in at least one isolate are listed. for each isolate, the sequence positions of amino acid substitution are noted. additionally, the number of mutations in the nucleotide sequence is indicated in brackets.

discussion
we determined the complete  <dig>  base pair genome of the hadv-a <dig> prototype strain and identified  <dig> putative genes. hadv-a <dig> is a highly significant pathogen, which has been frequently isolated from severely affected hsct recipients, and frequently presents itself as a disseminated disease, which is usually caused by species hadv-c  <cit> . experimental data strongly suggested that species hadv-c types have the ability to establish latent infections in mucosal lymphocytes and that stimulation of those cells can cause viral reactivation in cases of immunosuppression  <cit> . especially the early gene products , which counteract host anti-viral defence mechanisms, might play a key role in the process of persistence and reactivation  <cit> . a similar mechanism of persistence and reactivation can be suspected in case of hadv-a <dig>  which would explain its high incidence in immunosuppressed patients. therefore, the early coding regions e1a, e1b and e <dig> of the newly generated hadv-a <dig> prototype sequence were analyzed in detail for functional motifs. moreover, these genome regions of seven hadv-a <dig> wild type strains isolated from immunosuppressed patients were also sequenced in order to clarify whether a highly pathogenic subtype of hadv-a <dig> was circulating in recent years. however, analysis of nucleic acid and predicted amino acid sequences of seven hadv-a <dig> clinical isolates revealed high identity to the prototype strain . non-synonymous mutations in clinical isolates clustered in the e <dig> region, but did not affect previously described and predicted functional sites and motifs   <cit> . an s/n ratio of  <dig>  within the species hadv-a specific cr <dig> beta protein suggested selection of a potentially highly functional e <dig> protein, which is assumed to interact with the immunosurveillance of adenovirus infected cells  <cit> . unfortunately, experimental data about the functions of the e <dig> gene products cr <dig> alpha and beta were not available. therefore, in silico protein analysis of the predicted e <dig> cr <dig> alpha and beta proteins of hadv-a <dig> were performed. interestingly, the e <dig> cr <dig> beta protein of the hadv-a <dig> prototype and all analyzed clinical isolates were predicted to exhibit an immunoglobulin-like  domain, which was predicted neither for the closely related hadv-a <dig> nor for the corresponding e <dig> gene products of the related enteric species f adenoviruses. immunoglobulin-like domains are described to be involved in cell-cell interaction of the immune system  <cit> . a similar domain was previously described as involved in a novel feature of the soluble  <dig> k e <dig> gene product of hadv-d19a adenoviruses  <cit> . functional studies of the  <dig> k protein of hadv-d19a demonstrated proteolytic processing and secretion of the type ia transmembrane protein  <cit> . furthermore, a nk cell binding activity was detected and the immunoglobulin-like domain of the hadv-d19a  <dig> k protein was assumed to interact directly with nk cells, protecting infected cells against lyses  <cit> . for comparison, in silico protein analysis of hadv-a <dig> cr <dig> beta also predicted a type ia transmembrane domain, a cleavage probability of ~83%, a c-terminal sorting motif and various glycosylation sites, all of which are analogous to the confirmed predictions for hadv-d19a e <dig>  <dig> k protein.

in contrast to these predictions for cr <dig> beta, potential functionality of the predicted cr <dig> alpha protein of hadv-a <dig> have remained obscure, since all performed analyses and predictions did not reveal similarities with functional sites or motifs of any e <dig> counterparts of other hadv species. overall, cr <dig> alpha and beta amino acid sequence comparison between hadv-a <dig> and -a <dig> showed a particularly low identity of only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. this is in considerable contrast to corresponding e <dig> gene products of hadv-f <dig> and - <dig>  which had a high intraspecies homology of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. significant differences between both species a adenoviruses were also identified in the theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point  for cr <dig> alpha and beta gene products computed and visualized in virtual 2d gel analysis . these considerable differences between hadv-a <dig> and -a <dig> in the primary structure, protein size, pi and predicted functional domains consequently indicated differences in protein function and might be an important feature in explaining the described higher virulence of hadv-a <dig> 

comparison of the other e <dig> gene products,  <dig>  k, rid alpha, rid beta and  <dig>  k, revealed sequence identities between  <dig> and 96% with hadv-a <dig>  with the exception of predicted phosphorylation sites of rid beta , previously described functional sites and motifs are conserved in hadv-a <dig> and hadv-a <dig>  suggesting a comparable functionality. as determined for hadv-a <dig> and species f adenoviruses, the e <dig> transcription unit of hadv-a <dig> also lacked the extensively studied gp  <dig> k protein, which down regulates the expression of mhc i molecules and nk activation receptors  <cit> . as a substitute for this important immune escape mechanism, the e1a gene product of hadv-a <dig> was identified to down regulate the expression of mhc class i molecules by interfering with the transcription of mhc i gene products  <cit> . this unique feature can be assumed for the e1a protein of hadv-a <dig> as well, because amino acid stretches of hadv-a <dig>  which have been identified as essential for this mechanism, were identified in the predicted e1a gene product of hadv-a <dig> at corresponding positions. while the e1a protein is known to have pro-apoptotic features, the e1b  <dig> k gene product of hadv-c <dig> shares homology with the cellular anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> protein and interferes with a set of different cellular pro-apoptotic proteins , thus protecting infected cells against apoptosis  <cit> . comparison of the e1b  <dig> k small t- antigen homologue of hadv-a <dig> with hadv-a <dig> revealed high divergences of the c-terminus. since the e1b  <dig> k c-terminus of hadv-c <dig> has been identified as exhibiting a functional domain that influences the lateral viral spread of hadv-c <dig> by interfering with cellular apoptotic pathways  <cit> , the observed divergence between hadv-a <dig> and -a <dig> might have functional relevance.

in addition to the capability of persistence and of reactivation by interfering with the host immune response, the capacity for dissemination seems to be essential for a highly pathogenic hadv subtype. for example, an outbreak of the strictly enterotropic hadv-f <dig> did not cause any fatalities in paediatric hsct recipients  <cit> , which might be due to the missing integrin binding rgd motif within the penton protein of species f adenoviruses. since fatal dissemination of adenoviruses affects various organic systems, a more promiscuous behaviour in cell attachment and entry can be assumed to be favourable  <cit> . interestingly, the protein ix of hadv-a <dig> revealed an rgd motif at amino acid position  <dig> -  <dig>  which is conserved within all seven analyzed clinical isolates. this rgd motif is only  <dig> residues distant from the c - terminus, and it is unique among all sequenced human adenoviruses. as described previously, the c-terminus of hadv protein ix is exposed on the outer surface of the virion  <cit> . it was shown for protein ix of badv- <dig>  which is  <dig> amino acids in length that the n-terminus  and the central region  have immunogenic sites but are not exposed on the outer surface of the virion  <cit> . so far, no structural data about the exposed region of the c-terminus of protein ix of hadv-a <dig> is available, but the observations for badv- <dig> indicate that the amino acid stretch of the protein ix of hadv-a <dig> that contains the rgd motif might be present on the outer surface of the virion. as the hadv-a <dig> fiber shaft is shorter and probably less flexible than the fiber shaft of hadv-a <dig>  a functional binding of the secondary cellular receptor to the rgd motif of protein ix instead of the rgd motif in the penton base may be possible or even preferred. moreover, the construction of adenoviral vectors with an incorporated rgd motif within the c - terminus of protein ix has demonstrated that the additional rgd motif resulted in a significant augmentation of fiber independent infection of car-deficient cell types  <cit> . therefore, the additional rgd motif within the protein ix hadv-a <dig> might lead to a more effective targeting and internalization, and could be a factor in increased transmission and infectivity of the virus.

in addition to protein ix, sequence comparison of the cellular receptor binding sites of the penton protein of the clinical isolates with the hadv-a <dig> prototype revealed an amino acid substitution  in two clinical isolates. this substitution is close to the functional rgd motif and may influence integrin binding. moreover, a low s/n ratio of  <dig>   for the fiber knob indicated selective pressure on a major structural protein of the clinical isolates.

overall, the sequence divergence of the isolated clinical strains in comparison to the prototype sequence was determined to range between  <dig>  and 100%. these results suggested that all isolated strains were closely related to the prototype; a single outbreak subtype associated with severe disease in stem cell transplant recipients was not identified . this is in congruence with previous results of rflp analysis of  <dig> hadv-a <dig> wild type isolates from immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts, where a wide variety of slightly genetically different subtypes of hadv-a <dig> was described  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, studying the hadv-a <dig> prototype seemed to be sufficient to elucidate the high incidence and disease burden in immunosuppressed patients because hadv-a <dig> strains recently circulating in immunocompromised patients were closely related to the prototype. unique motifs of the hadv-a <dig> e <dig> and e <dig> regions may provide immune modulation and perhaps virus persistence. the additional rgd motif of protein ix may promote promiscuous tropism for various tissues and enhance dissemination. further studies of its biological relevance in vivo/in vitro are necessary to clarify its potentially unique characteristics.
