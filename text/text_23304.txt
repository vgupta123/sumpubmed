BACKGROUND
glioblastoma multiforme  is the most common and most aggressive type of primary brain tumor, accounting for 52% of all primary brain tumor cases and 20% of all intracranial tumors  <cit> . primary gbm arise de novo, without any history of pre-existing lower-grade tumor, whereas secondary gbm have clinical, radiologic, or histopathologic evidence of malignant progression from pre-existing lower-grade tumor  <cit> . in the past two decades, the molecular mechanisms, genetics and paths to treatment of glioblastoma have extensively been studied  <cit> . however, the causes and pathogenesis of glioblastoma have not been indentified clearly. with the continuing improvement of high-throughput genomic technologies, it is now feasible to survey human cancer genomes comprehensively. the cancer genome atlas  aims to catalogue and discover major cancer-causing genome alterations in large cohorts of human tumors through integrated multi-dimensional analyses  <cit> . glioblastoma is the first cancer studied by tcga. to identify the genetic alterations in glioblastoma, we investigated the expression profiles of gene and microrna.

micrornas  are single-stranded short coding rna molecules of about  <dig> nucleotides in length, which usually repress gene expression by binding at the 3’utr region of target gene  <cit> . the expressions of micrornas are found to be highly different in organ development and tissue differentiation  <cit> . moreover, many micrornas have been found to associate with apoptosis and cancer, suggesting they function as oncogene or tumor suppressor gene  <cit> . in our study, we examined the expression levels of  <dig> human mirnas in glioblastoma and indentify a group of micrornas whose expression is significantly altered in this tumor. we also indentified the significantly altered gene expression and pathways related to glioblastoma.

RESULTS
all types of data were acquired from tcga project  <cit>  . gene expression microarrays were performed on affymetrix ht human genome u <dig> array plate set by massachusetts institute of technology . level three data gave calls for genes per sample after probeset-level and gene-level robust multiarray analysis  until the most recent update on sep.  <dig>   <dig>  after calculation the average expression values for duplicated samples, finally  <dig> tumor tissue samples,  <dig> normal tissues and  <dig> cell line sample from glioblastomas patients were used for differential expression analysis. microrna expression experiments were performed on agilent  <dig> x 15khuman microrna-specific microarray by universities of north carolina . there are  <dig> micrornas  and  <dig> tumor tissue samples,  <dig> normal tissue samples available in level three data  until the most recent update on nov.  <dig>   <dig>  as it is very difficult to get the brain tissue samples from normal people, the control samples are all from the adjacent normal tissues of glioblastomas patients. thus we focus on detecting the effect of somatic difference on disease, which is also a common approach in many other cancer studies. we used  <dig> samples for gene expression and pathway analysis,  <dig> samples for microrna expression analysis,  <dig> samples common in microrna and gene expression datasets for mirna targets analysis.

gene expression analysis
a total of  <dig>  genes were identified to be significantly differentially expressed between tumour and normal tissues. the results were given in additional file  <dig>  to further investigate the function of these differentially expressed genes, we used david  <cit> , bioinformatics resources and pathway analysis  <cit>  for systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists.  <dig>  of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes had annotations in david functional annotation tools. we carried out gene set enrichment analysis to indentify the most enriched gene function annotation terms   <cit>  in the list of  <dig>  annotated differentially expressed genes.  the top ten enriched go terms in the list of differentially expressed genes were shown in table  <dig>  suggesting these genes were enriched in brain and mainly associated with nervous system development and function. the detailed information, for example, genes which shared the go terms was given in additional file  <dig>

david also could cluster similar functional go terms together. the first two enriched go term groups in the differentially expressed gene list were all the function terms relevant to brain and neuron. they were: 1) goterm cellular component including five terms: neuron projection, cell projection, dendrite, cell soma, and axon.  <dig> genes belong to this cluster including cdk <dig> , sncg , uchl <dig> , freq.

according to ncbi entrez gene annotation  <cit> , it was reported that the deregulation of gene cdk <dig> causes neuronal death and neurodegenerative diseases. gene sncg encodes a member of the synuclein family of proteins which are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. mutations in this gene have also been associated with breast tumor development. gene uchl <dig> is specifically expressed in the neurons and in cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. mutations in this gene may be associated with parkinson disease. freq gene encodes calcium-binding proteins expressed predominantly in neurons. the protein encoded by this gene is associated with secretory granules and modulates synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. 2) goterm biological process including twenty one terms: synaptic transmission; transmission of nerve impulse; neurotransmitter secretion; regulated secretory pathway; generation of a signal involved in cell-cell signaling; regulation of neurotransmitter levels; neurological system process; cell-cell signaling; exocytosis; snare binding; secretory pathway and so on. a total of  <dig> genes belong to this cluster. the detailed information for this two go term groups were given in additional file  <dig> 

pathway analysis
we first used algorithm proposed in tappa   <cit>  for pathway analysis. the results revealed that  <dig> pathways were significantly associated with glioblastoma . the  <dig> associated pathways belonged to  <dig> functional groups, among which cell signaling, neuroscience, immunology and expression were the most enriched pathway groups. glioma pathway was the only significant pathway in the cancer functional group with p-value=  <dig>  × 10– <dig>  similar to the go terms enrichment analysis, we used david functional annotation tools to indentify which pathways were most enriched in the list of differentially expressed genes. the  <dig> significant pathways were also given in additional file  <dig>  cell signaling, signal transduction, apoptosis and neuroscience were the most enriched pathway groups. a total of  <dig> significant pathways found by both methods were shown in additional file  <dig>  the detailed genes information involved in the over-represented pathways was also provided. long-term potentiation and calcium signaling pathway, were the most significantly enriched pathways with p-value  <dig>  × 10– <dig> and  <dig>  × 10– <dig>  respectively. there were 11significant cell signaling pathways,  <dig> significant apoptosis pathways,  <dig> significant signal transduction pathways,  <dig> significant immunology pathways,  <dig> significant neuroscience pathways and  <dig> significant nervous system pathways, . the results suggested that the differentially expressed genes were most involved in signal, apoptosis and neuroscience pathways. take long-term potentiation pathway as an example, figure  <dig> show all the genes in this pathway, hippocampal long-term potentiation  is a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy, is the molecular basis for learning and memory.  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in this pathway were significant over expressed genes and were highlighted in blue and  <dig> were under expressed and were highlighted in red. 

analysis of differential expression of microrna
a total of  <dig> micrornas were significantly differentially expressed between tumor and normal tissues . to examine whether these mirnas were associated with glioblastoma, we used mir2disease  <cit>  to validate our results . mir2disease provides a comprehensive literature reported resource of mirna deregulation in various human diseases. from the data in mir2disease,  <dig> of the  <dig> significant mirnas have been reported to associate with  <dig> diseases, among them,  <dig> mirnas are associated with  <dig> cancers and brain diseases.  <dig> of those mirnas have been reported to induce glioblastoma/ glioblastoma multiforme/neuroblastoma  and the expression pattern of mirna in published literatures is exactly the same as that in our data. table  <dig> gave the p-value, expression pattern, disease and references for the  <dig> mirnas. we inferred that the other  <dig> mirnas which were related to other cancers and brain diseases may also be important for carcinogenesis in brain. however, further experiment validations were required to confirm our results. among the  <dig> significant mirnas,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated.

exp means whether the expression pattern of microrna is up-regulated or down- regulated, comparing the average expression value in tumor tissues and average expression value in normal tissues. gbm: glioblastoma multiforme, nb: neuroblastoma.

to further examine the function of those significant mirnas, we need to find the target gene of mirnas associated with glioblastomas. so we carried out the regression analysis for mirna and gene expression.

the regulation of gene expression by microrna
mirna has been thought to promote degradation of target mrna or suppress translation of corresponding protein by matching with mrna in the 3’-utr region <cit> . there is no doubt that mirnas perform various biological functions through regulation of gene expression. to reveal the mechanisms of how mirna regulates gene expression in gbm, we identified target genes of mirnas and constructed mirna target networks. since mirnas repress the expression of its target gene, the first step was to test the inverse relationship between the expression profile of mirna and that of its potential targets. to achieve this, we regressed the expression of target mrna on the expression of mirnas and select mrna with significant negative regression coefficients as mirna targets. p-value for declaring significant evidence of mirna target was  <dig>  × 10– <dig>  the second step was to conduct sequence analysis which used sequence complementarities of mirna and its target site to predict potential mirna target genes. to achieve this, we use experimentally verified and predicted mirna targets data from three mirnas databases: mir2disease <cit> , tarbase  <cit>  and mirbase <cit> . mir2disease  and tarbase  provided experimentally verified microrna target genes. mirbase predicted the target gene of mirna by miranda algorithm  <cit> , where the predicted target genes and mirnas could be downloaded directly .

we compiled  <dig>  differentially expressed mrnas and  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas data in  <dig> tumor tissue sample and  <dig> normal tissue samples. we found two experimentally confirmed results. the literature reported that the in nasopharyngeal carcinomas underexpressed hsa-mir-29c = <dig> ) target overexpressed gene col4a1= <dig> )  <cit> . in our result, down-regulated hsa-mir-29c  targets over-expressed gene col4a <dig>  with regression β = – <dig>  and p=  <dig>  × 10– <dig>  we conclude that hsa-mir-29c is also an important mirna in glioblastomas. another experiment validated targets gene was ldoc <dig> targeted by has-mir- <dig> <cit> . the known oncogenic mirna hsa-mir- <dig> can regulate a set of target genes including ldoc <dig>  a regulator of apoptosis  <cit> . our results showed that hsa-mir- <dig> was over-expressed  and targets under-expressed gene ldoc <dig>  with regression β = – <dig>  and p=  <dig>  × 10– <dig>  we inferred that hsa-mir- <dig> could induce cancer through regulation of apoptosis gene ldoc <dig> in glioblastomas.

for predicted targets in mirbase, we found  <dig>  matched mirna-gene pairs including  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> genes .  <dig> down-regulated mirnas target  <dig> overexpressed genes while  <dig> up-regulated micrornas target  <dig> underexpressed genes. the up and down-regulated mirna-gene pairs were shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> 

the  <dig> target genes were a subset of the  <dig> significant differentially expressed genes. we examined which pathways were these genes enriched in and compared them with the previous results.  <dig> pathways were significant by fisher exact test in david,  <dig> of which were the same as the pathways identified from the previous sections: epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection,cholera - infection, long-term potentiation, calcium signaling pathway, neurodegenerative diseases, long-term depression, gap junction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. three new enriched pathways include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , alzheimer’s disease, wnt signaling pathway. these differentially expressed genes were also most involved in signal and neuroscience pathways.

to investigate the function of the  <dig> target genes, we searched the tsgdb  <cit>   and dna-tumor suppressor and oncogene database  <cit>  and we found eight tumor suppressor genes apc, tp <dig>  bin <dig>  btg <dig>  cdk2ap <dig>  ldoc <dig>  rassf <dig>  wfdc <dig> and three oncogenes: mcf <dig>  mpl, thra.

according to ncbi entrez gene annotation  <cit> , apc encodes a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the wnt signaling pathway. it is also involved in other processes including cell migration and adhesion, transcriptional activation, and apoptosis. tp <dig> encodes tumor protein p <dig>  which responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, dna repair, or changes in metabolism. bin <dig> encodes several isoforms of a nucleocytoplasmic adaptor protein, one of which was initially identified as a myc-interacting protein with features of a tumor suppressor. isoforms that are expressed in the central nervous system may be involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and may interact with dynanim, synaptojanin, endophilin, and clathrin. ldoc <dig> is thought to regulate the transcriptional response mediated by the nuclear factor kappa b . the gene has been proposed as a tumor suppressor gene whose protein product may have an important role in the development and/or progression of some cancers. rassf <dig> encoded protein was found to interact with dna repair protein xpa. the protein was also shown to inhibit the accumulation of cyclin d <dig>  and thus induce cell cycle arrest. wfdc <dig> gene is mapped to chromosome 16q <dig>  an area of frequent loss of heterozygosity in many cancers. owing to its location and a possible growth inhibitory property of its gene product, this gene is suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene. mcf <dig> is a member of a large family of gdp-gtp exchange factors that modulate the activity of small gtpases of the rho family. five-prime recombinations result in the loss of n-terminal codons, producing mcf <dig> variants with oncogenic potential.

to further investigate the function of target genes, we identified the mirna targeted pathways by right-tail fisher exact test, which tested enrichment of pathways in the mirna target gene set. a total of  <dig> pathways targeted by  <dig> mirnas were listed in additional file  <dig> after bonferroni correction for multiple tests . many of the pathways were targeted by more than one mirna. we shown  <dig> pathways which were targeted by more than  <dig> mirnas in figure  <dig>  long-term potentiation  was targeted by  <dig>  mirnas and nitric oxide signalling  was targeted by  <dig>  mirnas. we can see that the differentially expressed mirnas most frequently targeted genes in cell signalling and nervous system. the red bar gave the negative logarithm with  <dig> base of average p-value indicating the significance of enrichment of the pathway in the mirna targets. the dna replication pathway and the cell cycle pathway have the smallest average p-value  <dig>  × 10– <dig> and the second smallest p- value  <dig>  × 10– <dig>  p-values of long-term potentiation pathway  and nitric oxide signalling pathway  were also small.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we performed detailed analysis of differential expression of gene and mirna between tumor tissues and normal brain tissues in glioblastomas. we also performed gene sets enrichment analysis to find the enriched go terms and pathways. most of the genes were enriched in nervous system associated go terms and cell signaling and neuroscience associated pathways.  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were related to glioblastoma multiforme or neuroblastoma. to study the regulation of gene expression by mirna, we combined the sequence predicted mirna targets in mirbase database, experiment validated mirna targets in tarbase and mir2disease database with our predictions from the gene and mirna expression profiles and found  <dig> experiment validated targets and  <dig>  predicted targets. further function analysis of target genes suggests that mirnas most frequently targeted genes in cell signalling and nervous system. however, the number of normal tissues in the studies is small. more samples are needed for further investigation.
