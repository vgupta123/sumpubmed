BACKGROUND
recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have revealed that actinomycetes carry approximately  <dig> biosynthetic gene clusters and thus have huge potential to produce natural products. however, in practice, the majority of the biosynthetic gene clusters remain silent under standard laboratory conditions. therefore, the main challenge in the field is to access the hidden biosynthetic potential of actinobacteria. one approach is to clone the gene cluster on a cosmid or bac, redesign it and then express it in a well characterised bacterial host. while identification and cloning of the gene clusters is rather straightforward, successfully expressing them in heterologous hosts remains challenging.

s. albus j <dig> has long been known as a suitable host for the heterologous production of versatile secondary metabolites, ranging from marine micromonospora secondary metabolites  <cit>  to potent anticancer agents  <cit> . for example, this strain was used to express steffimycin biosynthetic genes  <cit> , as well as fredericamycin  <cit> , isomigrastatin  <cit> , napyradiomycin  <cit> , cyclooctatin  <cit> , thiocoraline  <cit> , and moenomycin  <cit>  biosynthetic gene clusters. s. albus j <dig> has a valine- and isoleucine-auxotrophic phenotype and is defective in the sali  restriction-modification system, which allows it to be genetically manipulated in a straightforward fashion. its complete genomic sequence highlighted its naturally minimised size but also provided new directions for s. albus applications.

recent attempts to construct and improve a model host for the heterologous expression of genes encoding secondary metabolites have done so by deleting nonessential genes  <cit> . however, the constructed s. avermitilis strain still possesses considerably larger chromosome than that of s. albus j <dig>  genomic information can provide us with additional possibilities for optimising a given strain for heterologous production and to develop methods for the activation of otherwise silent clusters. we present the complete sequence of the s. albus j <dig> genome and compare it to other streptomycetes whose genomes have been sequenced. moreover, detailed transcriptome time series of  <dig>   <dig> and 60 hours of shake-flask cultures of s. albus j <dig> have been used to profile gene expression.

RESULTS
general features of the s. albus j <dig> genome
at  <dig> ,649 bp, s. albus is one of the smallest streptomyces genomes, along with s. cattleya; however, the latter also contains a megaplasmid pscat . the genome size is an interesting feature of streptomycetes biology, and the availability of its complete genomic sequence made it possible for us to attempt to explain this phenomenon. deep analysis of chromosomal genes has shown that s. albus tends to reduce the number of orthologous groups of genes. it has also the highest known gc content  of streptomycetes. the main features of the single chromosome sequence are shown in table  <dig>  unlike those of other streptomycetes genomes, the single chromosome includes seven rrna operons  and  <dig> trna genes . the presence of seven rrna operons might explain the exceptionally fast growth rate and versatility of this strain  <cit> .

the chromosome of s. albus j <dig> contains  <dig> predicted protein coding sequences . of these cds,  <dig>  could be could be ascribed putative functions, while the remaining  <dig> orfs  were annotated as genes that code for hypothetical proteins. the origin of replication showed perfect symmetry and is situated exactly in the middle of the chromosome, located at 580 bp left of the centre, at  <dig>  <dig> 111– <dig>  <dig> 244 bp – this region contains  <dig> tandem dnaa box-like sequences and is flanked by the dnaa and dnan genes. the central “core” that contains essential genes comprises nearly the whole chromosome from approximately  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, while the “arms” were much smaller in comparison to those of s. coelicolor, with lengths of approximately  <dig>  mb  and  <dig>  mb . therefore, its genomic topology is quite minimal compared to other sequenced actinomycetes genomes .

plasticity and receptivity
putative transposase genes are found throughout the chromosome in intact, truncated and frameshifted forms. unlike s. coelicolor, in which transposases are concentrated on arms , virtually all insertion elements in s. albus are found in the core region . as such, the sheer distribution of mobile elements could be indicative of recent genomic perturbations. of the  <dig> predicted transposase coding sequences,  <dig> form simple insertion elements, while the remainder are not bounded by inverted repeats. most of them fall into  <dig> families, such as is112- and is1647-like elements. notably,  <dig> putative transposase genes lie to the left of oric and correlate with greater variation in gc-content dna composition in the left half of the chromosome . a high degree of horizontal gene transfer can be observed 370 kb left of oric , which is a region containing below average gc-content and multiple insertions of mobile elements.

as previously demonstrated  <cit> , one of the is <dig> insertion elements disrupted the gene for the restriction enzyme sali. we also identified that another is <dig> element is inserted into the gene of dna methyltransferase subunit of the type i restriction-modification system. in addition, s. albus has only three restriction endonucleases and four site-specific methyltransferases. interestingly, s. albus lacks the dnda-e operon involved in dna phosphothiolation  present in s. lividans tk <dig>  <cit> , which explains why the given strain does not prevent incoming dna from adding to exceptionally high transfer rates.

establishing strain ancestry
the taxonomic position of s. albus j <dig> within the s. albus clade was obscure. first mention of this strain occurred in  <dig>  <cit> , in which j <dig> was referred to as a sali system-deficient strain derived from s. albus g. although, the origin of s. albus g is also unknown, it was used as one of s. albus strains in  <dig>  <cit>  to analyse the ll-diaminopinielic acid containing peptidoglycans of streptomycetes. therefore, the interesting results of the initial attempts to study the s. albus j <dig> genome encouraged us to clarify the strain’s taxonomic position. the sequences of the 16s rrna genes from all s. albus strains available in genbank database  were compared. according to our analysis, s. albus j <dig> falls into one clade with strains s. albus subsp. albus nbrc  <dig>  nbrc  <dig> and s. albus dsm  <dig>  most other strains of s. albus subsp. albus cluster very closely in one clade and share 100% sequence similarity with only one exception – dsm  <dig> .

comparative overview
we compared the chromosomes of three streptomyces species, namely s. albus, s. coelicolor a <dig>  <cit> , and s. bingchenggensis <cit>  , in order to establish the loss of regions and functions through the evolution of j <dig>  dot plots generated via nucmer software clearly demonstrated the existence of a highly conserved internal core region of each chromosome even when several inversions were found . relative to the s. bingchenggensis bcw- <dig> genome, s. albus j <dig> lacks  <dig>  mb on its chromosomal arms. we clustered s. albus j <dig>  s. coelicolor a <dig>  and s. bingchenggensis bcw- <dig> proteins using the blastclust program with a threshold of 60% identity plus 70% length coverage . as such, 2811 s. albus j <dig> proteins , 2947 s. coelicolor a <dig> proteins , and 2988 s. bingchenggensis bcw- <dig> proteins  were classified into  <dig> clusters that are commonly present in these three species. we also found  <dig> clusters that are absent in s. albus but present in both s. coelicolor a <dig> and s. bingchenggensis.

s. albus lacks the whie gene cluster , which is involved in the biosynthesis of an aromatic-polyketide spore pigment  <cit> . additionally, we found that the bldk genes , which encode a peptide transporter involved in morphological development in s. coelicolor a <dig>  <cit> , are not present in s. albus. however, s. albus contains multiple other peptide transporter systems, one of which may function as the bldk system.

streptomyces sp. linear plasmids and linear chromosomes usually contain conserved terminal palindromic sequences bound to the conserved telomeric proteins tap and tpg, which are encoded by the tap and tpg genes, respectively  <cit> . however, we were not able to identify the tpg gene in s. albus. a gene-encoding tap domain-containing protein is located on the right end of chromosome  and upstream of a pseudogene of protein with dna-binding properties. however, as in the case of s. griseus, these genes appear to be non-functional  <cit> . while kirby et al.  <cit>  noted that s. albus lacks these genes possibly due to circular chromosome, this seems not to be the case, as the only replicon it has is linear. therefore, we assumed that s. albus acquired a novel pair of tpg and tap proteins that have yet to be identified, as it was described for multiple linear streptomycetes plasmids  <cit> .

another interesting feature of s. albus genome is the absence of the gamma-butyrolactone system. we were not able to identify genes for signal molecules biosynthesis with the exception of one gene-coding protein of the tetr family, which shows homology to gamma-butyrolactone binding protein. taking into account the size of the s. albus genome, we suggest that it was lost during chromosomal rearrangements. the a-factor instability of s. griseus is well known and is explained by the location of the afsa gene in the vicinity of one end of the chromosome  <cit> . therefore, due to deregulated signalling mechanisms, this strain could have acquired a genuine, permanent capability of heterologous production of secondary metabolites.

minimising genetic duplicates
a total of  <dig> genes  are predicted to be involved in regulation. s. albus j <dig> codes for  <dig> sigma factors, which is a small number relative to other streptomycetes, such as s. coelicolor  and s. avermitilis , etc. of these  <dig> sigma factors,  <dig> are “ecf”  sigma factors, which respond to external stimuli and activate genes involved in responses to different stresses, cell-wall homeostasis and aerial mycelium development. as with other streptomycetes, s. albus j <dig> also has abundant two-component regulatory systems. our analysis has revealed the presence of  <dig> sensor kinase genes,  <dig> of which lie adjacent to genes encoding response regulators that form two-component systems. in addition, there are  <dig> orphan response regulators encoded in this genome. in comparison, the s. coelicolor genome encodes  <dig> two-component systems  <cit> . there are also  <dig> genes encoding serine/threonine protein kinases in s. albus genome. as the number of two-component signal transduction systems encoded by a bacterial genome usually is proportional to the size of the genome  <cit>  and reflects the range of signals to which bacteria can respond  <cit> , we estimate that signal transduction is one area in which s. albus has retained the majority of its functions .

the genes encoding members of previously described regulator many families such as lysr, laci, rok, gntr, tetr, iclr, arac, asnc, arsr, deor, marr and merr are present in the s. albus j <dig> genome. in addition we identified  <dig> putative dna-binding proteins. a total of  <dig> genes  appear to be involved in transport into or out of the cell, the majority of which are abc transporters. among these are permeases, ion-, amino acid-, peptide- or sugar-binding transporters, or atp-driven membrane transporters. in addition, s. albus j <dig> has features that still allow extensive exploitation of rich media sources. a wide range of degrading enzymes, including multiple proteinases/peptidases, seven chitinases, two glucanases, two amylases and one cellulase are predicted to be secreted from the cell. presumably, these enzymes play a key role in breaking down the heterogeneous alternative food sources in soil.

having all the necessary features of a streptomyces genome, s. albus tends to exhibit minimised duplication of genes and operons. for example, s. albus contains one gene for chloramphenicol resistance, while s. coelicolor carries two genes: clmr <dig> and clmr <dig>  in s. coelicolor, two sets of genes are responsible for the biosynthesis of wall teichoic acids : sco2589-sco <dig> and sco <dig>  sco <dig>  <cit> . among these, glycosyltransferases play a central role for wta production  <cit> , including sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  sco <dig>  s. albus contains only three genes for such glycosyltransferases: xnr_ <dig>  xnr_ <dig> and xnr_ <dig>  all of which are located in a single cluster.

the s. albus genome has also been minimised in regard to the chaplin family proteins. the chaplins are surface-active proteins that comprise two classes: short chaplins and long chaplins  <cit> . the number of short and long chaplins varies from species to species. s. coelicolor has three long chaplins  and five short chaplins . chpc, chpe and chph are a minimal set conserved among streptomycetes  <cit> . s. albus contains orthologs of those three short chaplins, xnr_ <dig> , xnr_ <dig>  and xnr_ <dig>  and of two long chaplins, xnr_ <dig>  and xnr_ <dig> .

s. coelicolor carries three operons for nitrate reductase complexes, where narg plays central role and there are three nar genes – sco <dig> , sco <dig>  and sco <dig> . in contrast, s. albus contains only one cluster of genes for nitrate reductase, in which xnr_ <dig>  codes for the putative alpha chain of nitrate reductase. additionally, j <dig> contains only one cluster of genes for gas vesicle synthesis: xnr_ <dig> - xnr_ <dig> 

genes for antibiotic resistance
the chromosome of s. albus helps to explain another distinctive characteristic of its laboratory cultivation: that the bacterium’s spectrum of resistance is not as diverse relative to s. coelicolor . there are  <dig> beta-lactamase genes and  <dig> dioxygenases related to the bleomycin resistance proteins,  <dig> rrna methyltransferases,  <dig> aminoglycoside acetyltransferases and  <dig> other genes associated with its antibiotic resistance. detailed examination of the genome revealed that s. albus j <dig> contains an ortholog of sco <dig> – xnr_ <dig>   <cit> . xnr_ <dig> is an ortholog of rpba , an rna polymerase-binding protein that occurs in actinomycete bacteria and confers basal levels of rifampicin resistance in s. coelicolor <cit> .

regarding chloramphenicol resistance, s. albus contains xnr_ <dig>  an ortholog of cmlr <dig> , while cmlr <dig> is absent  <cit> . genes are present for efflux proteins for daunorubicin , camphor , bicyclomycin , tetracycline  and one putative macrolide glycosyltransferase . s. albus contains two genes for tryptophanyl-trna synthetase: xnr_ <dig> and xnr_ <dig>  of which the latter is an ortholog of indolmycin-resistant trp-synthetase from s. coelicolor <cit> . it is worth noting that the van-cluster involved in vancomycin resistance is absent from the s. albus genome.

another interesting feature of this strain is that s. albus displays sensitivity to moenomycin with a survival rate of  <dig> % at 1 μg/ml, while s. coelicolor and most streptomycetes strains are naturally resistant to this antibiotic  <cit> . as the major targets of moenomycin are transglycosylases involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, we examined the penicillin-binding proteins  genes of s. albus more closely and found that it contains  <dig> genes for pbp that show a high degree of homology to the pbp genes of s. coelicolor <cit> . among those identified, xnr_ <dig>  xnr_ <dig>  xnr_ <dig>  and xnr_ <dig> belong to the pbp-a class, while  <dig> genes fall into the pbp-b class. the c class is comprised of  <dig> genes for pbp in s. albus. however, analysis of amino acid sequences and domain organisation of pbp-a revealed no significant differences from those in other bacteria. moreover, transglycosylase domains of pbp from s. albus contain all  <dig> sequences required for moenomycin binding  <cit> . thus, it is likely that moenomycin susceptibility is not dependent on specific pbps but, rather, on other structural or functional changes of the cell wall biosynthesis machinery.

potential for production of secondary metabolites
genomic sequencing has revealed  <dig> clusters for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites . the distribution of these clusters is not uniform within the chromosome, as  <dig> clusters are located on chromosomal arms, and the remaining  <dig> are in the large “core” region that contains most of the essential genes. of the  <dig> clusters,  <dig> were estimated for terpene biosynthesis,  <dig> for polyketides or non-ribosomal peptides,  <dig> for siderophores and  <dig> for lantibiotics and others.
s. albus 
j <dig> 

of the five terpene synthase genes, xnr_ <dig> and xnr_ <dig> are classified as phytoene synthases, while xnr_ <dig> is a germacradienol/geosmin synthase. furthermore, xnr_ <dig> codes for terpene cyclase containing a metal binding motif and xnr_ <dig> encodes a putative squalene-hopene cyclase. similar to other actinomycete strains, s. albus j <dig> has  <dig> gene clusters that contain putative pks , nonribosomal peptide synthetase  , and pks-nrps hybrid genes . unusually, among the few polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters, there is no type ii pks responsible for the biosynthesis of polycyclic aromatic compounds.

one of pks <dig> clusters  is identical to gene cluster of streptomyces sp. fr- <dig> for biosynthesis of a heptaene macrolide antibiotic fr-008/candicidin  <cit> . the fact that the given cluster is cryptic in s. albus and that the antibiotic structure is known can be used as a model for discovery of regulatory mechanisms repressing expression of gene clusters. large non-ribosomal peptide synthetase xnr_ <dig> from nrps cluster confined to the genes xnr_5613-xnr_ <dig> shows homology to indigoidine synthase, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the blue pigment indigoidine. an nrps gene cluster  exhibits homology with sactedraft_ <dig> to sactedraft_ <dig> of streptomyces sp. acte ctg <dig> 

transcription levels
total transcriptome sequencing was performed using the strand-specific illumina protocol, which was used to generate more than  <dig> million short reads. the large volume of data helped considerably in the annotation process, during which the coding sequences and their lengths were adjusted in order to not to controvert known transcript boundaries. coding sequences in the genome represent a variety of transcription levels, with several abundant transcripts occupying the majority of the mrna pool of the cell. such overrepresented transcripts are exclusively of hypothetical function or are involved in the stress response. a comprehensive list of loci from s. albus j <dig> and their respective transcription levels can be found in additional file  <dig> 

early metabolic switch
to establish whether s. albus j <dig> is indeed outpacing other streptomycete strains by the timing of metabolic transition to stationary growth phase, we performed strand-specific total rna sequencing at several time points of growth in liquid tsb medium. next, we analysed subsets of genes responsible for protein biosynthesis, phosphorus and nitrogen metabolism, morphological differentiation and sporulation.

a subset of genes coding for ribosomal proteins and other proteins with functions in protein biosynthesis exhibited continually decreasing transcript levels during growth in the conditions tested. these genes were initially highly expressed but began to decline gradually as the cells entered the transition and stationary phases . the major change in expression occurred at or before 12 h from the point of inoculation, which perfectly correlates with the growth curve of s. albus. this point in time is regarded as a point of metabolic switch under the laboratory conditions tested. the onset of the stationary growth phase is also usually marked by a strong upregulation of the pho-regulon, which is controlled by the two-component kinase/regulator system of xnr_ <dig>  and xnr_ <dig> . indeed, transcript levels of those genes began to increase as soon as phosphate was depleted from the medium  .

the expression profiles for genes for nitrogen metabolism, and its key regulator glnr <cit> , also decreased after 12 h. as growth ceases, the amount of transcripts and levels of corresponding enzymes for purine, pyrimidine, and amino acid biosynthesis are reduced. the early expression of these genes is particularly surprising as nitrogen was not limiting in the medium used. transcripts of genes that are central to nitrogen metabolism, such as xnr_ <dig> , xnr_ <dig> , xnr_ <dig> , xnr_ <dig>  and xnr_ <dig>  were detected in the early time points but rapidly decreased until they were nearly undetectable as cultures continued to grow.

as described for s. coelicolor <cit> , the expression profiles of genes for major glutamine synthetase , glna , nad-specific glutamate dehydrogenase gdh , and aspartate aminotransferase aspc  were maintained at high levels up to the 60 h time point. while s. coelicolor has  <dig> gs-like genes, s. albus j <dig> contains four genes for glutamine synthetase: xnr_ <dig>  xnr_ <dig>  xnr_ <dig> and xnr_ <dig>  interestingly, transcript levels of the gs-like gene xnr_ <dig> increase from the 12 h time point and amounts of xnr_ <dig> became nearly undetectable after 12 h. therefore, the rapid drop in the levels of the glnr-regulated gene products occurred at or just before the cessation of growth . this indicates that without the demand for amino acid, purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, the nitrogen levels in the medium become less of a limiting factor.

the expression of developmental genes increases as the cells prepare for differentiation during a metabolic switch. the expression of whia is stable from 12 h to 60 h, while whib levels off gradually after 12 h. both whia and whib are required for the switch from elongation to division in aerial hyphae. gene whia constitutes, together with whib, a whig-independent converging pathway that controls sporulation in aerial hyphae. the whip gene rapidly increases in expression at 12 h and then declines as rapidly to very low levels of expression. whip influences the coordination of aerial hyphal extension and septation, possibly by inhibiting cell division until the correct moment  <cit> . the expression of whig, which encodes an rna polymerase sigma factor and is a target of bldd repression, gradually decreases from  <dig> to 24 h and is maintained at one level until 60 h. these data support our evidence that s. albus sporulates in liquid culture  <cit>  and that this process begins approximately 12 h.

interestingly, the transcription of all of the chp and rdl genes is activated during submerged sporulation with the peak at the 12 h and shows significant levels of expression, which implies that expression of chaplins and rodlins is an obligatory part of the sporulation program, regardless of whether it occurs on plates or in liquid culture. this was also recently demonstrated for s. venezuale <cit> . of note, we could not detect any transcription for gene xnr_ <dig> . among bld-genes, which play a crucial role in streptomyces differentiation, the highest level of expression was shown for xnr_ <dig> , which increased from 12 h onward. genes such as xnr_ <dig> , xnr_ <dig> , xnr_ <dig>  and xnr_ <dig>  demonstrate that peak expression occurs near the point of metabolic switch and then gradually levels off to produce constant transcript levels until 60 h.

transcriptome analysis showed that clusters of genes for secondary metabolites in s. albus j <dig> are cryptic. only clusters for ectoin biosynthesis demonstrate detectable levels of expression that increase after 12 h. other clusters showed extremely low levels of transcription that can even decrease into the stationary  growth phase.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome of s. albus j <dig> was sequenced and compared to the other completely sequenced genomes of s. coelicolor a <dig> and s. bingchenggensis. the s. albus genome shows an interesting trend of minimisation via deletion of gene and operon duplicates. in addition to providing new insight into genome evolution, the genomic sequence is a good starting point for further s. albus optimisation for biotechnological application as a host for the heterologous production of natural products. the transcriptome analysis revealed the early metabolic switch in s. albus correlating with the fast growth of the strain. an ordered bac library covering the genome was constructed to permit the ready application of redet pcr-targeted gene disruption  <cit>  to this species. the himar <dig> and tn <dig> transposons, site-specific recombinases and gusa–based reporter system applied for this strain enable very efficient and fast genome engineering of s. albus <cit> . its fast and dispersive growth is an attractive characteristic, along with sporulation in liquid culture; these properties prompted us to present s. albus as a new model strain for not only heterologous expression experiments but also for investigations of fundamental actinobacterial biology issues, such as growth, morphogenesis, cell division, cell wall formation and antibiotic resistance.
