BACKGROUND
comparative analysis of developmental and behavioral processes in closely related species is a powerful approach to understand the mechanisms of evolution. it facilitates identification of molecular components that are conserved over millions of years due to their role in specifying common features as well as those that are variable because they confer species-specific features. the model organism caenorhabditis elegans  and its congener, c. briggsae, are particularly suitable for such investigations. their many experimental advantages include rapid growth, small size, transparency, ease of culture and genetic manipulations, and the availability of fully sequenced genomes  <cit> .

c. briggsae is phenotypically almost indistinguishable from c. elegans and has a similar  reproductive mode. the last common ancestor of these two species lived about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , and despite the rapid molecular evolution typical of the family rhabditidae, more than half  of the c. elegans genome aligns with the c. briggsae genome assembly  <cit> . this includes two-thirds of all c. briggsae genes  with reciprocal orthologs in c. elegans  <cit> . thus c. elegans-c. briggsae comparative genomic and genetic studies promise powerful new tools for the identification of genes and pathways and the study of both conservation and divergence.

like c. elegans, c. briggsae has six chromosomes that display extensive conservation of synteny, but not exact colinearity relative to c. elegans  <cit> . while c. briggsae shares many of the experimental advantages of c. elegans, it has the further advantage of increased natural variability for single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion-deletions   <cit> . this elevated natural variation potentially enhances its use for genotype-phenotype association studies, and is also very useful for the mapping aspects of forward genetics projects.

initial work on gene function in c. briggsae employed cross-species transgene rescue of c. elegans mutants  and rna interference . however, a number of laboratories are now generating true mutations in c. briggsae, using both forward mutagenesis screens  <cit>   and pcr-based deletion mutation screens  <cit> . positional cloning of c. briggsae mutations without relying upon obvious candidate genes requires a set of mapping tools. development of such tools is facilitated by a high-quality whole-genome shotgun assembly  <cit>  and the organization of most of the resulting contigs into chromosomes via a snp-based recombination map  <cit> .

among the tools needed to facilitate forward genetics in c. briggsae, a set of easily scored dna polymorphisms is especially important. experimentally validated polymorphisms can serve as useful markers for mapping mutations that cause visible phenotypes. additionally, these markers can be integrated with the phenotype-based genetic linkage map  to further enhance their utility. integration of polymorphisms and phenotype-based maps increases map density and anchors the relative locations of molecular and phenotypic markers. with this goal in mind we have discovered a large set of genome-wide polymorphisms  in wild-type strains, using af <dig> as a reference strain and four other natural isolate strains: hk <dig>  hk <dig>  vt <dig>  and pb <dig> 

the indels were placed into three classes: small , medium , and large . we have focused on medium and small indels , which offer the greatest utility as genetic markers. in the case of snps , we found that  <dig>  modify restriction enzyme sites  and therefore can be easily detected as restriction fragment length polymorphisms . we established assay conditions for bulk segregant analysis  and used these to experimentally validate  <dig> snip-snps,  <dig> medium and  <dig> small indels. the validated polymorphisms were used to genetically map known mutations causing visible phenotypes thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the polymorphisms in linkage mapping studies. we also developed single animal-based pcr assay to determine map distance. five mutations were successfully localized to sub-chromosomal regions by  <dig> or more indels, greatly facilitating the search for each candidate gene. these results demonstrate the utility of our mapping toolkit in genetic linkage and gene identification studies.

RESULTS
snp discovery
we performed snp discovery in four c. briggsae strains by aligning paired shotgun sequence reads to the af16-based reference sequence . these sequences were obtained by capillary gel electrophoresis at washington university genome center . to build on previous snp discovery efforts  <cit> , we applied the ssahasnp algorithm, which detects snps and small indels based on ssaha alignments to a reference sequence . compared to af <dig>  ssahasnp detected  <dig>  unique snp loci in hk <dig> dna, or one substitution per  <dig> bp on average . consistent with c. briggsae clade structure  <cit> , snp density was slightly lower in strains hk <dig>  and pb <dig>  and much lower in strain vt <dig> . in hk <dig>  the most common substitution by far was a to g, which accounted for  <dig> % of all substitutions .

total aligned base pairs include redundant matches due to sequence overlaps  in sequence data. the snp density is based on the number of uniquely aligned base pairs.

rflp genotyping assays and validation of snip-snps
we screened the snps predicted for hk <dig> for variants that altered the recognition site of a restriction enzyme, and thus might be amenable to restriction fragment length polymorphism  genotyping. to make this a practical resource, we limited the analysis to  <dig> restriction enzymes from rebase  <cit>  that are reliable and inexpensive. of  <dig>  hk <dig> snps, some  <dig>   were predicted to alter the recognition site of at least one of the  <dig> restriction enzymes. to develop restriction fragment length polymorphism  assays from these snip-snps, we designed pcr primers with a standard protocol and performed in silico digests of the resulting amplicons to infer the banding patterns for each strain. rflps not easily distinguishable on a gel, or snps on ultracontigs not yet included in the genetic map, were removed. finally, we used assembly agp information and blast alignment to obtain coordinates for each snip-snp on the cb <dig> sequence assembly. our set contained  <dig>  predicted rflp assays from  <dig>  snip-snps  positioned on both the genetic and physical maps . another snip-snp, bdp <dig>  was identified in a separate study .

we selected a total of  <dig> rflp assays  based on hindiii, drai and sali snip-snps for validation in af <dig> and hk <dig> parental dna . roughly a third of the assays  failed pcr in one or both strains in repeated attempts. although we did not investigate the issue of pcr failure, it is possible that redesigning primers  and testing different pcr conditions may produce desired products in some cases. all of the  <dig> assays successfully gave rise to strain-specific rflp banding patterns, validating the predicted snip-snp . interestingly, two of these assays  exhibited hk <dig> fragments that varied from in silico predictions, another possible consequence of unknown variants in this highly divergent strain. consistent with c. briggsae clade structure  <cit> , vt <dig> was not polymorphic  for the snip-snps we examined.

the snip-snps are arranged by chromosome and location. the corresponding ultracontigs are also listed. the expected and observed dna fragments refer to products based on in silico analysis and actual experiments, respectively. the bdp <dig> location is unknown because the corresponding contig is unassembled. the validation type column marks snip-snps that were consistent with prediction  and those that differed significantly . re: restriction enzyme used to digest pcr amplified products.

indel discovery
the ssahasnp program  <cit>  was also able to detect insertion/deletion  polymorphisms of 1- <dig> bp . we used the parse_indel utility to extract  <dig>  candidate indels  for the hk <dig> strain. most insertions and deletions detected by ssahasnp were single base pair events; the largest was  <dig> bp. to identify larger insertion/deletion events, we developed a customized algorithm called breakpointread that detects indels based on blast alignments between read sequences and the reference genome. first, the algorithm identifies "breakpoint reads" with alignment gaps of  <dig> bp or larger compared to the reference sequence. next, it analyzes the gap size and alignment orientations to infer the nature  and approximate size of sequence variation. when we applied breakpointread to the hk <dig> sequence traces, it identified  <dig> breakpoint reads suggestive of  <dig> underlying variants. we filtered the results to obtain insertion/deletion events between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp. the resulting set contained  <dig> predicted indels , the largest of which was a  <dig>  bp deletion on chromosome iv .

validation of indels
medium indels
we used the breakpointread algorithm to develop pcr fragment length polymorphism  assays for medium indels to facilitate high-throughput gene mapping. of the  <dig> putative indels, we selected  <dig> for validation in af <dig> and hk <dig> parental dna . two other indels  were also chosen for a similar analysis . ten of the  <dig> plp assays failed pcr in one or both strains . as mentioned earlier, some of these errors may be eliminated by redoing pcr using new primers. one assay  resulted in pcr products that were quite large  in both strains and therefore could not be accurately resolved on the gel. of the remaining  <dig> assays that were successfully amplified,  <dig> confirmed the presence of polymorphism,  <dig> of which were similar in type and size as predicted .

the indels are arranged by chromosome and location. the corresponding ultracontigs are also listed. the "unknown" locations refer to unassembled contigs. the predicted indel sizes are based on in silico analysis of af <dig> and hk <dig> amplicons. the validation type column marks indels that were consistent with prediction  and those that differed significantly .

small indels
we developed plp assays for small  indels in af <dig> and hk <dig> that were identified by ssahasnp. to allow for gel resolution, we excluded indels smaller than  <dig> bp. this resulted in  <dig> assays that had 7- <dig> bp band size differences between af <dig> and hk <dig> . we tested  <dig> indels  by pcr and found that except one , for which hk <dig> amplification failed, all others could be successfully amplified . a total of  <dig> indels showed bands of predicted sizes . of the remaining  <dig>   <dig> showed no indel ,  <dig> had multiple products , and  <dig> showed pcr products that were inconsistent and unreliable .

the table is organized similar to table  <dig>  the "status" column shows whether an indel was correctly verified by pcr  or not . in all cases dna sizes were determined by visual inspection.

altogether we experimentally confirmed  <dig> polymorphisms  on all six chromosomes . the utility of these 'working' markers in genetic studies is demonstrated by successful mapping of several mutations that cause visible phenotypes. in two cases these mapping experiments also helped improve the genome sequence assembly. specifically, the bhp <dig> contig fpc <dig> was placed near the center of chromosome  <dig> and bhp <dig> contig fpc <dig> was reassigned to the left arm of chromosome  <dig> .

a summary of data presented in tables 2- <dig>  the successful pcr cases are divided into three categories: similar , different , and false .

linkage mapping studies using snip-snps and indels
the snip-snps and indels were used to map a set of  <dig> mutations with easily recognizable phenotypes  that were previously isolated in different laboratories . except lin and unc, all other loci were uniquely assigned to linkage groups by standard 2-factor mapping using known mutations that serve as reference . the dpy, unc, and unc are reference markers for lgiii, lgiv, and lgv, respectively. the remaining autosomal loci are linked to c. elegans orthologs cbr-lin- <dig>  and cbr-unc- <dig> . not only did the polymorphism-based mapping agree with phenotypic marker-based mapping  and dpy in figure 4a, b), it also helped to identify linkage groups of lin  and unc . in each of these cases a single cross with hk <dig> provided enough genomic dna and usually one pcr per chromosome was sufficient to establish the linkage . we also quantified dna band intensities to determine linkages as unitless linkage values  . as expected, for unlinked loci the ulv was one. in the case of dpy the ulv for chromosome  <dig> indel  was  <dig>  suggesting a strong linkage . overall, these results demonstrate that polymorphism-based mapping can be used to quickly map new mutations in c. briggsae.

mutations are arranged by linkage group  that corresponds to respective chromosome. for locations of polymorphism, refer to figure  <dig>  the mutant phenotypes are - lev-r: resistant to  <dig> mm levamisole; unc: uncoordinated; dpy: dumpy; egl: egg-laying defective; lin: lineage defective; sma: small; vul: vulvaless. question marks  refer to mutations that were not mapped by phenotypic markers.

in addition to linking mutations to chromosomes we also investigated whether polymorphisms could be used in more precise mapping i.e., placing mutations in specific chromosomal regions . we reasoned that by narrowing down genetic intervals of mutations it should be possible to identify potential candidates, including c. elegans orthologs, thereby facilitating gene cloning by rnai and transgene rescue approaches. to this end we used three medium indels on chromosome x to map dpy. the ulvs for dpy suggest weak linkages to indels cb-m <dig>  and cb-m <dig>  and tight linkage to the middle indel cb-m <dig> . similar result was also obtained with the small indel bhp <dig> that is located close to cb-m <dig> and is strongly linked to dpy .

besides dpy, we also mapped  <dig> autosomal mutations to sub-chromosomal regions using small indels. the results showed that dpy is most strongly linked to bhp <dig>  unc to bhp <dig> and bhp <dig>  and lin to bhp <dig>  . the unc appears to be located on the right arm of chromosome  <dig>  since it shows strongest linkage to bhp <dig> .

the c. briggsae sequence assembly 'cb3' had placed the bhp <dig> contig fpc <dig> on the right arm of chromosome  <dig> . we found that this location was inconsistent with ulvs for dpy and unc since both mutations are also linked to the left arm indel bhp <dig> . this suggested that there could be a possible error in the sequence assembly. in a separate study zhao et al.  <cit>  used the snp-based oligonucleotide array to map dpy and found that the region corresponding to bhp <dig> is misassembled. therefore, we have assigned bhp <dig>  as well as dpy and unc, to the very end of the left arm of chromosome  <dig>  additional mapping using polymorphisms and visible markers will resolve the extent of misassembly.

in addition to the above bsa approach we also analyzed single f <dig> mutants segregating from a cross  to determine recombination distances between polymorphisms and mutations. for this we used a multivulva mutation lin and an unc mutation unc. the lin mutation is located on chromosome  <dig> since it is strongly linked to three small indels bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> . from a cross between lin and hk <dig> we picked  <dig> f <dig> mutant animals  and analyzed their dna for the presence of bhp <dig>  a single recombinant chromosome was recovered suggesting a recombination frequency of ~2% between lin and bhp <dig>  in the case of unc mutation, located on chromosome x, we analyzed  <dig> f <dig> mutant animals for the presence of indel bhp <dig>  a total of  <dig> recombinant chromosomes were recovered  suggesting that the two loci are 10% apart. these results demonstrate that sra mapping protocol can be used in c. briggsae to localize mutations to sub-chromosomal regions and narrow down their genetic interval.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we took a bioinformatics approach to identify polymorphisms in the c. briggsae genome and experimentally validated a small set of these to facilitate mapping of mutations. comparison of af <dig>  to four other isolates  revealed that hk <dig> is most polymorphic since it has the highest density of snps among all the strains. altogether we identified ~ <dig>  polymorphisms  between af <dig> and hk <dig> that promise to be a valuable resource for mutation mapping and genome evolution studies. roughly 20% of the snps are predicted to alter restriction enzyme sites  that could be detected by pcr followed by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis.

a total of  <dig> polymorphisms  that were experimentally tested,  <dig>  showed dna fragments identical  to in silico predictions . another  <dig> cases  were significantly different but nonetheless showed the presence of underlying variants. in  <dig> cases no polymorphism could be detected. thus, excluding pcr failures , the success rate of correctly predicted polymorphisms was 73%  . this suggests that both ssahasnp and breakpointread algorithms work equally efficiently regardless of the type of polymorphism in question. a similar study in c. elegans  <cit>  showed that greater than 95% of the polymorphisms predicted by the polybayes program  <cit>  are true. it remains to be seen whether the lower success rate in c. briggsae is due to intrinsic differences between the programs alone or if the quality of sequence data and assembly are additional contributing factors.

we used snip-snps and indels to map  <dig> mutations with visible phenotypes, and found that polymorphism-based mapping agreed with phenotypic marker-based results. furthermore, it helped map two mutations, lin and unc, for which no prior genetic linkage data was available. five mutations were also localized to sub-chromosomal regions. thus our mapping resource can be used to rapidly map new mutations in c. briggsae. it is also relatively easy to validate additional polymorphisms if one needs a greater resolution. it should be pointed out that hillier et al.  <cit>  have validated another set of  <dig> snip-snps by sequencing during the process of c. briggsae genome sequence assembly . given the high density of such markers , it should be possible to map a mutation within a small genetic interval to facilitate molecular cloning .

in addition to mapping mutations, snps and indels could also be used to improve the genetic linkage map of c. briggsae. the current c. briggsae sequence assembly, cb <dig>  incorporates  <dig> %  of the genome united into six chromosomes  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> % of sequences are tentatively associated with chromosomes. these unmapped regions could be integrated into chromosomes by polymorphism-based recombination mapping. we have successfully used this approach to place the contig fpc <dig> in the vicinity of fpc <dig>  based on the recombination distance of 5% between bhp <dig>  and bhp <dig>   . in the other case, we have reassigned the bhp <dig> contig fpc <dig> to the left arm of chromosome  <dig> based on its tight linkage to dpy and unc. additional snip-snps and indels could further refine the locations of these contigs.
