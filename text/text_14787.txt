BACKGROUND
in sexually produced offspring, genotypes are determined by both maternal and paternal genetic contributions. an offspring phenotype is also influenced by a plethora of environmental factors experienced during its ontogeny and by its parents . such transgenerational plasticity of phenotypes is often adaptive, can promote efficient and rapid acclimatization to environmental changes, and even has the potential to modify evolutionary dynamics . anti-predator defenses  <cit> , tolerance of abiotic environmental change , and induced disease resistance in offspring  <cit>  are amongst the most studied transgenerational effects that are not inherited via dna, but through a diversity of alternative mechanisms  <cit> .

the transmission of parental parasite experience that subsequently leads to an enhanced offspring immune defense is known as transgenerational immune priming  . tgip enables a faster or stronger offspring immune reaction that matches the current parasite environment  <cit> . environmental variation can result in heterogeneous parasite distributions across environments  <cit>  persisting through host generations. under such matching environmental conditions where host-dispersal is limited and hosts have a long lifespan, selection for tgip is predicted to be strong and evolutionarily adaptive  <cit> .

in vertebrates, studies of tgip have mainly focused on the transfer of maternal antibodies  <cit> , while also substances of the innate immune system are involved . usually mothers deposit immune defense components into the eggs, transfer them during development , or, in mammals, after birth via lactation  <cit> . the classical view is that male sperm only contributes to heredity, i.e. via dna, to the offspring. considering recently discovered hereditary mechanisms that are not based on the pure dna sequence itself, like dna-methylation, histone acetylation pattern or trna, this view is challenged into question . recently, a growing number of examples indicate influences beyond pure transfer of dna via sperm on offspring and, thus, underline the fathers’ role beyond the determination of the offspring genotype . in an invertebrate system with only an ejaculate-based connection between father and offspring, the paternal environment influences offspring immune phenotype  <cit> . further, a strong paternal contribution to immune phenotype of progeny was found in vertebrates with intense paternal care or investment  <cit> .

the advantages of tgip in vertebrates were considered to be strongest during early life stages by strengthening the developing adaptive offspring immune system, with the effect fading upon maturation  <cit> . however, some ecological conditions may select for multigenerational tgip modulating immune responses beyond the f1-generation  <cit> . persistent tgip should be favoured when the parasite environment is stable over time and, hence, across host generations. so far, our knowledge about tgip in vertebrates past the early phase of an offspring’s life is limited. only scarce evidence supports the existence of tgip beyond the maturation of the adaptive immune system of vertebrates  <cit> , while in invertebrates tgip can apparently cross the borders of more than just one generation  <cit> .

to explore the potential for long lasting and multigenerational effects on immunity, we experimentally assessed grandparental tgip in the sex-role reversed pipefish syngnathus typhle. in this fish species, males have evolved a unique placenta-like structure  <cit> . not mothers but fathers are thus the pregnant sex  <cit> . during male pregnancy, embryos are provided with nutrients and oxygen over this placenta-like structure , which may mechanistically enable a paternal investment into offspring immune defense. usually in teleosts, females transfer immune components such as immunoglobulins, complement components, lectins, lysozymes and soluble antimicrobial peptides across follicle cells during the early stage of vitellogenesis into the oocyte  <cit> . however, apart from maternally derived immunity syngnathids profoundly rely on supplemental paternal immune priming  <cit> . as such, the pipefish system was chosen as here not only mothers but also fathers can induce offspring immune response over biparental tgip  <cit> . so far, it was considered that tgip in vertebrates is only of major importance during early development, to bridge the time of maturation of the acquired immune system, when selection pressure due to high mortality is greatest  <cit> . in contrast, recent studies indicate that in syngnathus typhle the persistence of immune priming lasts past the maturation of the adaptive immune system in four-month-old juveniles  <cit> , coupled with a high degree of bacteria specificity  <cit> . in the current study we aimed to address the impact of biparental parental immune priming beyond the generation border, affecting the immune dynamics of the grandoffspring generation.

mature pipefish males and females  were exposed to two heat-killed bacteria  or a control prior to mating in a fully reciprocal mating design . by leaving the f1-generation untreated, we were able to examine grandparental immune priming effects in the f2-offspring while challenging them with the same bacteria treatment as their grandparents . for the evaluation of grandparental sex-specific influences on grandoffspring immunity, either only grandmothers, only grandfathers or both grandparents  were expsed to the bacteria treatment. in the f2-generation we assessed expression of  <dig> target genes functionally associated to different pathways of the immune system  and epigenetic regulation processes , to test whether complementing sex-specific contribution as previously found to exist for the f1-generation  <cit>  may have been trans generationally maintained over two generations. here, we found strong grandparental effects that influenced the immune gene expression of grandoffspring upon bacterial exposure. this grandparental tgip is sex-specific  with regard to immune pathway activation and the involvement of epigenetic regulation genes.fig.  <dig> experimental design. the grandparental generation  was vaccinated using a combination of heat-killed immunological novel vibrio spp. and tenacibaculum maritimum , or were left naïve  as control. immune-challenged mature pipefish were used in following mating design:  <dig>  control: ;  <dig>  paternal: ;  <dig>  maternal:  and  <dig>  biparental:  and kept according to their mating pairs  in separate 36 × 80 l semi-flow through aquaria . f1-individuals were crossed within former parental treatment groups but left immunologically naïve . in spring  <dig>  f2-juveniles were exposed one-week post birth to the same heat-killed vibrio  and tenacibaculum  bacteria used for the f0-generation or left naïve  . out of each family  <dig> individuals were chosen for the direct immune challenge. per f2-offspring treatment  four individual replicates were used; resulting in a total of  <dig> samples




RESULTS
by using multivariate data analyses differential gene expression patterns were explored in one-week-old f2-juveniles upon the applied f0-grandparental bacteria treatment  in contrast to the naïve control group . we evaluated with a permutational multivariate analysis of variance  whether gene expression  of f2-juvenile pipefish revealed grandparental sex-specific influences  and grandoffspring bacteria treatment effects  including their interaction , while setting the family structure as random term. the multivariate permanova model was based on an euclidean distance matrix and applied for  <dig> immune genes and  <dig> genes associated to epigenetic regulation, but also divided into following specific functional gene categories:  innate immune system ,  adaptive immune system ,  innate and adaptive immune genes ,  complement system ,  dna methylation ,  histone de/methylation ,  histone deacetylation , and  histone acetylation   <cit> . finally, we evaluated the contribution of variance explained by each target gene to identify central genes driving the grandparental bacteria treatment effect.

immune gene expression 
based on  <dig> immune genes, we found marked and significantly different expression profiles among all four grandparental sex-specific bacteria treatment groups . we applied a pca and anosim analysis focusing on grandparental sex specific immune priming effects  . along the principle component  one, the grandparental control group  clusters opposed to all other three grandparental treatments, demonstrating a strong grand-paternal , grand-maternal  and grand-biparental  treatment effect on f2-offspring immune gene expression . all four grandparental treatment groups were significantly different from each other . as the grand-paternal and grand-maternal treatment groups are clustering on the same level in the pca without overlapping centers of gravity whereas the grand-biparental treatment group clusters further apart, this pattern indicates similar grand-maternal and grand-paternal influences on immune gene expression of f2-juveniles . in addition, post hoc pairwise comparisons of the significant f0-sex x f2-bacteria interaction  demonstrate grandparental sex-specific influences between grand-paternal  and grand-maternal  bacteria exposure. although the f2-generation received a bacterial immune treatment  grandparental sex-specific influences were dominating  vs. f0-pat x f <dig> bacteria  p <  <dig> , table 2). the combination of grand-maternal and grand-paternal exposure in a grand-biparental treatment did not differ from the single grandparental effects, designating an intermediate impact of grandmothers and grandfathers  vs. f0-pat x f <dig> bacteria  p >  <dig> ; f0-bi x f2-bacteria  vs. f0-mat x f <dig> bacteria  p >  <dig> , table 2).table  <dig> results from 2-way permanova analysis of gene expression ﻿of one-week-old f2-juveniles

: table s2
multivariate anosim was performed following significant permanova effects to assess differences in the gene expression profiles per treatment groups applying pairwise comparison on relative gene expression data  based on a euclidean distance matrix and  <dig> permutations. pairwise comparison was conducted for following two fixed factors and their interactions: ‘f0-sex’ , grand-maternal , grand-paternal , grandparental control ) and ‘f2-bacteria’ , f2-offspring vibrio  and tenacibaculum  bacteria treatment)﻿




innate immune genes 
f2-offspring innate immune gene expression profile differentiated depending on whether grandmothers, grandfathers, both or none were immune-challenged . likewise a significant f0-sex x f2-bacteria interaction  proposes grandparental sex-specific influences, outweighing the f2-bacteria treatment  vs. f0-pat x f2-bacteria  p <  <dig> , table 2). in contrast to previous findings of combined immune genes, f2-offspring of the grand-paternal bacteria treatment display exactly the same expression profile as f2-offspring from the grand-biparental bacteria treatment . in the pca grand-paternal and grand-biparental groups have remarkable overlapping centers of gravity indicating, that the grand-biparental group is more similar to the grand-paternal group than to the grand-maternal group which clusters further apart . nevertheless, the grand-maternal treatment group is set apart from the f0-naïve control treatment , implying that the grand-maternal bacterial exposure still reveals a diminished effect. these findings denote that the bacterial environment experienced by the grandfathers drives the grand-biparental impact on genes of the innate immune system to a larger extent.fig.  <dig> factor maps to demonstrate the contribution of variance retained by each principal component for immune genes  and epigenetic regulation genes  of one-week-old f2-juveniles. the response variables  are symbolized by arrows whereby the length of the arrow is directional proportional with the contribution of variance of each gene to the total variability. the colour gradient in the left corner highlights the most important genes in explaining the variation  retained by the principle components calculated according to  <cit> 




adaptive immune genes 
offspring adaptive immune gene expression did not reveal significant grandparental sex-specific effects  nor f0-sex x f2-bacteria interaction effects .

innate & adaptive immune genes 
five genes associated to both innate and adaptive immune response showed grandparental sex-specific treatment effects . f2-juveniles of grand-maternal and grand-paternal treatment groups revealed a different expression profile from one another , but also from the grand-biparental treatment  and the control group .

complement component system 
the expression of complement component genes  that mediate between innate and adaptive immune system and also complement the antibody-mediated immune response, showed grandparental sex-specific influences . the complement component factors were impacted predominantly by the grand-maternal treatment  but not by the grand-paternal treatment . as the grand-maternal and grand-biparental groups are not significantly different from each other and have the same center of gravity in the pca  the gene expression of complement factors of f2-juveniles was more affected by the grandmothers.

epigenetic regulation genes 
the global expression of five dna-methylation genes, four histone de/methylation genes, and five genes responsible for acetylation and deacetylation of histone residues in one-week old f2-juveniles showed grandparental sex specific differences . multivariate pairwise comparisons displayed a stronger grand-paternal than grand-maternal effect over the  <dig> epigenetic regulation genes since grand-paternal and grand-biparental groups are not significantly different from each other , displaying overlapping centers of gravity . a significant f0-sex x f2-bacteria interaction for all epigenetic genes  further indicates grandparental sex-specific effects apart from the f2-bacteria treatment  vs f0-pat x f2-bacteria  p <  <dig> , table 2).

epigenetic regulation genes 
the grandparental sex-specific immunological exposure primarily affected the expression of histone-acetylation genes , while on the contrary a separate consideration of five dna-methylation genes , four histone de/methylation genes , and three histone deacetylation genes  were not significantly affected.

however, the combined expression of histone acetyltransferase kat2a  and histone acetyltransferase hat <dig>  revealed pure grand-paternal influences, as the grand-maternal treatment group was not significantly different from the f0-naïve group but sets apart from the gran﻿d-biparental and grand-paternal treatments .

grand-offspring treatment effect 
the acute immune challenge of f2-offspring  with either vibrio or tenacibaculum bacteria significantly affected the multivariate expression of total  <dig> immune genes  and total  <dig> epigenetic genes . further, we examined the effects of the acute immune challenge in the functional gene categories separately. an induced expression of innate immune genes , complement component genes  and genes involved in both innate & adaptive immune system  was recorded. expression of genes associated with dna methylation processes  and histone acetylation  in f2-offspring was likewise significantly influenced upon the direct bacteria challenge. in contrast, genes of the adaptive immune system, histone de/methylation genes and histone deacetylation genes stayed unaffected .

gene contribution
immune gene expression 
in the factor map the arrows of  <dig> immune genes were generally all pointing into the direction of the first principle component , which explains 30% of the total variation and visualizes in the corresponding pca plots the grandparental treatment effect . important genes with an average contribution above 60% were the innate immune genes calreticulin, transferrin, and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein , the adaptive immune genes integrin, hivep <dig>  and hivep <dig> as well as c﻿omplement component  <dig> and  <dig> . most of the analyzed innate immune genes showed a contribution between 40-60% such as peptidoglycan recognition protein, heat shock protein  <dig> , coagulation factor ii, lectin protein ii, kinesin, allograft inflammation factor, tyroproteinkinase, ik-cytokine, interferon, and translocator protein  . besides, also following adaptive immune genes revealed a contribution between 40–60%: cd <dig>  tapasin , lymphocyte cytosolic protein  <dig>  lymphocyte antigen  <dig>  and immunoglobulin light chain . finally, chemokine  <dig>  lps induced tnfα factor, complement component  <dig>  interleukin  <dig>  and interleukin  <dig> contributed below 40% of the average variance .

epigenetic regulation genes 
epigenetic regulation genes with the highest average contribution of over 80% were dna-methyltransferases 3a and 3b , both responsible for de novo transfer of methyl groups to specific cpg sites in the dna, permitting the formation of new methylation marks on unmethylated dna . further, histone acetyltransferase kat2a  which promotes acetylation of core histone proteins and with it transcriptional activation revealed over 80% of inertia contribution .

these important key genes were followed with 60–80% of contribution by the maintenance dna methyltransferase dnmt <dig> , which copies complementary marks of newly-replicated dna by recognizing the hemimethylated sequences inherited from daughter strands  <cit> .

histone modification genes responsible for gene silencing or deactivation of gene transcription such as histone deacetylase  <dig>  , lysine specific demethylase   followed by histone deacetylase  <dig>  and histone deacetylase  <dig>  showed an intermediate contribution . the same pattern was true for genes promoting gene activation histone methyltransferase  , histone acetyltransferase hat <dig>  , and transcription factor  <dig> . histone demethylation genes lysine specific demethylase 5b , lysine specific demethylase 6a , and dna-methylation gene n6admet-methyltransferase  contributed below 40% of the total variance .

discussion
grandparental immune priming effect
the parental impact on offspring immune system persisted, once the adaptive immune system reached maturation  <cit>  and even continued into the second generation, affecting immune dynamics of grandoffspring in the pipefish syngnathus typhle. grandparental immunological treatment with heat-killed bacteria epitopes altered the gene expression patterns in the grandoffspring, affecting the global expression of  <dig> immune genes. the patterns are cross-correlated with the targeted functional gene groups, including genes of both innate and adaptive immune defense and complement component system. upon immune challenge in the f2-generation, grandoffspring only induced immune gene expression if their grandparents already had experienced the bacterial epitopes. this result highlights the existence and importance of multigenerational tgip, as only animals whose ancestors were exposed to a parasitic assemblage are able to quickly react towards an encounter with matching pathogens.

genes of the innate immune system and complement component system were pre-dominantly affected, as they are essential in the pro-inflammatory response initiated 20 h after the bacterial injection. central innate immune genes  involved in driving this remarkable grandparental bacteria treatment effect were calreticulin, transferrin, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein , complement component  <dig> and complement component  <dig>  the latter two genes are key players in the alternative pathway of the complement component system, necessary for the immediate immune defense against invaders  <cit> . complement component  <dig> proteins recognize and tag bacteria and thereby activate the lytic pathway during which the membrane attack complex  is formed under the support of complement component  <dig>  <cit> . activation proteins such as natural resistance-associated macrophage protein trigger macrophages activity that perform phagocytosis and remove pathogens with the production of reactive oxygen species  and a release of hydrolytic lysozymes  <cit> , while calreticulin chaperones assist in promoting the phagocytosis process and clearance of apoptotic cells. a primitive but effective antimicrobial mechanism of the innate immune system du﻿ring which actively nutriens  are removed from bacterial pathogens, a process referred to as iron-withholding, is maintained by transferrin and also intracellularly within the phagosome over natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins  <cit> . hence, the first line of innate immune defense is activated upon the grandparental treatment in the juvenile pipefish  <cit> . further innate immune genes with a lower average contribution  are also involved in immediately available and inducible pathways like bacteria recognition , antiviral response , oxidative burst by macrophages , stress response over molecular chaperone  as well as general inflammatory response   <cit> . the assessed adaptive immune genes were not affected by the f0-bacteria treatment, potentially due to the on-going maturation of the adaptive immune system in one-week-old pipefish  <cit>  and/or the rather early time point of sampling . yet, our former data implys that the expression of the same immune genes used here positively correlates with an activation of the innate  and adaptive  cellular immune system  <cit> , suggesting that induced gene expression is linked to a physiological impact of tgip.

grandparental sex-specific effect 
grandfathers and grandmothers might have evolved different strategies to achieve an optimal immunological protection of their grandoffspring. here, we investigated complementing grandparental sex-specific contribution to different pathways of the immune system in one-week-old f2-juveniles. grand-paternal immunological experience boosted the activity of the innate immune system in their grandoffspring. this male-specific effect on innate immunity is consistent with the result of tgip over one generation  <cit> . grandfathers transfer immediate protection via innate immunity during male pregnancy against prevalent pathogens of their surrounding environment.

in contrast, grandmothers largely influenced genes of the complement component system. in teleosts mothers activate the complement system of their offspring via the deposition of a variety of diverse complement component proteins such as c <dig>  c <dig>  a﻿nd c <dig> into the eggs  <cit> . grandoffspring might even profit from mrna transcripts that can likewise be transferred into the egg yolk  <cit> . a grand-maternal priming of the complement system can result in an earlier usage of acquired immune responses as it supports the antibody-mediated adaptive immune response. this implies that a stronger response against pathogens and parasites that linger in the environment over several generations is initiated. since grandparents differentially influence the distinct immune pathways of the f2-offspring, grand-maternal and grand-paternal immune priming can complement each other leading to a balanced effect on total expression of  <dig> immune genes. parental sex - specific influences on different immune pathway observed in former results of the f1-generation  <cit>  lasted into the f2-generation and reflect an efficient strategy to maintain optimal protection against parasites by both parents correspondingly both grandparents.

our data now suggest that information on prevalent bacterial epitopes is conserved and sex-specifically transferred, leading to complementing biparental tgip over two generations. with this strategy parents not only deliver specific protection to their genetic offspring and grandoffspring, but they also transfer the opportunity to plastically adapt to the prevailing pathogen environment. in contrast to most species with conventional sex roles, in a sex-role reversed pipefish offspring are born into the paternal environment and, thus, share the paternal parasitic experience. this makes the transfer of immunity via the paternal line likely to be adaptive. hence, both fathers and grandfathers will increase their fitness by altering their phenotype to optimally acclimatize offspring to the local parasitic environment  <cit> . yet, female specific immune priming effects still remained, to a lower extent. potentially this ancient evolution of beneficial maternal transfer of immune components into the eggs was still selected for, as a certain likelihood of matching parasite environment in their seasonal habitat  remained. when low dispersal might have resulted in habitat matching between grand-maternal and grandoffspring environment, maternal transfer of immunity should have been selected  <cit> . while most species boost their offspring immune response exclusively via maternal tgip, pipefish rely on both, on maternal and paternal tgip  <cit>  that last for at least two generations. this dual developmental plasticity with sex-specific effector pathways gives the next generations an evolutionary advantage in reacting towards potentially virulent parasites. the grand-biparental tgip is adaptive, provided that the maternal and paternal parasitic environment is experienced by their offspring correspondingly grandoffspring  <cit> . tgip, accordingly, gives individuals an advantage whose ancestors successfully defended parasites and transfer this experience to the following generations.

such heightened reaction to a pathogen should only be expressed under certain ecological circumstances as strong expression of immunity and the maintenance of inducible defense is costly due to high energy demand  <cit> . bi-parental immune priming is traded off with delayed maturation time of adult f1-males, reduced fecundity and reproduction of the adult f1-generation, in case of parental bacteria exposure, indicating a compensational effect of reduced energy investment into reproduction  <cit> . these costs might constrain the overall beneficial net output of biparental immune priming  <cit> . nevertheless, selection for grandparental immune priming designates that adaptive net influence and total benefits outweighed the associated costs.

mechanism of immune priming 
our results cannot be explained by parasite-induced selection, as we used virulent heat-killed bacteria for the immune challenges. this presumes that the inheritance mechanism is non-dna sequence based. the mechanisms permitting immunological information to be preserved via the paternal line over two generations most likely rely on a combination of small soluble immune components and epigenetic factors that are transferred via the sperm, the placenta-like structure or the fluid of the paternal brood-pouch tissue. as innate immune genes were predominantly influenced by the grand-paternal treatment, these genes might play a crucial role in the paternal transmission process.

dna methylation and histone modifications are responsible for regulating packing and de-packing of the chromatin structure around histone molecules  <cit>  and, consequently, the activation or deactivation of transcription processes for our targeted immune genes. that such epigenetic modifications of the genome can be responsible for paternal effects was recently demonstrated in zebrafish displaying paternal methylome transmission  <cit> . in our study, the expression of total  <dig> genes connected to dna-methylation and histone de/methylation and de/acetylation in one-week-old f <dig> juveniles showed a significant change of expression in case of grandparental bacteria exposure. epigenetic regulation genes that displayed a high contribution with over 80% were dna-methyltransferase 3a, dna-methyltransferase 3b. as de novo methylation via dnmt3a/b causes new chemical modifications of the dna  <cit>  and is essential for maternal and paternal imprinting  <cit> , dnmt3a/b are potentially crucial mediators for epigenetic changes based on environmental stressors. in accordance to previous findings epigenetic regulation genes might not only be central regulators of parental immune priming  <cit> , but also of grandparental immune priming, revealing a persisting effect into the second generation. in addition, we found strong evidence that histone acetylation genes  and histone acetyltransferase hat <dig> ) regulating positively the accessibility of the dna sequence for transcription processes by addition of acetyl groups to histone tails  <cit>  were strongly influenced by the grandfathers solely. histone modifications are supposed to be heritable across generations  and might carry epigenetic information  <cit> . the reaction to repeated pathogen exposure in macrophages involves positive histone marks and chromatin remodeling at specific promotors  <cit> . moreover, it was suggested that histone modifications are associated with immune memory following a viral infection in cd8  t-cells  <cit> . the recent findings of parental  <cit>  and grandpaternal influences on histone modification genes upon bacterial immune challenge suggests that the regulation of immune priming might be mediated with heritable marks stored on histones.

our data, thus, propose that environmental stressors like pathogens leave an epigenetic mark on the genome affecting gene expression of genes associated with the immune system and transcriptional regulation that can be inherited over multiple generations. the fact that grandparental tgip involves epigenetic mechanisms may result in a novel selection scenario for the evolution of tgip along the paternal line, as the argument that male sperm is too small to transfer any more than just the dna does not apply any longer. the sperm is thus potentially not only a sole messenger of “the other half of the offspring dna”, but also an important mediator for developmental plasticity and fast phenotypic acclimation to environmental changes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
transgenerational effects on immunity in vertebrates are not short-term but can be sustained across two consecutive generations by the involvement of epigenetic regulation mechanism. these grandparental immune priming effects in the pipefish revealed complementing sex-specific contribution to different pathways of their grandoffspring immune system. although tgip might be beneficial on the individual level, it also involves ecological and evolutionary consequences on population level and has the potential to change disease dynamics and the spread of epidemics in a population  <cit> . under negative-frequency dependent selection, rare parasite alleles may spread quickly in a population, while it takes time for the hosts as a population to counter-adapt under a red-queen dynamic  <cit> . in contrast, as an individual response, tgip plays out within one generation, because the exposure to a novel parasite will already be met with an amplified immune reaction in the next generation. with this, the advantage of the novel parasite genotypes vanishes. this dampens the amplitude of predicted frequency dependent selection and may slow down red queen dynamics, giving the host an advantage in fast clearance of novel pathogen genotypes  <cit> .

according to neutral genetic markers, syngnathus typhle from different sites in the baltic sea all belong to the same population  <cit> . this is in line with the broad-nosed pipefish migratory behaviour: from open waters in winter to shallow seagrass meadows along the coastline in summer to exert mating and reproduction  <cit> . while in this sex-role reversed species, females display secondary sexual signals and are subject to multiple mating, males as the choosing sex are bound to their offspring during pregnancy. with respect to the seasonal migration pattern and the larval exposure to the pathogenic environment that their fathers already experienced, the investment into grandparental immune priming can be adaptive as individuals will be pre-adapted for the pathogen fauna in which the subsequent generations mate and release their offspring. on-going climate change with higher temperatures and lower salinity levels induces the abundance and virulence of pathogenic strains e.g. vibrio particularly during the summer season  <cit> . the efficient transfer of immunological information about prevalent pathogenic threads is key for efficient short-term acclimation to changing virulence patterns  <cit>  with benefits occurring particularly during the summer mating season in highly exposed shallow seagrass meadows. future work should focus on the evaluation of resistance effects in a survival experiment, bacterial specificity processes, and an in depth analysis of the physiological mechanisms mediating grandparental tgip.
