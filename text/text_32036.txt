BACKGROUND
rna molecules are known to be key genetic regulators in diverse organisms. in bacteria, these regulatory rnas are generally referred to as small rnas  because they usually range from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length  <cit> . recent studies have suggested that most srnas modulate target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by base pairing to mrnas  <cit> . it has been reported that the majority of bacterial srnas are synthesised under very specific growth conditions and that these rnas are regulators of gene expression in response to environmental stresses  <cit>  such as low iron  <cit> , oxidative stress  <cit>  and elevated glucose-phosphate levels  <cit> . currently, approximately  <dig> srnas have been detected in  <dig> microbial genomes, including of the escherichia, shigella and salmonella genera  <cit> . in escherichia coli , the most exhaustive and diverse searches for srnas have been conducted with several methods: high-throughput computational searches  <cit> , shotgun cloning  <cit>  and tiling array analyses  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> srnas have been experimentally verified and registered in regulondb  <cit> , and many more srnas are predicted to exist  <cit> . in recent years, deep sequencing has emerged as a new and powerful experimental method for transcriptome analysis  <cit> . in eukaryotic organisms, this approach has been commonly used for transcriptome analyses, including microrna detection  <cit> . in contrast, in bacteria, this approach has only recently been used for transcriptome analysis, although it has the potential to increase our insight into transcriptional and post-transcriptional events in microorganisms dramatically  <cit> . for instance, several srnas have been identified using a deep sequencing-based approach in salmonella  <cit> , vibrio cholerae  <cit> , helicobacter pylori  <cit> , burkholderia cenocepacia  <cit> , bacillus anthracis  <cit>  and quite recently, e. coli  <cit> .

in this study, we report novel srnas identified in e. coli with a deep sequencing analysis, focusing on low-molecular-weight rnas . applying this approach, we successfully detected most of the previously known srnas, and discovered thousands of novel  transcribed regions. we selected  <dig> novel transcribed regions as candidate srnas with computational or experimental evidence of transcription initiation. furthermore, we detected the expression of seven intergenic srnas and three cis-antisense srnas by northern blot analysis. interestingly, five newly identified srnas are expressed from prophage regions. we conducted an evolutionary conservation analysis of our candidate srnas and summarised the data among closely related bacterial strains. finally, we generated a platform  for srna research in bacteria.

RESULTS
deep sequencing-based identification of cis-antisense and intergenic srnas
to comprehensively identify and summarise the srnas in e. coli, we focused on the low-molecular-weight rnas and performed a deep sequencing analysis. first, e. coli cells were grown to late exponential phase in m <dig> medium . the cultured cells were harvested and immediately treated with rnaprotect bacteria reagent to prevent rna degradation, because  the half life of some srnas is very short   <cit> ; and  we wanted to minimise in vitro degradation. the low-molecular-weight rna  was then isolated from the cultured cells , and a cdna library was constructed from the rna sample after it had been ligated to both 5'- and 3'-specific rna adapters to determine the direction of each transcript. the cdna library was deep sequenced using an illumina 1g genome analyzer system . after discarding the reads containing unreliable nucleotides , we selected  <dig> , <dig> reads that could be mapped to the e. coli genome with soap v <dig> . most of the reads  were mapped to annotated regions, whereas the remaining  <dig>  reads  were mapped to non-annotated regions . the majority of reads that mapped to annotated regions  corresponded to rrnas  or trnas , and the remainder corresponded to coding sequences , previously known srnas , untranslated regions  or other regions such as pseudogenes or phantom genes . conversely, the reads that mapped to the non-annotated regions  corresponded to either intergenic regions  or cis-antisense strands of known genes . we classified the reads that could be mapped to both intergenic regions and cis-antisense strands of known genes as "other regions" . the reads located on cis-antisense strands of the ribosomal binding sites  of known genes, in particular, may be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mrnas  <cit> . we noted that  <dig>  reads  were classified in this category.

to predict novel transcribed regions, the resulting reads were classified into one of five groups , according to the numbers  and types  of the mapped regions . we then eliminated the non-annotated mapped regions in group e, because the reads in group e matched multiple regions and because it was difficult to determine which one was actually expressed. finally, all overlapping mapped regions were assembled, thus generating  <dig>  novel transcribed regions and  <dig>  known transcribed regions . we assumed that some of these regions were still fragmentary. it is noted that  <dig> of  <dig> known srnas registered in regulondb  <dig>  were detected with multiple deep sequencing reads, indicating the reliability of our method. the remaining  <dig> known srnas have been reported to be expressed only under specific conditions .

then, we attempted to extract novel srnas from the  <dig>  novel transcribed regions. for this purpose, we focused on novel transcription units. generally, srnas can be generated either as primary transcripts or by processing from longer precursor transcripts  <cit> . in this study, we ignored the latter case because we could not discriminate the processed srnas from rna degradation products in the current experiment. we used both computational and experimental data to reveal the novel transcriptional units. firstly, we searched for potential promoter and terminator sequences at the genome level, as described previously  <cit> , and predicted  <dig>  sigma  <dig> promoter sequences and  <dig>  rho-independent terminator sequences. the observed-to-expected  ratio of the predicted sigma  <dig> promoters for the  <dig>  novel transcribed regions was lower than that for the  <dig> known genes with annotated sigma  <dig> promoters , but it is striking that their undulating patterns were very similar. these results suggest that many of the novel transcribed regions contain predicted sigma  <dig> promoters, as do the known genes. however, in the case of rho-independent terminators, the o/e ratio of the  <dig>  novel transcribed regions was not significant , suggesting that most of the novel transcribed regions may not have a defined transcription termination site or may lack the 3' sequence. based on these results, we decided to use only the transcription initiation information to extract the candidate srnas. next, we collected published data on experimentally determined transcription start sites   <cit>  and rna polymerase-binding regions   <cit> . finally, we selected  <dig> novel transcribed regions as candidate srnas. the criteria for this selection process were as follows :  computational or experimental evidence of transcription initiation; and  a length of more than  <dig> nt. these candidate srnas were designated ecs001- <dig>  of these candidate srnas,  <dig> were located in intergenic regions  and the remaining  <dig> were located on the opposite strand of annotated regions . we also classified these  <dig> candidate srnas into three classes  according to the evidence for transcription initiation . the details of these candidate srnas are summarised in additional file  <dig> 

it has been reported that small functional proteins of less than  <dig> amino acids  <cit>  and several regulatory srnas encode small functional peptides  in bacteria  <cit> . therefore, we scanned the sequence of each candidate srna for an open reading frame  and corresponding rbs using a computational approach, to determine whether our novel candidate srnas could encode small peptides. we determined that  <dig> candidate srnas had both an orf and a corresponding rbs, suggesting that these srnas may encode small peptides . seventy-five candidate srnas had putative start codons and corresponding rbss, although they did not have stop codons . fifty-five candidate srnas had putative orfs, although they did not have corresponding rbss . collectively, our data suggest that additional small proteins might yet be discovered among these candidate srnas. in contrast, the remaining  <dig> candidate srnas did not have orfs of an appropriate length or rbss, suggesting that these function as non-coding rnas . the details of these candidate srnas are summarised in additional file  <dig> 

expression of novel srnas analysed by northern blot hybridisation
deep sequencing analysis revealed a large number of novel transcribed regions, identifying  <dig> intergenic and cis-antisense candidate srnas. we used northern blot analysis to confirm the expression and determine the sizes of these srnas, with strand-specific probes for the  <dig> most abundant candidate srnas with predicted sigma  <dig> promoters . sixteen of these were intergenic srnas and nine were cis-antisense srnas. we used both total rna and low-molecular-weight rna from e. coli cells grown to either exponential or stationary phase. we defined the expected size of each srna as the length of the continuous genomic region mapped with at least one read.

intergenic srnas
expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> intergenic candidate srnas was detected by northern blot analysis  and the results are summarised in table  <dig>  the lengths of each main band on the ecs <dig>  ecs <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> blots were almost the same as the expected sizes . for the remaining six candidate srnas , the observed size was longer than the expected size. among them, the observed sizes of ecs <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> were almost equivalent to the distance between the 5' end of each candidate srna and the 3' end of the nearest downstream gene. based on the regulondb database and the results of this study, the longer transcripts may be expressed from novel tsss . for three candidate srnas, ecs <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  the reason for the difference between the observed band size and the expected band size remains unknown. although the band for ecs <dig> was very faint on northern blots, we obtained a similar expression pattern using two different probes , and thought that the candidate ecs <dig> was a member of the novel srna category. for ecs <dig>  we detected a smear in the total rna lanes on northern blots and eliminated this candidate from being a novel srna because we did not detect a similar expression pattern using two different probes . intriguingly, the ecs <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> srnas were differentially expressed in the four different growth phases , suggesting that the expression of these rnas is regulated during bacterial growth.

cis-antisense srnas
the expression of four of the nine cis-antisense candidate srnas was detected by northern blot analysis  and the results are summarised in table  <dig>  the observed size of each candidate srna differed slightly from the expected size. however, for the ecs <dig> candidate srna, the length of the mapped region with many reads  was consistent with the observed size . a faint band was also observed at ~ <dig> nt, which corresponded to the expected size. these results suggest that ecs <dig> is first transcribed as a precursor of approximately  <dig> nt and is then cleaved to ~ <dig> nt. the observed sizes of the remaining candidate srnas were somewhat longer than expected .

it is well known that cis-antisense srnas and their target mrnas exhibit complete complementarity, and that their base-pairing causes either translational regulation of the target rna by changing the ratio of its ribosomal-binding activity or degradation of the target rna by certain ribonuclease  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that a subset of srnas regulates transcription  <cit> . for example, the ecs <dig> srna is encoded on the cis-antisense strand of the ymfm rbs, and might regulate ymfm translation by masking the rbs. the ecs <dig> srna is encoded on the cis-antisense strand of the sigma  <dig> promoter  of the ykgm-ykgo operon and the ecs <dig> srna is encoded on the cis-antisense strand of the ybhj mrna , suggesting that these cis-antisense srnas might regulate their corresponding sense transcript. in contrast, the ecs <dig> srna is encoded on the cis-antisense strand of the is <dig> srna. it has previously been reported that the is <dig> srna overlaps the is <dig> srna in the same chromosomal region as a cis-antisense srna pair  <cit> . both the is <dig> and is <dig> srna transcripts  were detected by northern blot analysis with a double-stranded probe that could not discriminate between the strands. we found that only is <dig> is registered in the regulondb version  <dig>  database. however, in our study, no is <dig> srna was detected by northern blotting with strand-specific probes , although is <dig> was detected as part of ecs <dig>  therefore, we suggest that the is <dig> srna is an artefact or is only expressed under specific conditions. we also suggest a re-annotation of is <dig> as ecs <dig>  a member of the intergenic srnas.

novel srnas expressed from prophage regions and their possible roles
the e. coli k <dig> genome is reported to include  <dig> prophages  <cit> . we noted that  <dig> of  <dig> candidate srnas were expressed from prophage regions . to date, the isrc  <cit> , c <dig>  <cit>  and dicf  <cit>  srnas are known to be expressed from prophage regions. the functions of the isrc and c <dig> srnas are totally unknown, although the dicf srna is known to bind the rbs of the ftsz mrna, thus inhibiting ribosome entry. because ftsz encodes a protein  involved in cell division, dicf srna binding causes a defect in e. coli cell division  <cit> . to investigate our srnas expressed from prophage regions, we focused on five srnas detected by northern blot analysis .

because the expression of many srnas is reported to be regulated under specific conditions  <cit> , such as under various stresses, in different kinds of media or in the presence of certain chemicals, we analysed the expression of each srna expressed from a prophage region using total rnas prepared from cells grown under these conditions . we used total rnas from e. coli cells grown to exponential or stationary phase in lb  medium or e. coli cells subjected to heat or cold shock. we also used an hfq knockout strain  because the rna chaperone hfq is thought to be required for the stability of many srnas and/or their activity in e. coli  <cit> . we measured the signal intensity of each band using the quantity one software package , and calculated the relative amount of each transcript by comparison with the signal intensity of that transcript in samples derived from cells grown to exponential phase in m <dig> medium, which were used as the control. the gene expression of the ecs <dig> srna did not change under any of these conditions, although its transcript level seemed to be relatively stronger. in contrast, the levels of the ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> transcripts were reduced  in lb medium . the expression of the ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> srnas was increased  by heat shock, whereas that of the ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> srnas was increased  by cold shock. the levels of the ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> transcripts were reduced  in the hfq knockout strain. the expression of dicf srna, which is known to bind hfq, was also reduced and was negligible in the hfq knockout strain. moreover, the ecs <dig> transcript overlapped with previously predicted candidate srnas that have been detected based on co-immunoprecipitation with hfq  <cit>  . these results suggest that hfq is required to produce or maintain the ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> srnas.

nucleotide conservation of novel candidate srnas in bacteria
the blast-like alignment tool   <cit>  was used to compare the nucleotide sequences of the  <dig> previously known srnas and  <dig> novel candidate srnas in e. coli with those of  <dig>  complete bacterial genomes. under our definition of "conservation" , we found that only  <dig> genomes derived from  <dig> genera possessed similar sequences, and that most of the conservation was restricted to two genera: escherichia and shigella. an example of the nucleotide conservation of the  <dig> most abundant candidate srnas is shown in figure  <dig>  the same features of conservation were reported in a previous study using  <dig> srnas  <cit> . in contrast, some novel srnas, such as ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  exhibited conservation with sequence from the salmonella genus. moreover, the ecs <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig> srnas were conserved beyond the yersinia genus, similar to housekeeping srnas such as ssrs srna  and ffs srna . srnas expressed from prophage regions, such as esc <dig>  ecs <dig> and ecs <dig>  were not well conserved even within the escherichia genus. because the host range of some bacteriophages is quite limited and, in many cases, each bacteriophage only attacks a single strain of bacterium  <cit> , the prophage region itself may not demonstrate high levels of nucleotide conservation in the genome.

construction of the ecsbrowser
we constructed the ecsbrowser to provide an up-to-date overview of e. coli srnas, including those identified in this study . this database enables visualisation of all the data from the current analysis. in figure  <dig>  the upper panel shows all the ncrna genes encoded in the e. coli genome, including srnas, trnas and rrnas. the middle panel magnifies the entire cps- <dig> prophage. the lower panel focuses on the ecs <dig> srna. in this figure, we used the example of ecs <dig>  expressed from the cps- <dig> prophage region. similarly, using the ecsbrowser, we can obtain information for each srna, from the single-nucleotide level to the whole-genome level. we also included in this browser the evolutionary conservation data for the  <dig> previously known srnas and  <dig> novel srnas. the ecsbrowser is available through the website http://rna.iab.keio.ac.jp.

discussion
in this study, our first priority was to detect novel transcribed regions, so we filtered unreliable reads quite strictly and only selected  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads from the original  <dig> , <dig> reads . we then discovered  <dig>  novel  transcribed regions and selected  <dig> candidate srnas . it is likely that these candidate srnas are actually expressed under the conditions used in this study because the deep sequencing-based approach directly determines the cdna sequence. traditionally, the expression of previously known srnas was ultimately confirmed by northern blot analysis  <cit> . therefore, we also conducted northern blot analysis, detected the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> examined candidate srnas  and identified  <dig> of them as novel srnas. we cannot explain why the remaining  <dig> candidate srnas could not be detected by northern analysis. it might be necessary to optimise the hybridisation conditions for each srna. in addition, we could not intrinsically distinguish the novel srnas from stable degradation products in our current study. therefore, we established criteria for extracting srnas . in this way, we selected  <dig> candidate srnas with computational or experimental evidence of transcription initiation and a length of more than  <dig> nt . because several srnas generated by processing from larger precursor rnas have been reported  <cit>  and fairly small srnas  are known in a few cases  <cit> , the remaining novel transcribed regions might contain additional srnas. collectively, at least  <dig> previously unreported srnas were identified, and the expression of many other candidate srnas was implied by this study, although the functions of the vast majority of these candidate srnas are not yet clear.

in the last decade, several groups have searched extensively for srnas in e. coli using computational and experimental approaches  <cit> . therefore, we examined the overlaps between the candidate srnas in this study and those identified in previous studies. forty-seven of the  <dig> novel candidate srnas overlapped with previously predicted srnas, but the remaining  <dig> could not be predicted by traditional approaches. the details are summarised in additional file  <dig> and the ecsbrowser. moreover, we suggested that  <dig> of the  <dig> novel candidate srnas might encode small proteins because they have both an orf  and corresponding rbs. interestingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> potential small proteins in this study overlapped with the dataset of small proteins that have been computationally predicted based on sequence conservation and rbs models  <cit> . we show six examples of the candidate srnas that encode putative peptides in additional file  <dig> 

the primary limitation of most traditional methods of identifying srnas is a bias toward intergenic regions  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the previous list of cis-antisense srnas is far from complete. currently,  <dig> of the  <dig> previously known srnas registered in the regulondb database are located on the opposite strand from known genes in e. coli. among them,  <dig> are reported to act as cis-antisense srnas  <cit> . these srnas interact with the 5'-utr  <cit> , the 3'-utr  <cit>  or the whole area  <cit>  of each target mrna by a base-pairing mechanism. two srnas are known to interact with each other by a cis-antisense mechanism  <cit> . in this study, we found  <dig> novel cis-antisense candidate srnas . we noted that  <dig> of these  are encoded on the opposite strand from protein-coding regions, but are not in the 5'- or 3'-utrs of the mrnas . the target sites of a few trans-antisense srnas are reported to occur in protein-coding regions and these srnas cause endonucleolytic mrna destabilisation rather than the typical inhibition of translational initiation  <cit> , although most trans-antisense srnas interact with the 5'-utr of the target mrna by a base-pairing mechanism, blocking translation initiation  <cit> . these results suggest that novel cis-antisense srna species, as well as trans-antisense srnas, may regulate a coding gene on the opposite strand.

three previously identified srna genes  are expressed from prophage regions in e. coli. our results show that at least five additional srnas are expressed from prophage regions, and that the transcript levels of some of these srnas are high . recently, it was reported that prophage regions contain several srnas and that the expression levels of some srnas are also high in bacillus subtilis  <cit> . this may represent a common feature of prokaryotic srnas. four of five prophage-derived srnas were modestly activated by temperature stress , although the expression levels of these srnas were unchanged under conditions of sos induction, such as mitomycin c treatment and uv irradiation . the sos response is known to trigger significantly higher induction of prophages  <cit> .

previously, it was reported that the majority of intergenic srnas in e. coli regulate the expression of genes in response to environmental stresses, and that these integral elements of the stress response are usually very tightly regulated  <cit> . in contrast, the novel srnas in the current study are constantly expressed under our conditions, although the transcript levels of several novel srnas were also moderately activated in response to temperature stress, nutrient limitation and growth phase . to obtain more functional information on the novel srnas, we generated single-deletion mutants for  <dig> novel intergenic srna regions and conducted growth analysis of these mutants on rich and minimal medium. however, the growth of these deletion mutants was not significantly different from that of wild-type e. coli. typical data are shown in additional file  <dig>  we concluded that many of these srnas are not necessary for the growth of e. coli, although they are clearly expressed. we are now generating mutants from all the srnas for functional analysis . recently, a deep sequencing analysis of novel regulatory rnas in e. coli has been reported  <cit> . the authors identified  <dig> new srnas and  <dig> new regulatory leader sequences in the intergenic regions of e. coli. we found that four of our srnas  overlapped with their new srnas, and another four of our srnas  overlapped with their new regulatory leader sequences . these results also support the concept that there are many as-yet-undiscovered srnas or transcribed regions in e. coli.

finally, we emphasise that the ecsbrowser is the only browser that specifically focuses on the transcribed regions of the e. coli genome . this browser includes information about transcript elements, such as promoters, terminators, rbrs and tsss, which have been predicted and/or identified at the genome-wide level by various methods. furthermore, this browser includes information about srnas that were predicted in eleven previous papers  <cit> . using this browser, it is also possible to integrate a number of deep sequencing data that have been obtained under various culture conditions; we intend to use this to compare the dynamic changes in the transcriptome under each specific culture condition. we anticipate that the ecsbrowser will contribute to future transcriptome analysis, including the detection of novel srnas.

CONCLUSIONS
in previous research, many bacterial srnas have been characterised under certain stress conditions such as heat shock, cold shock or oxidative stress. in this paper, we comprehensively analysed srnas expressed in normal e. coli growth conditions and discovered  <dig> novel candidate srnas  with computational or experimental evidence of transcription initiation. we also found several novel srnas that are highly expressed in prophage regions in the e. coli genome. we conducted an evolutionary conservation analysis of the candidate srnas and summarised the data among closely related bacterial strains. furthermore, we made  <dig> srna deletion mutants and characterised their growth, although the growth of these deletion mutants was not significantly different from that of wild-type e. coli. finally, we generated a platform  for srna research in bacteria. previously, other studies have reported hundreds of candidate srnas encoded in the e. coli genome. however, there is no consensus among them and the wealth of information is confusing. in ecsbrowser, users can access the results of the  <dig> primary e. coli srna prediction papers plus our new data in a uniform database format. we believe this will be invaluable to researchers in this field.
