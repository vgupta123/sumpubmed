BACKGROUND
gap junctions facilitate the intercellular communication between adjacent cells by allowing the exchange of small molecules that play roles in the regulation of many cellular events including proliferation, differentiation and cellular homeostasis  <cit> . gap junction biosynthesis starts in the er-golgi network by the oligomerization of six connexin subunits into hemichannels, known as connexons. then, these connexons are transported to the plasma membrane where they can either align with other connexons from neighboring cells to complete the formation of intercellular channels, or function individually on the plasma membrane as hemichannels that can mediate the exchange of materials between the cell interior and the extracellular environment .

gap junction channels and hemichannels are important modulators of tissue homeostasis as evidenced by the association of mutations in connexin genes with several hereditary disorders. for example, mutations in connexin  <dig> , a member of the connexin gene family, are the leading cause of non-syndromic hearing loss   <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> nshl mutations throughout the cx <dig> gene  have been identified, and functional characterization of these mutations suggested that the majority are loss-of-function mutations that can lead to protein truncation, altered trafficking, misfolding of cx <dig> protein or altered channel permeability . in addition to nshl, cx <dig> mutations were linked to syndromic deafness associated with various skin pathologies including keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness  syndrome, palmoplantar keratoderma  and vohwinkel syndrome   <cit> . generation of diverse epidermal phenotypes during aforementioned skin disorders driven by different cx <dig> mutations imply that associated mutations may have unique properties affecting distinct cellular machinery  <cit> .

kid syndrome is a rare congenital genetic disorder with phenotypes of thickening of the skin, keratisis, scaly skin  and deafness  <cit> . the cx26a40v was the first kid syndrome associated mutation that was shown to cause increased hemichannel activities and cell death in mrna injected xenopus oocytes  <cit> . other studies on different kid syndrome mutations also suggested the involvement of altered hemichannel activities and cell death in both xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines as a common mechanism for this disorder . however, the molecular mechanisms that lead to cell death, and skin phenotypes due to active hemichannels are poorly understood. for that, we characterized two more kid syndrome mutations, cx26i30n and d50y, in order to understand whether they affect the protein biosynthetic pathway, hemichannel activities similar to previously characterized kid syndrome mutations and intracellular calcium levels that play essential roles in cellular processes, especially in keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and migration .

RESULTS
protein localization of cx26i30n and d50y mutant proteins
to examine the effects of cx26i30n and d50y kid syndrome associated mutations on protein synthesis and localization, gap junctional communication deficient cell line, hela, were transiently transfected with pires2egfp <dig> cx26wt , i30n and d50y constructs. 24 h after transfection, the protein synthesis and localization was determined by immunofluorescent staining of transfected cells . immunofluorescent staining with cx <dig> specific antibody demonstrated that cells expressing cx26wt, i30n and d50y constructs were able to synthesize cx <dig> proteins . further, cells transfected with cx26wt targeted proteins to the plasma membrane where they formed gap junction plaques at the cell-to-cell junctions between adjacent cells . on the other hand, in spite of positive protein synthesis in cells with cx26i30n or d50y constructs, no gap junctional plaques were observed between neighboring cells expressing mutant constructs . this suggested that cx26i30n and d50y proteins failed to form gap junction plaques between adjacent cells.fig.  <dig> effect of cx26i30n and d50y mutations on protein expression and localization. merged images of cx26wt, i30n and d50y transfected hela cells that were co-stained with phalloidin for actin  and cx <dig> antibody . blue is for dapi staining of the nucleus. white arrow head shows the gap junction plaques formed between adjacent cx26wt expressing cells. red arrow heads point the cell-to-cell contact sites between neighboring cells of cx26i30n and d50y. cells with only green and blue signals indicate untransfected cells. scale bar 10 μm



effect of cx26i30n and d50y mutations on the cx <dig> protein trafficking
in order to determine the location of cx <dig> proteins within cells, co-labelling of cx <dig> protein with golgin- <dig>  a golgi apparatus marker, or cx <dig> protein with wheat germ agglutinin , for the plasma membrane staining, were performed . as observed in images in fig. 2a, there was no overlap between cx <dig> and golgin- <dig> protein signals in cx26wt expressing cells while cx26i30n or d50y mutant proteins were widely co-localized with golgin- <dig> in transfected cells as evidenced by the presence of yellow signals . analysis of costes’ colocalization values through image processing revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig>  images for cx26wt had significant colocalization for cx <dig> protein and golgin- <dig> . on the other hand,  <dig> out of  <dig> images  for cx26i30n and  <dig> out of  <dig>  for cx26d50y had significant co-localization, ratios that were both significantly  higher compared to wt images . furthermore, the membrane localization of cx26wt, i30n and d50y, that was verified by cx <dig> and rhodamine labeled wga co-staining suggested that a fraction of proteins in all conditions were localized to the plasma membrane . these suggested that mutant proteins can be found both in the golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane.fig.  <dig> effect of cx26i30n and d50y mutations on protein trafficking. a merged images of cx26wt, i30n and d50y transfected cells that were co-stained with cx <dig>  and the golgi apparatus marker, golgin- <dig>  antibodies. blue is for dapi staining of the nucleus. arrow heads point the location of the golgi apparatus. yellow signals in cx26i30n and d50y images show the colocalization of cx <dig> and golgin- <dig>  scale bar 10 μm. b merged images of cx26wt, i30n and d50y transfected cells that were co-stained with cx <dig>  antibody and rhodamine labeled wheat germ agglutinin . blue is for dapi staining of the nucleus. yellow signals shown by arrow heads point out the colocalization of cx <dig> and wga. scale bar 10 μm

altered hemichannel activities of cx26i30n and d50y channels
cx <dig> mutations associated with kid syndrome have been shown to cause elevated hemichannel activities  <cit> . here, we determined the ability of cx26i30n mutation to form aberrant hemichannels in addition to d50y mutation that was previously shown to result in elevated membrane currents in xenopus oocytes by electrophysiological measurements  <cit>  in mammalian cell lines with fluorescent dye uptake assay using neurobiotin  . under physiological calcium concentrations, cx26wt hemichannels had 10 % increase in the mean fluorescent intensity of nb in cells compared to negative control. on the other hand, cx26i30n and d50y expressing cells had  <dig>  fold increase in nb uptake with respect to wt containing cells  , suggesting an aberrant hemichannel activities. to further verify the formation of abnormal hemichannels on the plasma membrane, dye uptake studies were performed under divalent free conditions and in the presence of a hemichannel blocker, carbenoxolone  . analysis of nb fluorescent intensity in egfp positive cells suggested that the fluorescent intensity of cx26wt cells was  <dig>  fold  higher than control cells and for i30n and d50y cells the fluorescent intensities increased by  <dig>   and  <dig>  fold  compared to cx26wt cells, respectively . to determine if the uptake of nb into the cells were mediated by cx26i30n and d50y abnormal hemichannels, cells were initially treated with a hemichannel blocker, carbenoxolone  before nb application. treatment of cells with 100 μm cbx for 20 min resulted in a 17 % and 35 %  reduction in the levels of mean fluorescent intensities in cx26i30n and d50y expressing cells compared to their cbx absent counterparts, respectively. these suggested that the increase in the uptake of nb into cells were mediated by aberrant hemichannels formed from cx26i30n and d50y.fig.  <dig> fluorescent dye uptake in cx26wt, i30n and d50y transfected cells. a comparison of fluorescent dye intensities in transfected cells under physiological calcium concentration. cx26i30n and d50y were compared with both negative control pires2egfp <dig> and cx26wt . b comparison of fluorescent dye intensities in transfected cells in divalent free medium and in the presence of 100 μm cbx, a hemichannel blocker. cx26wt, i30n and d50y were compared with negative control pires2egfp <dig> ; cx26i30n and d50y were compared with cx26wt  and comparison between samples treated with or without cbx was performed 



effect of cx26i30n and d50y mutations on intracellular calcium signals
calcium signals are essential for the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis . therefore, we next wanted to investigate whether cx26i30n and d50y mutations have any effect on internal calcium content by using a calcium indicator, fluo-3 am, and flow cytometry . comparison of fluo-3 am signals in pcs2+, cx26wt, i30n and d50y transfected cells demonstrated that intracellular calcium content in both i30n and d50y transfected cells were elevated by  <dig>   and  <dig>  fold  compared to cells with pcs2+ and cx26wt clones, respectively . this increase in intracellular calcium content was reduced by 34 % and 50 %  with the treatment of 100 μm cbx in cx26i30n and d50y containing cells, respectively, suggesting the involvement of aberrant hemichannels in the elevation of intracellular calcium concentration .fig.  <dig> effect of cx <dig> mutations on intracellular calcium levels. intracellular calcium concentration determined by a calcium indicator  using flow cytometry was compared among pcs2+, cx26wt, i30n and d50y containing cells . comparison between 100 μm cbx treated and non-treated samples was also performed 



discussion
characterization of cx <dig> mutations associated with kid syndrome will improve the understanding of both cx <dig> function in normal epidermal homeostasis and generation of disease phenotypes in affected individuals. examination of several cx <dig> mutations suggested that kid syndrome mutations lead to the formation of active hemichannels on the plasma membrane that might result in uncontrolled exchange of molecules between the cytosol and the extracellular environment, influencing the cellular/tissue homeostasis  <cit> . here, we characterized two additional kid syndrome mutations, cx26i30n and d50y, in order to understand their effect on the protein biosynthetic pathway, hemichannel activity and intracellular calcium levels in communication deficient cell lines. we demonstrated that both mutants failed to form gap junction plaques at cell-to-cell contact sites between neighboring cells in contrast to cx26wt proteins even though a fraction of mutant proteins was targeted to the plasma membrane. moreover, cells with mutant constructs had increased uptake of neurobiotin fluorescent dye and elevated intracellular calcium levels compared to cells with cx26wt which were abolished by carbenoxolone, a hemichannel blocker. these observations provided support for the contribution of aberrant hemichannels and the involvement of altered calcium signals in kid syndrome  <cit> .

mutations in the cx <dig> gene cause both non-syndromic and syndromic deafness with skin pathologies. each mutation is unique in terms of defects they cause, that is, mutations leading to various skin disorders result in distinct molecular abnormalities within cells at different levels from protein synthesis to the formation and the function of gap junction channels  <cit> . mutations associated with kid syndrome, for example, were shown to mostly cause abnormal hemichannel activity leading to altered regulation of molecular exchange through the plasma membrane . similar to many characterized kid syndrome mutations, cx26i30n and d50y also resulted in increased fluorescent dye uptake from the external environment, suggesting the involvement of aberrant hemichannel activities for these mutations.

disease associated cx <dig> mutations lead to different molecular abnormalities that can interfere with the cellular homeostasis  <cit> . included among these are alteration in trafficking of proteins to the plasma membrane, where they could prevent the formation of gap junction plaques at cell-to-cell contact sites. abnormal membrane trafficking might result in the accumulation of mutant proteins within the subcellular structures including the er, the er-golgi intermediate compartment or the golgi apparatus . in this study, cx26i30n and d50y mutations were observed to abolish the formation of gap junction plaques between adjacent cells. although mutant proteins were observed on the plasma membrane, they were also widely accumulated in the golgi apparatus. how mutations in isoleucine  <dig>  and aspartic acid at position  <dig>  affect the localization and function of cx <dig> is not known. i <dig> is found in the first transmembrane domain  that was shown to be important for oligomerization and channel function  <cit> . the mutation of a nonpolar residue into a polar amino acid  might affect the structure of the tm <dig> as asparagine can form hydrogen bonds with other residues that can affect the organization and stability of this domain. the inability of i30n mutation to form gap junction channels suggest that this amino acid might influence the docking of hemichannels in the extracellular space during the formation of gap junction channels. the first extracellular loop  was shown to be involved in connexon formation, docking of connexons at the extracellular space and gap junction channel function  <cit> . d <dig> in ec <dig> is highly conserved across species and across the connexin family  <cit> . the mutation of this charged amino acid might alter the organization of the ec <dig>  affecting the interactions of connexons in the esc as they are forming the gap junction channels  <cit> .

the maintenance of calcium homeostasis is crucial for proper functioning of keratinocytes and the epidermis. calcium plays roles in the regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and cellular adhesion processes  <cit> . furthermore, there is a calcium gradient across the epidermis with the lowest concentration in the stratum basale and the highest in the stratum granulosum. maintenance of this gradient and intracellular calcium levels are indispensable for epidermal cells as abnormalities in these processes have been linked to a variety of skin disorders . here, cx26i30n and d50y mutations were shown to result in the elevation of intracellular calcium in transfected cells compared to cx26wt cells. an increase in the intracellular calcium levels was also observed for other cx <dig> kid syndrome associated mutations  <cit> . terrinoni et al. demonstrated that cells with cx26g11e and d50n mutations have an increased amount of intracellular calcium 24 h post transfection  <cit> . moreover, garcia et al. observed a significant increase in the intracellular calcium levels in cells co-expressing cx <dig> and kid syndrome associated cx <dig> mutant constructs compared to cx <dig> alone cells  <cit> . thus, deregulation of intracellular calcium mechanisms by aberrant hemichannel activities may perturb several calcium dependent cellular processes to contribute to the development of skin phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
formation of aberrant hemichannels due to cx26i30n and d50y mutations provided further support for the involvement of abnormal hemichannel activities as a common mechanism for kid syndrome. uncontrolled transport of signaling molecules such as atp or calcium through these channels may alter keratinocyte growth, proliferation and/or differentiation that could play role in the generation of dermatological anomalies in kid patients. however, the molecular mechanisms altered by aberrant cx <dig> hemichannels affecting keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and migration remain to be elusive.
