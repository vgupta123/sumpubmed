BACKGROUND
due to its respiratory versatility, shewanella oneidensis strain mr- <dig> serves as a model organism for studying the regulation of aerobic and anaerobic growth  <cit> . in contrast to escherichia coli, the regulatory systems that control transcription of genes responsible for different respiratory processes are poorly understood in environmentally relevant shewanella spp.  <cit> . in e. coli, the transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism is primarily regulated by fnr  and by the two-component regulatory system arcab   <cit> . a gene expression study in e. coli k <dig> indicated that one-third of its  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed during aerobic versus anaerobic growth  <cit> . among the differentially expressed genes,  <dig>  genes were directly or indirectly affected by fnr. fnr possesses a 2+ cluster that acts as an oxygen sensory domain  <cit> . fnr in its active dimeric form binds to target dna sequences inducing or repressing transcription  <cit> . under aerobic conditions, or when oxygen levels increase, an fe2+ atom in the 2+ cluster is oxidized resulting in the formation of a 2+ cluster via a 1+ intermediate. this oxidation causes a conformation change in fnr, thus altering its affinity to dna and regulatory control of transcription  <cit> .

studies with strain mr- <dig> mutants have identified three important regulators of anaerobic metabolism: etra , arca and crp   <cit> . sequence alignment of the protein encoded by etra reveal that the four cysteine residues that form the 2+ cluster in fnr are conserved in etra  <cit> . in a gene replacement study, etra of strain mr- <dig> restored wild type physiology of an e. coli fnr deletion mutant  <cit> . etra shares  <dig> % and  <dig> % of amino acid sequence identity with fnr in e. coli and anr  in pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. this high degree of similarity suggests that etra has a regulatory function in mr- <dig>  possibly by sensing oxygen. despite the lack of physiological evidence to support a regulatory role of etra in the anaerobic metabolism of strain mr- <dig>  <cit> , a gene expression study using a partial microarray  of the strain mr-1's genome suggested involvement of etra in the regulation of the transcription of genes associated with aerobic and anaerobic metabolism  <cit> . growth experiments with an etra deletion mutant in s. oneidensis strain dsp <dig>  implicated etra in the regulation of genes related to aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, similar to what has been observed for fnr in e. coli  <cit> . unfortunately, the implications of these findings cannot be interpreted unambiguously since the rifampicin resistance of strain dsp <dig> influences electron transport  <cit> .

to examine the regulatory role of etra in strain mr- <dig> in more detail, we generated an etra knockout mutant etra7- <dig> in a wild type background. growth and phenotypic characterization of this mutant combined with a whole genome transcriptome analysis confirms that etra regulates nitrate and fumarate reduction, plus provides experimental evidence for its positive regulatory role in dmso reduction. our genome-wide expression analysis shows differential expression of  <dig> genes for which sequence analysis recognized a etra motif for  <dig> of the operons encoding  <dig> genes, suggesting that their regulation is via direct interaction of etra with its promoters. most of these genes are associated with metabolic functions.

RESULTS
genotypic and phenotypic characterization of a Δetra::loxp mutant
the growth of the etra knockout mutant etra7- <dig> with nitrate was significantly impaired as cultures reached a maximum od <dig> of  <dig> , at least 5-fold lower than the wild type strain . in addition, the doubling time for the mutant under these conditions was approximately  <dig> h compared to a doubling time of  <dig> h for the wild type. plasmid pccg <dig> carrying etra, but not the parental pcm <dig> vector lacking etra, restored near wild type growth to the etra7- <dig> mutant, which confirms that the observed phenotype was attributable to the deletion of etra. after  <dig> h of incubation, nitrate was reduced in wild type and complemented etra7- <dig> cultures though less nitrate was reduced in the latter consistent with its slightly slower growth . after  <dig> h, both the wild type and etra7- <dig> complement had completely converted nitrate and nitrite to ammonia, while nitrite was the major product in cultures of the etra7- <dig> mutant and the control strain harboring pcm <dig> .

anaerobic cultures of the mutant and the wild type strain were analyzed for the reduction of different electron acceptors with lactate as the electron donor. no growth of the etra7- <dig> mutant was observed with fumarate as electron acceptor whereas the wild type strain reached an od <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . limited growth  was observed in mutant cultures amended with trimethylamine n-oxide  or thiosulfate . no od increases with the mutant and the wild type were measured with dmso provided as electron acceptor at  <dig> and  <dig> mm; however, hplc analyses of cultures with  <dig> mm dmso revealed that dmso was completely consumed in wild type cultures, whereas no dmso consumption was evident in the mutant cultures . no changes in dmso concentrations were observed in cultures with  <dig> mm dmso. no significant differences in fe, mn and sulfite reduction rates were observed between the wild type and the etra7- <dig> deletion mutant . anaerobic cultures of the mutant and the wild type strains grown with pyruvate instead of lactate as electron donor showed similar results, i.e., the mutant showed limited or no growth with nitrate, fumarate and dmso provided as electron acceptors compared to the wild type . similar to the lactate-amended cultures, the rates of nitrate, fumarate and dmso reduction in wild type cultures exceeded those measured in cultures of the mutant strain . resting cell assays corroborated these findings and nitrate reduction and ammonium production occurred at higher rates in assays with wild type cells. complete stoichiometric conversion to ammonium also occurred in the assays with mutant cells, although lower rates and a 3-fold longer incubation were required for complete reduction  .

data are means ± the standard deviation from three independent cultures.

effects of etra deletion on transcription
the global transcriptome profile of mutant strain etra7- <dig> grown anaerobically with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor was compared to that of the wild type under the same growth conditions. a complete list of all the genes differentially expressed two-fold or higher is provided as supplemental information . out of  <dig> differentially transcribed genes in the etra7- <dig> mutant relative to the wild type,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. the differentially transcribed genes were classified in  <dig> functional "tigr role" categories  based on the mr- <dig> genome annotation   <cit> . genes with unknown functions represented the largest category of up-regulated  and the second most common category of down-regulated genes . genes associated with energy metabolism were the largest category  of down-regulated genes . among the up-regulated genes, the "protein synthesis" category ranked second  and the "other categories" ranked third . this latter category included phage-, transposase- and plasmid-related genes. the "energy metabolism" category represented  <dig> %, ranking fourth.

identification of putative etra binding sites
the promoters of the differentially expressed genes were examined for putative etra binding sites in order to identify those genes that were likely directly regulated by etra from the many genes whose expression changes were most likely due to secondary effects. for example, the up-regulation of phage-related genes is likely a response to stress, and not a direct result of the etra deletion. putative etra binding sites were identified for those genes that showed at least  <dig>  fold change in the etra7- <dig> mutant relative to the wild type by extracting the upstream intergenic sequences and applying the gibbs centroid sampler to identify a putative binding site motif. a motif was identified  that displays similarities to the e. coli fnr and crp binding sites motifs; this motif was present upstream of  <dig> operons that encode a total of  <dig> genes. the largest proportion of these genes is in the "energy metabolism" category . binding sites were detected upstream of an additional  <dig> operons when the detected motif  was used to scan the upstream intergenic regions of all genes listed in additional file  <dig>

regulatory role of etra in energy metabolism
since the "energy metabolism" category contained the largest group of genes responsive to etra, these genes were analyzed in more detail. up-regulated genes  in this group included genes encoding a cytochrome c oxidase , proteins involved in gluconeogenesis such as pcka , and nqrabcdef- <dig> genes  encoding nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductases. from this group, only the nqr gene clusters had a putative etra binding site.

while the nqr- <dig> gene cluster was up-regulated in the etra knockout mutant, the nqr- <dig> gene cluster  was down-regulated. nqr is a na+ pump that during respiration generates a sodium motive force to mediate solute transport, flagellar motility and atp synthesis  <cit> . both nqr gene clusters had putative etra binding sites. the microarray data indicated that etra affects the transcription pattern of these genes differently. similarly, the etra deletion had a distinct effect on the expression of the fdh gene clusters encoding a formate dehydrogenase. the fdh- <dig> genes  were up-regulated whereas the fdh- <dig> gene cluster  was down-regulated. an etra binding site was only identified for the fdh- <dig> cluster and not for the fdh- <dig> cluster, indicating etra affects both clusters differently.

other up-regulated genes in the "energy metabolism" category included the succinate dehydrogenase gene sdhc , the succinyl-coa synthase operon sucabcd , the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase and the acetyl coa-synthase genes .

down-regulated genes in the "energy metabolism" category , which were predicted for direct regulation by etra, included genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, especially in nitrate respiration like the napbhgad operon , and the nrfa  genes. cyma , the prismane protein hcp gene , and neighboring protein hcr gene , both of which were strongly repressed  and have been associated with the nitrate reduction pathway  <cit> , did not show evidence of etra binding sites. also indirectly down-regulated were the fumarate reductase genes frdab  and fcca , the acka and the pta  genes involved in acetate production and the ppc  gene encoding an acetate phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase. the hyacba  genes encoding a quinone-reactive ni/fe hydrogenase were highly indirectly repressed . among the genes identified as directly down-regulated are all the genes in the operon that encodes the anaerobic dmso reductase  , the cydab genes  encoding a cytochrome d oxidase complex, as well as genes involved in metabolism of organic compounds such as the pflab .

other down-regulated genes grouped in different categories included genes encoding abc transporters , tonb-dependent receptors , and l-lactate permease  and a putative lactate permease . the only gene directly down-regulated from this later group is lldp , for which an etra binding site was predicted . as expected, the cdna for etra, shows no significant hybridization signal in etra7- <dig> mutant .

stress response caused by the etra deletion
we detected induction of genes from various categories, which have been associated with stress response i.e., starvation, phage infection and oxidative stress, possibly due to accumulation of nitrogen oxide reactive species. up-regulated genes  were dominated by genes grouped in "other categories". the majority of up-regulated genes were phage-related. for example,  <dig> genes of the lambdaso phage , a gene encoding a viral capsid protein of the muso <dig> phage , and genes of muso <dig> phage  were up-regulated. in contrast, the gene encoding the lambdaso phage transcriptional regulator of the cro/ci family  was down-regulated . transcriptional changes of most of these genes are likely indirect effects due to the deletion of the etra gene and only for the lambdaso phage genes s02957- <dig> was an etra binding site predicted.

the category "transport and binding proteins" contains a large number of genes associated with stress response. up-regulated genes in this group contain genes encoding heavy metal efflux pumps  and genes for phosphate transport . there was up-regulation of phobr  and phou  genes, which regulate the phosphate transporters genes during phosphate starvation  <cit> .

up-regulated genes in response to stress conditions i.e., starvation, phage infection, oxidative stress, include a stringent starvation protein encoded by the sspab genes  <cit> , and a phage shock protein operon pspabc  <cit> . other up-regulated stress-related genes were the rna polymerase sigma- <dig> factor rpod  <cit> , a gtp-binding protein that regulates the tca cycle and responds to starvation  <cit> , and a dna repair protein  <cit> .

discussion
the results of this study demonstrate that etra positively regulates dissimilatory nitrate, fumarate and dmso reduction pathways in s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  the generation of etra knockout mutant etra7- <dig> in the wild type strain mr- <dig> background eliminated any possible secondary effects on the phenotype, such as the electron transfer perturbation suspected with the rifampicin resistant dsp <dig> strain  <cit> . similar to other etra mutants of strain mr- <dig>  etra7- <dig> retained its ability to reduce nitrate  <cit> ; however, our results show that the anaerobic growth of the mutant was significantly impaired compared to the wild type when nitrate was the only electron acceptor. likewise, the etra deletion mutant lost its ability to reduce fumarate and dmso with both lactate and pyruvate as electron donor. regulation of dmso reduction by etra in strain mr- <dig> was suggested previously  <cit>  however this study provides physiological evidence that confirm its role. the ability of the etra7- <dig> mutant to reduce tmao and thiosulfate also decreased; however the reduction of fe citrate, mn and sulfite was not affected by the deletion. no differences in growth performance between the wild type and the mutant were observed under aerobic conditions .

the transcriptome analysis provides a genome-wide expression profile of s. oneidensis mr- <dig> instead of the partial genome array that was previously evaluated . we observed in  <dig>  differentially expressed genes represented though some are likely due to differences in growth rate between the mutant strain and the wild type strain. nonetheless, the expression patterns of genes are consistent with the physiological data and with the transcription data reported for fnr in e. coli  <cit>  and with the more limited data by beliaev et al.  <cit> . genes involved in nitrate reduction  were significantly down-regulated by the etra deletion as well as those encoding the fumarate reduction  and all the genes encoding for the dmso reductases . all of these genes have been considered candidates for etra regulation in previous studies; however, results were not conclusive  <cit> . sequence analysis of the regulatory regions of the differentially expressed genes, indicated possible etra recognition sites for most genes in the "energy metabolism" category, some of which i.e. napdahgb, nrfa, frdab and dmsab, confirms previous results  <cit>  and further suggests that regulation of these genes is via direct interaction of etra with their promoters. putative recognition sites for etra were also identified for the two nqr gene clusters, which had not been identified previously. also, the regulatory regions for fdh gene clusters were evaluated and an etra binding site was recognized for only fdha- <dig>  the fdh- <dig> cluster does not possess an etra binding site, suggesting a different regulatory system.

our data indicate that etra is a global regulator acting in cooperation with other regulatory proteins to control anaerobic metabolic processes in strain mr- <dig>  <cit> , therefore, the expression of these genes cannot be expected to be under an "all or none" regulatory mechanism. rather, these global regulators respond to multiple stimuli  and fine-tune regulation via transcriptional control and interactions between regulatory proteins. studies in s. oneidensis and in other shewanella species that indicate the combined action of transcriptional regulators for the anaerobic metabolism in this organism  <cit> . for example, recent studies showed that crp, etra and the product of the cya genes act as expression regulators of several anaerobic respiratory systems, including nitrate reduction in s. oneidensis mr- <dig> and shewanella sp. strain ana- <dig>  <cit> . in e. coli, fnr and narp positively regulate the nap and nrf genes  <cit> . mr- <dig> possesses the genes for a homolog of the two-component regulatory system in e. coli narq/narp . the presence of alternate regulators that partially fulfill the function of etra can explain why nitrate reduction even though impaired, still occurred in the etra7- <dig> knockout mutant.

down-regulation of genes for lactate transport was also observed. since lactate was the source of reducing equivalents and carbon, a lack of electron donor and carbon may have contributed to the impaired growth of the etra7- <dig> mutant. induction of transport proteins for carbon sources and electron acceptors has also been credited to fnr in e. coli  <cit> , and a putative etra binding site was predicted for the gene encoding a lactate permease  in mr- <dig> 

impaired growth of etra7- <dig> could also be due to stress factors caused or enhanced by the deletion . the expression of phage-related genes induced in response to irradiation in strain mr- <dig> has been reported  <cit> . up-regulation of the genes involved in activation of the strain mr- <dig> prophages lambdaso, muso <dig> and muso <dig> in the etra7- <dig> mutant was observed, suggesting phage activity. induction of bacterial genes  required to stabilize the lambda protein antitermination complex in e. coli was also shown  <cit> . conversely, there is repression of the lambdaso transcription regulator cro/ci family, which represses the transcription of the lambda genes in e. coli  <cit> . also, the induction of genes associated with starvation, i.e., a condition that could activate the lytic cycle of prophages  <cit> , was confirmed in the expression analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
the involvement of several regulatory controls has complicated the interpretation of gene expression patterns and functions in shewanella spp. results from the above etra deletion mutant studies suggest a global regulatory role for etra, but one which works in conjunction with other regulators to fine-tune the expression of key genes in anaerobic metabolic pathways in s. oneidensis strain mr- <dig>  besides confirming and clarifying previous reports on fnr regulation, we also provide experimental evidence for a positive regulatory role of etra in the dmso reduction pathway of strain mr- <dig>  furthermore, our whole-genome transcriptional profile shows the effects of etra on the expression of genes not previously evaluated , and differences in the expression pattern of genes previously analyzed  <cit> . these observations are consistent with results obtained by gralnick et al.  <cit>  suggesting a distinctive regulatory system, although very similar to fnr in e. coli. a stringent sequence analysis of the regulatory region of the genes affected by the mutation suggest direct interaction of etra to those in the "energy metabolism" category, while stress- and phage-related genes are up-regulated indirectly as a consequence of a secondary perturbation. this and previous work taken together suggest that this regulator is more properly termed fnr.
