BACKGROUND
mulberry plays a crucial role in driving the sericulture industry as it serves as the sole feed for silkworm. in india, four species of mulberry have been reported to occur naturally i.e. m. indica, m. alba, m. laevigata and m. serrata  <cit> . m. indica and m. alba are cultivated for silkworm rearing whereas the other two grow naturally in the wild. apart from its uses in sericulture, mulberry is also cultivated for fruit especially m. laevigata which produces long sweet fruits, firewood, fodder, and used in furniture, traditional medicine etc. m. laevigata grows across the indian sub-continent and some collections harbor important traits such as disease and termite resistance  <cit> . m. serrata on the other hand, is restricted to higher altitudes  particularly northwestern himalayas and is known to be tolerant to frost and drought  <cit> . m. serrata also possesses several other important traits such as thicker leaves and higher moisture content and higher moisture retention  <cit> .

since the ultimate commercial importance of mulberry lies as a feedant for the silkworm, leaf palatability is an important trait directly dependent on leaf water retention capacity, total biomass, and size and weight which are considered significant in the present day breeding programs  <cit> . nonetheless, these species possess several agronomically important traits and to utilize the vast genetic potential of these species, hybridization programs between the wild species and cultivated varieties of morus sp. are promising  <cit> .

additionally, owing to the medicinal and commercial importance of mulberry, a need for developing comprehensive genomic resource has also been felt. in this pursuit, our lab has contributed immensely by generating rich transcriptome-based resources of mature leaf, drought specific transcriptome  <cit>  and root tissue  <cit>  of m. indica. the complete chloroplast genome of mulberry was also sequenced  <cit> . additionally, these resources have been utilized for generation of simple sequence repeat  markers for use in mulberry and related species  <cit> . recently, though the draft genome of haploid mulberry, m. notabilis has been sequenced  <cit> , this is far from complete limiting its practical utility. the growing concern in mulberry is evident from the recent efforts in the expansion of genomic resources  <cit>  and its subsequent utilization in marker development programs  <cit> . with recent advancements in sequencing technologies, prediction of markers from transcribed regions of the genome has become a method of choice for genotyping particularly for non-model species with less commercial value.

with the above background, in the present study we describe sequencing and generation of large-scale transcriptome based resource for two wild species of mulberry, m. laevigata and m. serrata, integrated with available information on haploid mulberry m. notabilis for dna based marker development.

RESULTS
even with the advent of next generation sequencing techniques, sequencing whole genomes of ‘less attractive’ or non-model plants/wild species remains impracticable. a fundamental need for introducing wild gene pool in the cultivated varieties of m. indica and m. alba has been long felt  <cit> . thus, two wild species of morus growing in different geographical locations in india were selected for transcriptome sequencing to explore their novel genetic potential and to undertake a comparative analysis. also, transcriptome sequencing data comprising different tissues  of m. notabilis was downloaded from morus genome database . together, these transcriptomes were used for generating a key resource for gene identification, characterization and marker development in the genus morus.

transcriptome sequencing using illumina hiseq2000
previously, we have reported generation and sequencing of est libraries of m. indica from mature leaves  <cit> , subtractive suppressive hybridization under drought stress  <cit>  and roots  <cit>  of m. indica. in the present study, transcriptomes of m. laevigata and m. serrata were sequenced using illumina hiseq <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads 2x <dig> bp in length were generated in m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively. of this, a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  paired reads of m. laevigata and m. serrata respectively were of high quality  and used for further analysis.

assembly and transcript clustering
high quality paired reads were used for de-novo assembly using trinity program version r20140413p <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were identified in m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively . clustering of assembled transcripts was undertaken using cd-hit-est version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . after clustering the number of transcripts was reduced to nearly half and around  <dig>  transcripts were identified with an average length of  <dig>  bp in m. laevigata . similarly,  <dig>  transcripts were identified with an average length of  <dig>  bp in m. serrata . the mapping of hq reads to the mulberry transcriptomes revealed that around  <dig>  and  <dig>  % reads mapped to the m. laevigata and m. serrata unigenes, respectively. the gc content was found to be  <dig>  % in m. laevigata and  <dig>  % in m. serrata transcriptomes, respectively. similar results were obtained in a study  <cit> , which reported a gc content of  <dig>  % in arabidopsis,  <dig>  % in soybean and  <dig>  % in chickpea transcripts. however, the gc content of haploid m. notabilis genome has been reported to be  <dig>  %  <cit> .table  <dig> summary of de-novo assembly statistics of m. laevigata and m. serrata transcriptomes



in m. laevigata,  <dig>   contigs were found to be in the range of 201–500 bp and  <dig>   contigs in the range of 501–2000 bp . similarly in m. serrata, around  <dig>   contigs were found in the size range of 201– <dig> and  <dig>   contigs were found in the range of 501–2000 bp  suggesting a high probability of finding full-length genes in the present dataset. orthologous hit ratio has been calculated for both the transcriptomes . orthologous hit ratio  <cit>  represents the ratio of length of putative coding region of a unigene divided by the length of the best blastx hit considering it as an ortholog.  <dig>  unigenes from morus laevigata and  <dig>  unigenes from morus laevigata have shown a hit with any sequence in nr database.  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes from morus laevigata and morus serrata, respectively, were found to have orthologous hit ratio of > <dig>  . similarly  <dig>  and  <dig>  in morus laevigata and morus serrata, respectively, with ortholog hit ratio > <dig> .fig.  <dig> length distribution of contigs of mulberry transcriptomes



analysis of mulberry transcriptome
in order to functionally annotate the transcriptomes of m. laevigata and m. serrata, the transcripts were subjected to blastx search against the ncbi nr database and gene ontology  terms were assigned using fastannotator . the largest number of sequences showing similarity with morus transcriptomes was with that of prunus persica, followed by vitis vinifera and theobroma cacao . essentially,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % sequences from m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively, showed a hit with any organism in the ncbi nr database . the blastx against ncbi nr was performed using fastannotator and perhaps due the use of an older version of ncbi nr, no hits with m. notabilis sequences were obtained, however, a small number of hits from m. indica were obtained . nonetheless, we downloaded the proteome of m. notabilis with  <dig>  sequences from morus genome database  and performed blastx analysis. a stringent cutoff of 1e- <dig> e-value was applied to identify the genuine hits. upon comparison with m. notabilis sequences, a significantly higher number of hits i.e.  <dig>   and  <dig>   were obtained in m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively .fig.  <dig> the number of hits obtained from different organisms using blastx search against nr database  number of hits obtained from blastx against m. notabilis proteome 



gene ontology assignment and analysis
the go ids of unique sequences were categorized into three standard categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function. nearly  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes from m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively, were assigned to go terms . around  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes of m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively, were assigned all three go terms . apart from assigning gene ontology ids after blast analysis with the ncbi nr database, fastannotator also identifies enzyme-encoding transcripts by performing blast search against enzyme database and domains based on blast against pfam domain database. thus, a significant number of transcripts from m. laevigata  and m. serrata  were assigned ids in all three types of annotations viz. go, domains and enzyme . likewise  <dig>  transcripts in m. laevigata  and  <dig>  transcripts in m. serrata  were assigned both go ids and domains . the categorization of mulberry unigenes into these three distinct modules can serve as a stepping stone in realizing the full genetic potential of mulberry and further aid in understanding plant gene function in general.fig.  <dig> 
a the number of standard go terms assigned to the transcripts. bp: biological process, mf: molecular function, cc: cellular component. b total go categories, domains and enzyme classification ids assigned in m. laevigata and m. serrata unigenes after blast2go analysis



since, the number of go categories assigned was too large to represent, the results for the top twenty-five categories are presented in fig.  <dig>  the best-represented groups of biological processes included oxidation-reduction processes, cellular component included nucleus and molecular function included atp binding and associated processes . interestingly, in the top twenty-five categories of biological processes, a high representation of categories involving responses to abiotic stress such as salt, cold and cadmium ion; hormonal response such as aba stimulus; defense responses and hypersensitive responses; signal transduction and plant microbe interactions was observed . amongst the stress related genes, highest number of transcripts was observed in defense response, followed by response to salt stress. the cold responsive genes were also amply represented in the present dataset. this is in broad agreement with the impending use of these two varieties in breeding programs for improving the currently used cultivated varieties as already stated. among the cellular component category, the highest representation was of nucleus followed by mitochondria and plasma membrane. furthermore, a high representation of putative regulatory categories such as dna binding, rna binding, nucleic acid binding, sequence specific dna binding, protein binding, chromatin binding and sequence specific dna binding were among the top twenty five molecular function categories.fig.  <dig> top twenty-five go categories represented in m. laevigata and m. serrata unigenes obtained after blast2go against ncbi non-redundant database



ssr identification in mulberry
ssrs are simple and cost effective markers that can play a key role in improvement of non-model plants such as mulberry. the importance of ssrs in mulberry breeding can be highlighted with the use of ssrs in the development of the first linkage map  <cit> . despite their potential advantages there have been a few reports on development of ssr markers in mulberry . recently a database of predicted ssrs from m. notabilis has been developed  <cit> . with the development of high throughput transcriptome based resources, reports of ssr prediction in large datasets have started emerging  <cit> . earlier we reported ssr identification in mulberry root ests  <cit>  and subsequently in the genic and the non-genic regions  <cit> .

in the present study, we identified ssrs from the expressed regions of m. laevigata and m. serrata. in m. laevigata transcriptome, a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified with at least one ssr in  <dig>   transcripts with a density of at least  <dig>  ssrs per kb. similarly, in m. serrata, around  <dig>  ssrs were identified in  <dig>   with an average of  <dig>  ssrs per kb. the maximum number of transcripts showed at least  <dig> ssr/transcript . most abundantly found ssr types were of di-, tri- and hexa-nucleotide  repeats . in our earlier study, a similar abundance of di-and tri-nucleotide repeats in mulberry transcriptome was observed  <cit> . the abundance of tri- and hexa- nucleotide repeats does not lead to frameshift that is possibly one of the reasons for its abundance in coding regions  <cit> . among the types of repeats, most variability could be seen in the penta-, hexa- and hepta-nucleotide repeats . the functional impact of predicted ssr harboring genes was assessed using go enrichment analysis. the top five significantly enriched categories have been represented in additional file 2: figure  <dig> fig.  <dig> distribution of total number of ssrs identified in mulberry. a distribution of number of ssrs identified per transcript, b. number of ssrs identified in different repeat units, c. number of types representing different repeat units



polymorphism identification
transcriptome data is extensively used for identification for markers, which being derived from the expressed region of the genome have broad applicability for breeding purposes. earlier we reported est based ssrs from root derived transcriptome of m. indica  <cit> . in the present study, a total of  <dig> , <dig> paired reads were obtained from m. notabilis out of which  <dig>  % reads were aligned with m. laevigata de novo assembled transcriptome using bowtie <dig> version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . almost similar alignment rate  was observed when m. notabilis was aligned to m. serrata transcriptome. similarly,  <dig> , <dig> paired reads from m. serrata were obtained, out of which  <dig>  % were aligned to m. laevigata de novo assembled transcriptome. the variant calling was done using freebayes version  <dig> .20-8-gfef284a  <cit>  from the three alignments. additional file 3: table  <dig> summarizes the variants identified initially before filtration.

the variants were subjected to high stringency filtration using vcftools version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . high quality variants with a quality score above  <dig>  minimum read depth of  <dig> and 100 % allele balance at heterozygous sites were filtered. we also filtered variants lying in close proximity with each other. finally,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  high quality snps were identified with a density of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps/kb  in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively. apart from snps, around  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  other variants were also identified in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively, including multiple nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions .fig.  <dig>

read depth of least three reads is a reliable quality check for the probabilistic model of snp prediction. in our dataset, however, the minimum read depth/snp was in the range of 10– <dig> reads/snp that represented the maximum number of snps identified in ml/ms , ml/mn  and ms/mn  indicating good quality and high confidence level . correspondingly, around  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % transcripts in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn respectively contained at least one snp. around  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts contained more than  <dig> snps in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively . a higher read depth supporting a large number of snps when m. notabilis transcriptome was used for alignment . high read depth per transcript indicates good quality and a higher confidence in predicted snps. an average of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps/transcript  were identified in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively. transitions  were found to represent  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of all snps in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively . similarly, the remainder was represented by transversions i.e.  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn respectively . nearly similar transition to transversion ratios of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were observed in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively. the rates of base changes have been represented in additional file 4: figure 3b. we also identified around  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  indels in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively . the length of insertions ranged from  <dig> to 15 bp while the length of deletions ranged from  <dig> to 17 bp with a density of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels/mb in ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively. maximum number of indels was of smaller size ranging from− <dig> to + <dig> 

distribution and effect of variants
snpeff version  <dig> j  <cit>  was employed to understand the overall effect of variants on the transcripts. around 22−26 % of total polymorphisms were found to be in the coding region. transdecoder generated gff file for each assembled unigene transcriptome was used as input for snpeff. since, it was derived from transcribed region, a major portion of the variants  could not be annotated . nonetheless, around 50 % of total polymorphisms lying in the coding regions of the three genotypes were analyzed. in m. laevigata/m. serrata, of the 25 % variants in the coding region an equal proportion of non-synonymous and synonymous changes of around 11 % were observed .fig.  <dig> analysis of the effect of variants on mulberry transcriptomes . ml/mn: m. laevigata/m. notabilis, ml/ms: m. laevigata/m. serrata, ms/mn: m. serrata/m. notabilis




in m. laevigata/m. notabilis, of the 25 % variants found in the coding region, around 13 % were found to be non-synonymous changes . similarly, in m. serrata/m. notabilis, a higher number of non-synonymous changes  were observed . more than  <dig>  non-synonymous changes were identified between m. laevigata or m. serrata/m. notabilis indicating a significant evolutionary distance between the two indian species with m. notabilis as expected. a significant number of changes were also observed in the 5’ and 3’ utr regions suggesting possible changes in these crucial regulatory regions.

gene ontology enrichment analysis of high impact variants
to assess the overrepresentation of go classes in the annotated variants, gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using cytoscape software version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with bingo plugin version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we used high impact variants including indels, frameshift, non-synonymous coding, stop lost and stop gained for enrichment. the molecular functional classes over represented by variants between ml/ms included protein and dna binding, which might possibly result in differences in protein-protein interactions and interactions with other biomolecules . other significantly enriched go terms included transcription regulator activity and its child term transcription factor activity. enrichment in this class of go terms might result in changes between promoter/enhancer or transcription factor binding/activity which might be indicative of overall variability showed by these species in terms of their physiological and biochemical responses. similarly, in ml/mn these categories showed overrepresentation of variants harboring transcripts suggesting major changes in these classes of genes between the genotypes studied. however, in ms/mn though the number of significantly enriched categories was much less, still a related category i.e. translation factor activity, nucleic acid binding showed slight enrichment which includes interaction with nucleic acids. other significantly enriched go terms included molecular transducer activity and signal transducer activity, which might lead to potential changes in the signal transduction mechanisms. detection of such genotypic changes can serve as a foundation for understanding of phenotypic difference among different genotypes and breeding.fig.  <dig> significantly enriched go terms in molecular function category. a
ml/mn: m. laevigata/m. notabilis,
b. ml/ms: m. laevigata/m. serrata, c. ms/mn: m. serrata/m. notabilis




interestingly, among the biological processes, an enrichment of snps was observed in the response to stimulus category and its children terms i.e. response to abiotic stimulus, biotic stimulus, stress, external and endogenous stimulus . enrichment in these categories indicates putative changes that might be responsible for their differential responses. enrichment in the secondary metabolic processes and related categories such as generation of precursor metabolites and energy, carbohydrate metabolic process and lipid metabolic process was also observed. these changes might be critical as mulberry is a rich source of secondary metabolites with vast medicinal potential  <cit> . interestingly, enrichment in developmental process and its children terms was also observed. given the morphological variation between the two species  <cit> , these categories can serve as a good resource to isolate genes leading to those changes. intriguingly, upon comparison of m. serrata and m. notabilis, a higher number of metabolic processes related categories were significantly enriched with variants. this might possibly reflect that these categories may give a substantial contribution to the differences in the two species. in general, significant enrichment was observed between indian wild species when compared with m. notabilis suggesting that the two varieties are closer to each other when compared with m. notabilis. the response to biotic stimulus category also showed enrichment, as genes belonging to this category are under rapid evolution to match with the avirulence genes of the pathogens  <cit> . this information can further be used for identifying/understanding stress responsive mechanisms and changes thereof in different varieties.

genotype specific differential expression pattern of genes under various stress conditions
the expression of several genes identified in both the transcriptomes generated in the present study  was analyzed using quantitative real time pcr under altered environmental stimuli . the expression of these genes was compared with those from m. indica cv. k <dig> . the involvement of nac transcription factors in mediating stress responses is well documented . two nac family genes  analyzed in the present study showed significantly high up-regulation under simulated dehydration stress  and salt stress  conditions. the gene showing similarity to nac domain containing protein  <dig> in particular showed a very significant up-regulation in dehydration stress in both the tolerant wild species as compared with the susceptible cultivar i.e. m. indica cv. k <dig>  differential expression of rice map kinase cascade genes has been reported in response to abiotic stresses  <cit>  likewise, the expression of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase was also found to be up-regulated under dehydration, salt and cold stresses in different mulberry genotypes with significantly higher up-regulation in the wild species. we also analyzed the expression of plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1; <dig>  which showed enhanced expression under dehydration  and salt stress  conditions. the magnitude of induction was the highest in m. serrata under dehydration  stress treatment. interestingly, in arabidopsis thaliana, pip genes are regulated by drought and aba  <cit> . likewise drought-induced expression of pip genes has been found to be associated with maintenance of leaf water content  <cit> . specifically high expression of dehydration related genes such as hva22-like, uncharacterized protein and dessication responsive protein in dehydration  and salt stress  conditions in wild varieties of mulberry was detected. overexpression of barley hva <dig> gene in mulberry has been implicated in imparting tolerance to salt, drought and cold stresses  <cit> . the role of cbl-cipk network is central to modulation of calcium signatures that are translated to different cellular responses  <cit> . cbl interacting protein kinase  <dig>  has been shown to play a crucial role in plant responses to nitrate  <cit> . maximum induction of expression of cbl interacting protein kinase  <dig> was observed in aerial drying , salt stress  and cold stress  conditions in m. laevigata. temperature responsiveness of heat shock proteins  <cit>  and heat shock factors  <cit>  has also been reported. thus, we analyzed the expression profile of heat shock protein 90– <dig> and heat shock factor  <dig> in different mulberry species. both these genes showed significant up-regulation under cold stress treatment in the wild species with a very strong expression in m. serrata.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of genes under different environmental cues in morus sp. con: mock treated with ro water for five hours, ad: aerial drying for five hours, ss: salt stress by treatment with 250 mm nacl for five hours, cs: cold stress for five hours. data represents average of two biological replicates  ± standard error



modulation of expression and synthesis of a plethora of genes involved in stress signaling are among the most essential adaptive responses of plants to alteration in environmental cues. the expression of several stress related genes in the wild varieties was found to be considerably elevated in both the wild varieties analyzed in the present study. enhancement in the expression of these genes under drought, salt and cold stresses in the two wild species  as compared with the existing cultivar  indicates the potential of these two species in mulberry improvement.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we report generation and functional annotation of a rich transcriptome-based resource for two wild species of mulberry, which have been previously shown to possess important desirable traits such as bigger leaf size, higher leaf moisture retention, and also greater adaptability to adverse conditions. we sequenced and assembled the transcriptome of two morus species i.e. m. laevigata and m. serrata, and identified around  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes, respectively. the number of unigenes identified is slightly higher than m. atropurpurea  <cit>  and m. multicaulis  <cit>  possibly due to difference in stages and species selection. the de-novo assembled transcriptome was enriched in genes related to abiotic stresses such as salt stress, cold stress and defense responses including hypersensitive responses, signal transduction and plant microbe interactions. these findings corroborate the utility of these two species in mulberry breeding program where genes of desired traits can be introgressed.

in the present study, we also identified ssr and snp markers. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ssrs were identified in m. laevigata and m. serrata, respectively. snp markers from the three transcriptomes i.e. m. laevigata, m. serrata and m. notabilis were also identified. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  high quality snps were also identified between ml/ms, ml/mn and ms/mn, respectively. snp density of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps/kb  was observed which is in range between chickpea  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . thus, upon comparison amongst m. laevigata, m. serrata and m. notabilis transcriptomes, a rich resource for markers was developed for direct application in mulberry improvement programs. furthermore, we have identified high impact variant containing transcripts and deduced their ontologies, which could serve as a resource for gene selection for further validation of their role in mediating different responses in these two species. these high impact variants are distributed across important go terms including transcription, translation, response to stress, anatomical features, and reproductive structure development. this could be suggestive of the differential regulation of these genes amongst these species manifested in the form of their respective phenotypes.
