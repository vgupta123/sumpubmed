BACKGROUND
rice is a staple food for nearly half of the world’s population and a model species for monocot developmental studies  <cit> . stamen is the male reproductive organ that consists of anthers and filaments. anthers produced pollens, the male gametes, which are one of the major routes of gene flow in nature through cross-pollination  <cit> . in addition, anther development and pollen fertility are directly associated with rice yield in the agricultural production. the key role of male sterility in rice heterosis spurred people to investigate the regulatory mechanism of pollen development  <cit> . therefore, rice anther and pollen development is an active area of research plant reproduction and crop breeding. anther development in rice was divided into  <dig> stages, which was consistent with that of arabidopsis  <cit> . to summarize, anther development initiates with stamen primordium formation, followed by the primordium differentiation to form the anther wall and pollen mother cells. subsequently, the meiocytes undergo meiotic divisions and the anther wall degenerates. afterward, the released microspores undergo two rounds of mitosis to develop into tri-cellular pollen and the pollen grains further accumulate starch and lipidic materials. last, the pollen grains are released from anthers during the anther dehiscence.

genome-wide expression analysis during rice anther development could help establish regulatory networks, and further analysis that investigates co-expressed gene groups may help identify dna cis-elements and their interacting protein factors. in recent years, several transcriptome analyses of rice male reproductive organs were reported  <cit> . these transcriptomic studies using high density microarrays revealed the complexity of gene expression during anther development. the studies based on agilent 44 k microarray or affymetrix rice genome array showed that most rice genes were expressed in developing anthers and the expression of thousands of genes were anther-specific  <cit> . furthermore, some reports utilized laser-microdissection to isolate microspores and the tapetum layer of developing anthers  <cit> . more recently, transcriptome profilings revealed genes contributing to specific aspects to meiosis and male gametophyte development  <cit> . nevertheless, transcriptomic analyses of genes predominantly expressed in mature anthers instead of developing anthers were not performed.

during anther and pollen maturation, pollen metabolism, anther dehiscence, and pollen germination after pollination were key events for male fertility. previous studies described several genes that function in anther dehiscence and pollen tube growth. the siz <dig> gene in rice encoded a sumo e <dig> ligase and was expressed in all tissues. the spikelet sterility in siz <dig> mutant and siz1-rnai lines was caused by defective anther dehiscence but not defective pollen  <cit> . spikelet sterility in rice pss <dig> mutants was due to a failure in anther dehiscence at the time of spikelet opening or even after its closing  <cit> . however, little is known about the genetic control of anther dehiscence in rice and how it is coordinated with other developmental processes in the anther and florets.

several studies have revealed genes that played roles in the pollen tube growth such as osap <dig>  vgd <dig>  pi cdpk and mgp <dig>  <cit> . the osap <dig> encoded a transmembrane protein and was expressed in various organs, and the anthers of osap <dig> mutant developed normally until mature stage, showing defect in pollen tube elongation. vgd <dig> was expressed specifically in pollen grains and pollen tube in arabidopsis and encoded a pectin methylesterase -homologous protein that acted in cell wall modification. vgd <dig> pollen tubes were unstable and burst more frequently than those of wild type. in addition, two pollen-expressed calmodulin-like domain protein kinases pi cdpk <dig> and pi cdpk <dig> in petunia, and male gametophyte defective  <dig>  in arabidopsis were involved in pollen germination and pollen tube growth. these results showed that the genes expressed in pollen were necessary for pollen grain germinate or pollen tube elongation. although gene knockdown or knockout approaches can be used to identify gene functions, they do not illustrate the systems level molecular networks of mature anther development. the molecular mechanism concerning this specific late stage anther development was still poorly understood compared with early- or mid-term stages of the anther development.

in this study, we aimed to provide molecular insights into genes preferentially expressed in rice mature anthers by establishing their regulatory networks based on transcriptome profiling and gene co-expression analysis. genes highly expressed in the mature stamen at higher than  <dig> fold levels compared with other organs in minghui <dig>  or zhenshan <dig>  rice were defined as mature anther-preferentially expressed genes   <cit> . expression patterns during anther development and co-expression analyses were performed to discover the potential functions of the ossta genes. we have validated the microarrays data by quantitative real-time pcr. in addition, some genes were chosen to confirm the spatial and temporal expression by in situ hybridization. finally, we have constructed ossta-rnai transgenic plants for gene functional characterization.

RESULTS
identification and nomenclature of ossta genes
the definition of mature anther in this experiment was that with tri-nucleus and materials accumulation of pollens, followed with the anther connective burst. the data for rice mature anther-preferentially expressed genes was cited from the results of tissue-specific expressed genes in previous study, which contain  <dig> tissues during the rice development  <cit> . based on the data, we have identified  <dig> probe sets preferentially expressed in the mature anther and  <dig> folds higher than other tissues. during them,  <dig> probe sets were removed for absence of the gene ids. the remaining  <dig> probe sets corresponding to  <dig> genes were considered as mature anther-preferentially expressed genes and were named from ossta <dig> to ossta <dig> according to their positions on pseudomolecules . the microarrays concerning the rice entire life cycle in wang et al.  <dig>  <cit>  were used for hierarchical clustering analysis. the gse <dig> affymetrix microarray from ncbi showed that all of the  <dig> genes had high transcript accumulations in mature anther. a hierarchical cluster displaying the log <dig> of average signal values for the  <dig> ossta genes was generated in mh <dig> . the cluster suggested that all genes showed the highest expression signals in mature anther. another microarray gse <dig> was used to confirm the expression patterns of the  <dig> ossta genes, which contained  <dig> anther developmental stages from hypodermal archesporial cells formation to tri-cellular pollen stage in nipponbare . the hierarchical clustering analysis based on this array data was carried out, using the same probe sets in mh <dig> . the heat map showed that 85%  of the ossta genes had the highest expression levels in the anther with tri-cellular pollen. besides, most of them had expression signals in bi-cellular pollens. therefore, we defined the  <dig> ossta genes as rice mature anther-preferentially expressed genes and performed further analysis on these ossta genes. detailed information on the ossta genes such as accession numbers, protein properties, and isoelectric points is listed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  at the times we take the ossta genes sequence information in additional file 3: files 1- <dig> figure  <dig>

validation of the microarrays data by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr
sixteen ossta genes were randomly chosen for further validation by real-time pcr . various rice tissues from zhonghua <dig>  were used, includes flowering stage roots, stems and flag leaves, the panicles from archesporial cells formation to bi-cellular pollen stage , paleas , lemmas and mature anthers in tri-cellular mature pollen stage  <cit> . in this experiment, the ubiquitin was used for internal control gene. the results of real-time pcr showed that the expression patterns of these genes were in general agreement with the data of the microarrays . remarkably, the expression level was higher in the mature anther than those in the other tissues . ossta <dig> , ossta <dig> , ossta <dig>  and ossta <dig>  showed  <dig> to  <dig> fold, ossta <dig> , ossta <dig> , ossta <dig> , ossta <dig> , ossta <dig> , ossta <dig> , ossta <dig> , ossta <dig>  and ossta <dig>  showed  <dig> to  <dig> fold, and ossta <dig> showed more than  <dig> fold than other tissues. the results confirmed that these genes were mature anther-preferentially expressed genes. furthermore, ossta <dig>  and ossta <dig>  showed more than one thousand fold than other tissues, which indicated these two genes specifically expressed in the mature anther and had no signal in other tissues.figure  <dig>

the spatial and temporal activities of ossta genes in rice anther
in situ hybridization was performed to examine the temporal and spatial expression patterns of ossta genes in rice anther. five genes from real-time pcr test, including ossta <dig>  ossta <dig>  ossta <dig>  ossta <dig>  and ossta <dig>  were selected for mrna in situ hybridization. the transverse sections of roots, stems and flag leaves in flowering stage, anther from pollen mother cell stage to mature pollen stage were used for analysis . no signal was detected in the anthers of microspore stage using a dig oxigenin -labeled ossta genes sense probe as a control.figure  <dig>

the ossta genes showed similar spatial and temporal expression patterns, all of which had no detection signal in vegetative organs and early stage anthers such as pollen mother cell and meiosis stage using the dig-labeled ossta genes anti-sense probe for research . the genes expression signal in anther could be detected from microspore stage  to tri-cellular mature pollen stage, and the anther wall had the transcript accumulation. more accurately, ossta <dig> expressed in the pollens of mature anther and the anther wall from bi-cellular pollen to mature anther stage. the expression signal of ossta <dig>  ossta <dig> and ossta <dig> appeared on the anther wall from microspore stage to mature anther stage, in addition, ossta <dig> had transcript accumulation in the mature pollens. besides, the ossta <dig> was only expressed in anther wall from bi-cellular pollen stage to mature anther stage. interestingly, all of the ossta genes had no expression signal in the stomium of anther. the similar expression patterns implied that the detective ossta genes might perform functions during the mature processes of the anther.

gene ontology  analyses and functional classification
agrigo is a useful tool to analyze the go annotations concentrating in molecular function, biological process and cellular component  <cit> . we thus analyzed the go annotations of  <dig> ossta genes by the agrigo tools, which indicated functionality of  <dig> genes . these  <dig> genes were classified into  <dig> categories: cellular process, cellular component organization, regulation of biological process, biological regulation, metabolic process, establishment of localization and localization in biological process; macromolecular complex, cell part, cell and organelle in cellular component; transcription regulator activity, transporter activity, catalytic activity and binding activity in molecular function . during these go annotations, the ossta genes enriched in categories of cellular process , metabolic process , catalytic activity  and binding activity . more exactly, the  <dig> genes belong to metabolic process were mainly involved in cellular metabolic process, macromolecule metabolic process and primary metabolic process. the  <dig> genes encoding proteins with catalytic activity contained  <dig> kinases,  <dig> transferases and  <dig> hydrolases. further analysis showed that most of the enzymes participated in the metabolic process, in the form of compounds. these results suggested that ossta genes might play crucial roles in cellular development and metabolic processes in rice mature anthers.figure  <dig>

identifying mature anther highly expressed genes and go analyses
to search for genome-wide molecular mechanisms in rice mature anthers, we analyzed all the mature anther highly expressed genes. in arabidopsis, rice and other organisms, co-expression analysis was used for identifying functional transcription regulators  <cit> . the distribution of the pearson’s correlation coefficients  suggested that the pcc higher than  <dig>  was significant for two correlated genes  <cit> . the  <dig> pccs of each pair for the ossta genes were calculated, during them,  <dig> pccs were higher than  <dig> , which revealed that most ossta genes had similar expression pattern, therefore, we detected the co-expression genes of ossta genes to find the mature anther highly expressed genes . each of the osstas was selected to identify the co-expressed genes using expression data from crep database , and the pccs greater than  <dig>  were chosen for next step analysis by the removal of duplicated genes. based on this,  <dig> genes were found to be highly-correlated with the expression of ossta genes group .

the co-expression gene annotations were identified in the agrigo database . afterwards, the results involved in biological process, cellular component and molecular function were graphical . the enriched go annotations particularly concentrated on metabolic process, localization process, cellular process, signal transduction, biological regulation and cell wall organization or biogenesis. they encoded proteins forming macromolecular complex in cell or extracellular. the molecular functions of these genes were transporter activity, enzyme regulator activity, catalytic activity and binding. these annotations were mainly consistent with ossta genes, except for signal transduction and enzyme regulator activity, which revealed that the genes highly expressed in mature anther might function together with ossta genes. among these genes,  <dig> genes were annotated with pectinesterase activity , whereas only  <dig> genes had this activity in the rice genome. the graphical results of gene annotations were showed in figure  <dig>  the graphs revealed that these genes encoded enzymes that function as modifiers of the cell wall. also,  <dig> of these genes encoded proteins showing enzyme inhibitor activity and participated in enzyme regulator process. these results suggested that pectinesterase could be necessary for anther development in mature pollen. moreover,  <dig> genes that code for proteins with the calcium ion binding  activities were identified, which were annotated with catalytic activity and participated in metabolic processes .figure  <dig>

characterization of cis-elements in ossta gene promoters
in rice, the levels of auxin, gibberellins, ethylene and jasmonic acid in mature anthers were higher than in other tissues  <cit> . to investigate whether the ossta genes participated in phytohormones regulatory networks, cis-elements for phytohormone responsiveness at the promoter regions of ossta were identified using the place database . based on promoter analysis,  <dig> cis-elements for abscisic acid responsiveness,  <dig> cis-elements for auxin responsiveness,  <dig> cis-elements for gibberellin response,  <dig> cis-elements for ethylene response, and  <dig> cis-elements for jasmonic acid response were used for phytohormone responsiveness research. as a result,  <dig> genes had the cis-elements that respond to phytohormones, among which  <dig> genes had more than one phytohormone response cis-elements. it was interesting that  <dig> genes had abscisic acid response elements in their promoters,  <dig> gene promoters had auxin response cis-elements,  <dig> genes were predicted to respond to gibberellin, and  <dig> gene promoters had jasmonic acid responsive elements. however, no gene has cis-elements for ethylene and cytokinin . therefore, the results revealed that most of the ossta genes may be regulated by the phytohormone abscisic acid, auxin, gibberellins and jasmonic acid in mature anthers. additionally, individual ossta gene promoter analysis showed that ossta <dig> and ossta <dig> had the abscisic acid, auxin, and jasmonic acid responsive elements; ossta <dig> and ossta <dig> might respond to gibberellins and jasmonic acid; ossta <dig> possessed auxin, gibberellins and jasmonic acid responsive elements.

reduced expression of ossta results in male sterility and defect of pollen germination in ossta rnai transgenic plants
to study the functions of ossta genes in rice anthers, we employed methods of dsrna-induced rna interference according to published procedures  <cit> . three genes  were selected for rnai, and the gene-specific coding sequence was chose for gene-specific interference.

after transforming dsrna into rice protoplasts, more than  <dig> regenerated transgenic plants per ossta gene were obtained. among the t0ossta-rnai transgenic plants, the positive transgenic plants showed  <dig> % to  <dig> % decreased expression level of ossta compared with the wt . three positive transgenic t <dig> lines of ossta genes  with reduced expression of ossta  were selected for further analysis. the expression levels of ossta genes in these rnai t <dig> plants were stably repressed . the defects of pollen and anther in ossta rnai t <dig> plants were observed . statistical analyses of pollen fertility and germination data in ossta rnai and wild-type  zh <dig> plants were shown in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

in ossta <dig> rnai rice plants, the anther and pollen developed normally from hypodermal archesporial cells to early bi-cellular pollen, but iodine staining of mature pollen showed that more than half were sterile . in addition, cross sections of mature anthers of ossta <dig> rnai plants revealed that sterile pollend were shrunken and undyed compared to fertile pollens . in situ hybridization showed that ossta <dig> was expressed in tri-cellular pollen and anther walls after microspores underwent first mitosis. protein conserved domain analysis showed that ossta <dig> contained rrc <dig>  fyve, and brx domains. the previous study revealed that fab1a and fab1b encoded proteins with the fyve domain and played key roles metabolic processes from bi-cellular to tri-cellular pollen transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . according to these results, we speculated that ossta <dig> might be a regulator of pollen fertility by influencing the unknown metabolic materials in rice.

compared with wt anthers, anthers from ossta <dig> rnai plants were relatively white, their pollens were only 5-8% fertile . most of the pollens were no dye based on iodine stained mature pollen, and also these pollen grains failed to germinate . histological section also showed that the pollens of ossta <dig> rnai plants were empty and shrunken inside the mature anther . it was surprising that ossta <dig> was only expressed in the anther wall instead of pollen from microspore stage to mature anther stage by in situ hybridization detection. therefore, we speculated that down-regulating expression of ossta <dig> in anther wall might interrupt cross-talks between pollen and anther wall, which could be critical for pollen fertility. conserved domain analysis showed that ossta <dig> possessed dyw_deaminase, four repeats of ppr, and two dagk  domains. using the rnai method, the rice dagk family was previously found to function in regulating abiotic and biotic stresses through different signaling pathways  <cit> . thus, it was possible that ossta <dig> participated in stress response in the anther wall for regulating pollen fertility.

different from ossta <dig> and ossta <dig>  the anther and pollen of ossta <dig> rnai plants appeared to show a wt phenotype, and the pollen fertility of rnai plants was almost identical to wt based on statistical analysis of iodine stained mature pollen . however, most pollen grains of transgenic plants failed to germinate in vitro under the same culture condition . ossta <dig> was preferentially expressed in mature anthers and the in situ hybridization showed that ossta <dig> was expressed in tri-cellular pollen and anther walls. protein conserved domain analysis showed that ossta <dig> possessed only an apt <dig> domain. several prior reports concerning apt <dig> and its homologs  revealed that these proteins were involved in membrane trafficking and were required for the high secretory demands of tip growth in pollen tubes or roots  <cit> . it is thus reasonable to suggest that ossta <dig> may function in regulating pollen germination and pollen tube growth by mediating material transportation or signal transferring. in previous studies, ca2+ and pectinesterase were shown to be involved in pollen grain germination and pollen tube elongation. thus  <dig> pectinesterase genes and  <dig> calcium ion binding genes were selected from the co-expression network to detect their expression levels in ossta <dig> rnai plants . the expression levels of most pectinesterase genes were changed in rnai plants compared with the wt. among them, os11g <dig> showed increased expression, whereas the other  <dig> genes showed decreased expression . while the  <dig> tested genes with calcium ion binding activity showed decreased expression, the other  <dig> genes did not change their expression levels. it was inferred that ossta <dig> controlled pollen germination and pollen tube growth by regulating the expression of ca2+ and pectinesterase relative genes in rice.figure  <dig>

taken together, based on the ossta gene expression and observed phenotypes of ossta rnai lines, we concluded that ossta genes likely functions to ensure pollen grain germination or pollen tube growth.

discussion
ossta genes could be essential for rice male fertility by mediating pollen metabolism
at mature anther stage, the pollen grain maturation was accompanied with the accumulation of starch, lipid and secondary metabolites. these metabolic activities are important for male gametophyte fertility. here, the go annotations analysis of  <dig> ossta genes revealed that the largest group consisting of  <dig> genes had “enzymatic activity”, and  <dig> genes took part in “metabolic process”. it was notable that  <dig> ossta genes belonged to the “kinase-like genes”. in the past decades, plant kinases were found to be vital for pollen fertility. vps <dig> encoded a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in arabidopsis, and vps <dig> mutants showed male gametophyte abnormality with large vacuoles and no nuclear in pollen grains in the mature pollen stage, indicating vps <dig> was essential for pollen maturation  <cit> . moreover, the metabolic activities of mature pollen influenced pollen grain germination. for example, alpha-glucan water dikinase  was a key enzyme in tomato that controlled the phosphate content of starch and the starch degradation. in gwd mutants, the pollens showed excess starch accumulation and soluble sugars reducing phenotypes, leading to a reduction in pollen germination, which indicated the key role of starch metabolism for pollen germination  <cit> .

in this study, the gene knockdown experiment was performed to determine the function of ossta genes in male fertility. we have found that pollen viability was reduced in ossta <dig> and ossta <dig> rnai plants and their pollens showed varying degrees of debility. it was reported that osnek <dig>  was preferentially expressed in mature anthers and functioned in male fertility of rice  <cit> . the knockout mutant of osnek <dig> did not show obvious pollen-defective phenotype. however, the over-expression of osnek <dig> caused a peculiar pollen structure; the outer cell wall of pollen grains fused together. meanwhile, ospdc <dig>  was a mature pollen-specific gene and encoded a pyruvate decarboxylase that may be required in pollen energy metabolism. over-expression of ospdc <dig> caused increased enzyme activity in rice  <cit> . here, the conserved domains and go annotations analysis showed that ossta <dig>  and ossta <dig>  had the kinase activity, and ossta <dig>  ospdc <dig> and osnek <dig> were included in metabolic process genes group. therefore, among the ossta genes, the kinases and metabolism related genes might play key roles in pollen fertility. it will be essential to further dissect their functions and learn their regulatory relations in the network of anther maturation in rice.

ossta genes might regulate pollen germination and pollen tube growth by interaction with ca2+ or pectinesterase
in this study, the identification of ossta co-expressed genes showed that  <dig> genes with “pectinesterase activity” and  <dig> genes with “calcium ion binding activity” were highly expressed in the mature anther. these genes annotated with the pectinesterase activity were regarded as functional factors during pollen tube growth in previous reports  <cit> . the pectin esterification played an important role in determining the mechanical properties of the pollen tube cell wall during tube elongation  <cit> . the degree of pectin esterification in different pollen tube location was controlled by competitive effect of pectin methylesterase  and pectin methylesterase inhibitor   <cit> . it was reported that the interactions between pmes and pmeis regulated the properties and distributions of pectin  <cit> . the activity of pmes was inhibited in the presence of pmeis at the apical region of pollen tube, while the activity of pmes in the sub-apical region of pollen tube depended on both exocytosis and endocytosis  <cit> . pectinesterase genes were highly expressed in mature anther, whereas they changed expression patterns in ossta <dig> rnai plants. detailed analysis found that  <dig> down-regulated genes were defined as pme based on other reports, while the up-regulated gene was pmei  <cit> . on the basis of the results, we hypothesized that the ossta <dig> might be located in the pectinesterase regulatory network for pollen tube growth, and coordinate the expression of pmes and pmeis in different pollen tube growth stage.

in our study, the genes encoding calcium ion binding activity proteins were highly expressed in mature anther, and recently, the mechanisms and functions of calcium in pollen tube growth have been extensively reviewed  <cit> . the tip-focused calcium gradient, calcium oscillation, ca2+ sensing and flowing are essential for pollen grains germination and tube growth  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a calcium-dependent protein kinase cpk <dig> interacts with calcium channel cngc <dig> and activates it to regulate the pollen tube growth  <cit> . the proteins phosphatase  <dig> and 2a are involved in the regulation of ca2+ uptake across the plasma membrane in exocytotic activities and in the biosynthesis of cell wall components that control pollen tube development in picea wilsonii  <cit> . the cbl <dig> and cbl <dig> encode calcineurin b-like  proteins, which act as ca2+sensor to regulate pollen germination and tube growth in arabidopsis  <cit> . in ossta <dig> rnai plants, most of the “calcium ion binding activity” genes showed down-regulated expression, prompting us to suppose that ossta <dig> may be related to ca2+ regulating pathway in pollen tube growth. it is useful to further clarify how ossta <dig> regulates pmes and calcium ion related gene expression and elucidates the mechanism of pollen tube elongation.

the gene expression patterns in co-expression network implied that the ossta genes might be involved in ca2+ or pectinesterase regulating pathway during the pollen germination or pollen tube growth. it would provide the clues to find new regulatory genes and explain the molecular mechanisms of pollen germination and pollen tube growth.

ossta genes might function in anther dehiscence in response to phytohormones
it is well known that the anther dehiscence is the final and necessary step for anther development, resulting in the release of pollen grains to pollination, fertilization, and seed set. recently, studies on a certain number of dehiscent mutants have shown that phytohormones contributed to the control of anther dehiscence. in the tir <dig> afb <dig> afb <dig> afb <dig> quadruple auxin receptor mutants of arabidopsis, anther dehiscent was defective as the endothecial lignification occurred prematurely before tapetum degeneration  <cit> . the dad <dig> gene in arabidopsis encodes a lipase-like protein that catalyzes the production of free la from cellular lipids as the first step in jasmonic acid biosynthesis. the stomium of anther in dad <dig> mutant fails to open and the elongation of the filament is delayed, while the defects are rescued by the exogenous application of jasmonic acid or linolenic acid  <cit> . hvgamyb is a transcription factor that first identified in barley aleurone cells. it is upregulated by gibberellin, and the anthers of transgenic plants overexpressing hvgamyb are male sterile due to a failure in dehiscence with the stomium remaining intact  <cit> . the previous reports indicated that genes responding to auxin, gibberellins and jasmonic acid were involved in anther dehiscence.

here, the identification of cis-elements in ossta promoters showed that a majority of ossta genes could respond to phytohormones. coincidently, the detailed analysis indicated that the promoters of the largest group consisting of  <dig> genes had jasmonic acid responsive elements, meanwhile,  <dig> genes had the auxin response factor,  <dig> genes could respond to gibberellin. thus, it appears that the ossta genes could regulate anther dehiscence by involving phytohormone regulatory network during anther dehiscence.

during anther dehiscence process, anther walls are indispensable for successful pollen grain release. recently, a mathematical model describing the biomechanics of anther opening incorporates the bilayer structure of the mature anther wall, which comprises the epidermis and the endothecium. the model describes and demonstrates how epidermal dehydration in association with the thickened endothecium to drive anther opening and pollen release  <cit> . also, there have been some reports of dehiscence mutants resulting from defects of secondary wall thickening and epidermis change  <cit> . in the arabidopsis myb <dig> mutant, the endothecium fails to expand and secondary thickening, which is seen in the wt anther endothecium, fails to occur. overexpression of myb <dig> results in ectopic secondary thickening in the epidermis  <cit> . in our study, the in situ hybridization showed that  <dig> tested ossta genes were expressed in the anther wall after the meiosis or first mitosis, which is the time of secondary thickening in the endothecium  <cit> . meanwhile, these ossta genes had no expression signal in the stomium. this tissue was derived from the differentiation of epidermal cells, which did not undergo secondary thickening. moreover, promoter analysis of these  <dig> ossta genes showed that they had auxin, gibberellins and jasmonic acid responsive elements. therefore, we hypothesized that some ossta genes might be involved in anther wall development and anther dehiscence through their roles in phytohormone regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, microarray expression profiling was used to investigate the mature anther preferentially expressed genes in rice. using go enrichment analysis and cis-elements identification in ossta gene promoters we showed that the ossta genes may involve in the anther maturation through different processes, such as pollen germination regulation and pollen tube growth by interaction with ca2+ or pectinesterase, or participated in anther dehiscence through response for phytohormones. the gene knockdown experiment showed the male sterility and defect of pollen germination in ossta rnai transgenic plants when the gene expression level reduced. all of the researches will provide the basis for understanding the mechanism of ossta genes in rice anther growth. the findings in our work would be useful in selecting candidate genes for functional research of ossta members during the anther maturation in rice.
