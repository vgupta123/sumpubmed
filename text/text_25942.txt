BACKGROUND
the peptide bond has a partial double bond character which results in the plane arrangement of the six backbone atoms cα, c', o, n, h, cα. the angles Ψ, Φ and Ω readily describe the arrangement of the six atoms in three-dimensional space: Ψ defines the angle of the n – cα bond and Φ is given by the cα-c' bond of the same residue whereas the Ω angle is defined between the c' and n atoms of adjacent residues. for Ω only two conformations are energetically and sterically preferred. the trans conformation is defined by an Ω angle of 180° while the cis conformation ideally displays an Ω angle of 0°. the cis conformation occurs rarely in polypeptides because of the higher intrinsic energy compared to the trans conformation  <cit> . in contrast to other amino acids proline has a higher propensity for the cis conformation. this can be explained by the smaller energy difference between the cis and trans isomer which is  <dig> kcal/mol higher for the cis as compared to the trans imide bond. the functional relevance of the proline cis/trans equilibrium is supported by the existence of special enzymes called peptidyl-prolyl isomerases which catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of xaa-pro bond  <cit> . the action of these enzymes is thought to be important for the proper functioning of biological processes such as protein folding  <cit>  and splicing  <cit> . in addition, cis prolines act possibly as molecular switches  <cit>  and are frequently present in turn regions of water-soluble proteins  <cit> .

nuclear magnetic resonance  experiments have shown that the cis/trans ratio depends on the amino acid sequence adjacent to the proline. more specifically, a correlation has been found between the isomerization rate and the bulkiness of the side chain of the residue preceding proline. the isomerization rate becomes smaller as the bulkiness of the side chain increases. for example, aromatic residues cause an approximately tenfold reduction in isomerization rate in comparison to alanine  <cit> . further nmr studies  <cit>  demonstrated that the cis/trans ratio is influenced by the nature of the succeeding amino acid. positively charged side chains seem to destabilize cis relative to trans whereas aspartate, asparagine and glycine stabilize the cis form.

cis and trans isomers show different tendencies to be present in certain secondary structure elements: while the trans conformations can be found in all classes of secondary structure   <cit> , the cis isomer is usually confined to bend and turn regions within proteins. however, a systematic analysis of these findings has been elusive.

the goal of our study is to derive statistically relevant propensities for predicting the relative occurrence of cis and trans proline conformations in proteins with respect to their sequential and structural properties.

for the analysis of the data set, different statistical methods such as calculation of the chou-fasman parameters  <cit>  and occurrence matrices were used.

RESULTS
chou-fasman parameters
figure  shows the comparison of the relative natural occurrence of the secondary structure types for cis and trans conformations of the xaa-pro peptide bond based on the pdb analyses . interestingly, cis prolines mostly occur in bend structures and almost never in helix or strand whereas trans prolines are mostly found in coil and to a smaller degree in turn, bend, helix or strand structures.

this observation is confirmed by analysis of the data with the modified chou-fasman parameters . the  values obtained from this analysis ) show that the parameter values are close to one for the trans proline, indicating no significant preference for any given secondary structure type. in contrast, the  value is high for cis prolines within the bend structure type  while it is very small for helix  or strand  elements.

in addition, the chou-fasman parameters of the secondary structures of the two amino acids adjacent to proline  are calculated and illustrated in table . similar to the results for the central proline position ), the trans conformation of the proline is almost equally distributed amongst the different secondary structure types for these two positions . for cis prolines, the chou-fasman parameter at positions  and  show a strong bias against helical secondary structure, albeit not as strong as for the proline itself . the low propensity for the strand structure seen for the central cis proline is not observed for the preceding residue and is above  <dig> for the residue following proline. the preference for the bend structure is attenuated for the adjacent residues  as compared to the central cis proline . interestingly, the propensity for the residue preceding cis proline to be part of a turn structure is higher than to be part of a bend structure . for the cis proline itself, the order is reverse.

occurrence matrix
a matrix of residue occurrence of the five-piece fragments ) reveals the different preferences of residues adjacent to proline. on the left side all residue combinations with a trans proline in the mid-position are listed and on the right side all combinations with a cis proline in this position are reported. rows indicate the amino acid types and columns contain the absolute and relative occurrences of the amino acids in the five-pieces fragments with proline in the central position.

table  illustrates the significant changes of the natural occurrence of the amino acids at different positions. the calculated natural occurrences  correspond to the results by  <cit> .

the observed relative occurrences were normalized in respect to the natural occurrence at each position for each amino acid type ). the normalized occurrences for cis and trans  show the preference for certain amino acid sequence patterns. amino acids with a relative occurrence greater one are shown in bold face. we considered a relative occurrence difference as almost equal  if Δh was smaller than  <dig> . Δh values larger than  <dig>  were of particular significance . the following observations can be made: for the normalized occurrences  of the trans conformations at the position i- <dig> the amino acids p≈g>f>y≈w>t = n≈l are preferred in comparison to the cis conformation where c>>q>p>s≈m>k≈g>v are favored in position i- <dig>  for position i- <dig> the amino acids c>n>i = h>t = d≈l≈k≈q≈r are predominant for the trans conformation while the order w>y>>g>f>c>n>p≈q≈a was found for the cis conformation. for the succeeding residue of pro  the preferences e>q = a≈d≈v = g≈r are observed for the trans conformation and the order y≈ f>a>w = c>h>g≈s≈p = l≈q resulted for the cis conformation. the most favorable amino acids are p≈w = g≈s≈m≈a≈f≈l for the trans conformation  and p>c>>t>n>g≈r = k≈v for the cis conformation at position i+ <dig> 

by analyzing the individual positions, it appears that certain amino acids occur in the cis and in the trans sets with high propensity . besides those amino acids a number of amino acids occur more exclusively at distinct positions for either the cis or the trans conformation. interestingly, certain properties seem to dominate at particular positions. for cis, aromatic residues are very likely at position i- <dig> and i+ <dig> whereas for trans aromatic residues occur with high propensity at position i- <dig> 

in table  the occurrences of the secondary structure types of proline in the cis and trans conformation are shown. for the five secondary structure elements  we analyzed the surrounding of the fixed proline in the mid-position. rows indicate the secondary structure type with fixed secondary structure of the proline. columns show the relative occurrence of the secondary structure at the  <dig> positions around proline. based on the relative occurrence of the secondary structure of the proline we can specify typical secondary structure pattern for cis and trans xaa-pro peptide bond conformation.

for example, if the cis proline is located in a bend or coil secondary structure type the amino acid at the position i- <dig> is never an element of a helix or turn. furthermore, in the rare case where cis proline is part of a helix it is never found at the beginning or the end of the helix. in the case of the cis proline being present in a turn we never found a helix or bend structure element at the position i- <dig>  however, residues in a turn occurred relatively often .

the  <dig> most frequently occurring secondary structure fragments with a cis proline at the mid position are presented in the second and third column of table . for comparison, the occurrences of the corresponding fragments with trans proline are shown in column  <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, table  shows the  <dig> most frequently occurring secondary structure fragments of trans proline and the corresponding occurrence of cis prolines. here, the amount of helical regions in the environment of proline increases dramatically whereas in the cis case the helix structure occurs very rarely. most of the trans prolines of the five-piece fragments in helical regions appear as the first helix element in contrast to the helical cis prolines which do never occur as the first element of a helix ).

all previous results from the different approaches are compared with the content of the "top 10" tables ) in order to confirm the observed dependencies of sequence and secondary structure on the cis/trans peptide bond conformation of proline.

as a control parameter for the estimation of cis and trans conformations the sum of the chou-fasman parameter can be used  and ). the sum of the  at the positions  leads to the same ranking in comparison to the "top 10" tables considering only  <dig> positions. for the pattern bbc in the cis case the sum is  <dig>  and for trans conformation it is  <dig> . in contrast the pattern ccc leads to  <dig>  for trans and  <dig>  for the cis conformation. on the basis of separated data sets for cis and trans proline conformation we derived the occurrence for the secondary structure elements and sequence pattern from so-called occurrence matrices  and ).

the output from the "top 10" tables can be verified in the occurrence matrices ). the cbbcc pattern is most probable for the cis conformation and for trans conformation it is the ccccc pattern. they coincide as most probable secondary structure combination in table  as highlighted by bold face. for example, for the secondary structure element bend in position i, ccbbc results as most probable for the trans proline and the cbbcc pattern for cis. for coil as secondary structure element in the position i ccccs results for the cis case whereas ccccc occurs for trans.

in order to evaluate the significance of table  and , we analyzed the ccccc secondary structure pattern for the middle proline in trans peptide bond conformation in terms of the most probable amino acid in the  <dig> positions . we found the following preferences: position i-2: p>m>q>a>y>t>r>s, position i-1: p>s>a>q>r>k>m>c>l>t, position i+1: p>r>t>e>s>q>a>v>k position i+2: p>s>k>r>y>a>v>e. however, if those amino acids are compared with the most probable amino acids for trans or cis peptide bond conformation with proline in position i, no unambiguous sequence pattern remains.

we conclude that the influence of the secondary structure on a possible prediction of the xaa-pro peptide bond conformation is more significant than the sequence information of the residues surrounding proline.

analysis of the solvent accessible surface
the relationship between the relative solvent accessibility and the relative occurrence of prolines in our pdb data set was investigated. in the range from 0% to 20% of solvent accessibility  <dig> % of the trans entries can be found compared to  <dig> % cis entries whereas  <dig> % cis instances occur in the range above the threshold of  <dig> % accessibility rate in contrast to  <dig> % trans. these numbers suggest that proline in the cis conformation is slightly more frequently found in surface accessible areas compared to the trans proline.

the reason for the difference can be explained by the finding that cis prolines are more frequently found in solvent-exposed turn and bend structures, whereas trans prolines mostly occur in either helix or strand secondary structure elements. the relatively high frequency of exposed cis-prolines in conjunction with the relatively low energy barrier for the cis to trans conversion as compared to other amino acids mark proline as a preferred site for conformational switch mechanism in proteins. for example, ppiases catalyze the isomerization rate and thereby may regulate biological responses by alternative conformations of loop regions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have analyzed more than  <dig> proline residues within pdb-deposited protein structures in regard to their peptide bond conformation . we extracted fragments of  <dig> residues in length with proline in the mid-position. the pdb-derived secondary structure and the sequence information were used in a further statistical analysis of the  <dig> fragments.

the calculation and interpretation of occurrence matrices reveal distinct preferences for the cis and for the trans conformation in dependence of secondary structure types. by the use of the modified chou-fasman parameter at the positions ,  and   propensities for the proline peptide bond conformation can be derived from the secondary structure pattern. it is conceivable that an implementation of the modified chou-fasman parameters can be used for the prediction of proline peptide bond conformation in fragments with known secondary structure. an application of the new chou-fasman parameters for other naturally occurring amino acids is possible and leads to statistically relevant propensities for the prediction of the peptide conformation of any of the  <dig> amino acids in proteins. a prediction algorithm is presented on our website .

finally the relationship between the relative solvent accessibility of proline and its peptide bond conformation shows that cis prolines occur more frequently in surface accessible areas compared to the prolines in trans conformation.
