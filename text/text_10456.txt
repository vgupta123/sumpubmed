BACKGROUND
soybean  is the world’s largest oilseed crop with many uses including oil, food, and biofuels. in  <dig> over  <dig> million acres of soybean were grown in the us, for a total crop value of  <dig> billion dollars  <cit> . the completion of the soybean genome sequence in  <dig> has accelerated progress in understanding the genetic control of many processes, as well as enabling functional genomics research towards crop improvement  <cit> .

a leaf undergoes several important changes throughout its development. as the newly initiated leaf expands and gains photosynthetic competency, it undergoes a transition from nutrient sink to source, and later it undergoes senescence as nutrients are mobilized and exported prior to leaf abscission and a highly controlled process of cell death. during trifoliate leaf senescence in soybean, the nutrients that remain in the are transported to the developing seeds, therefore this process is crucial to yield and seed quality. if leaves senesce before seed development is complete , the plant may suffer yield reductions up to 50 %  <cit> , while senescence delay and extension of the seed filling period results in potentially increased yield  <cit> . studies have also shown that a suppressed leaf senescence during water-deficient conditions can confer drought tolerance to tobacco plants  <cit> . further understanding of the pattern of gene expression that is triggered during leaf senescence and how the initiation of leaf death is controlled presents an opportunity to maximize the photosynthetic period and potentially improve crop yields.

the cotyledon, a modified leaf that functions to sustain early seedling development follows a similar pattern, at least in soybean which undergoes epigeal phanerocotylar germination. even among other legume species the cotyledon has a different fate – pisum and phaseolus cotyledons function exclusively as storage organs and do not attain photosynthetic competence, while in ricinius communis the cotyledons lack the fleshy characteristics of soybean or common bean cotyledons and much more closely resemble leaves  <cit> . establishment of the photosynthetic machinery in the soybean cotyledon is energetically costly for relatively little gain; it is thought that photosynthesis by soybean seedling cotyledons serves to balance respiratory losses soon after germination while the carbohydrate, lipid, and protein reserves are mobilized  <cit> .

previous expression profiling studies have identified genes associated with leaf development and senescence in the model plants arabidopsis and maize and have further defined processes that occur during this period . genes that are up-regulated during senescence, termed senescence-associated genes  encode proteins required for degradation, but which have roles in a variety of processes including defense responses, detoxification, and signaling. genes that decrease in expression during senescence, referred to as senescence down-regulated genes  primarily encode proteins involved with photosynthesis . along with sags and sdgs a number of transcription factors have been identified in various species that are implicated in the regulation of sags and sdgs . the largest families of transcription factors associated with senescence include nac, wrky, myb, c2h <dig> zinc finger, bzip and ap2/erebp  <cit> . some of these transcription factors have also been identified as highly expressed in the early seedling cotyledons  <cit> . plant hormones play an important role in plant growth and development and also in the regulation of senescence. the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene response pathways are known to be involved with plant defense responses and also positively regulate the senescence process, while cytokinins inhibit senescence  <cit> . studies in arabidopsis have shown that mutants defective in salicylic acid signaling exhibit a delayed senescence and all three pathways are required for the expression of sags  <cit> .

to characterize the temporal shifts in gene expression that underlie the biochemical and metabolic processes occurring in soybean leaves and cotyledons, and to identify the genes that govern these transitions, we performed rnaseq expression profiling on soybean leaves and cotyledons at multiple stages of the life cycle of each organ, including the stages before and during senescence. to more fully understand the mobilization of nutrient reserves in the cotyledon, we also examined the common and distinct processes between these two photosynthetic tissues.

RESULTS
stages and genes
five stages were selected for profiling from the leaves from leaf opening to onset of senescence, which we refer to as l-i through l-v throughout this experiment. three stages of development were analyzed from soybean cotyledons, which we refer to as c-i through c-iii. the stages of leaf and cotyledon samples collected are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. principal component analysis plots for leaf and cotyledon samples show consistency between biological replicates and significant differences between the stages selected for comparative analysis . stages l-ii and l-iii as well as stages l-iv and l-v are similar to one another, but very different from stage l-i. principal component analysis for the cotyledon data suggests that gene expression in stages c-ii and c-iii is overall more similar than between stages c-i  and c-ii. a total of  <dig>   transcripts from the gmax <dig> version of the soybean genome annotation were found to be expressed during at least one stage of leaf development, while  <dig>  transcripts  were found to be expressed during at least one stage of cotyledon development .

genes expressed differentially during development and senescence
of the  <dig>  genes in the soybean gmax <dig> dataset,  <dig>  genes  were found to be differentially expressed between at least two stages within the cotyledon timecourse while  <dig>  genes  were differentially expressed between two stages of the leaf timecourse. each differentially expressed gene was assigned to an expression profile based on significant fold change and expression across all of the stages in an organ order to identify major dynamic patterns of gene expression . overall, the set of differentially expressed genes through cotyledon and leaf development agree well with results of prior studies of leaf senescence in arabidopsis thaliana and other plants. close homologs for thirty-one percent  of genes identified as sags in arabidopsis  <cit>  were found to be differentially expressed in the leaf dataset, while 44 % were differentially expressed in the cotyledon dataset . for example, arabidopsis gene atnap  is a nac transcription factor that has an important role in leaf senescence  <cit> . the top soybean orthologs of this gene are glyma13g <dig>  glyma1g <dig>  glyma20g <dig>  glyma02g <dig>  and glyma07g <dig>  all of these were found to be significantly upregulated in either cotyledon or leaf in this experiment suggesting conservation of function of this transcription factor in soybean leaf senescence.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed gene profiles in leaf and cotyledon development. differentially expressed genes from  leaves and  cotyledons were classified into expression profiles based on significant changes in gene expression between subsequent stages. line thickness is proportional to the number of genes included in each profile. see methods for more detail



temporal pattern of leaf gene expression
to characterize the biochemical and physiological processes occurring during different stages of leaf development, we used gene ontology term  enrichment analysis  <cit>  to identify groups of genes involved in similar functions that were significantly enriched within the co-regulated gene sets that were identified. a table listing all enriched go-terms and associated genes identified in each leaf or cotyledon expression profile is given in additional file  <dig>  and summarized in figs.  <dig> &  <dig>  genes belonging to profile  <dig> or  <dig> that decreased significantly between stage l-i and l-ii or l-iii fell into several classes, predominantly associated with cell growth and expansion, cell wall biosynthesis, cell wall thickening and loosening, as well as the development of the epidermal cell layer and cuticular wax biosynthesis . this finding is consistent with the l-i stage being critical for leaf expansion and maturation . genes associated with photosynthetic processes and light response decreased in expression during the later stages of l-iv and l-v  consistent with the decline of photosynthesis as the tissues began to senesce. genes expressed at higher levels in the later stages  function in arginine and glutamate transport, consistent with remobilization of amino acids  from the senescing tissues. seven genes with predicted roles in sulfate assimilation are upregulated early  which is consistent with the previously observed developmental regulation of the atp sulfurylase genes  <cit> . a significant number of genes potentially involved in disease resistance and defense responses were also upregulated after stage l-iii, which is consistent with the overlapping functions of many senescence-associated genes in responses to biotic stress .fig.  <dig> significant go term associations in leaf developmental patterns. gene ontology  terms that were significantly enriched in the identified gene expression profiles from developing leaves are shown. the number of genes included in each profile is shown in the box that represents the expression pattern of the included genes. a full listing of significant go-terms can be found in additional file 7

temporal pattern of cotyledon gene expression
genes that increased in expression between stages c-i and c-iii  or c-ii and c-iii  were implicated in protein and starch breakdown . genes in profiles  <dig> and  <dig> that increase in expression between stage c-i and c-ii have roles in defense response, nitrate assimilation, and sulfate transport. a large number  decreased in expression between stages c-i and c-ii  and these genes appear to function in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and proteolysis, consistent with the role of cotyledons in mobilizing reserves to the developing seedling shortly after germination  <cit> . some of the changes in gene expression observed between c-i and c-ii may be due to the differences in the growth conditions for these tissues, however we can infer that the genes that respond in a similar pattern in l-i and l-iii may be developmentally rather than environmentally induced. genes that decrease in stage c-iii  are primarily involved in the biosynthesis and maintenance of the photosynthetic complex, and jasmonic acid biosynthesis.

a significant number of genes included in cotyledon profile  <dig>  are annotated as sulfate transporters. nitrogen , potassium , phosphorus , and sulfur  are major nutrients mobilized from yellowing leaves to new growth or developing seeds. it was shown that n, p, k, and s levels drop dramatically during arabidopsis leaf senescence, with a loss of over 60 % of the initial nutrient content  <cit> . to understand the role of transcriptional regulation in the process of nutrient mobilization, we examined the response of the all of genes annotated as transporters of nitrogen, sulfur, potassium, or phosphorus. approximately half of the annotated or blastp-identified n transport genes were expressed at levels below the threshold of detection of this experiment, but many of the transporter genes expressed at high levels were identified as differentially regulated. these genes are listed in additional file  <dig>  fig.  <dig> shows the differentially expressed n  and s transporters in the cotyledon and leaves. the upregulated nitrate transporters predominantly belong to the npf <dig>  npf <dig>  and npf <dig> families, with an affinity for nitrate or dipeptide transport, and related to the arabidopsis nrt <dig>  with a role in source-sink remobilization of n  <cit> . consistent with results from arabidopsis, nitrogen and sulfate transporter genes are expressed at higher levels in the later stages of both the leaves and cotyledon. of  <dig> transcript models annotated as sulfate transporters,  <dig> were upregulated between stages c-i and c-ii in cotyledons, and  <dig> were significantly upregulated in leaf tissues, and eleven of these were common to both sets. n transporters were also upregulated in both leaves and cotyledons. potassium and phosphate transporters were differentially expressed during leaf and cotyledon development and senescence, but demonstrated less coordinated regulation .fig.  <dig> regulation of n and s transporter genes. differentially expressed genes annotated as n transporters in  cotyledons and  leaves. blue and green lines represent nitrate transporters, pink and red lines represent ammonium transporters. solid lines represent genes that were differentially expressed in both tissues, while dashed lines show genes that were differentially expressed in either cotyledons or leaves. genes annotated as sulfate transporters from the cotyledons are shown in  and from the leaves in  y-axis is log <dig> scale



modifications of the leaf expression blueprint to program a nutrient reserve
we determined that  <dig>  transcripts  were expressed in both the cotyledon and the leaf, while the remainder of the genes showed evidence for specificity to either leaves or cotyledons in this experiment . a total of  <dig>   genes were only present in cotyledons and  <dig>  genes  were only expressed in the leaf . over-represented go-terms associated with the cotyledon-specific genes suggest the mobilization of cotyledon-specific nutrients, including the response to trehalose stimulus and alpha-glucan/water dikinase activity. the chloroplast protein alpha-glucan water dikinase  <dig> mediates the incorporation of phosphate into starch-like alpha-glucan, mostly at the c- <dig> position of glucose units in arabidopsis. this acts as an overall regulator of starch mobilization, and is required for starch degradation  <cit> . the β-amylase enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of starch and an important step in germinating seedlings, and post germination growth  <cit> . over-represented functions for the leaf-specific genes include categories associated with photoperiodism and flower development, consistent with these processes occurring long after the cotyledons have senesced.fig.  <dig> leaf and cotyledon specific genes. of the  <dig>  genes identified as expressed in the experiment,  <dig>  % of genes were expressed exclusively in the cotyledons, 5 % of the genes were expressed only in the leaf, and more than 87 % were shared between the two tissues. the list complete list of genes that demonstrated tissue specific expression is included in additional file 9




genes expressed in both leaf and cotyledon tissues, and which demonstrated significant differential expression between both c-ii and c-iii and l-iii and l-iv  were shown to have a significant overlap, and  <dig>  % of these genes shared the same direction of change  in both tissues. this may indicate that the control of the later phases of senescence uses the same molecular machinery in both tissues . genes expressed differentially between early stages, as between both c-i and c-ii and l-i and l-ii also overlapped significantly and over 95 % of these genes shared the same direction of change, which likewise implies a shared mechanism for early growth and developmental patterning common to both tissue types.

the control network of temporal gene expression
one of the largest classes of genes found to be differentially expressed between multiple stages were the transcription factors. to investigate regulatory networks involved with developmental processes we identified transcription factors that were differentially expressed throughout the time course. we assembled a list of  <dig>  transcription factors from the soybean genome based on mapman classification terms  <cit> . in leaves, a total of  <dig> genes predicted to encode transcription factors were differentially expressed between two stages. a total of  <dig> transcription factors were differentially expressed between at least two stages of cotyledon development.

the transcription factors from both the cotyledon and leaves were placed into bins based on annotated family  <cit> . we found representatives of  <dig> different families of transcription factors in the cotyledon and  <dig> families in the leaf. the most abundant transcription factor families  are shown in fig.  <dig> for leaves and fig.  <dig> for cotyledons. in both tissues, we observe that the transcription factors most commonly found to increase in expression with tissue age are from the wrky family and these comprise the largest family of transcriptional regulators expressed differentially in our dataset. this is consistent with previous studies that find these transcription factors to function as major regulators of senescence . additionally, members of the gras family are also expressed predominantly during leaf senescence and early cotyledon senescence, consistent with studies in other species . twenty-one of the gras transcription factors were upregulated during senescence in both cotyledons and leaves. in leaves, the bhlh, c2c <dig> zinc finger transcription factors, and g2-like transcription factors share the expression profiles  that span the photosynthetic period, consistent with a likely role in chloroplast development and regulation of photosynthetic genes and carbohydrate metabolism . auxin plays an important role in plant growth and development by regulating gene expression  <cit> . in both the leaf and cotyledon, the aux/iaa transcription factors decrease in expression following the initial stages of development . this result is consistent with studies of senescence in cotton, rice, and wheat suggesting these transcription factors may act as negative regulators of senescence . of  <dig>  genes identified by mapman as transcription factors, only six were annotated as part of the nac family. as these transcription factors are known to be involved in senescence and defense  <cit> , we examined the gmax_ <dig> genome annotations to identify  <dig> nac or nac-related transcription factors ,  <dig> of these were found to differentially expressed in the leaves and  <dig> in the cotyledon. the majority of the differentially expressed nac transcription factors  were upregulated during tissue senescence, with  <dig> genes common to both organs.fig.  <dig> specific families of leaf transcription factors are enriched in early leaf development and senescence phases. differentially expressed transcription factors categorized by expression profile and classified by family. transcription factor families represented by more than twenty genes are shown  <cit>

to identify potential cis-acting elements that govern the temporal patterns of expression, over-represented promoter motifs were identified from genes in each profile using elefinder  <cit> . the elefinder method identifies statistically over-represented, characterized binding sites for known transcription factors from a variety of plant species within a specified promoter set. this can suggest a likely mechanism for the control of the specific expression pattern of a gene although the incidence of a given binding site only suggests which class of transcription factor could recognize and regulate the promoter. where gene sets were too large to scan for over-represented elements in their entirety, the top  <dig>  or  <dig> genes  were analyzed. fig.  <dig> lists all of the significant motifs associated with each expression pattern in leaves, and the associated e-value, and the number of occurrences of the element in the data set. in the leaf, elements present in the promoters of genes that decline from stage l-i throughout the timecourse  are associated with photosynthetic genes, including the myc <dig> binding site, the ibox, and atb2/atbzip44/atbzip53/gbf <dig> binding site. similarly, genes included in cotyledon profiles  <dig> and  <dig> that decreased in expression between stages c-ii and c-iii contained the g-box and sorlip <dig> element in their promoters, consistent with the known abundance of these motifs upstream of light regulated genes associated with photosynthesis. photosynthesis genes were observed to be downregulated between these stages , thus activation via these elements may be reduced during the studied period  <cit> . the abfs element is enriched in promoters of genes declining in expression throughout the cotyledon timecourse, and is a g-box variant implicated in aba response and targeted by bzip transcription factors  <cit>  . the arf <dig> binding site, targeted by the aux/iaa transcription factors is enriched in genes downregulated in later stages of development in both the leaf  and cotyledon   <cit> . in both leaves and cotyledons, the dpbf1& <dig> element is enriched in genes upregulated in later stages  . in both leaves and cotyledons, the athb <dig> motif is over-represented in genes that had a constant increase in expression . the athb <dig> transcription factor is a member of the homeodomain-leucine zipper family of transcription factors thought to regulate active cell growth and differentiation . the bellringer/replumless/pennywise binding site is enriched in promoters of genes from multiple distinct expression profiles in cotyledons and leaves. this at-rich cis-regulatory element is a target for homeodomain transcription factors, however in the context of regulation of the agamous gene in arabidopsis the element is located within an intron  <cit> . in both tissues the wrky-targeted w-box  <cit>  is the most significantly enriched promoter element, and occurs in genes that increase in expression leading up to leaf senescence.fig.  <dig> significantly over-represented motifs in promoters of genes that change in expression during leaf development and senescence. the table shows the significant promoter motifs  and the number of elements  found in the set of promoters of genes classified in one of the six expression profiles  <cit> . for leaf analysis, multiple profiles were combined to identify significant motifs. leaf profiles  <dig> and  <dig> were combined, while profile  <dig> was pooled with genes decreasing in stage l-v. profiles  <dig> and  <dig> did not include a sufficient number of genes to identify significant motifs. profiles  <dig> and  <dig> were pooled into one profile. profile  <dig> included additional genes that increased in expression between stages l-iv and l-v. where gene sets were too large for analysis, the top  <dig> or  <dig> genes  were analyzed

fig.  <dig> significantly over-represented motifs in promoters of genes that change in expression during cotyledon senescence. the table shows the most significant promoter motifs  and the number of occurrences  for each significant element found in promoters of genes classified in one of the eight expression profiles identified for differentially expressed cotyledon genes  <cit> . where gene sets were too large for analysis, the top  <dig> or  <dig> genes  were analyzed



transcriptional control mechanisms leading to differential gene expression are believed to play important roles in coordination of the senescence process  <cit> . our results support previous findings that major transcription factor families  are associated with senescence. the wrky family is one of the largest transcription factor families in higher plants and  <dig> wrky members have been identified in the soybean genome  <cit> . eighty-six wrky transcription factors were differentially expressed in the leaf, and  <dig> in the cotyledon. of these wrky genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed in both leaves and cotyledons, indicating that the wrky transcription factors play a major role in regulation in both tissues. supporting the hypothesis that the co-regulated sets of genes expressed in distinct stages of cotyledon development share a mechanism of regulation, it was found that the w-box  has by far the most significant over-representation in the promoters of genes that increase in expression during senescence in both cotyledon and leaf tissues. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that these master regulators lie at the top of a network driving the expression of genes that drive the physiological changes observable during senescence.

CONCLUSIONS
we have profiled the temporal and developmental regulation of approximately  <dig>  genes in trifoliate leaves and cotyledons of soybean. we found several commonalities between these two tissues for the establishment of photosynthetic machinery, and in the final processes of mobilization of nutrients, but have also identified specific transcripts that appear to be involved in mobilization of stored nutrients in the cotyledons and are expressed earlier in cotyledon development. significantly, we have identified families of transcriptional regulators and corresponding cis-regulatory motifs that appear to co-ordinately regulate the changes in expression observed in several groups of genes during the programmed transition to senescence. our data help to identify the specific machinery by which the genome is regulated during the later stages of leaf development, and may allow more specific biotechnology approaches targeting developmental stages and tissues with transgene expression.
