BACKGROUND
enteroaggregative e. coli  is defined by its adhesion to cultured cells in a stacked brick-like formation  <cit> . this phenotype, termed aggregative adherence , is mediated by specific fimbriae  encoded by plasmids   <cit> . however, other factors, including afimbrial adhesins, are also associated with this adherence pattern, indicating its complex nature  <cit> .

the virulence of at least some prototype eaec strains has been demonstrated  <cit> , although it remains unclear whether virulent strains can be accurately screened in epidemiological studies. the gene sequence termed cvd <dig>  found in paa plasmids, has been employed as an eaec molecular marker while the transcriptional activator termed aggr has been described as the major eaec-virulence regulator  <cit> . epidemiological studies suggest that cvd432-positive eaec strains, which are predicted to carry the aggr regulon, form a subgroup of supposed pathogenic isolates named "typical eaec"  <cit> . despite the efforts to identify a genotype definitely associated with the eaec virulence, controversial data gathered in different geographic areas has made the epidemiology of this pathotype difficult to understand. nevertheless, eaec has been recognized as an emerging pathogen mainly associated with persistent infantile diarrhea in middle-income countries  <cit> .

elucidation of the mechanisms involved in eaec pathogenesis has been limited because of the heterogeneity displayed by wild-type strains  <cit> . given this genetic heterogeneity, expression of biofilms has been considered a consensual virulence factor among eaec isolates  <cit> . biofilm formation is a complex event that may involve many species and several factors. furthermore, the discovery that factors not devoted to adhesion are also important in biofilm formation has highlighted its multifactorial nature. an aaf-independent mechanism for biofilm formation, which is mediated by plasmid-encoded type iv pili, was described in the atypical eaec strain c <dig>  <cit> .

type iv pili are involved in numerous phenotypes in gram-negative pathogens including cell adhesion, twitching motility and conjugation  <cit> . in addition to type iv pili, tra gene-encoded pili are involved in bacterial conjugation mediated by f plasmids. these cellular appendages are non-bundle forming, flexible pili reaching  <dig> μm in length that are expressed during log phase  <cit> . furthermore, f pili render planktonic bacteria capable of engaging in biofilm formation by allowing cell-to-cell contact and interactions with abiotic surfaces  <cit> . thus, it has been shown that e. coli strains harboring natural f plasmids form complex mature biofilms by using f-pilus connections in initial stages of the biofilm formation, whereas plasmid-free strains form only patchy biofilms  <cit> .

bacteria that express conjugation systems frequently exhibited cell aggregation followed by flocculation in static liquid culture. in e. coli strains, bacterial autoaggregation is also mediated by the expression of the self-recongnizing adhesin named antigen  <dig> . ag <dig> is a autotransporter protein whose the mature form consists of two subunits, α and β  <cit> . the expression of ag <dig> is phase variable and in the k <dig> strain is under the control of oxyr, the master activator of the oxidative stress response in e. coli strains  <cit> . in addition to ag <dig>  bacterial aggregation is also mediated by the expression of curli fibers. curli is a proteinaceous component of the extracellular matrix produced by many enterobacteriaceae species which is known as thin aggregative fimbriae  <cit> . among enterobacteriacea species, curli fibers are the major determinant of cell-cell interactions and adherence to abiotic surfaces and have been shown to sustain biofilm formation in enterobacter sp., salmonella typhimurium, e. coli and citrobacter freundii strains  <cit> .

citrobacter freundii is usually considered a commensal species of the human gut, although some isolates have acquired specific virulence traits that enable them to cause diarrhea. therefore, virulence factors homologous, and some even identical, to those described in e. coli pathotypes were detected in c. freundii strains isolated from sporadic cases of infantile diarrhea  <cit> . additionally, isolates of c. freundii have been identified as effective recipient strains even since the first articles concerning e. coli conjugation mediated by f pili were published  <cit> . reports on the transfer of e. coli thermo-stable toxin genes between these species raised considerations about the virulence potential of the bacterial conjugation  <cit> . a highly conjugative plasmid , which is responsible for the extensive spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase  in enterobacteriaceae, was described in clinical isolates of c. freundii. pctx-m <dig> is a  <dig>  bp-plasmid belonging to incl/m group that probability evolved from environmental plasmids through stepwise integration of mobile genetic elements. moreover, it has been shown that this plasmid is easily transferred to e. coli, klebsiella sp., enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and salmonella enterica strains  <cit> .

nowadays, it is known that phenotypic features classically associated with pathogenic e. coli strains are not restricted exclusively to this species. in addition to eaec, the aa pattern has been recognized in uropathogenic proteus mirabilis strains  <cit>  and in klebsiella pneumoniae strains recovered from healthcare-associated infections  <cit> . in these isolates, the expression of aa pattern has been associated with the ability to form biofilms.

bacterial biofilms found in natural and pathogenic ecosystems are formed in the presence of multiple species and genetically distinct strains. however, the current understanding of these microbial consortia is largely based on single-species models that frequently use laboratory strains. in this work, wild-type strains of typical eaec and c. freundii, which were concomitantly recovered from diarrhea, were tested in mixed biofilm assays in order to evaluate the occurrence of synergistic effects on biofilm formation.

firstly, it is shown that the diarrhea-isolated c. freundii strain shared the characteristic aa phenotype displayed by eaec strains, and henceforth was named aggregative c. freundii . it follows that eacf strain  <dig> and diarrhea-isolated typical eaec strains cooperate to increase bacterial adhesion to hela cells and biofilm formation. moreover, the synergic effect was associated with putative f pili expressed by eaec strains.

RESULTS
aggregative c. freundii
during a case-control study of infantile diarrhea, c. freundii strains were isolated from two subjects. the c. freundii strain  <dig>  was isolated from a child suffering of a severe mucous diarrhea; while the strain  <dig>  was isolated from a control child. adherence assays showed that strain cf <dig> displayed a mannose-resistant aa phenotype  indistinguishable to that developed by eaec prototype strain  <dig> . as with the prototype eaec strain, cf <dig> strain displayed the characteristic stacked-brick pattern on the periphery of the cells and autoagglutination on the glass coverslip. therefore, this strain was termed aggregative c. freundii . by contrast, control strain cf <dig> developed diffuse adherence .

given the occurrence of aggregative adherence in c. freundii, the presence of eaec adhesion related fimbrial genes together with  <dig> additional eaec molecular markers were tested . none of the eaec-specific genetic markers were detected in the eacf strain and in the diffusely adherent strain as well. additionally, eleven virulence markers associated with four other e. coli pathogenic categories were also tested and included markers for toxins and adhesins . none of these tested markers were detected in the examined c. freundii strains. c. freundii strains were also tested negative for gene sequences of the self-recognizing adhesin ag <dig> 

as conjugation may lead to bacterial aggregation, the presence of conjugative plasmids was also tested employing primers designed to target pctx-like plasmids  and f plasmids . c. freundii strains were negative for the tested conjugative sequences. moreover, plasmid profile revealed that eacf and diffusely c. freundii were plasmid-free strains .

in an attempt to reveal some aspect on the adhesion factor used by the eacf strain, ultrastructural analyses were carried out. tem micrographs showed that planktonic cells of eacf did not display fimbrial structures . eacf biofilms were also analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. surface-associated eacf cells formed tight aggregates which were devoid of extracellular appendages . although extracellular appendages can not be detected in the eacf strain, the presence of an extracellular matrix involving both planktonic  and surface-associated  eacf cells was easily noted. together these results indicated the occurrence of putative non-fimbrial adhesins mediating the adhesion of the eacf strain.

eacf  <dig> and eaec strains cooperate to increase adhesion to hela cells
aware that eacf strain  <dig> was isolated from a severe diarrhea case together with eaec strains, mixed infection assays were conducted in order to evaluate the adherence developed by bacterial combinations  recovered from the diarrheic child  <dig> and from the healthy child  <dig>  light microscopy showed that the adhesion to hela cells developed by the pair of strains isolated from diarrheic child  was greater than that supported by each of the strains separately as well as by the bacterial pair recovered from control child . as both eaec strains 205- <dig> and 047- <dig> showed cell-detaching activity, they are considered unsuitable for quantitative analyses. therefore, the diarrhea-isolated eaec strain 340- <dig> and the prototype eaec strain  <dig> were chosen in order to continue the mixed infection assays employing quantitative analyses. as verified in the preliminary tests, the preinfection of hela cells with eacf strain  <dig> increased the bacterial adherence when followed by coinfection with eaec strains 340- <dig> or  <dig> . in contrast, preinfection with control-isolated c. freundii strain  <dig> did not cause any increment of bacterial adhesion.

to exclude the possibility that the increased adhesion was an unspecific synergic effect triggered by any pair of aggregative strains, coinfection assays were performed with several pairs of eaec strains . no increment in bacterial adhesion was observed using any strain combination.

in order to determine what species accounted for the increased adhesion, quantitative mixed infection assays were conducted and the colony forming units  were counted . assays showed that eaec strains 340- <dig> and  <dig> displayed antagonistic behaviors when hela cells were preinfected with eacf strain  <dig>  regarding eaec 340- <dig>  preinfection with eacf  <dig> induced a 10-fold increase in the adherence of strain 340- <dig> when compared with the single infection . by contrast, preinfection with eacf  <dig> decreased adhesion of the eaec strain  <dig> at  <dig> % . the overall increased adhesion displayed by coinfection of eacf  <dig> plus eaec  <dig> was supported by the  <dig> -fold increased adherence of the eacf  <dig> .

search for biochemical signaling
the role of inter-specific chemical signals in the increase of bacterial adherence was evaluated using permeable inserts that allow the division of culture-plate wells into two diffusion chambers. thus, dmem media were pre-conditioned inoculating the upper chamber with bacterial cultures, and then hela cells, in the lower chamber, were infected in order to test the bacterial adherence. media pre-conditioned by eacf  <dig> or by eaec strains did not induce changes in the adhesion developed by eaec 340- <dig>  eaec  <dig> or eacf  <dig>  such results indicated that the increase in adherence was not triggered by chemical signaling.

the possibility that a previous intimate bacterial contact with the host cells might be required for the increment in adherence was also tested. hela cells pre-conditioned by the adhesion of eacf  <dig> were treated with antibiotics and washed in order to remove the adherent bacteria. afterwards, pre-conditioned hela cells were used to test the adhesion of the eaec strains . no increment in bacterial adherence was observed showing that the enhanced adhesion was not primed by host cells. however, the same assay carried out in the absence of washing step showed an increased adherence similar to that observed with live bacteria. thus, the eacf  <dig> population adhered to hela cells and inactivated by antibiotics still held the capability to boost the adhesion of the eaec strain 340- <dig> . these results showed that the increase in the bacterial adherence developed by eacf 205-eaec combinations were supported by physical interactions, which were triggered by eaec strains, independently of chemical signals or the influence of host cells.

eacf  <dig> and traa-positive eaec strains form bacterial aggregates
aggregation assays showed that the eaec strain  <dig> was capable of intense autoaggregation . as a consequence, this strain was not used in the aggregation assays which intended to address inter-specific interactions. standing overnight cocultures of eacf  <dig> and eaec 340- <dig> aggregated at levels  higher than c. freundii 047-eaec 340- <dig> cocultures  and monocultures of eacf  <dig> , c. freundii  <dig>  or eaec 340- <dig> . these assays indicated the occurrence of inter-specific interactions between eacf  <dig> and eaec 340- <dig>  settling profile assays showed that the bacterial aggregates formed by eacf  <dig> and eaec 340- <dig> were not restored if the overnight coculture was homogenized. moreover, the assays showed that bacterial aggregates were not formed when overnight monocultures of eacf  <dig> and eaec 340- <dig> were mixed . these results indicated that the aggregation involving eacf  <dig> and eaec 340- <dig> strains occurred at a specific time during the bacterial growth and involved inter-specific recognition.

in order to verify these events, settling profile assays were performed employing bacterial cultures in mid-log phase. the assays showed that eaec strains 340- <dig> and 205- <dig> aggregated, and consequently settled, only in the presence of eacf  <dig> . when mixed with eacf  <dig>  the eaec strains 340- <dig> or 205- <dig> induced a steady drop in the settling curve at the 15-min time point. aggregation occurred in the absence of self-recognition, given that monocultures of tested eaec strains and eacf strain  <dig> did not settle. sem analyses showed that bacterial aggregates were mediated by non-bundle forming, flexible pili that extended up to  <dig> μm and promoted cell-to-cell contact . by contrast, eacf  <dig> was unable to aggregate when combined with eaec strain 17- <dig>  demonstrating the absence of inter-specific interactions between these strains . confirming this fact, sem analyses did not detect any bacterial appendages in the mixed suspensions of eacf  <dig> and eaec 17- <dig> 

the inter-specific recognition mediated by flexible pili during the mid-log phase indicated the involvement of conjugative pili in the formation of the bacterial aggregates  <cit> . endorsing this assumption, eaec strains 340- <dig> and 205- <dig> were shown to harbor traa family genes. in contrast, the eaec 17- <dig>  which was unable to display inter-specific aggregation with eacf  <dig>  was negative for traa genes. further evidence was obtained employing zinc, a f-pili specific inhibitor. the zinc treatment of the eaec strain 340- <dig> or 205- <dig> impacted negatively the respective settling curves when performed in the presence of eacf  <dig> . magnesium, another divalent ion which was used in control assays, did not inhibit the bacterial aggregation .

aaf-positive eaec strains harboring the traa gene boosted mixed biofilm formation
in the search for the presence of potential adherence factors listed in table  <dig>  with the exception of the locus tra, the eaec strains 17- <dig> , 340- <dig>  and 205- <dig>  shared the same genotype: pcvd432+aggr+aaf-i+pils+pap+. these strains were therefore employed to verify the association of the traa gene with the increase in biofilm formation in eacf-eaec cocultures.

preliminary assays showed that the synergic effect, previously detected using hela cells, was reproducible when glass coverslips were used as adhesion substratum . the increased adhesion occurred in both faces of the coverslips indicating that enhanced biofilms were caused by active processes developed by combination of eacf  <dig> and traa-positive eaec strains rather than a mere consequence of bacterial settling . mixed biofilms formed by cocultures of eacf  <dig> and traa-positive eaec strains  were  <dig> -fold increased when compared with single biofilms supported by each respective eaec strain  . in contrast, the mixed biofilm developed by eacf  <dig> and eaec 17- <dig>   did not display a statistically significant increase when compared with the eaec 17- <dig> single biofilm   .

zinc effect on single and mixed biofilms
single and mixed biofilm assays were performed in order to evaluate the impact of zinc, and consequently the role of putative f pili, on biofilm formation . zinc at a concentration of  <dig>  mm  reduced the single biofilm formation by eaec strain 205- <dig> by 23%  . in the case of eaec strains 340- <dig> and 17- <dig> no reduction in single biofilms was noted. in contrast, the single biofilm formed by eacf  <dig> displayed a 3-fold increase when zinc was present  . focusing on the traa-positive eaec strains, these results indicate that putative f pili assume variable relevance in the formation of single biofilms.

the impact of zinc on mixed biofilm developed by cocultures of eacf  <dig> and eaec strains was also evaluated. zinc significantly reduced  eacf- <dig> mixed biofilms formed by eaec 205- <dig>  or by eaec 340- <dig>  which displayed in these conditions similar levels to those reached by eacf  <dig> single biofilms . as expected, zinc treatment did not impact the mixed biofilm produced by eacf  <dig> and eaec 17- <dig>  endorsing the conclusion that this biofilm was formed in the absence of putative f pili.

taken together, these results indicated that putative f pili engaged eaec strains in mixed biofilm formation when eacf was present.

sem analyses of biofilms
sem micrographs showed that eacf- <dig> biofilms occurred in the absence of any extracellular appendage . by contrast, biofilms formed by eaec strains 340- <dig> or 205- <dig> were mediated by thick pili that emanated from bacteria and regularly attached to the abiotic surface . enhanced biofilms developed by cocultures of eacf  <dig> with eaec strains 340- <dig> or 205- <dig> were also mediated by pili that, in addition to adhesion to inert surfaces, frequently promoted cell-to-cell interactions . as expected, putative f pili were not detected in the single biofilms formed by traa-negative eaec strain 17- <dig> . curli fibers were occasionally detected in biofilms formed by eaec strain 340- <dig> mainly during single biofilm formation .

zinc effect on single biofilms produced by typical eaec strains isolated from asymptomatic and diarrheic children
in order to evaluate the role of putative f pili on biofilm formation,  <dig> aaf -negative eaec strains, including  <dig> strains recovered from diarrhea and  <dig> recovered from healthy children , had their ability to form biofilms challenged by zinc. additional genetic characterization  showed that two of these strains were positive for aaf/iii and that six strains harbored adhesion factors associated with other e. coli pathotypes . employing the average reduction presented by traa-positive eaec prototype strain  <dig>  as a cut-off line, the assays showed that the eaec strains were sorted into two groups plotted in opposite positions . most of the strains isolated from diarrhea positioned above the cut-off line and thus were considered to form biofilms sensitive to zinc. specifically, sixteen of  <dig>  diarrhea-isolated strains were ranked above the cut-off line. in addition, seven of  <dig> strains recovered from persistent diarrhea formed biofilms sensitive to zinc . in contrast,  <dig> of  <dig>  strains isolated from healthy children formed biofilms resistant to zinc .

this approach suggested that typical eaec strains use distinct adherence factors to form biofilms. moreover, the assays showed that most of eaec recovered from diarrhea employ putative f pili as central factors during biofilm formation. on the other hand, eaec strains isolated from controls commonly use zinc-resistant adhesins to form biofilms.

despite of the genetic heterogeneity presented by the tested collection of typical eaec strains , the zinc cut-off line showed a specificity of  <dig> % and predictive positive value of  <dig> % when employed as a sorting criterion for diarrhea-associated typical eaec strains.

discussion
despite controversial data gathered from different geographic areas, epidemiological studies conducted in economically underprivileged communities showed that eaec strains are strongly associated with persistent diarrhea in children  <cit> . eaec is also associated with growth impairment caused by malabsorption that, theoretically, would occur in consequence of thick biofilm formation  <cit> . moreover, it has been suggested that unrecognized enteropathogens might be involved in similar pathologic processes  <cit> . this work showed that eacf  <dig> boosted the bacterial adhesion to hela cells as well as the biofilm formation when in the presence of typical eaec strains. despite the antagonistic behavior displayed by eaec strains 340- <dig>  and  <dig>  when in the presence of eacf  <dig> , the overall bacterial adhesion was always increased in the mixed infection assays to hela cells. at this time, it is unknown what biological events determine this antagonistic behavior, however, if in fact similar events occur in the human gut, they may influence the outcome of diarrheic processes simply by determining in which proportions the involved species will compose the intestinal microbiota.

as demonstrated by settling profile assays, eacf  <dig> and traa-positive eaec strains aggregated after inter-specific recognition during the mid-log phase of growth. moreover, sem micrographs showed that the bacterial aggregates were mediated by non-bundle forming, flexible pili. these observations indicated that increased adherence might be mediated by putative f pili expressed by eaec strains. endorsing our assumption, inhibition of the putative f pili by zinc significantly reduced the bacterial aggregation and mixed biofilms produced by eafc  <dig> and traa-positive eaec strains. sem images showed that enhanced biofilms formed by cocultures of eacf  <dig> and traa-positive eaec strains were mediated by pili that promoted bacteria-to-bacteria interactions in addition to adhesion to inert surface. conversely, biofilms formed by the coculture of eacf  <dig> and traa-negative eaec strain 17- <dig> did not display pili and therefore were resistant to zinc treatment.

with regard to biofilms formed by traa-positive eaec strains , our results are in agreement with a previous report showing that natural f plasmids promoted single biofilm formation by generating cell-to-cell connections mediated by f pili even in f+-bacteria populations. endorsing this idea, it was shown that biofilm formation is also induced by transfer-deficient f plasmids indicating that the phenomenon does not require conjugative dna transfer itself  <cit> .

curli fiber displayed by enterobacteriaceae species is an unstable phenotype that is responsive to many environmental conditions. in c. freundii and e. coli strains, it has been shown that curli fibers mediate the biofilm formation at liquid-solid interfaces  <cit> . additionally, the presence of natural f conjugative plasmids in e. coli strains was shown to induce the development of mature single biofilms by stimulating the expression of curli fibers after appearance of f pili and following cell-to-cell contact  <cit> . based on previously published sem images  <cit> , we were unable to detected curli fibers in single biofilms formed by eacf  <dig> despite the extensive analysis. concerning e. coli strains, although curli fibers were detected in traa-positive eaec 340- <dig>  their expression was infrequent and incipient either in single biofilms  or in mixed biofilms formed in the presence of eacf  <dig> . taken together our findings corroborate with previous studies showing the central role of the f pilus in the initial steps of the biofilm formation by e. coli strains. adding to this model, now it is shown that expression of f pili may engage e. coli pathotypes in microbial consortia associated with diarrhea.

zinc is a vital micronutrient in humans and its dietary deficiency occurs worldwide, particularly in developing countries. numerous studies have suggested that zinc-deficient populations presented an increased risk of contracting diarrhea. consequently, the zinc administration has been recommended as an additional approach for the prevention and management of diarrhea, being more efficient in treating persistent diarrhea rather than acute cases  <cit> . although the success of zinc therapy has been widely reported, the mechanisms by which zinc exerts its antidiarrheal effects is not fully elucidated  <cit> . the present results showed that zinc frequently inhibited biofilms formed by typical eaec strains isolated from diarrheic children, indicating a possible explanation for its efficient use in the management of diarrhea.

CONCLUSIONS
previously, we reported that typical eaec strains negative for the aaf fimbriae were statistically associated with persistent diarrhea  <cit> , indicating the occurrence of other adhesion factors among wild-type typical eaec strains. here, the results indicate that putative f pili may work as central adhesion factor during the biofilm formation by typical eaec strains. moreover, putative f pili engage typical eaec strains in forming mixed biofilms increasing the overall bacterial adhesion when diarrhea-isolated aggregative c. freundii is present.
