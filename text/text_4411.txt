BACKGROUND
injuries to the central nervous system  in mammals result in devastating consequences because of the limited capacity of the lesioned neurons to regenerate across the wound site and re-establish appropriate connections. on the other hand, there are animals who can completely regenerate their severed cns in a fast and efficient way. among these animals, echinoderms are of particular interest, because their phylogenetic position among basal deuterostomes makes them equally suitable for studies of evolution of neural regeneration in the animal kingdom and for looking for insights into how cns regeneration can be improved in mammals.

the main components of the echinoderm cns are five equidistantly spaced radial nerve cords  , each innervating the adjacent structures in the respective sector of the body. at the oral end of the animal, the five rncs are joined together by a circumoral nerve ring. an established injury paradigm to investigate neural regeneration in echinoderms has been to completely cut one of the rncs at about the mid-body level . among the most prominent components of the early post-injury response are a sharp increase in programmed cell death and extensive dedifferentiation of glial cells in the vicinity of the lesion. the dedifferentiated glial cells become highly proliferative and act as a major source of both new glial cells and new neurons in the regenerating segment of the radial nerve cord  <cit> . the ability of the echinoderm glia to acquire pluripotency and take on a leading role in neural regeneration contrasts with the early post-traumatic events in mammals, where glial cells form a scar, which inhibits any subsequent regeneration across the wound gap  <cit> . as the early processes in the lesioned cns largely determine whether genuine regeneration or scarring will ensure, better understanding of the events that unfold shortly after injury in the echinoderm cns may eventually lead to the development of better therapeutic strategies to stimulate neural regeneration in humans.

in an attempt to get insight into molecular mechanisms involved in control of cell activation and dedifferentiation in the regenerating echinoderm cns, we investigated expression patterns of pluripotency factors in the rnc of a sea cucumber at various time points after injury  <cit> . we identified  <dig> homologs of vertebrate pluripotency genes , of which only myc expression showed significant increase in response to the rnc injury. the sea cucumber myc is a homolog of mammalian myc proteins, global transcription regulators that moderate expression of 10– <dig> % of the genome and play crucial roles in control of cell growth, proliferation, balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and apoptosis in various developmental contexts and during oncogenic transformation . interestingly, the expression level of the sea cucumber myc was already elevated during the early response to rnc injury  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that this increase in myc expression was somehow associated with the initiation of cns regeneration, however, the specific function of the gene remained unknown.

in this study, we adapt rna interference -mediated gene silencing to determine the roles played by myc during the early post-injury response in the rnc of the brown rock sea cucumber holothuria glaberrima selenka,  <dig>  we show that elevated levels of myc during the first two days after the injury are required for proper dedifferentiation of radial glial cells and for initiation of programmed cell death in the vicinity of the lesion. to our knowledge, the present study is the first implementation of rnai methodology in regenerating adult echinoderms. the ability to use functional genomics tools makes it possible at last to experimentally decipher molecular pathways underlying post-traumatic organogenesis in these highly regenerating animals.

RESULTS
electroporation of dsirnas reduces myc expression in the injured radial nerve
in order to determine the functional role of myc in the early response to the cns injury in h. glaberrima, we designed two different dicer-substrate small interfering rnas , designated as myc dsi <dig> and myc dsi <dig>  which targeted distinct  regions of the myc transcript . the decision to use longer dsirnas with a 25-nt sense strand and a 27-nt antisense strand rather than more traditional shorter 21-nt duplexes was based on the fact that dsirnas can be up to 100-fold more efficient than the classical 21-mers  <cit> . dsirnas were injected and electroporated into the rnc . besides reagent delivery, the injection procedure also served another function. the diameter of the injection needle was chosen to be greater than the width of the rnc, so that complete transection is achieved during the injection procedure . two days after surgery, quantitative real-time rt-pcr  showed that injection and electroporation of either myc dsi <dig> or myc dsi <dig> caused a significant ∼ <dig> -fold decrease in myc mrna expression compared with the injection of the control gfp-trageting dsirna , whereas the animals treated with the control dsirna themselves did not show any significant differences when compared with the animals injected with the vehicle alone.

likewise, in situ hybridization shows that rnai-mediated gene targeting causes myc expression to fall below the detection limit in the cells adjacent to the site of injury/injection. no knockdown occurred when the animals were injected with the control gfp-targeting dsi rna .

forced downregulation of myc transcripts impairs dedifferentiation of radial glia
glial dedifferentiation is one of the key cellular events that take place in the injured sea cucumber rnc shortly after transection  <cit> . under normal conditions, fully differentiated radial glial cells show typical palisade morphology, with their cell bodies mostly localized to the apical region of the neuroepithelium and the long basal processes extending through the entire thickness of the neural parenchyma  <cit> . in response to injury, however, the glial cells loose their basal processes, which undergo fragmentation and become eventually phagocytosed by adjacent cells. the glial cells bodies persist in the apical region of the neuroepithelium and retain epithelial characteristics such as intercellular junctions and apicobasal cell polarity, but undergo extensive reogranization of the cytoskeleton and chromatin decondensation  <cit> .

in order to determine if there is any effect of rnai-induced myc knock-down on post-traumatic dedifferentiation of radial glial cells, we measured the relative area of the rnc occupied by glial cells, which still retained their basal processes  on day  <dig> post-injury. the measurements were performed on sagittal sections and covered the area spanning  <dig> mm from the site of the injury/injection. myc knock-down had a highly significant effect on the extent of glial dedifferention = <dig> ,p= <dig> ×10−5). electroporation of either of the two dsirnas, myc dsi <dig> or myc dsi <dig>  resulted in a ∼50–60-fold increase in the size of the relative area of the radial nerve cord occupied by differentiated radial glia , whereas electroporation of the control  dsirna resulted in exactly the same phenotype as injection of the vehicle alone, i.e. extensive dedifferentiation  in the radial glia . therefore, myc is required for induction of dedifferentiation of radial glial cells after cns injury.

myc knock-down decreases the extent of programmed cell death in the injured radial nerve cord
besides glial dedifferentiation, extensive programmed cell death is another characteristic feature of the early post-injury phase in the rnc  <cit> . by day  <dig>  the number of apoptotic cells in the vicinity of the injury increases 20-fold in comparison with uninjured animals and then starts to gradually return to the normal levels as regeneration progresses  <cit> .

given that myc, depending on the context, is known either to trigger or suppress apoptosis in mammalian models  <cit> , we employed tunel  assay to determine if myc is involved in regulation of the programmed cell death in the injured radial nerve cord of h. glaberrima. there was a significant effect = <dig> ,p= <dig> ×10−4) of rnai-mediated myc down-regulation on relative abundance of tunel-positive cells in the vicinity  of the wound on day  <dig> post-injury. myc-targeting dsirnas caused a ∼2–4-fold decrease in the number of the cells undergoing programmed cell death, whereas the control gfp-targeting dsirna did not result in any changes in comparison with vehicle-injected animals .

discussion
in our earlier experiments  <cit> , we identified myc as the only pluripotency factor, whose expression significantly increased in response to cns injury in the sea cucumber h. glaberrima. in vertebrates, myc proteins are known to act as major hubs in gene regulatory networks, as they receive multiple inputs from various upstream signaling pathways and then in turn regulate expression of a wide range of downstream genes , including other transcription factors  <cit> . h. glaberrimamyc might thus be a crucial component of the gene regulatory networks that trigger and control neural regeneration. it was therefore important to determine its specific functions.

previously published evidence firmly established myc as a regulator of cell differentiation. for example, c-myc was one of the four components of the transcription factor cocktail that produced induced pluripotent stem cells from adult murine fibroblasts  <cit> . myc downregulation, on the other hand, causes cells to exit the cell cycle and undergo differentiation  <cit> . our data suggest that upregulation of myc expression is also required for proper dedifferentiation of radial glial cells in the context of response to cns injury in the sea cucumber h. glaberrima. interestingly, this function of myc is not unique to the rapidly regenerating echinoderm cns, but can also be harnessed to improve recovery following neural injuries in animals with poor intrinsic regenerative abilities. forced constitutive expression of v-myc  stabilized dedifferentiated state in rat embryonic radial glia. upon transplantation into the injured adult spinal cord, these myc-expressing cells were able to form bridges across the lesion and improved functional recovery  <cit> . the role of myc in control of glial differentiation may, therefore, be part of a phylogenetically conserved program of neural regeneration throughout deuterostomia.

another well-known function of myc is regulation of programmed cell death. upregulation of myc can either trigger apoptosis or protect cells from cell death, depending on the context, in which it is expressed  <cit> . in sea cucumbers, a sharp increase in the extent of programmed cell death is one of the most notable components of the early reaction to the rnc injury  <cit> . since rnai-induced myc knock-down resulted in a significant decrease in abundance of apoptotic cells, we concluded that myc positively regulates programmed cell death in the injured echinoderm cns. it is not yet known, however, whether in this case the wave of cell death is merely a byproduct of the trauma or whether it is also required for initiation and coordination of the subsequent regeneration, as in head regeneration in hydra  <cit>  and tail regeneration in xenopus tadpoles  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time the utility of rna interference for determining functional roles of genes of interest in regenerating adult echinoderms. to our knowledge, myc is the first transcription factor whose function in echinoderm regeneration was experimentally established. quantitative pcr and in situ hybridization showed that injection and electroporation of myc-targeting dsirnas resulted in a reliable knock-down of about  <dig> %. analysis of the rnai phenotypes revealed that in the context of post-traumatic neural regeneration in a sea cucumber myc promotes acquisition of dedifferentiated state in glia and triggers programmed cell death. we hypothesize that myc might be a component of a phylogenetically stable mechanism of deuterostome neural regeneration, which has even been preserved in a dormant state in poorly regenerating mammals. further research into specific roles of regulatory genes associated with neural regeneration in echinoderms will improve our understanding of evolution of regeneration in deuterostomes and provide insights into which molecular pathways can be adjusted in mammals to improve their regenerative capacities.
