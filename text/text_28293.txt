BACKGROUND
the mountain pine beetle  is a major forest pest currently enjoying historically unprecedented outbreak populations in western north america  <cit> . its success is due in part to the use of pheromones to coordinate mass-attacks on host trees, a behavior necessary to overcome tree oleoresin defences  <cit> . the aggregation pheromone system involves male- and female-produced components as well as synergistic effects of host monoterpenes  <cit> . three important pheromone components are trans-verbenol hept-3-en-2-ol], exo-brevicomin , and frontalin octane]. trans-verbenol is produced by pioneer females when they attack a new host, serving as an aggregation pheromone that attracts males and other females to the tree. exo-brevicomin is produced by males before they join females in the tree, serving as a synergist to trans-verbenol. production of both trans-verbenol and exo-brevicomin falls later during colonization, at approximately the same time that males produce frontalin, which appears to function as an anti-aggregation or dispersion signal  <cit>  .

understanding the metabolic pathways, their regulation, and the enzymes responsible for creating these chemicals is important in developing potentially targeted management strategies for this devastating forest pest and other destructive dendroctonus spp. including the spruce beetle  and the southern pine beetle . the three chemicals appear to arise via different metabolic pathways: trans-verbenol is likely the cytochrome p450-mediated hydroxylation product of ingested host tree α-pinene  <cit> ; exo-brevicomin is produced from a fatty acyl-derived precursor  <cit> ; and frontalin is synthesized de novo via the mevalonate pathway  <cit> . while common enzymes synthesizing their precursors are relatively easily identified, those creating the final pheromone components are more difficult to recognize.

fortunately, advances in genomic and proteomic technologies allow creation of sequence and/or gene expression databases to investigate economically important but genetically inconvenient "non-model" species. for example, functional genomics studies of the pine engraver beetle, ips pini   <cit> , assisted the identification of important pheromone-biosynthetic genes that otherwise would have been difficult to discover  <cit>  and led to subsequent understanding of their regulation and biochemical roles . similarly, a recent effort to characterize the proteome of d. frontalis pronota catalogued differences between males and females that may lead to new control measures  <cit> . we wished to create functional genomics tools for d. ponderosae to facilitate the development of new strategies to mitigate its economic impact. we produced ests representing over  <dig>  tentative unique genes, and used custom oligonucleotide arrays to study their regulation in eleven different biological states. we have used these data to make preliminary identification of putative pheromone-biosynthetic genes. furthermore, the ests and microarrays are resources for forest insect researchers working to understand bark beetles.

RESULTS
ests
two cdna libraries, "mpb" and "dpg," were prepared in pdonr <dig> . the mpb library includes cdnas from midguts and fat bodies of juvenile hormone  iii-treated and acetone-treated  insects because of the known role for jh iii in stimulating pheromone biosynthesis in the coleoptera  <cit> , while the insects used for the dpg library were fed or unfed, but not stimulated with applied hormone and thus can be expected to have more normal biological expression patterns. the mpb library was constructed from  <dig>  μg poly+rna, yielding a primary titre of  <dig>  ×  <dig> colony forming units . the average insert size, not including flanking vector sequences, was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb. the dpg library was constructed from  <dig>  μg poly+rna, yielding a primary titre of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu and an average insert size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kb. in total,  <dig>  and  <dig>   templates were sequenced from the mpb and dpg libraries respectively, yielding  <dig>  total ests that passed the sequencer's quality control threshold . the average read length for both libraries was  <dig> nt.

further cleansing with egassembler  <cit>  removed  <dig> additional ests. the remaining  <dig>  ests were masked to remove vector and repeat sequences and clustered with cap <dig> to yield  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets representing  <dig>  tentative unique genes . of these,  <dig>  returned at least one hit when compared against genbank nr using blastx and an e-value minimum cutoff of 10- <dig>  the ests and assembled contigs have been deposited in genbank  and , respectively.

the nine contigs with the highest number of ests represent either sugar-digesting enzymes or orthologs of a bark beetle-specific gene cluster, ipg001b01/ipg001d <dig>  identified in a previous est survey of ips pini midguts   <cit> . the abundance of sugar-degrading sequences reflects the midgut's digestive role and is consistent with est surveys of other phytophagous beetles including i. pini  <cit> , phaedon cochlearidae  <cit> , and chrysomela tremulae  <cit> . the orthologs to i. pini ipg001b1/001d <dig>  named here dpod12- <dig>  and dpod12- <dig> , have essentially no sequence identity  beyond a well-conserved n-terminal signal peptide, and lack the highly charged c-terminal tails of the i. pini proteins . however, all orthologs have four perfectly-conserved cysteines  and are predicted to have >95% α-helical structure . dpod12- <dig> and dpod12- <dig>  which showed essentially stable, constitutively high expression in all samples based on microarray data , apparently contributed ~ <dig> % of recovered mrna, as indicated by their portion of total ests, making them among the most highly-expressed genes sequenced. this is a much smaller though still significant fraction of the total than the ~35% observed for the i. pini orthologs  <cit> . the apparent difference in transcript abundance between species may reflect either a true difference in relative abundance, dilution of the midgut transcriptome by fat body mrnas, or both. the highly-conserved secondary structures of these orthologs suggest conserved functions, which have not yet been determined.

representatives of other midgut-associated transcripts were sequenced, including those implicated in peritrophic membrane maintenance , proteolysis  and defence . genes expressed in the fat body in other insects were also represented, including putative vitellogenin , putative ferritin , and putative ommochrome-binding protein . gene ontology and enzyme number annotations show that a broad range of molecular functions were represented, with a preponderance of tugs involved in catalysis or binding . the distribution is consistent with other samples of midgut transcriptomes  and is evidence that a broad spectrum of the midgut/fat body transcriptome was sampled.

microarrays
a major goal of this study was to combine sequence and microarray expression data to help identify pheromone biosynthetic and potential resin detoxification genes. to this end, we chose  <dig> biological states that spanned the beetle's life history and pheromone component profile  to query custom oligonucleotide microarrays representing the  <dig>  tugs. four biological replicate pools were generated for each of the  <dig> states. visual inspection of all  <dig> hybridizations showed no gross spatial variation due to fibers or bubbles. the normalized distributions of expression values for all  <dig> arrays were very similar, with no apparent outlying arrays. digestion curves suggested that trends in rna degradation between 5' and 3' ends of each probe set were very similar. thus we concluded that the quality of the arrays and the rna used to query them was high. the array data have been deposited in ncbi .

to validate the array data, nine genes including mostly p450s and mevalonate pathway genes  were chosen for quantitative  rt-pcr  amplification of first strand cdna prepared from the same biological states used for microarray hybridizations. linear regression of  <dig> pairs of qrt-pcr and microarray data showed an overall correlation coefficient of  <dig>   . thus, there was a statistically significant strong to moderate correlation of qrt-pcr data with the microarray data, confirming that microarray values reliably indicate expression information.

clustering
genes active in the terminal steps of ipsdienol biosynthesis in i. pini share three common expression characteristics: they are induced in pheromone-biosynthetic tissues by juvenile hormone, their basal expression levels are higher in males than in females, and they are coordinately regulated with mevalonate pathway genes that function earlier in the pathway  <cit> . combining these data allowed the identification of previously unknown pheromone-biosynthetic genes, including the dual-function geranyldiphosphate synthase/myrcene synthase  <cit> , myrcene hydroxylase  <cit> , and a novel oxidoreductase . therefore, we clustered the current microarray data to assist in the identification of d. ponderosae pheromone-biosynthetic genes.

hierarchical clustering yielded  <dig> clusters of between  <dig> and  <dig> tugs  with at least  <dig>  average pairwise correlation amongst cluster member expression profiles across the  <dig> biological states . visual inspection suggested that many clusters contained features with relatively stable expression across all treatment groups. several clusters involved genes that were either up- or down-regulated in pupae  compared to other stages, consistent with the dramatic change in gene regulation, dietary intake, and metamorphosis occurring in developing pupae. several clusters of genes that were either up- or down-regulated by feeding  were also apparent, as can be expected for midgut and fat body tissues that must respond to dietary status.

putative pheromone-biosynthetic genes
exo-brevicomin is thought to arise from a fatty-acyl precursor  <cit> , implying that fatty acid-biosynthetic  mrnas should be elevated in unfed males. fatty acid-metabolizing genes , acp transferase, β-ketoacyl acp reductase, desaturases, acetyl-coa synthetase, enoyl hydratase, etc.) did not appear to be coordinately regulated or have uniformly higher basal expression levels in males compared to females . similarly, mevalonate pathway genes  synthase , hmgr, mevalonate kinase, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, isopentenyl diphosphate  isomerase, etc.) necessary for de novo frontalin production  <cit>  were not clearly coordinately regulated . there are various potential explanations for the apparent lack of coordinate gene regulation. the amount of frontalin recovered from volatile extracts of d. ponderosae  is much lower than that of ipsdienol from i. pini , so if the change of gene expression correlates with the amount of pheromone component, the induction may be too small to detect on microarrays.

alternatively, the pheromone-biosynthetic pathway may be loosely coordinated. in i. pini, early pheromone-biosynthetic pathway genes have relatively lower basal expression levels and are much more strongly induced by jh iii than genes functioning near the terminal steps, which have higher basal expression levels but are not as strongly induced  <cit> . thus, genes for mevalonate or lipid-metabolizing pathways may not necessarily be closely coordinated. furthermore, the microarrays were queried with rna combined from midguts and fat bodies, so expression changes in one tissue may be masked by those of the other. in fact, mevalonate gene expression patterns appeared quite different in midguts and fat bodies . hmgr and hmgs mrna levels rise in female blattella germanica fat bodies upon egg production  <cit> , and a similar increase in mated female d. ponderosae may mask stable expression levels in midguts. any combination of these scenarios is also possible. it is also possible that some pheromone-biosynthetic genes may have been missed due to the relatively small est sample size.

the considerations noted above support the assertion by keeling et al.  <cit>  that microarray data alone are not reliable indicators of a gene's potential role. while the relatively small est sample size confers a risk that some pheromone-biosynthetic genes were missed, the available data were still useful for preliminary identification of pheromone-biosynthetic genes, particularly those involved in later steps. for example, exo-brevicomin biosynthesis requires the fatty acyl-derived precursor, -6-nonen-2-one, to be epoxidized to  <dig> -epoxynonan-2-one, a reaction that is likely catalyzed by a cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> . one cluster of three genes with a "male-enriched" expression profile contains a cytochrome p <dig> , a putative dehydrogenase, and an unknown protein . further qrt-pcr analyses indicate that the p <dig> gene has expression characteristics consistent with exo-brevicomin biosynthesis, suggesting that it may carry out the epoxidation step, while the dehydrogenase has characteristics implying a role in fatty-acyl-coa metabolism upstream of epoxidation . similarly, frontalin biosynthesis requires carbon to be shunted from the mevalonate pathway either by gpps   <cit> , or by a dioxygenase active on gpp or longer-chain isoprenoids, or by another, as yet unknown pathway. one gene, represented by contig <dig>  has a best blastx hit to geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  and an expression profile congruent with hmgr and hmgs  and with frontalin production: it is induced by feeding, with most of the mrna localizing to the midgut , where frontalin is produced  <cit> . while the expression profile is consistent with one expected of a putative gpps, the activity of this enzyme must be determined. the lack of sequence similarity between this gene and i. pini gpps may perhaps reflect both broad evolutionary divergence and potentially different enzyme activities. i. pini gpps also functions as myrcene synthase  <cit> , an activity that one would not expect in d. ponderosae because myrcene is not a predicted intermediate in frontalin biosynthesis. both cyp6cr <dig>  and contig <dig>  are current subjects of post-genomic experiments to confirm their functions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated est and microarray tools for d. ponderosae. the ests and microarray data will be useful for researchers working to develop control strategies for this important pest insect. the microarray data suggest genes encoding enzymes in early steps of metabolic pathways implicated in pheromone component biosynthesis are not clearly coordinately regulated. however, candidate enzymes catalyzing late steps of exo-brevicomin and frontalin biosynthesis were identified, and are subjects of ongoing post-genomic research.
