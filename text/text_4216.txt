BACKGROUND
around 40% of the world's population is at risk from malaria. current widespread parasite drug resistance and insect pesticide resistance call for urgent development of new control tools, including malaria vaccines. rationale vaccine development is challenged by the complexity of the life cycle and the large number of potential vaccine targets  <cit> . the search for genetic evidence of diversifying selection has been proposed as a strategy to identify major targets of protective immunity  <cit> . several antigens under putative immune selection have been uncovered this way  <cit> , including the n-terminal polymorphic domain of the merozoite surface protein- <dig> , called msp <dig> block <dig>  <cit> .

msp1-block <dig> shows extensive allelic polymorphism, with over  <dig> variants identified worldwide, grouped into three families or types and one recombinant type  <cit> . in parasite populations from africa and southeast asia, pfmsp <dig> block <dig> showed a low inter-population variance, with a very low fst value, suggesting strong balancing selection to maintain family types within each population  <cit> . in agreement with this, in vitro inhibition of p. falciparum cultures by monoclonal antibodies reacting with msp <dig> block <dig> was family-specific  <cit> . studies in humans exposed to malaria showed that antibodies to msp <dig> block <dig> were family-specific   <cit> . the same was observed in mice immunised with recombinant proteins derived from reference alleles from each family  <cit> . importantly, presence of antibodies to recombinant proteins of the k1- and mad <dig> types was negatively associated with clinical malaria in prospective studies in gambian  <cit>  and ghanaian children  <cit> . in contrast, levels of anti-msp <dig> block <dig> igg were positively associated with an increased risk of subsequent reinfection and/or a lower ability to control parasitaemia in older individuals in mali  <cit> . thus, the involvement of antibodies to msp <dig> block <dig> in parasite control and protection is still unclear.

the k <dig> and mad <dig> msp <dig> block  <dig> families are characterised by the presence of central three amino acids repeats. the various k1- and mad20-type block <dig> alleles differ in the number, sequence and relative arrangement of tripeptide repeats and in point mutation polymorphism of the flanking regions. the non-repetitive ro <dig> alleles only differ by point mutations  <cit> . the fourth family type called mr, which has been identified recently, results from recombination between the mad <dig> and ro <dig> families  <cit> . within each msp <dig> block <dig> family, multiple sequence variants have been described.

analysis of antibody responses in humans living in endemic areas using up to four full length recombinant proteins per family alongside recombinant sub-domains such as repeats only or flanking regions expressed in escherichia coli  <cit>  showed family-specific responses, with no inter-family cross-reactivity. antibodies to specific sub-types within each family were observed as well  <cit> , and their prevalence varied with malaria transmission conditions  <cit> . monitoring of the antigenic consequences of sequence variation at the single epitope level was done using arrays of synthetic peptides  <cit> . interestingly, this showed that sera from mice immunised with a full length recombinant protein reacted with peptides derived from the immunising allele but not with any of its sequence variants  <cit> . sequence-dependent specificity of individual epitopes was similarly outlined using monoclonal antibodies  <cit> . in african populations exposed to p. falciparum, the response to msp <dig> block <dig>  assessed using synthetic sequence variants displayed a restricted specificity  <cit> .

the antibody response to msp1-block <dig> correlated with pcr typing of the parasites present at the time of plasma collection in some settings  <cit> , weakly in some others  <cit>  and not in others  <cit> . in senegal, fine specificity of the antibodies to msp <dig> block <dig> did not match with the infecting type and moreover was fixed over time, with no novel antibody specificity acquired upon cumulated exposure to multiple infections  <cit> . interpretation of these studies has been limited insofar as molecular sequence data and sequence-specific serological responses were not gathered from the same population/setting  <cit> , or sequence data were generated without exploring the immune response  <cit>  or alternatively, immunological responses were studied without detailed knowledge of the actual sequence polymorphism of the local population  <cit> . thus, whether the acquired antibodies to msp <dig> block <dig> select for parasites presenting novel sequence variants and exert a significant diversifying selection at the epitope level remains to be studied.

we set out to address this question and analysed pfmsp <dig> block <dig> sequence polymorphism and sequence-specific antibody responses using archived samples collected in dielmo, a senegalese rural setting. we have analysed sequence polymorphism of the locus over a  <dig> year period to gain a view of its overall polymorphism and possible temporal evolution. we have explored the humoral response of the villagers to msp <dig> block <dig> using synthetic peptides displaying numerous sequence variants. serological studies have included a cross-sectional study to measure point prevalence at the village level before a rainy season, a prospective study to explore the relationship between the presence of antibodies to msp <dig> block <dig> at enrolment and protection from clinical malaria episodes during the following five months of intense transmission, and longitudinal follow up of individuals to study temporal antibody variation. this showed evidence for family-specific responses possibly exerting a balancing selection, but gave no support to the notion of antibody selection for variant sequence alleles.

RESULTS
pfmsp <dig> block <dig> pcr genotyping: distribution of allelic families
a total of  <dig> samples were successfully genotyped by semi-nested pcr. overall  <dig> pcr fragments were generated . there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> fragments assigned to the k <dig>  mad <dig> and ro <dig> allelic families, respectively. based on fragment size polymorphism,  <dig> and  <dig> k1-type and mad20-type alleles could be identified . all ro <dig> fragments were of the same size. the family frequencies were 47%, 28% and 25% for k <dig>  mad <dig> and ro <dig>  respectively. the relative proportion of the three allelic families  did not show significant temporal fluctuations , was not influenced by age , gender , β-globin type , abo blood group  or rhesus blood group .

many samples contained more than one pfmsp <dig> block <dig> type. the average multiplicity of infection estimated from the number of fragments detected  was  <dig>  pfmsp <dig> block <dig> fragments/sample. this figure does most probably not reflect the actual number of distinct clones present in the patient, as distinct pfmsp <dig> block <dig> alleles yet of similar size are not taken into account and as parasites with identical pfmsp <dig> block <dig> alleles may differ in multiple other loci across their genome.

the number of pfmsp <dig> block <dig> fragments detected was influenced by age  ; it was highest in the 2- <dig> y and 6- <dig> y old children and lowest in the ≥  <dig> y old. it was not associated with gender , β-globin type , abo or rhesus blood group  or with year of study .

analysis of infection rates by individual allelic families
one or more k1-type and mad-type  <dig> alleles were detected in 73% and 44% of the samples, respectively, while the ro <dig> family was observed in 43% of the patients. for each of the three families, the infection rate was not associated with gender , β-globin type , abo blood group  and rhesus blood groups . seasonality did, however, have an influence . the infection rates of k1-types were higher and those of mad20-types lower in the november-january period  than in february-may  or june-october  . the ro33-type infection rates tended to be lower in february-may compared to the two other periods .

pfmsp <dig> sequences
direct sequencing generated high quality sequences on both strands for  <dig> fragments. the  <dig> sequences obtained accounted for 58% , 62% , and 94%  of the amplified k <dig>  mad <dig> and ro <dig> fragments, respectively, with a fair temporal distribution of sequenced fragments .

there was a large nucleotide sequence diversity, with a total of  <dig> alleles. in addition to the k <dig>  mad  <dig> and ro <dig> families, the fourth mr hybrid family identified recently  <cit> , was observed . the six ro33-type alleles  differed only by point mutations. in addition to the previously reported g97d polymorphism  <cit>   four novel positions were dimorphic . the k <dig> family presented the highest diversity, with  <dig> distinct k <dig> alleles . sequencing of  <dig> fragments assessed by nested pcr to the mad <dig> resulted in identifying only  <dig> distinct mad20-type alleles  and nine hybrid types .

codes for k1- and mad20-types tripeptide repeats together with the nucleotide sequence are as proposed in  <cit> . sequence of the k1-type alleles are grouped as mentioned in the text based on the 5' di-motif and the presence of motif  <dig> and  <dig>  sequence of the mad20-type alleles are grouped as mentioned in the text based on the 5' motifs.

the k1- mad20- and hybrid-types mainly differed in copy number and arrangement of sequence motifs called in the literature "tripeptide motifs", while presenting no or minimal polymorphism of the flanking family-specific sequence. five distinct tripeptide motifs were observed in the k <dig> types. in addition to the known sgt, sgp, saq and sga motifs , a novel motif was observed , which encodes the svt tripeptide sequence displayed so far only by mad <dig> types. motif  <dig> presented a typical k1-type signature, with agt coding for ser, as opposed to a tca/g codon in the mad <dig> types. all k1-type alleles contained more than one motif sequence, resulting in eleven di-motif combinations . most alleles had three or four different motifs . some di-motifs were very frequent and motif  <dig>  <dig> was present in all alleles . a clear dichotomy could be delineated based on the first 5' di-motif being either  <dig>  <dig>  or  <dig>  <dig>  . limited polymorphism was observed in the 3' family-specific region, with a non-synonymous s to l  mutation, observed in three alleles, and a six amino acid insertion, sppada, observed in a single allele .

similar findings were observed for the mad <dig> types alleles, which differed mainly in the number, arrangement and coding sequence of six tripeptide motifs . there were two synonymous sequences coding for sgg  such that all mad20-type alleles contained an sgg-encoding motif . in this family too, all alleles contained more than one motif sequence. the majority had four distinct nucleotide sequence motifs , encoding three different tripeptide sequences . some di-motifs were highly represented, with the sva sgg motif  being present in virtually all alleles. there was a dichotomy within the family based on the first 5' motif, being either 5/ <dig>  or  <dig>  . this group-specific 5' end was followed by a variable copy number and arrangement of six di-motif sequences, which at the protein level translated into variable combinations of the sgg and sva tripeptides. all mad20-type block <dig> repeats except two  terminated with the  sequence. the flanking non repeated region upstream from the tripeptide motifs was identical in all alleles. downstream from the repeats, a  <dig> amino acid deletion  was observed in three alleles, but otherwise the family-specific region was monomorphic.

sequencing showed that  <dig> fragments assigned to the mad <dig> family by semi-nested pcr were indeed mad20/ro <dig>  hybrids. we are confident that these alleles are bona fide hybrids and not artifactual pcr products, as they have been observed in  <dig> of  <dig> samples where a ro <dig> allele could not be detected using multiple family-specific nested pcr reactions. moreover,  <dig> of  <dig> samples where the mr allele was detected by sequencing were monoinfections . this mr hybrid family was quite diverse as eight alleles were observed. allele dmr <dig> had a group <dig> type mad <dig> while alleles dmr 2- <dig> derived from mad <dig> group  <dig>  all dmr alleles carried the same 25-residue long, ro33-type downstream region, which interestingly was a rd <dig> allelic type with a g97d d104n double mutation . a novel hybrid, dmrk, displayed a ro33-k <dig> hybrid sequence in the family-specific 3' region  .

the large local diversity was associated with a large number of low frequency alleles in the k <dig> and mad20/mr family types, contrasting with the ro <dig> family where a dominant rd <dig> allele was observed in 78%  of the sequenced ro33-types alleles . at the population level , rd <dig> was by far the most frequent allele, accounting for 27% of the sequenced samples  and  <dig> % of all alleles within the village when adjusted for relative family frequency estimated by nested pcr genotyping . the second most frequent allele after adjusting for family frequency was dk <dig> . most alleles  presented a less than 1% frequency in the population sample studied here. in terms of frequency, the largest contribution among the top  <dig> alleles came from the ro <dig> family.

sequence comparison of dielmo alleles with the ro33-, k1-, mad20-, and mr-types alleles deposited in the database , , , , respectively, showed that only  <dig> of the  <dig> alleles from dielmo were identical to reported sequences from other endemic settings, namely k1-types , two mad20-types , two ro- <dig> types  and one mr allele  . interestingly, only four of the top  <dig> alleles have been reported elsewhere in the world, , suggesting local diversification of the parasite population.

tests for neutrality
to gain some insight into a possible positive selection on this locus regarding the level  and the type of selection operating, ewens-watterson-slatkin tests for neutrality  <cit>  were conducted. at the family level, i.e. grouping alleles by family type considering three families irrespective of size or sequence polymorphism, this showed a significant departure from neutrality on a yearly basis and when grouping all years together, i.e. for a  <dig> year period . thus, there was evidence for balancing selection at the family level in this setting, the observed homozygosity being lower than expected .

ewens-watterson tests by individual year during the 1990- <dig> decade and for all years of the decade grouped together . in the top table, tests were based on family frequency distribution. three families were considered: k <dig>  mad20/hybrids and ro <dig>  the second part shows the results of the ewens-watterson tests within each family with alleles identified by size polymorphism only or both size and sequence polymorphism. for the ro <dig> family no size polymorphism was observed.

f: homozygosity. n: sample size. na: not available.

we then considered the within family diversity of the k <dig>  mad20/hybrids  and ro <dig> alleles separately to look for evidence of selection within each family . tests were performed for each year separately or for the  <dig> year period. alleles were differentiated by either size polymorphism or both size and sequence polymorphism. overall, the null hypothesis was not rejected, implying that there was no evidence for significant within-family balancing selection on the pfmsp <dig> block <dig> locus. the results of these ewens-watterson-slatkin tests need to be interpreted with caution though. these tests are based on the assumption that no recurrent mutation has occurred at the locus studied. since the mutation rate is known to be high in minisatellite/repetitive sequences, this assumption may be violated. in other words, one cannot exclude that recurrent mutations may have occurred and in turn have artificially reduced our power to detect balancing selection acting at the intra-family level.

within the  <dig> ro <dig> pcr fragments sampled there was no size polymorphism and six different allele sequences were identified. an alignment of  <dig> nucleotides for all  <dig> alleles contained five polymorphic sites, all of which were non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms. this indicates that dn/ds is infinite. nucleotide diversity  was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  to examine the possibility of natural selection acting on the ro <dig> family, tajima's d and fu and li's d* and f* were calculated  <cit> . in view of the high number of segregating sites , these tests are expected to show high statistical power for natural selection. no evidence for departure from neutrality was obtained, with non significant tajima's d value, fu and li's d* and f* values , thus confirming results obtained using the ewens-watterson test.

sequence diversity is shown in the upper half of the table with the nucleotide sequence on the left and the amino acid sequence in single letter code on the right. n: number of isolates.

the lower half of the table shows the sequence diversity tests by year and all years combined 

n: number of samples; h: number of haplotypes; s: number of segregating sites; ss: number of singleton sites; π: average nucleotide diversity. tajima's and fu and li's tests were implemented by the dnasp version  <dig> software, and validated by fisher's exact tests.

anti-msp <dig> block <dig> antibody prevalence and specificity
the sequence-specific antibody response was studied by elisa using biotinylated msp <dig> block2-derived peptides bound to streptavidin-coated plates that overall represented a fair coverage of the sequence diversity observed in the village . we recorded as seropositive any individual reacting with one or more peptide. seroprevalence was analysed at the village level using an archived cross-sectional study conducted at the beginning of the  <dig> rainy season, to which 85% of the villagers had contributed. we recorded as seropositive any individual reacting with one or more peptide. overall, seroprevalence was 25% . seroprevalence increased with age and reached  <dig> % in adults . confirming previous observations in this setting  <cit> , all anti-block <dig> iggs were exclusively igg <dig> . no anti-block <dig> igm was detected.

the 15-mer peptide sequence is represented in single letter code, and the location of the peptide in the region is indicated. pools contained equimolar amounts of four to six biotinylated peptides .

the frequency of recognition of each allelic family mirrored the frequency distribution of the family types within the parasite population . the antibody reaction was family-specific and usually restricted to one family, with 73%, 23% and only 4% of the positive plasma reacting with one, two and three allelic families, respectively , consistent with our previous survey in this village  <cit> . figure 7c shows that antibody response to pools  <dig> and  <dig>  derived from the adjacent block  <dig> domain and block  <dig> respectively, was rare. no immunodominant region was identified within block <dig>  antibodies to the repeats were detected alongside antibodies to the family-specific n- or c-terminus block <dig> sequences. interestingly, when scrutinizing the response at the individual peptide level in the context of the allelic sequence diversity within this village, it was clear that antibodies reacted with motifs displayed by the vast majority of the alleles observed in the village, namely either frequent/universal di-motifs  or family-specific unique sequences. indeed,  <dig> of  <dig> villagers with antibodies to k1-type peptides reacted with sequences present in  <dig> or more of the  <dig> observed k <dig> alleles. similarly,  <dig> of  <dig> responders to mad20-type peptides reacted to sequences present in  <dig> or more of the  <dig> observed alleles.

in addition to the family-specific antibodies, some villagers had sequence-variant specific antibodies, namely reacted with only one of sibling peptides while others reacted with multiple sibling peptides displaying sequence variants. for example, within the group of sibling peptides derived from the n-terminus of mad <dig> block <dig> , some villagers reacted with one peptide , whilst others reacted with two , but none reacted with all five peptides. likewise for the group of sibling peptides derived from the k <dig> block1/block <dig> junction , some villagers reacted with one , two  or all three peptides. this suggests that sequence variation indeed translates into antigenic polymorphism. whether antibody reaction with multiple sequence variants reflects serologic cross-reaction or accumulation of distinct antibody specificities is unclear.

antibodies to msp <dig> block <dig> and subsequent clinical malaria
to look for a putative association between the presence of anti-msp <dig> block <dig> antibodies and protection against clinical malaria during the subsequent high transmission season, we mined the database for the occurrence of clinical attacks within the 5-month period following the  <dig> cross-sectional blood sampling studied above. the  <dig> individuals experienced a total of  <dig> clinical malaria attacks . the number of clinical malaria attacks experienced per individual varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . recordings of the entomological inoculation rate indicated a mean of  <dig> infected bites/person during this time period. twenty-nine percent of the seronegative individuals  experienced a clinical attack during that period, compared with 15% of individuals with anti-block <dig> antibodies. using a poisson regression model, the crude estimates of the incidence rate ratio  of malaria attacks associated with the presence of antibodies to one allelic family or ≥  <dig> families  were  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively . in a multivariate poisson regression analysis, this association was independent of haemoglobin type or ethnic group. however, it was confounded by age, i.e. within the age groups, there was no significant association between the incidence of clinical malaria attacks and the number of msp <dig> block <dig> allelic families recognized.

analysis of the response during a high transmission season
to study the impact of novel infections during the transmission season on the humoral response to msp <dig> block <dig>  we investigated the fingerprick blood samples collected from  <dig> seropositive individuals throughout the high transmission season.

by the end of december  <dig>  namely five months after the cross-sectional sampling, the anti-msp <dig> block <dig> antibody level was reduced by ≥ 2-fold in  <dig> subjects , had varied less than 2-fold in  <dig> individuals   and was ≥ 2-fold higher in one individual . importantly, when a change was observed, it concerned the intensity of the reaction but not its specificity. in other words, responding individuals usually reacted with the same pool and within the pool with the same individual peptide before and after the transmission season. in none of the studied individuals were novel antibody specificities stably acquired during that time period, despite an elevated infection rate.

we then carried out a follow up of the antibody responses in villagers who experienced clinical malaria during the 5-month transmission season, using archived fingerprick sera collected monthly, and when available, sera on the day of the clinical malaria episode. transient fluctuations were observed, with in some cases boosting of a pre-existing response , in others a decrease in antibodies  or evidence of a short-lived response . this was also observed in children experiencing multiple clinical episodes during that same time period . in nine out of  <dig> subjects in whom peripheral blood parasites collected at diagnosis of the clinical malaria episode were genotyped, the three allelic families were detected, and one individual harboured only  <dig> allelic families. in all  <dig> cases, infection with an allele against which there was no evidenced pre-existing response did not elicit any long lasting novel antibody specificity.

long term temporal analysis of the response to msp1-block2
to analyse antibody patterns over several years, we used archived systematic blood samples collected during the longitudinal survey. confirming a previous study in this village  <cit> , once acquired, the response to msp1-block <dig> was essentially fixed over time. a typical example is shown in figure  <dig>  where a 6-year follow-up was carried out on child 01/ <dig>  starting at  <dig> months of age. the child had been exposed to a mean of  <dig> infected bites each year over the six years. a single peptide pool was recognised by this child from the age of  <dig>  years onwards . the intensity of the signal fluctuated subsequently, including a drop during malaria attacks , but nevertheless there was a progressive increase with cumulated exposure. analysis of fine specificity on the individual constituents of peptide pool  <dig> showed the same pattern for all positive samples collected from this child with recognition of peptides #  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  namely of the k1-specific block1-block <dig> junction . the occurrence of clinical malaria episodes in this child resulted in temporarily reduced signals , but was not associated with stable acquisition of any novel specificity.

discussion
this first detailed longitudinal survey of pfmsp <dig> block <dig> sequence polymorphism along with the assessment of the specific humoral response within a single endemic setting provides novel insights on the locus at the population level and on the possible selective forces underpinning such a polymorphism. a very large local polymorphism was detected, mainly due to microsatellite type variation, resulting in a very large number of low frequency alleles. numerous novel alleles were identified here, including novel mr alleles, illustrating the value of in depth analysis of local polymorphism. the humoral response of the villagers, as deduced from the reaction with a series of 15-mer peptides, displayed features that illuminate its possible role in selection for diversity. the relative distribution of the family-specific antibody responses mirrored the relative distribution of the family types at the parasite population level. seroprevalence was moderate. responses were usually limited to a single family and frequently directed to family-specific sequences present in most of the alleles from that family circulating in the village. this is consistent with a frequency-dependent selection operating at the family level. however, the serological analysis did not outline frequent occurrence of immune responses possibly selecting for sequence variants within that family. it confirmed and expanded on previous observations in this setting  <cit>  of an essentially fixed antibody specificity, despite intense exposure to a very large number of allelic types. overall, the data point to a possibly antibody-driven diversifying selection maintaining balanced family types within the population, as proposed by other groups  <cit>  but do not support the commonly accepted notion that the families accumulate mutations that allow the parasite to circumvent the host's capacity to build up an efficient immune response selecting for sequence variants.

the study design used here differs from previous studies in combining assessment of actual sequence polymorphism with analysis of sequence-specific immune response rather than combining pcr fragment size polymorphism with assessment of antibody responses using recombinant antigens  <cit> . no significant temporal fluctuations of the relative distribution of the allelic families was found over the 10-year period investigated, consistent with longitudinal studies in the gambia using monoclonal antibody serotyping  <cit> , and in vietnam using pcr-based genotying  <cit> , differing in this regard from studies conducted in brazil  <cit> . the family distribution obtained here for symptomatic, high density infections was superimposable with the distribution observed in previous cross-sectional surveys of asymptomatic infections  <cit>  . sequencing showed a very large number of low frequency genetic variants, along with one dominant allele  and few intermediate frequency alleles . only  <dig> out of  <dig> alleles were detected at a frequency above 1%. the level of polymorphism of the non repeated r <dig> family was similar to the level observed in the same setting for pfmsp <dig>  in however a much smaller  sample size  <cit> . tests for neutrality did not show a significant departure from neutrality, for the repeated domains of the k1-, mad20- and mr- types and for the repeatless ro <dig> family. the tajima's test for ro <dig> is consistent with selectively neutral mutations  <cit> . testing the repetitive sequences for selection is difficult, since the mutational and evolutionary processes underlying their diversification are not clearly understood. the ewens-watterson   <cit>  test is based on the idea that, under neutrality, the observed number of alleles should be consistent with the observed gene diversity. because of their particular mutation patterns and rates, neutral microsatellites tend to show naturally more alleles than expected from their observed gene diversity  <cit> . this phenomenon could artificially reduce the effect of balancing selection on allele distribution and as such reduce our ability to detect it. however, the effect of repeated mutations on the distribution of alleles is most of the time rather small and occurs mainly when the observed gene diversity is low which is not the case for msp <dig> repeat domains  <cit> . hence, if a strong balancing selection is acting on the msp <dig> repetitive sequences, we should still be able to detect it. furthermore, the reported evidence for diversifying selection on the pfmsp <dig> block <dig> locus  <cit>  included the analysis of such repeat-related polymorphisms. when considering fragment size polymorphism, there was no evidence of departure from neutrality either, contrasting with a recent report from kenya  <cit> , where a different parasite population sampling strategy was used. the  <dig> samples successfully genotyped here originated from  <dig> different villagers  over a decade, whereas the  <dig> samples analysed in kenya were collected by repeated sampling from  <dig> infants during a 4y period  <cit> . such repeated sampling from the same sub-group may have biased the analysis of population polymorphism, in particular as successive clinical malaria attacks experienced by a child are each caused by "novel" parasite genotypes  <cit> .

to assess the consequence of sequence diversity on antigenicity, and in the search for evidence of antibody-driven diversifying selection, we opted here for the use of synthetic peptides encompassing a large number of sequence variants, rather than using recombinant proteins expressing an entire msp <dig> block <dig> domain, which exposes multiple antigenic determinants. whereas recombinant proteins allow to study family cross-reactivity, recognition at the single epitope level is best monitored using synthetic peptides. individual msp <dig> epitopes are displayed by short peptidic sequences, which are recognised by monoclonal antibodies  <cit>  and human sera  <cit> . use of synthetic peptides may result in underrepresenting certain epitopes, including conformational epitopes, and hence in underestimating the overall seroprevalence to the locus. however, interestingly this assessment using synthetic peptides outlined a strikingly similar relative distribution of family genotypes and family-specific antibodies in dielmo, consistent with observations in other settings monitoring immune responses using recombinant proteins  <cit> .

the humoral response of the dielmo villagers suggested a family-specific selection pressure rather than an antibody-mediated selection for sequence variants. seroprevalence increased with age, but the number of peptides recognised was unrelated to age. most individuals had antibodies to one family only, and within that family, polymorphic sites as well as common repeat motifs and the more conserved family-specific sequences were recognised. importantly, antibody specificity remained essentially fixed over time. confirming previous observations in this setting  <cit> , the long term longitudinal follow up showed that cumulated exposure to an increasing number of pfmsp <dig> block <dig> alleles was usually not associated with stable acquisition of antibody specificities to additional sequence variants. analysis of anti-msp <dig> block <dig> responses during a transmission season showed that some individuals experiencing a high density clinical episode had their pre-existing responses boosted, while antibodies were transiently undetectable in other patients. in some cases, novel specificities were acquired only transiently, since they were rarely detected a few weeks after the episode and undetected in subsequent longitudinal samplings, where a steady state, essentially stable specificity profile was consistently observed. the response pattern to msp <dig> block <dig> markedly differs from the progressively enlarging antibody repertoire to erythrocyte surface variant antigens . this rather stable steady state specificity profile is highly reminiscent of clonal imprinting. it may reflect particular constraints on the response or stimulation by chronic asymptomatic carriage and/or novel infections, quite frequent in such a holoendemic setting. clonal imprinting of responses to another p. falciparum merozoite surface antigen displaying variable repeats, namely msp <dig> has been suggested in some studies  <cit> , but was not supported by studies on pfmsp1block <dig> responses in a hypoendemic sudanese setting  <cit> . the best evidence in favour of clonal imprinting in malaria parasites stems from studies on cellular responses to peptide variants of the cs protein  <cit> .

studies conducted in other african settings, using recombinant proteins, have outlined several features that are consistent with the observations we made in dielmo: i) a moderate seroprevalence to msp <dig> block <dig> that increases with age  <cit> , ii) recognition of a single family by a large proportion of responders  <cit> , iii) family-specific and sub-type specific responses  <cit>  along with recognition of conserved family-specific flanking domains  <cit> ; iv) transient acquisition antibody specificity or loss of pre-existing response during a malaria attack  <cit> . thus in other african settings as well, the msp <dig> block2-specific humoral response is unlikely to exert a significant selection favouring the outgrowth of parasites presenting mutant epitopes. this does not rule out a selection by cellular immune effectors, which has not been assessed here. this deserves a detailed study, since sequence variation of the block1-block <dig> junction has been shown to influence cellular responses  <cit> .

confirming studies in other areas  <cit> , the antibodies to one or more msp <dig> block <dig> allelic families were prospectively associated with protection against subsequent clinical attacks. however, multivariate analysis showed this association to be confounded by age, and as such difficult to distinguish from concomitant acquisition by dielmo villagers of other responses involved in protection. protection against clinical malaria has been indeed associated with an array of antigens in various endemic settings, including the antigenic variant pfemp <dig> exposed onto the infected red blood cell surface  <cit> , msp1- <dig>  <cit> , r <dig>  <cit> , msp <dig>  <cit> .

apart from the ro <dig> types, the large sequence polymorphism observed in dielmo was essentially of microsatellite type. variations within the k <dig>  mad <dig> and mr families mainly focused on the second and third codon of the tripeptide repeats, involving, furthermore, a restricted set of amino acid residues. as noted by others  <cit> , fragment length did not adequately describe the local genetic diversity. based on size polymorphism,  <dig> alleles were identified, but  <dig> alleles were identified by sequence analysis. all six ro <dig> alleles had the same size. some size bins used to group alleles from other families turned out to group a large number of distinct sequences  .

sequence analysis identified numerous novel alleles and specific motif arrangements, with  <dig> of the  <dig> pfmsp <dig> block <dig> allele sequences observed in dielmo being novel. the ro <dig> types displayed novel point mutation polymorphisms. compared to the reported sequences, the k <dig> alleles from dielmo were more diverse , with more frequent usage of motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  and with a novel k1-type motif encoding the svt tripeptide . the mad <dig> types were longer , used a restricted set of codons and particular motifs, with a higher occurrence of sgg-encoding motifs, more frequent use of motif  <dig> and fewer motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  the mr family accounted for up to  <dig> % of all pfmsp <dig> block <dig> alleles from dielmo, a lower frequency than the 28-29% observed in a kenyan holoendemic setting  <cit> . we could not identify any epidemiological parameter associated with the presence of mr alleles: there was no association with age, gender, abo or rhesus blood group. interestingly, like the other three families, mr alleles from dielmo presented specific characteristics. all harboured a rd5-type ro <dig> moiety, differing from most mr alleles with a worldwide distribution  <cit> . furthermore, dmr <dig> displayed a novel mr subtype with a  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> motif  instead of a  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> motif . in addition, a novel hybrid with a 3' ro33/k <dig> hybrid sequence was observed. whether this dmrk allele was generated by insertion of a sppada-encoding dna segment within a mr allele , or whether this element was inserted within rd <dig> before recombination with a mad <dig> allele is unclear. insertion of the sppada-encoding segment within any allele of the ro <dig> family has never been reported, but was observed within the k1-type in this study  and in other settings  <cit> . observation of a single ro <dig> progenitor together with a single mad <dig> progenitor led takala et al  <cit>  to propose that the mr family arose from a single recombination event. the present data rather suggest that several separate recombination events involving distinct ro33-types and mad20-types progenitors have contributed to the generation of this hybrid family.

the characteristic of the pfmsp <dig> block <dig> allelic repertoire in dielmo is in line with the epidemiological conditions prevailing in the village. unlike the surroundings where transmission is moderate and highly seasonal, transmission in dielmo is perennial and intense  <cit> . therefore, local transmission largely dominates over the import of alleles from the neighbouring area during the 9- <dig> months of the dry season. as such, dielmo constitutes a transmission area where a high level of genetic diversity can be maintained. detailed analysis of parasite population structuring and expansion in this setting awaits study of additional genetic loci. transmission in the village occurs throughout the year, albeit with marked seasonal fluctuation in entomological inoculation rates and vector species  <cit> . the seasonal pattern of family distribution may reflect different fitness/survival rates associated with different allelic families under different transmission conditions and/or for different anopheline vector species. additional studies are needed to explore this hypothesis further.

previous studies have surveyed sequence polymorphism across large geographic areas or with a small sample size in a single setting, and as such did not capture the micro-geographic features observed here in a single setting. better understanding at micro-geographic level is essential to analyse immune responses in the context of the parasite population to which people are exposed. this is critical importance to interpret selective forces on parasite population, and to design rationale control measures accordingly.

CONCLUSIONS
the pfmsp <dig> block <dig> locus presents a population sequence diversity larger than we could anticipate from published studies. a very large local polymorphism was detected, mainly of microsatellite type. the humoral response observed here using synthetic peptides was consistent with a frequency-dependent selection operating at the family level. however, there was no evidence for major humoral selection for sequence variants. in contrast, antibody specificity remained fixed over time, despite exposure to novel allelic forms. such a lack of stable acquisition of novel antibody specificities in response to novel infecting types is reminiscent of clonal imprinting. the locus appears under antibody-mediated diversifying selection in a variable environment that maintains a balance between the various family types without selecting for sequence variant allelic forms. at the family level, intra-family sequence diversity is consistent with a neutral evolution and with the observed characteristics of the antibody response. finally, the data reported here do not confirm the association of the acquired humoral response to msp <dig> block  <dig> with protection against subsequent clinical p. falciparum malaria attacks.
