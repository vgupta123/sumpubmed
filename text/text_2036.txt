BACKGROUND
bac transgenesis has many important applications in basic and applied biomedical research, from the analysis of regulatory elements controlling gene expression to creating animal models of human diseases  <cit> . because bacs can hold genomic segments as large as  <dig> kb, they are invaluable for the analysis of distant cis-regulatory elements  <cit> , rescue of mutant phenotypes and regulated expression of human disease-related genes in mice  <cit> . a number of bacs encoding fluorescent reporters have been created by 'recombineering' in bacteria to visualize specific tissues or cell types in vivo  <cit> .

bac transgenesis has been carried out by microinjection of naked dna into the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs in zebrafish  <cit>  or oocyte pronucleus in mice  <cit> . with these methods, integration of the bac in the genome occurs at best in ~5-20% of the injected survivors in mice  <cit>  and ~1-3% in zebrafish  <cit> . a recent extensive study showed that about half of bac transgenic mice carried  <dig> to  <dig> copies of the injected bac as concatamers at one genomic locus, and the rest carried more than  <dig> copies, and up to  <dig> copies, arranged in various orientations  <cit> . concatameric transgenes may be associated with silencing, instability, and genetic lesions both inside and around the transgenes  <cit>  that seriously limit important experimental applications  <cit> . for example, cre-mediated recombination between two loxp sites  <cit>  placed at defined positions within a bac can be used to delete precisely a candidate regulatory element, or to remove a cassette for conditional expression, and such applications may be facilitated by single copy integrations.

to deliver single-copy bac transgenes to the genome, several methods including retroviral transfection into embryonic stem  cells  <cit> , site-specific homologous recombination in es cells  <cit>  and intracytoplasmic sperm injection  <cit>  have been developed. while these methods are useful, they involve laborious handling of es cells or freeze-thawing of sperm, and are not suitable to model organisms without established es cell lines. thus, simpler and more versatile methods for bac transgenesis are still desired.

one potentially versatile approach for single-copy bac transgenesis is to introduce bacs into the genome via dna-type transposons. however, to date, no transposon has been reported to have the cargo capacity to carry such large dna inserts as a bac clone. the medaka fish tol <dig> element is a dna-type transposon that is active in a wide variety of vertebrate animals  <cit> . it has been shown that  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp from the left and right ends of tol <dig>  respectively, are cis-sequences essential for transposition, and tol <dig> constructs that carried ~ <dig> kb dna inserts between them can transpose efficiently via a reliable cut-and-paste mechanism  <cit> . here we demonstrate that tol <dig> can carry a bac clone and describe the first application of any transposon to bac transgenesis in two major model organisms, zebrafish  and mice .

RESULTS
to test whether tol <dig> can carry a bac, we used a bac clone isolated from pufferfish  that harbored ~ <dig> kb genomic dna containing the hoxaa cluster  and the evx <dig> gene  <cit> . we inserted gal4ff  in frame with the second exon of evx <dig> by galk-mediated homologous recombination in e. coli  <cit> . it is expected that gal <dig> directs gfp expression in the spinal neurons when the transgenic line is crossed with the uas:gfp reporter fish  <cit> . to introduce the tol <dig> sequence into the bac plasmid, we designed a cassette containing the minimal cis-sequences of tol <dig> in an inverted orientation separated by a ~ <dig> kb spacer, which we termed itol <dig> . the itol <dig> cassette enables incorporation of the tol <dig> cis-sequences essential for transposition into a bac clone through a single step of homologous recombination. the tol2-frevx1:gal4-bac plasmid  contained  <dig> kb dna, including the pufferfish genomic dna and the backbone vector sequence, between the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp end sequences of tol <dig> .

we injected the tol2-bac plasmid and the transposase mrna into the cytoplasm of zebrafish fertilized eggs. in  <dig> of  <dig> injected embryos, the ~ <dig> kb dna flanked by the tol <dig> cis-sequences was excised from the donor plasmid, indicating that the transposase worked on the itol <dig> cassette properly . injected embryos were raised to sexual maturity and mated to homozygous uas:gfp transgenic fish . we found that progeny from  <dig> of  <dig> injected fish showed gfp expression in the nervous system, including a medial population of spinal neurons, which is consistent with evx <dig> expression in chicks and mice  <cit>  . southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of single ecorv bands  containing junction fragments of tol <dig> and genomic dna in these transgenic lines, indicating integration of single copies of the tol2-bac . inverse pcr identified that the tol2-bac was integrated  <dig> kb upstream of the cng <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  or in the intron  <dig> of the ntt <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  and created  <dig> bp duplications at the target site, indicating transposase-mediated integrations. pcr analysis using several sets of primers within the tol2-bac  and southern blot analysis using the internal nhei sites  revealed that no gross structural alterations of the tol2-bac occurred upon integration.

next, we tested whether tol <dig> can carry a bac in mice as well. we injected the tol2-bac plasmid into the pronucleus and cytoplasm or cytoplasm only of oocytes with the transposase mrna . as a control we injected the same dna without transposase mrna.  <dig> of  <dig> mice derived from pronuclear and cytoplasmic co-injection showed the presence of the tol2-bac dna in the tail dna as detected by pcr. in contrast, none of the mice derived from cytoplasmic injections  or control injections  had integrated the tol2-bac dna . the two pcr positive tol2-bac founder mice were raised to sexual maturity and crossed to wild type mice. we analyzed f <dig> offspring by pcr and found that  <dig> of  <dig> f <dig> from founder no. <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> f <dig> from founder no. <dig> carried the tol2-bac transgene . southern blot analysis revealed that the progeny from founder no. <dig> and no. <dig> harbored single insertions at two different loci . we performed inverse pcr and cloned the tol2-bac genomic junction fragments . the 3a insertion from founder no. <dig> was located ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the pomc gene on chromosome  <dig> . in addition, another insertion  was detected in the progeny of founder no. <dig> and mapped to contig aahy <dig>  .  <dig> bp duplications were created at the integration sites, indicating that the integrations were mediated by transposition . we did not examine founder no. <dig> further since the bac integration site could not be mapped . further, we performed pcr analysis using several sets of primers within the tol2-bac and confirmed that no gross structural alterations of the tol2-bac occurred upon integration in 3a and 3b . in addition, we used semi-quantitative pcr with bac-specific primers to obtain an alternative estimate of bac copy number. consistent with our southern blot and inverse pcr results, we estimated ~1- <dig> bac copies in both zebrafish and mouse transgenics .

our results demonstrate for the first time that a dna transposable element has an extremely large cargo capacity sufficient for bac transgenesis in two model vertebrates. tol2-mediated bac transgenesis should provide advantages over conventional dna microinjection. first, it can generate single copy integrations that may be analyzed and mapped on the genome relatively easily. second, such integrations may not suffer from problems that have been observed in concatemeric integrations of small linear dna transgenes; i.e., gene silencing, gross rearrangements at the target loci, unwanted mutant phenotypes, etc. third, it ensures integration of dna from end to end without obvious rearrangements inside. all of these features have been observed in transgenesis using transposons with smaller inserts in mice and zebrafish  <cit> . the numbers of transposon insertions transmitted to f <dig> offspring were even lower in our bac transgenic experiments probably because much fewer donor molecules were introduced in the nucleus during injection compared to small transposon constructs. while, to our knowledge, the  <dig> kb dna is the largest insert for any transposon vector, we have also found that the transposase can catalyze transposition of tol <dig> with a  <dig> kb bac . because itol <dig> can be easily introduced into any existing bac clone or bac vector to create new bac libraries, we are continuing further work to extend this method to constructs of larger sizes. while ongoing efforts are aimed at defining the optimal conditions and rate of tol2-mediated bac transgenesis, our current methodology should have immediate applications in comparative genomic analysis of cis-regulatory elements and gene functions in mice and zebrafish. furthermore, it could contribute to development of transposon-based vectors for gene therapy, allowing precise delivery of a number of genes in the same context or of complete chromosomal loci in humans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
transposon-mediated bac transgenesis is a new tool for precise delivery of bacs in both zebrafish and mice. it avoids potential multicopy concatameric integrations, allowing confirmation of the completeness of the bac from end to end, as well as mapping of the genomic integration site. therefore, transposon-mediated bac transgenesis represents a useful complement to conventional bac transgenesis, offering new possibilities in genomics research and beyond.
