BACKGROUND
an intein is a specific insertion within a host protein that is excised during protein maturation, that is, post-translationally  <cit> . this maturation process is termed "protein splicing" and involves precise excision of the internal protein  sequence and ligation of the flanking external protein  sequences to form a peptide bond. the excision of the intein and the subsequent ligation of the flanking host exteins are catalysed by the intein itself  <cit> . the sequence encoding the intein appears as an in-frame insertion within the gene for the host protein. for the sake of simplicity, this intein encoding sequence is also often referred to as an intein.

as well as controlling their own protein splicing, many inteins also include site-specific 'homing' dna endonucleases. these homing endonucleases belong to several distinct families ; the laglidadg type is by far the most common in inteins. related homing endonucleases are found encoded in group i self-splicing introns  <cit> . homing endonucleases can cause a gene conversion event that converts a cell heterozygous for the intein into a homozygote. to initiate this gene conversion, the homing endonuclease, encoded by an intein sequence located at a specific site, recognises a long dna target sequence corresponding to an unoccupied allelic site. the homing endonuclease generates a double strand chromosomal break within the unoccupied target sequence. this break is repaired by the host dna repair machinery using as a template the allele containing the intein gene. this gene conversion results in the replication of the intein gene into a specific site in a previously unoccupied allele. the occupied allele is no longer a target for the homing endonuclease because the target site is split by the insertion  <cit> . thus, inteins are 'selfish' mobile elements that occupy unique, specific sites in the genome. when they are copied into an empty allele, they are still retained by the donor allele. these characteristics make inteins especially effective tools in phylogenetic analysis of such phenomena as horizontal transfer.

it has been hypothesised, using information derived mainly from studies of the vma intein in saccharomyces, that at the population level the 'super-mendelian' replication process caused by the homing endonuclease will increase the frequency of the intein within the gene pool of a sexual species, until eventually the intein may come to fixation  <cit> . the rate of spread through a population will depend upon the host mating system  <cit> . at fixation there will be no remaining unoccupied alleles. intra-specific movement of the intein will no longer occur and selection will no longer operate on the homing endonuclease function. in the absence of selection, the homing endonuclease function of the intein will become inactive through random mutation  <cit> . in agreement with this prediction many yeast vma inteins have been shown to have non-functional homing endonucleases  <cit> . it has been suggested that inteins depend on horizontal transmission to species that do not already contain an intein at a specific site to ensure their long-term survival  <cit>  and retention of active homing endonuclease. this horizontal transfer between species could be initiated by the encoded homing endonuclease. it has been hypothesised  <cit>  that inteins undergo recurrent cycles of  horizontal transmission to new genomes,  fixation in the recipient population by homing,  degeneration of the homing endonuclease gene  due to the absence of target sequences and  eventual loss by deletion of the whole intein.

about 15% of the known inteins lack an endonuclease domain. these minimal protein splicing elements  are probably derived from full-length inteins by deletion. mini-inteins are 130– <dig> amino acids in length with conserved sequence blocks at each end, while 'full-length' inteins  are about 360– <dig> amino acids in length  <cit> . both mutagenesis studies  <cit>  and 3-d crystal structures  <cit>  have indicated that the two functions inherent in a mobile intein are largely separate. thus the endonuclease domain is a discrete region of the intein that has little or no functional or structural overlap with the protein splicing domain  <cit> . mini-inteins can be considered as an extreme example of heg corruption and loss. this loss of homing endonuclease function will prevent interspecific or intraspecific replication by homing, restricting the evolution of mini-inteins and their phylogenetic distribution.

inteins are found in diverse prokaryotes and a few unicellular eukaryotes. until recently, the only eukaryote nuclear gene intein described was the vma intein found in the vacuolar atpase gene of a number of hemiascomycete yeasts such as saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . these inteins all appear in exactly the same site  within the host vma <dig> gene. such inteins are referred to as 'allelic inteins', even though they are from different species . it was analyses of the yeast vma inteins, all of which contain a laglidadg heg, which suggested the possibility of frequent horizontal transfer between species of ascomycete yeasts although the mechanism for such a transfer of nuclear genes is unknown  <cit> . the suggestion was based on the comparison of the intein phylogeny and the host gene .

recently we reported the presence and sequences of a second set of allelic nuclear encoded inteins  in a large number of strains of cryptococcus neoformans and in the related species cryptococcus gattii  <cit> . cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycete fungus capable of causing serious infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent people  <cit> . c. neoformans is divided into two varieties, c. neoformans var. neoformans and c. neoformans var grubii. molecular phylogenetic work indicates that the grubii and neoformans varieties are separated by ~ <dig>  million years of evolution, and these varieties diverged from c. gattii ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> . intein encoding sequences are present in the prp <dig> genes of both c. neoformans varieties and also in c. gattii. these inteins all lack homing endonuclease domains and are thus mini-inteins. the sequence differences of the mini-inteins reflect the relationships among the host species; for example, the variety neoformans and variety grubii mini-inteins are more similar to each other than either is to the inteins of c. gattii  <cit> .

the cryptococcus mini-inteins are encoded within the nuclear gene for prp <dig>  a highly conserved protein central in the formation of the spliceosome, that coordinates multiple processes in spliceosome activation  <cit> . the protein-splicing component of the prp <dig> inteins must remain functional, even after heg corruption and loss, so that the intein can remove itself from the prp <dig> precursor. if the intein is not removed, it is probable that the spliceosome will be non-functional and the fungus will not be able to process introns from messenger rna. the presence of the mini-intein in both varieties of c. neoformans and in c. gattii is consistent with their vertical inheritance from their common ancestor but the original source of the intein in cryptococcus remains unclear. the closest relative of c. neoformans and c. gattii, cryptococcus amylolentus, does not contain a prp <dig> intein, nor does a slightly more distant relative, c. heveanensis  <cit> . the only other member of the tremallales clade known to contain a prp <dig> intein is cryptococcus laurentii, a species relatively distantly related to c. neoformans. the c. laurentii intein is a full-length, heg-containing, intein  <cit> .

we have investigated the distribution of the prp <dig> intein in order to clarify its evolutionary history and, by inference, to better understand the behaviour of inteins in eukaryotes. previously, prp <dig> inteins have been described from four species of cryptococcus  <cit>  and three from filamentous ascomycetes, aspergillus nidulans, aspergillus fumigatus and histoplasma capsulatum  <cit> . in order to understand intein distribution we have screened the genomes of various fungi for prp <dig> inteins. in this work we describe the prp <dig> inteins of paracoccidioides brasiliensis and uncinocarpus reesii of the onygales, botrytis cinerea of the helotiales and inteins from diverse members of the sections fumigati and clavati of the eurotiales. many of these are mini-inteins. this is in contrast to the vma inteins of yeast, all of which are full-length, although many of their encoded endonucleases are no longer active. in three orders of euascomycete fungi the prp <dig> genes have been found to encode inteins with homing endonucleases. within two of these orders we found closely related species that contain mini-inteins. all three orders contain species that do not contain any prp <dig> inteins, often species closely related to intein-carrying species. thus the phylogenetic distribution of these inteins poses some interesting questions. comparing and contrasting the datasets of the fungal prp <dig> and vma inteins clarifies some of these questions.

RESULTS
prp <dig> inteins in ascomycete sequence databases
to examine the distribution of prp <dig> inteins in fungi other than species of cryptococcus we searched the databases of many genome-sequencing projects with the predicted protein sequence of the c. neoformans mini-intein cneprp <dig>  other searches used as query sequences the prp <dig> protein sequences from several fungi. our searches of the publicly available eukaryote sequence databases revealed the presence of putative full-length prp <dig> inteins in the following ascomycete species: aspergillus nidulans, aspergillus fumigatus, paracoccidiodes brasiliensis, three strains of histoplasma capsulatum and botrytis cinerea. we also detected by this means a mini-intein in uncinocarpus reesii, a close relative of coccidioides immitis and coccidioides posadasii. all of these inteins occur at the same site within the prp <dig> gene as the inteins in cryptococcus. the insertions all form part of the open reading frame of the 'host' prp <dig> gene and encode residues at each end that show similarity to the splicing domains of other inteins, especially to the cryptococcus inteins .

the intein encoding sequence in paracoccidioides brasiliensis was represented only by a single, 594bp, est . the first 243bp are predicted to encode the most c-terminal region  of an intein similar to the other, complete, ascomycete prp <dig> inteins.

histoplasma intein encoding sequences can be found on genbank accession aaji <dig>  describing data from a nami strain, wu <dig>  and on contigs describing two strains which are available at the histoplasma capsulatum genome project website  <cit> . the sequence encoding hcaprp8-186ar is found on contig <dig>  from position 26003–27604; hcaprp8-217b is encoded on histo_fe.contig <dig> from position 885924– <dig>  there are  <dig> variable positions and a single codon indel among the three histoplasma inteins. the aspergillus nidulans intein  is described in a third party annotation  referring to the primary data in another accession . the prp <dig> intein of a. fumigatus af <dig> is encoded by the complementary strand of genbank: aahf <dig> . the b. cinerea intein  is encoded on the complementary strand of supercontig_ <dig> , base pairs 22933- <dig> . the mini-intein in uncinocarpus reesii is encoded between positions  <dig> to  <dig> of genbank: aaiw01000130; see also table  <dig> 

detection and sequencing of further prp <dig> inteins in ascomycetes
aspergillus/neosartorya
full-length inteins
we used data from the aspergillus sequence databases to design primers to amplify and sequence prp <dig> inteins from other strains of a. fumigatus  and from a. fumigatus var.ellipticus nrrl <dig> . a. fumigatus var.ellipticus nrrl <dig> is a member of a small group of strains that form a cryptic species clade . in addition, we amplified and sequenced a full-length intein from neosartorya fischeri , a species closely related to a. fumigatus. we also obtained the intein sequence of a. nidulans r <dig> . it is identical to that of the whole genome sequence strain, fgsc_a4; both strains originate from glasgow university. it should be noted that the genus aspergillus is large and diverse, for example a. fumigatus and n. fischeri are much more closely related to each other than either is to aspergillus nidulans  <cit> . n. fischeri  is also known as nrrl <dig> and is now the subject of a genome sequencing project at the institute for genomic research . the intein encoding sequence from a. fumigatus frr <dig>  is identical to that of the fully sequenced strain of a. fumigatus , except for one silent third-codon position change in 2457bp . the intein in a. fumigatus var.ellipticus nrrl <dig> varies from that in a. fumigatus  at  <dig> positions, resulting in four amino acid substitutions in  <dig> residues. the prp <dig> intein of n. fischeri  is 94% identical at the dna level to the a. fumigatus intein. there are three indels of various sizes  that do not include any of the conserved sequence motifs of the splicing or homing endonuclease domains.

mini-inteins
we attempted to amplify prp <dig> intein sequences from other species of aspergillus and neosartorya from the section fumigati  and from more distantly related species using primers complementary to internal intein sequences. these attempts were unsuccessful. in contrast, when we used primers complementary to the prp <dig> regions flanking the intein insertion site we detected pcr products, but these were much shorter than would be expected if a full intein were present. these pcr products were sequenced directly, yielding sequences representing mini-inteins in six species of neosartorya  and in three species of aspergillus   . both n. spinosa and n. glabra are sometimes described as varieties of n. fischeri, but are more distinct from a. fumigatus than is n. fischeri . the taxonomy of both n. glabra and n. spinosa isolates is undergoing revision  <cit> . of these nine species with prp <dig> mini-inteins, all except a. giganteus nrrl  <dig> are members of the section fumigati. a. giganteus is a member of the section clavati  <cit> .n. pseudofischeri frr <dig> is the designation we have given to a strain that was originally described as n. fischeri. our analysis of other sequences derived from this strain  suggests that it is a member of the n. pseudofischeri species. the its sequence of frr <dig> is very closely similar  to that of n. pseudofischeri ; the next best match  is to n. fischeri . n. pseudofischeri has occasionally been isolated as an opportunistic infection  <cit> ; some isolates have been initially identified as a. fumigatus  <cit> .

empty alleles
when using primers complementary to the prp <dig> regions flanking the intein insertion site we detected short pcr products from aspergillus unilateralis , a. clavatus  and four strains of a. lentulus. these pcr products yielded sequence showing 'empty' alleles; that is, there were no prp <dig> inteins present in these strains. a. lentulus is a newly recognised species, originally isolated from patients at the fred hutchinson cancer research center  <cit> .

paracoccidioides
using dna from strain pb <dig> of paracoccidioides brasiliensis  and a combination of primers, some designed to complement regions of the est  that carries a part of a prp <dig> intein and other less specific primers designed to complement regions of the prp <dig> gene, we amplified the whole of the intein-containing prp <dig> region from p. brasiliensis. the predicted protein sequence reveals an intein containing a homing endonuclease domain; the intein sequence and flanking regions are described in genbank accession dq <dig>  the protein sequence of pbrprp <dig> from strain pb <dig> has 53% identity with that of the histoplasma capsulatum intein hcaprp8_217b and 45% identity to the aspergillus nidulans intein aniprp <dig>  in the 72-residue prp <dig> intein region shared by strains pb <dig> and pb <dig> ,  <dig>  are identical.

botrytis
we attempted to amplify a prp <dig> intein encoding sequence from a strain of botrytis cinerea isolated in new zealand. the strain was confirmed as belonging to b. cinerea by amplifying and sequencing the its <dig> and its <dig> regions of the ribosomal gene array . amplification of the region surrounding the prp <dig> intein insertion site, however, showed that this strain does not contain an intein, in contrast to strain b <dig>  from the sequence project.

protein domains encoded by prp <dig> intein sequences
the splicing domains and endonuclease domain of prp <dig> inteins were predicted through comparison with those of the saccharomyces cerevisiae vma intein . we identified the conserved sequence blocks using sequences of known inteins held at inbase  <cit> . there are homing endonuclease domains in the prp <dig> inteins of a. fumigatus, a. nidulans, n. fischeri, h. capsulatum, p. brasiliensis and the genome sequence strain of b. cinerea, but none in prp <dig> inteins of other aspergillus or neosartorya species . the afuprp <dig> inteins  include a large insertion of  <dig> amino acid residues not present in the closely related neosartorya fischeri frr <dig>  this sequence is located immediately after the conserved sequence block b of the splicing domain . it does not show significant sequence or structural similarity to other protein sequences in the databases. the intein in b. cinerea  also contains a substantial insertion in this region . the sequence of the insertion in botrytis shows 58% similarity to the insertion in the a. fumigatus inteins, although it is  <dig> residues longer. other, different, indels occur in this region of the other ascomycete inteins and mini-inteins . it may be that this region is especially tolerant of substantial indels. after this variable region, but prior to the first motif of the homing endonuclease , there is a region  that is relatively well conserved across all of the prp <dig> inteins  and which must presumably be part of the splicing domain. this region does not, however, show similarity to the n <dig> splicing domain motif recognised by pietrokovski  <cit> .

the splicing domains of the prp <dig> inteins , whether from full-length or mini-inteins, are very closely similar to each other. the splicing domains from the ascomycete prp <dig> inteins share more residues with those from the basidiomycete  prp <dig> inteins than they do with the splicing domains of the saccharomycete  vma inteins .

the internal regions of some of the prp <dig> inteins evidently form part of an endonuclease due to their similarity to other homing endonuclease domains such as those in the vma inteins. the homing endonuclease domains of the prp <dig> inteins  are closely similar to each other, although the spacing between the first two highly conserved motifs  is somewhat variable; for example, the distance between motifs c and d in the prp <dig> full-length inteins ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> residues. length variation in this region is also seen in the yeast vma inteins; while in vma inteins with active homing endonucleases this distance is ~ <dig> residues, in inactive vma homing endonucleases there may be as many as ~ <dig> residues.

many of the ascomycete prp <dig> inteins found so far, are mini-inteins apparently without the homing endonuclease domain. the whole of the homing endonuclease domain is absent from all the ascomycete mini-inteins . all of the mini-inteins are of approximately the same length and have no regions with vestiges of homing endonuclease motifs. the alignment of the mini-inteins with the homing endonuclease containing inteins  indicates that the homing endonuclease deletions have occurred at almost the identical site within the ascomycete mini-inteins. the cryptococcus mini-inteins have an internal deletion of a similar length that also covers all the conserved homing endonuclease domains . the presence of numerous mini-inteins in the prp <dig> allelic series contrasts with the vma allelic series of inteins in saccharomycetes, all of which are full-length.

nucleotide changes and ds/dn values of prp <dig> intein encoding sequences
the endonucleases of the yeast vma intein series are frequently non-functional. it is of interest to determine if the newly described prp <dig> heg sequences encode active or inactive homing endonucleases. one way of approaching this question is to compare pairs of sequences and determine the frequencies of synonymous and non-synonymous changes in the hegs of the inteins  <cit> . a large value for ds/dn implies that the encoded peptide is selectively constrained . it should be borne in mind that since prp <dig> is an essential gene, even if the homing endonuclease becomes non-functional, the intein must remain as an orf and must encode functional splicing domains. the heg domain is therefore still subject to weak selection pressure, even if it is inactive .

we analysed the distribution of point mutations in the codons over a concatenated 213bp region of the heg domains; this region encodes the nine residues of motif c and the whole region covering motifs d, e and h of the homing endonuclease . results from analysis of the nine full-length prp <dig> inteins are summarised in table  <dig>  the rate ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions   <cit>  was calculated via the syn-scan website  <cit> . the synonymous to non-synonymous rate provides a sensitive measure of selective pressure on the protein; a  value greater than  <dig>  indicates that selection is operating to minimize the number of amino acid changes and thus retain the activity of the protein.

comparison of the heg regions of closely related fungi gave high ds/dn ratios. for example comparison of the heg region of the a. fumigatus intein with the heg region of its closest relative, n. fischeri, yields a ds/dn value of  <dig> , indicating that the rate of synonymous  change far outweighs the rate of non-synonymous change. it is therefore likely that selection is acting to reduce change in these sequences by eliminating mutant alleles carrying non-synonymous substitutions. this indicates that the heg region of these inteins encodes active endonucleases . comparisons between histoplasma and paracoccidioides gave a ds/dn of  <dig> . even some less closely related pairs gave high ds/dn values, for example the aspergillus nidulans/aspergillus fumigatus ds/dn is  <dig>  and the botrytis cinerea/neosartorya fischeri ds/dn is  <dig> . the calculation of the ds/dn value was not possible for many pairs because the frequency of synonymous substitutions was greater than  <dig> , which makes calculating the jukes-cantor correction unreliable . several comparisons, especially those between the more distantly related species , encountered this limitation. these ds/dn values are entered as na in table  <dig>  however, consideration of the underlying substitution frequencies shows clearly that even these comparisons are reflecting strong selective pressure. for example, in table  <dig>  the comparison of histoplasma  with nfi <dig>  allows a ds/dn value to be calculated, the comparison gives a ps of  <dig> , a pn of  <dig>  and a ds/dn of  <dig> . in contrast, comparison of the other histoplasma intein  with neosartorya fischeri  does not allow a ds/dn value to be calculated; it gives a ps of  <dig>   a pn of  <dig>  and therefore the ds/dn value cannot be calculated. many of the comparisons listed as na in table  <dig> are only just beyond calculation  and are very similar to comparisons that give clear evidence of selective constraint .

in conclusion, ds/dn analysis of the prp <dig> hegs suggests that they are constrained by selection. in addition, the high frequency of synonymous substitutions indicates that these inteins have been diverging for a considerable period of time.

nucleotide changes and ds/dn values of vma intein encoding sequences
it is of interest to compare the nucleotide substitution pattern in the prp <dig> hegs  with a similar analysis of the yeast vma hegs. it has been shown that some of these vma homing endonucleases are inactive  <cit> . the longer a homing endonuclease has been inactive, the more random the pattern of substitutions will be . we have analysed the substitution patterns between vma hegs from  <dig> strains from  <dig> yeast species, using the same heg region used to analyse the prp <dig> homing endonucleases . of these  <dig>  four have been shown to have active homing endonucleases , two homing endonucleases have not had their activity determined experimentally  and the remaining  <dig> homing endonucleases are inactive  <cit> .

comparison of substitution patterns of active vma homing endonucleases gave ds/dn values ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . comparison of substitution patterns of inactive vma homing endonucleases gave ds/dn values from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the vma homing endonuclease from these two species of torulaspora is closely similar to that of z. baillii, a homing endonuclease known to be functional. it is likely that the torulaspora homing endonucleases have only recently become inactive . of the  <dig> comparisons between inactive homing endonucleases,  <dig> give ds/dn values below  <dig>  of the  <dig> comparisons with mixed pairs , there were only  <dig> instances where the ds/dn value was > <dig> . nine of these involved endonucleases from species of torulaspora that are probably only recently inactive.

in summary, the correlation of the ds/dn values and homing endonuclease activity in the vma cohort supports the concept of using ds/dn analyses to predict the activity of the prp <dig> intein homing endonucleases. in other words, the comparison of active homing endonucleases gave high ds/dn values; in contrast comparison of inactive homing endonucleases gave low ds/dn values. the high ds/dn values of the prp <dig> homing endonucleases are strikingly greater than the vma active homing endonuclease values. also, the frequency of synonymous substitutions was less than  <dig>  in all but one vma comparison, that is, the vma system is not saturated by synonymous substitutions. taken at face value this implies that the saccharomycete vma intein allelic group is of more recent origin than the prp <dig> allelic group.

comparison of the nucleotide changes of the vma and prp <dig> intein encoding sequences
the above ds/dn analyses showed numerous comparisons where the jukes-cantor correction could not be calculated because of the high frequency of synonymous substitutions. these comparisons are described as na in table  <dig>  in order to examine the homing endonuclease evolution in a way that includes all the comparisons, we submitted our data to analysis at the snap  site  <cit> . snap calculates rates of nucleotide substitution from a set of codon-aligned nucleotide sequences, based on the method of nei and gojobori  <cit> . the xy-plot function at this site provides an illustration of the cumulative behaviour of the synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions across the coding region, one codon at a time; that is, the average behaviour at each codon is estimated from all the pair-wise comparisons. in the prp <dig> heg region, the synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions accumulate at a similar rate . in the vma heg, non-synonymous substitutions accumulate at almost twice the rate as those in the prp <dig> heg region . this analysis, which is based on the complete data set, supports the individual ds/dn comparisons.

prp <dig> and vma intein substitutions at the asp active sites
to explore the activity of the prp <dig> homing endonucleases further we aligned the active site residues  <cit>  of the homing endonucleases from prp <dig> and yeast vma inteins. as an example, the two aspartic acid residues  are involved in the active site co-ordination of a divalent metal ion, and are critical for activity of the homing endonuclease. these two aspartic acid residues are conserved in the active vma homing endonucleases . the only inactive homing endonucleases to retain both these sites are from the two torulaspora species; these homing endonucleases are closely similar to the active z. baillii homing endonuclease. we believe, therefore, that the torulaspora homing endonucleases have only recently become inactive. of the two vma homing endonucleases whose functionality is unknown, the one from c. glabrata lacks both these critical aspartic acid residues and the d. hansenii homing endonuclease lacks the proximal aspartic acid. the homing endonuclease domains of all of the ascomycete prp <dig> inteins, except pbrprp <dig> and claprp <dig>  have both these critical aspartates, supporting the belief that these homing endonucleases are active.

euascomycete fungi lacking a prp <dig> intein
during our systematic search for further prp <dig> inteins using the public sequence databases , we encountered several instances where there was no prp <dig> intein in close relatives of species known to contain an intein . for example, coccidiodes posadasii and coccidiodes immitis  are very closely related to uncinocarpus reesii , but neither species of coccidioides contains an intein, whereas u. reesii does . in the family sclerotiniaceae, b. cinerea and sclerotinia sclerotiorum are very closely related  <cit>  but there is no prp <dig> intein in s. sclerotiorum . several species of aspergillus are also known not to have a prp <dig> intein  <cit>  and . within the section clavati of the genus aspergillus there are two major clusters of species  <cit> . one cluster includes a. clavatus  and the other includes a. giganteus, which has a prp <dig> mini-intein quite distinct from those present in species from the section fumigati. within the fumigati, only one of the species analysed  was without an intein.

prp <dig> inteins may eventually be found in other isolates of some of these apparently 'intein-less' species. the data in table  <dig> are derived from single isolates of each species and it is possible that species will be found that are polymorphic for the prp <dig> intein.

distribution of prp <dig> inteins
in addition to the sporadic nature of prp <dig> intein distribution within the euascomycetes mentioned above, the wider distribution of the prp <dig> intein is also decidedly sporadic  . the intein is present in species from three orders of euascomycetes  and a very narrow range of basidiomycete species. this would suggest a widespread occurrence and an ancient origin for the intein within the euascomycetes; however most euascomycetes for which there is prp <dig> sequence data available do not have an intein in prp <dig>  there is no intein encoded in the prp <dig> gene of any species from the other major ascomycete class, hemiascomycetes ; for example, candida albicans, candida guilliermondii, eremothecium gossypii, kluyveromyces waltii, saccharomyces cerevisiae. neither of the two archaeascomycetes  for which prp <dig> sequence data are available encodes a prp <dig> intein. in summary, if the prp <dig> intein is descended from a precursor present in the common ancestor of the ascomycota, the loss of the intein must have been a frequent occurrence, either by deletion or by fixation of an empty allele.

the only other prp <dig> inteins are present in four species of cryptococcus . a survey of other cryptococcus species within the tremellales has not yet yielded any further prp <dig> intein sequences but has shown 'empty sites' in eight species, including in c. amylolentus, the most closely related species to c. neoformans and c. gattii  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses
to better understand the sporadic distribution of the prp <dig> inteins we analysed the sequences of the prp <dig> host proteins and prp <dig> intein splicing domains. this analysis should determine if the inteins have a similar phylogeny to that of the prp <dig> proteins  or, alternatively, have discordant phylogenies suggesting horizontal transfer. we chose to concentrate the phylogenetic analysis on the splicing domains for two main reasons. firstly, c. neoformans and c. gattii have prp <dig> mini-inteins, as do several of the euascomycetes. these inteins therefore have splicing domains but no homing endonucleases. secondly, it has been shown that many of the yeast vma homing endonucleases are non-functional and this will influence the rate of substitution and therefore potentially disturb phylogenetic analyses.

the phylogeny of the prp <dig> proteins follows the expected organism phylogeny . the basidiomycete prp <dig> sequences  fall within the fungal group, but are outside those of the ascomycete species. the euascomycete prp <dig> proteins group into their respective orders, all well separated from hemiascomycete prp <dig> proteins. there are no paralogs of the prp <dig> gene present in any genome that might perturb this phylogeny.

further phylogenetic analyses were based on an alignment of the four sequence blocks/motifs of the splicing domains of the fungal inteins. these analyses indicate that the splicing domains of the euascomycete prp <dig> inteins are closely similar to those of the cryptococcus prp <dig> inteins . there is much less variation between the splicing domain sequences of the euascomycete prp <dig> inteins and the splicing domains of the cryptococcus prp <dig> inteins than there is within the splicing domains of the vma inteins found in the single family saccharomycetaceae. the basidiomycete and ascomycete fungi last shared a common ancestor more than  <dig> million years ago, while two of the most diverged vma intein carrying species  diverged approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the close similarity of the basidiomycete and euascomycete prp <dig> inteins does not reflect the length of time since the divergence of their host organisms, and suggests horizontal transfer from a euascomycete to a basidiomycete.

the splicing domains used in this alignment span only  <dig> residues and thus provide insufficient discrimination within the fumigati group of the aspergillus species to determine within-group relationships. inteins carried by species in more taxonomically distant groups are clearly separated however , indicating significant phylogenetic signal is present.

phylogenetic analysis of the prp <dig> homing endonuclease domains was limited to the nine full-length inteins in table  <dig>  the phylogram  indicates an unresolved polytomy, reflecting the highly diverged nature of the homing endonucleases, with the exception of the closely related aspergillus fumigatus/neosartorya fischeri group and the moderately related histoplasma capsulatum/paracoccidioides brasiliensis group. this extensive divergence means that nothing can be concluded from these data about the phylogenetic relationship of the cryptococcus laurentii prp <dig> endonuclease with the euascomycetes. these results fit with the conclusions derived from the synonymous substitution analysis; the prp <dig> intein shows great diversity. the comparable vma phylogram also shows a great deal of diversity in the homing endonuclease domain , however much of this diversity is in inactive endonucleases that would be expected to evolve more quickly.

the prp <dig> and vma heg domains show comparable protein diversity. in contrast, the synonymous substitution frequency has reached saturation in the prp <dig> hegs, while there is much less synonymous substitution present in the vma hegs. these observations taken together suggest that the prp <dig> intein is the more ancient element.

discussion
in the introduction we described a model in which hegs  undergo recurrent cycles of  horizontal transmission to new genomes,  spread and fixation in the recipient population by homing,  degeneration due to the absence of target sequences and  eventual loss  <cit> . this general model could be applied to any heg but the hegs of the vma inteins of the saccharomycetes provided much of the experimental basis for the model. our results allow evaluation of this model in the context of a second group of nuclear inteins. relevant gene distribution models, used to investigate patchy, non-phylogenetic gene distributions, have been the subjects of several studies  <cit> .

full length inteins: active and inactive homing endonucleases
the majority of the homing endonucleases encoded by the vma intein sequences are no longer functional  <cit> . in vitro assays of the activity of the vma intein homing endonucleases have shown that only three are functional  <cit> . the ds/dn values derived from comparisons of these active inteins  are higher on average than the ds/dn values produced when inactive homing endonucleases are compared. as noted by koufopanou and burt  <cit>  the ds/dn value of the splicing domain is strongly positive for the vma inteins, including those with an inactive homing endonuclease. to take one of the extreme examples, our comparison of two species with inactive vma homing endonucleases  gave ds/dn of  <dig>  for the splicing domain and a ds/dn of  <dig>  for the homing endonuclease domain. in other words, when inteins with inactive homing endonucleases are compared the ds/dn value of the  splicing domain is different from that for the inactive homing endonuclease. comparison of the ds/dn value of the splicing domain and homing endonuclease domain of the prp <dig> inteins suggest that both of these domains are constrained . for example, comparison of the histoplasma and paracoccidioides inteins show a ds/dn value of  <dig>  for the splicing domain and a ds/dn value of  <dig>  for the homing endonuclease domain. the euascomycete prp <dig> homing endonucleases almost all contain the two critical aspartate residues of the active site. it is therefore likely that they are active although this clearly requires experimental confirmation.

even though the prp <dig> homing endonucleases appear to be constrained by selection, they are nevertheless quite diverse. this may be attributable, in part, to a long evolutionary separation but it also seems to reflect a relatively relaxed selection as compared to the splicing domain. the diversity of the homing endonucleases is shown by amino acid substitution as illustrated in the phylogenetic tree , but there is also frequent indel occurrence. this diversity makes the homing endonucleases useful sequences for the study of the phylogenetic relationships of intein carrying fungi. many major human pathogens  and plant pathogens  carry inteins with homing endonucleases that, because of their diversity, can facilitate phylogenetic analysis.

mini-inteins: artificial and natural
the vma inteins of the saccharomycetes are all full-length, homing endonuclease-containing inteins. no allelic vma mini-inteins have been reported. chong and xu  <cit>  created artificial, splicing-competent, vma inteins by the deletion of the internal homing endonuclease region  from the s. cerevisiae vma intein. in order for the splicing activity to be restored in these artificial constructs, the 183amino acid residue deletion had to be replaced by a  <dig> or  <dig> amino acid residue 'linker' region. chong and xu  <cit>  suggest that the linker provides sufficient flexibility to allow correct conformation for efficient splicing. this result demonstrates that a single deletion event removing all of the heg is compatible with retaining splicing function .

in contrast to the vma inteins of saccharomycetes and the glt <dig> inteins present in other ascomycetes  <cit> , which are all naturally full-length, the prp <dig> inteins of the basidiomycetes and euascomycetes are found both as mini-inteins and homing endonuclease-containing inteins. we previously reported that the prp <dig> genes of cryptococcus neoformans and c. gattii encode a mini-intein  <cit> . the full-length euascomycete prp <dig> inteins vary in length from  <dig> to  <dig> residues; the mini-inteins, in contrast, are all of very similar length , with only the a. giganteus and cryptococcus mini-inteins being somewhat different in length. we have not detected inteins of an intermediate length or inteins with only remnants of any of the homing endonuclease domains. this raises the interesting questions of why the prp <dig> system should have frequent mini-inteins and also how a full-length intein might be precisely reduced to a mini-intein.

empty alleles and the intein cycle
inteins are often present at highly conserved sites in their host proteins, presumably because such inteins are less likely to be deleted. the model of burt and koufopanou  <cit>  proposes that inteins can be deleted to regenerate target sites and that target sites can be invaded through horizontal transmission. the allelic prp <dig> inteins are present at a highly conserved site in a highly conserved protein that forms an essential part of the spliceosome  <cit> . the elimination of the intein or mini-intein encoding sequence would have to be exact to allow the continued function of the protein encoded by the prp <dig> gene. another aspect of the model is the expectation that the frequency of the heg allele will increase within the gene pool and eventually come to fixation. the model therefore proposes that, if a heg is present in a species, then all members of a species should eventually carry the intein. this is not the case for s. cerevisiae where some members do not have the vma intein , or for candida  guilliermondii where some members of the species do not contain the glt <dig> intein  <cit> . the genome sequencing strain of botrytis cinerea has a full-length prp <dig> intein, while a strain isolated in new zealand has no allelic intein. we are investigating the intein status of other b. cinerea strains. at present it therefore seems true that inteins are not found at fixation in many species, perhaps most species. aspergillus fumigatus may have the intein at fixation but this species seems to be an asexual clone with little polymorphism. the model of burt and koufopanou  <cit>  may require modification for asexual or predominantly asexual species such as a. fumigatus. as pointed out by these authors, the amount of gene flow within  populations and species will determine how rapidly an element such as an intein will come to fixation  <cit> . the vma intein is only capable of homing during meiosis. if this restriction applies to other eukaryote inteins one would expect asexual species to lose their inteins more rapidly than sexual species.

liu and yang  <cit>  indicated that there were no allelic prp <dig> inteins in some species of aspergillus . in this study, we have shown that there is no prp <dig> intein in a. unilateralis . there is no prp <dig> intein in a. clavatus  but there is a prp <dig> intein in a. giganteus . there are numerous other examples where an intein is found in one species but not in a closely related species . determination of the prp <dig> intein status of further euascomycetes related to aspergillus is desirable. vertical inheritance accompanied by multiple events of intein loss may explain the present intein/mini-intein/empty allele distribution.

to determine if an intein is present in a species it is necessary to analyse more than one member of a species . similarly, before concluding that all members of a sexually reproducing fungal species carry an intein  it is necessary to test a significant number of isolates from diverse origins, as suggested by burt and koufopanou  <cit> . this prediction was investigated by okuda et al.  <cit> , who sequenced the vma <dig> gene  from  <dig> strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae. they detected two different groups of vma intein sequence, one group of  <dig> were identical to the intein sequence in strain dh1-1a and the other group of six were identical to the strain x2180-1a. the two groups were 96% identical to each other. a final strain, nky <dig>  did not contain an intein in vma. a further strain of s. cerevisiae, the natural isolate rm11-1a, does not contain an allelic vma intein . it then follows that not all members of the species contained an intein, even though the s. cerevisiae vma homing endonuclease is active.

intein, mini-intein, empty allele polymorphism
it is possible that inteins do not typically come to fixation but rather achieve an equilibrium with their empty targets within the gene pool. for example, it may be that the presence of an intein is not perfectly neutral but confers a very slight selective disadvantage due to the added process of protein splicing or the occurrence of ectopic homing endonuclease cleavage. if inteins exist in equilibrium with empty target sites within a gene pool this would allow continuous selection for homing endonuclease function during extended periods of vertical transmission. if true, this would explain how an active homing endonuclease could be retained during an extended period of vertical transmission. segregation of the empty allele  would also explain the frequent occurrence of species lacking the intein. this modified model may be applicable to the filamentous fungi such as aspergillus fumigatus that, because of their abundant aerial mitotic conidia, have global distributions and therefore very large effective gene pools.

intein phylogeny and horizontal transmission
the only occurrences of an intein in prp <dig> outside the euascomycetes are those found in closely related, pathogenic, varieties of cryptococcus neoformans and c. gattii  and in the occasional pathogen cryptococcus laurentii. the absence of an intein encoded in the prp <dig> gene of species closely related to cryptococcus neoformans and c. gattii poses an interesting puzzle as to the evolutionary origin of the immobile mini-inteins at this site in the cryptococcus prp <dig> protein. if the intein were inherited vertically, it might be expected to be present in all, or at least some, of the other members of the tremellales group, whereas the only other cryptococcus species in which a prp <dig> intein has been detected is cryptococcus laurentii  <cit> . this species contains a full-length homing endonuclease-encoding intein in prp <dig>  c. laurentii is a species from a different cluster of the tremellales group than c. neoformans  <cit> . it might be suggested as a source for the c. neoformans mini-inteins. the intein is absent, however, from all the other tremellales species that have been examined, including another member of the filobasidiella genus . the common ancestor of pathogenic cryptococci may have gained the intein by horizontal transmission of an heg containing intein sequence from another prp <dig> gene. the presence of an allelic, heg containing, intein sequence in the prp <dig> gene of a group of euascomycetes suggests that this euascomycete group is a possible source of the cryptococcus mini-intein.

CONCLUSIONS
our analyses of the prp <dig> intein group have shown many points of difference between prp <dig> inteins and the vma inteins of saccharomycetes. the prp <dig> intein has been found in members of two phyla , while the vma intein of yeast is restricted to several genera in one family, the saccharomycetaceae. many prp <dig> inteins are mini-inteins, whereas no mini inteins have been found in the vma-a site of members of the saccharomycetaceae. most of the vma inteins contain an inactive homing endonuclease. in contrast, the homing endonucleases of the prp <dig> inteins are apparently active . the phylogeny of the euascomycete prp <dig> inteins provides no evidence for horizontal transfer. comparison of the homing endonuclease domains indicates that the level of synonymous change has reached saturation  suggesting that the homing endonucleases have been diverging over a substantial period of evolutionary time. despite this extended period of vertical transmission, the homing endonucleases have apparently remained active. the vma homing endonuclease is not saturated by synonymous substitutions . this implies that the vma intein allelic group is of more recent origin than the prp <dig> allelic group, even though the homing endonuclease amino acid sequences are more divergent than those of the prp <dig> inteins. the extensive divergence in the vma homing endonucleases is attributable to their loss of function.

we submit a modified model for intein evolution that may be more appropriate for inteins present in euascomycete species. we suggest that inteins may not become fixed in a population, but that their presence/absence may be polymorphic in a particular species. this would allow continuous selection for homing endonuclease function during extended periods of vertical transmission. segregation of the empty allele  would also explain the frequent occurrence of closely related species that lack the intein.
