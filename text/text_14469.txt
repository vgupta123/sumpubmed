BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes that have evolved a wide array of metabolic capabilities  <cit> . because of their high photosynthetic efficiency, variety of metabolic pathways, and genetic manipulability, they are a potential source of "green" chemicals and fuels  <cit> . some cyanobacteria reduce atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia to support growth in nitrogen-deficient conditions  <cit> . because nitrogen is often a limiting resource for growth, this gives nitrogen-fixing strains a competitive edge in some environments. understanding the response to nitrogen deprivation, nitrogen fixation, and diazotrophic growth in cyanobacteria will shed light on basic mechanisms of bacterial genetic regulation and physiology. in addition, it may help to develop better strains of cyanobacteria for the production of renewable chemicals and biofuels.

the cyanobacterium anabaena  sp. strain pcc  <dig> grows as long filaments of photosynthetic vegetative cells in the presence of combined nitrogen. in an environment lacking combined nitrogen, about  <dig> to 10% of the cells terminally differentiate into nitrogen-fixing heterocysts. heterocysts provide a microoxic environment for the expression of the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase enzyme  <cit> . single heterocysts are spaced about every 10- <dig> cells along filaments and they supply fixed nitrogen, probably in the form of amino acids, to neighboring vegetative cells  <cit> . vegetative cells provide heterocysts with products of carbon fixation, probably as sucrose  <cit> , thus creating a multicellular organism with two mutually dependent cell types. heterocyst development involves the response of vegetative cells to nitrogen deprivation, the formation and maintenance of the pattern of the two cell types, differentiation of heterocysts from vegetative cells, and the adaptations made by vegetative cells to adjust to diazotrophic growth.

the differentiation of a vegetative cell into a heterocyst involves substantial changes in cell morphology and physiology  <cit> . heterocysts deposit glycolipid and polysaccharide layers outside of their cell wall to limit the entry of atmospheric oxygen  <cit> . they lack photosystem ii activity, which normally produces o <dig>  and increase respiration to consume o <dig> that enters the cell. heterocyst differentiation requires dramatic changes in transcription and some of the key components of this regulation are known. nitrogen limitation is sensed by accumulation of 2-oxoglutarate , the backbone for nitrogen assimilation. 2-og enhances the dna-binding activity of the transcription factor ntca  <cit> , which regulates expression of the response regulator nrra, which is partially responsible for upregulation of hetr  <cit> . hetr, deemed the master regulator of heterocyst development, regulates the expression of many genes, including the glycolipid genes , exopolysaccharide genes , and the pats gene, which encodes a peptide involved in heterocyst pattern formation  <cit> .

factors other than those described above are known to be involved in heterocyst development and have been identified through microarrays and genetic screens  <cit> . while these methods are powerful, microarrays and screens often overlook unannotated regions of the genome and antisense or noncoding transcripts. in addition, they lack sensitivity and do not provide information on utr length or operon structure. therefore, we have employed directional rna-seq to analyze the transcriptome of anabaena filaments during nitrogen step-down to identify and map all transcripts during heterocyst development  <cit> .

our rna-seq data provide information on the utr lengths of each mrna transcript, on the transcription of sense and antisense or noncoding rnas, and on the changes in expression of all transcripts whether or not they carry an annotation. the data show long 5' utrs for many genes, likely with multiple transcriptional start or processing sites. in addition, our study identifies antisense transcription in the coding region or utr of many genes known to be involved in heterocyst development. finally, we detected new genes that are significantly upregulated in response to nitrogen deprivation.

RESULTS
analysis of the transcriptional response to nitrogen step-down
we obtained rna-seq data for total rna isolated from anabaena filaments grown with ammonium as a nitrogen source and at three times after nitrogen step-down from ammonium to dinitrogen in air. the nitrogen step-down produces relatively synchronous induction of heterocyst development. rna-seq data were acquired from filaments at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down, which provides detailed transcriptome data at important stages of heterocyst development . at  <dig> hours, all cells in the filaments are actively growing photosynthetic vegetative cells. at  <dig> hours, the cells have responded to the nitrogen step-down and are expressing early heterocyst differentiation genes such as hetr, the master regulator of heterocyst development, and pats, which is involved in pattern formation. by  <dig> hours, proheterocysts are committed to complete differentiation and are expressing genes required for altering their morphology and physiology to become microoxic. by  <dig> hours, nearly all heterocysts appear fully formed, contain polar cyanophycin granules, and are actively fixing nitrogen.

rna-seq expression data are presented as rpkm, or reads per kilobase  of cds  model per million mapped reads in the sample  <cit> , with the cds model defined as the cds plus  <dig> bp of 5' utr. rpkm values and changes in rpkm value for the chromosome and six plasmids are presented as additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  these data can be examined and filtered in many ways. for example, for genes on the chromosome  with a rpkm value of at least  <dig>  and a fold change of at least  <dig>  there are  <dig> genes with increased expression by  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down,  <dig> genes upregulated by  <dig> hours , and  <dig> genes upregulated by  <dig> hours . for genes on the chromosome with decreased expression, there are  <dig> genes downregulated at  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down,  <dig> genes downregulated at  <dig> hours, and  <dig> genes downregulated at  <dig> hours.

upregulation of nitrogen-fixation genes is the culminating event of heterocyst differentiation. the rna-seq data provide detailed information on the expression of the known nitrogen-fixation genes as well as hypothetical and unknown genes that show the same pattern of regulation. for example, the data show very low levels of reads for nifhdk and other nif operons at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down . the reads for all nif operons and especially for the nifhdk genes are dramatically increased in the  <dig> h sample, when most heterocysts are fully differentiated .

formation of the heterocyst envelope involves deposition of a polysaccharide outer layer followed by deposition of an inner glycolipid layer  <cit> . the rna-seq data show that the genes responsible for heterocyst exopolysaccharide synthesis  were upregulated by  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down . however, strong upregulation of the genes required for heterocyst glycolipid synthesis  did not occur until the 21-hour sample. these data show that during heterocyst morphogenesis, the polysaccharide genes are expressed first, likely depositing the stabilizing exopolysaccharide later; subsequently, hgl genes are expressed to produce the underlying glycolipid envelope layer, which together are required to help create a microoxic environment within the heterocyst.

in addition to identifying single genes that respond to nitrogen deprivation, we mapped gene clusters that were upregulated in response to nitrogen step-down. as expected, the region containing the major nif operons from fdxh -nifb   was strongly upregulated by  <dig> hours in response to nitrogen deprivation . another cluster of genes in the patb -alr <dig> region, which contains the cytochrome oxidase genes coxbac, and many genes annotated as unknown or hypothetical, was strongly upregulated by  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down. genes in the region alr2816-all <dig>  which contains hetc, hetp, and hepa, as well as many genes annotated as encoding hypothetical, glycosyltransferases, and metabolic proteins, were upregulated by  <dig> hours after nitrogen step down. finally, genes in the region alr5340-alr <dig>  which contains several hgl  genes along with a number of hypothetical genes, were upregulated by  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down. each of these regions contains a number of genes and operons that are important for heterocyst development and nitrogen fixation.

identification of unstudied genes regulated in response to nitrogen deprivation
the rna-seq data showed regulation of numerous genes in response to nitrogen step-down; including many that had not been previously identified as nitrogen-responsive in microarrays or genetic experiments. these genes are new candidates for the study of anabaena heterocyst differentiation. we identified several new genes transcribed in response to nitrogen deprivation that have go terms associated with regulation, including transcriptional regulators, two-component regulators, and kinases . these genes may be involved in the regulatory pathways and transcriptional changes responsible for coordinating the expression of proteins required for heterocyst morphogenesis and nitrogen fixation.

1only unstudied genes with at least one-fold read coverage and annotated with the go term "regulatory function" are presented.

2genes that were not identified as being significantly upregulated in previous microarray analyses  <cit> .

3genes that were previously identified as being regulated in microarray data but that show a greater degree of upregulation in our rna-seq data  <cit> .

we also identified many transposase genes that are upregulated by  <dig> hours after nitrogen step-down . transposases are highly similar within a family and rna-seq reads cannot always assign a sequence to a particular transposase locus for transposases within the same family. however, we can see that distinct families of transposons are upregulated in response to nitrogen step-down. table  <dig> shows the average fold change in rpkm during nitrogen step-down for four families of transposons  <cit>  that are upregulated at least 2-fold by  <dig> hours after nitrogen deprivation. it seems likely that transposase genes are turned on as a stress response to nitrogen deprivation.

1the average fold change in rpkm for all members of each transposon family is shown. most rna-seq reads align to multiple members of a highly conserved transposon family; therefore, we cannot report fold change in rpkm for single members of a family. gene members of the is5/is <dig> family are all <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  and alr <dig>  gene members of the is <dig> family are alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig>  all <dig>  asl <dig>  all <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  and alr <dig>  gene members of the is <dig> family are asl <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig>  and alr <dig>  gene members of the isl <dig> family are alr <dig> and alr <dig> 

transcript mapping
unlike previous whole-transcriptome analyses in anabaena, deep sequencing provides information on all transcripts and can help identify 5' and 3' ends and characterize operon structure; however, transcriptional start sites versus processing sites cannot be differentiated with these methods. we used rna-seq to identify distinct 5' ends for many transcripts, characterized by a set of reads with a common 5' end and the absence of upstream reads . these 5' ends often corresponded with published transcriptional start and/or processing sites; for example psbb, petf, nrra, psbai, and nifb, all of which were previously analyzed via primer extension  <cit>  .

however, for other genes such as atp <dig>  and rbcl , the pattern of reads showed evidence for transcripts extending upstream from published 5' ends . for both atp <dig> and rbcl, there is a considerable drop in read coverage at the previously identified 5' end, but there is still significant coverage upstream of these sites. this suggests that the previously identified 5' end may be a processing site or a site of rna secondary structure that affects primer extension results on full-length transcripts, and that some of these transcripts originate at upstream start sites. our analysis of transcript 5' ends suggests that transcription initiation and transcript processing in anabaena is often complex, and that many transcripts have long 5' utrs with unclear transcriptional start sites or processing sites. these "trailing" 5' ends make identification of transcriptional start sites via primer extension or race difficult for some genes, and rna-seq will be the method of choice for mapping transcripts.

the rna-seq data can be used to map transcripts and examine the coordinated expression of genes that form operons. for example, the genes in the nifb-fdxn-nifs-nifu operon showed very low numbers of reads at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours during nitrogen step-down, when proheterocysts have yet to create a microoxic environment for nitrogen fixation . by  <dig> hours, there was a large increase in the number of reads for all four genes, indicating that a single transcript for all four genes originates from a promoter upstream of nifb. the rna-seq data showed a clear 5' end at position - <dig> upstream of the nifb start codon, which validates previously published results  <cit> . further research will be required to fully describe the promoters and operon structure for the entire set of nitrogen fixation genes, which may be unexpectedly complex  <cit> . additional rna-seq data or other types of approaches will be required to clarify transcription in certain regions because of fluctuations in read coverage present in our data set. these fluctuations in reads across orfs and a general increase in coverage around the 5' ends of orfs are consistent with other rna-seq datasets  <cit> . it is likely that rna stability and secondary structure contribute to these fluctuations in coverage.

identification of antisense rnas
the small rna prep protocol maintains information on the direction of transcription by adding different adaptors to the 3' and 5' ends of each rna molecule in the sample prior to cdna synthesis. therefore, we were able to identify antisense rnas in orfs or 5' utrs of annotated genes and also identify transcripts from unannotated regions of the genome . the antisense transcripts would not have been identified with standard microarray or rna deep sequencing methods because these methods do not normally distinguish between sense and antisense transcripts.

our directional rna-seq data showed antisense rnas throughout the anabaena transcriptome . for example, we identified novel antisense transcripts in the 5' ends of key developmental genes such as hetr  and hetc . furthermore, we confirmed the presence of the noncoding rna nsir <dig> in the upstream region of hetf   <cit> , and our directional rna-seq data suggest that the nsir <dig> transcript is antisense to the 5' utr of hetf. other potential noncoding rnas identified by our directional rna-seq data include, for example, antisense reads in the region from alr <dig> to alr <dig> and from alr <dig> to alr0710; and abundant rightward reads between alr <dig> and all <dig>  and leftward reads between alr <dig> and alr <dig> .

*nsir <dig> has been previously characterized  <cit> .

some genes showed striking changes in antisense rnas. for example, nbla, which is involved in degradation of phycobilisome proteins in response to nitrogen deprivation  <cit> , showed extensive antisense reads at  <dig> hours . after nitrogen step-down, the antisense reads decreased as nbla sense reads increased . we hypothesize that it is critical for vegetative cells to avoid expression of even small amounts of nbla protein and that the antisense rna ensures no expression from the nbla gene. the ratio of antisense to sense nbla rna decreases after nitrogen step-down, likely because heterocysts begin to express the coding transcript. future studies will be required to determine if sense and antisense rnas for nbla are differentially expressed in heterocysts and vegetative cells.

antisense transcription within genes involved in heterocyst development  suggests that antisense rnas may be an important mechanism of regulation during the response to combined nitrogen deprivation. future analysis of these noncoding rnas will shed light on the regulation of genes required for heterocyst development and diazotrophic growth.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data confirm directional rna deep sequencing as a more thorough method for analyzing transcriptional regulation in cyanobacteria and indicate that further studies using different environmental conditions and mutant strains will yield novel information about anabaena gene regulation. our rna-seq data can be used to improve gene annotation and map rna ends and operon structure. in addition, directional rna-seq data provide superior information compared to 5' race and primer extension experiments for mapping rna transcripts and identifying potential promoter regions. because we used a strand-specific sequencing protocol, the dataset can be used to identify antisense and other noncoding rnas potentially involved in gene regulation. finally, our work has provided a systems-level view of the anabaena transcriptome during the response to nitrogen step-down. together, these features of the directional rna-seq data can be used to define future directions for studying heterocyst development.
