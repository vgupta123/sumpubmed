BACKGROUND
the true water bugs are grouped as the infraorder nepomorpha, one of seven infraorders within the suborder heteroptera   <cit> . this group is of tremendous economic importance because all the members, except some corixidae, are predators  <cit> . extant water bugs have been grouped into  <dig>  <cit>  or  <dig> superfamilies   <cit> . when molecular sequence data was combined with morphological characters to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of the true water bugs for the first time, a 7-superfamily classification system was proposed, containing a newly erected superfamily aphelocheiroidea, which had formerly belonged to naucoroidea   <cit> .

in these classification systems, the contents of nepoidea, corixoidea, and ochteroidea are constant. phylogenetic relationships proposed previously at the superfamily or family level within nepomorpha are summarized in figure  <dig>  the works of china   <cit> , popov   <cit> , rieger   <cit> , and mahner   <cit>  were based on morphological characters without algorithmic analysis. in their landmark work, hebsgaard et al.  reviewed these studies in detail and analyzed the phylogeny of nepomorpha using molecular sequence data  combined with morphological data for the first time, raising a new superfamily aphelocheiroidea as part of a new phylogenetic hypothesis   <cit> .

until now, the monophyly of each nepomorphan family, and the monophyly of superfamilies nepoidea, corixoidea, and ochteroidea in nepomorpha, have been generally accepted  <cit> . a close relationship between pleidae and helotrephidae has been supported by recent studies  <cit>  and the monophyly of aphelocheiridae + potamocoridae was supported in the latest comprehensive study  <cit> . the phylogenetic relationships within nepomorpha, however, have not reached full agreement. the unsolved problems are: 1) whether the aphelocheiridae and potamocoridae should be members of naucoroidea or be raised as a separate superfamily aphelocheiroidea; 2). whether the pleidae and helotrephidae should be members of notonectoidea or be raised as a separate superfamily pleoidea; 3) the phylogenetic relationships among the superfamilies.

the mitochondrial genome  is one of the largest sets of homologous genes which can be compared across animal taxa and has become an effective data source for resolving deep-level phylogenetic problems  <cit> . within insecta, more than one hundred mt-genomes are available now in genbank/ddbj/embl and mt-genomes have been shown to resolve intraordinal relationships, such as in diptera  <cit> , hymenoptera  <cit> , and orthoptera  <cit> . there are many possible ways of using mt-genomes in phylogenetic analyses, for example by using different genes, amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences. using the nucleotide sequences of all available genes clearly has been shown to be the best way to extract a phylogenetic signal from mt-genomes  <cit> .

previous molecular data used for the analysis of nepomorphan relationships was about  <dig> kb  <cit>  and no mt-genome data are available for any nepomorphan species. in this study, fourteen new mt-genomes were sequenced, nine of them belonging to the infraorder nepomorpha  . a preliminary phylogenetic framework of nepomorpha is proposed using mt-genome data, and the relationships of pleoidea and aphelocheiroidea are analyzed.

RESULTS
general features of the fourteen mt-genomes of hemiptera
ten complete and four nearly complete mt-genomes of hemiptera were sequenced . because of the polynucleotide regions, the control regions of the four incomplete mt-genomes were difficult to sequence. all mt-genomes are similar to the typical insect mt-genomes, containing the commonly found  <dig> genes in the same gene order as observed in drosophila yakuba   <cit> . no gene rearrangement or duplication has been found, indicating that the organizations of the mt-genomes in the suborder heteroptera are more stable than those in the suborder sternorrhyncha   <cit> . family names are used instead of the species names in following discussion for brevity since only a single representative was selected for each family.

ten completely sequenced mt-genomes range in length from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp . lengths of the  <dig> coding genes of each mt-genome range from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp , while the size of the control regions ranges from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp  . variance of the mt-genome size is mainly derived from the control region.

nucleotide compositions of these mt-genomes are at-biased . though the control regions of four mt-genomes were not completely sequenced, this biased trend is obvious even without the control region sequence. interestingly, in most of the completely sequenced mt-genomes, the control regions are not the most at-rich regions , which has been found in other insect mt-genomes  <cit> 

intergenic spacers ranging from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp  were found between trna-ser and nd <dig> in all mt-genomes except fulgoridae. this spacer has also been reported in other insects and some conserved motifs were identified  <cit> . in the present study, no perfectly conserved motif was found but a conserved region was identified . additionally, a unique  <dig> bp intergenic spacer was found between trna-gly and nd <dig> in hydrometridae which lacks significant blast similarity . the exact origin and function of such spacers are unclear, but they may be the vestiges of pseudogenes generated by the gene duplication-random loss process of rearrangement  <cit> 

other features of these mt-genomes, including non-traditional start codons such as ttg of co <dig> in naucoridae and gtg of nd <dig> in aphelocheiridae, incomplete stop codons t or ta, and absence of the dhu arm in the secondary structure of trna-ser, are found commonly in insect mt-genomes  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses
for the fifteen species, there are  <dig> sites in the pcg123rt matrix , plus the whole of the rrna and trna genes),  <dig> sites in the pcg12rt matrix ,  <dig> sites in the pcg <dig> matrix , and  <dig> sites in the pcg <dig> matrix . from bayesian and ml inferences, these four matrices generated eight fully bifurcated trees with similar topology . the monophyletic nepoidea and ochteroidea were consistently recovered. the monophyly of the remaining nepomorphan superfamilies such as pleoidea, corixoidea, notonectoidea, naucoroidea, and aphelocheiroidea could not be analyzed in this study as only a single representative was sampled. in all trees, the relationships within nepomorpha were found to be constant. the pleoidea  was recognized as the sister group of the clade including the infraorders cimicomorpha , leptopodomorpha , pentatomomorpha , and the remaining traditional nepomorpha. nepoidea and ochteroidea were sister groups and this clade was found to be a sister group of notonectoidea  plus naucoroidea .

discussion
mitochondrial genomes
the mt-genomes sequenced in this study are similar to the mt-genomes of other insects and contain very few novel features . it has been reported that the hemipteroid insects  have experienced increased rates of mt-genomic gene rearrangements  <cit> . gene content and gene order of the mt-genomes sequenced in this study, however, are all the same as observed in drosophila yakuba [genbank: nc001322)  <cit>  except for some unique intergenic spacers. in the present study, gene order provides no phylogenetic information.

phylogenetic analyses
mt-genomes provide abundant phylogenetic signal because they possess large sets of homologous genes. multiple genes with increased sequence lengths are favorable for accurate phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . it has been shown that the best way to use mt-genomes in phylogenetic analyses is to combine all the coding genes and use nucleotide sequence data  <cit> . we used a data set consisting of all  <dig> genes  to infer relationships within nepomorpha. the pcg12rt, pcg <dig>  and pcg <dig> data sets were analyzed to test the stability of the phylogenetic hypotheses to the inclusion of different portions of the data. phylogenetic relationships among heteropteran infraorders are still controversial  <cit> . taxon sampling for this study is too limited to analyze this problem in full and data for the infraorders enicocephalomorpha and dipsocoromorpha are not yet available. we focused on the phylogeny within infraorder nepomorpha, especially relationships among superfamilies, using mt-genome sequences for the first time. finally, five of the eight analyses inferred the same topology, with the remaining three tree resulting form less complete datasets  differing at a few nodes, which indicates that the mt-genome is an effective data source for resolving phylogenetic problems within nepomorpha at the superfamily level. because the ml and bayesian algorithms are not sensitive to possible long-branch attraction and allow evolutionary modeling of the data  <cit> , we do not think our hypotheses are artifacts.

the problem of pleoidea
the pleoidea has been proposed to include pleidae and helotrephidae  <cit> . the mt-genome of helotrephidae was not sequenced in this study. this family has been generally accepted as the sister group of pleidae  <cit>  except in the study of china   <cit> .

previous studies based on morphological characters, molecular data or combined data consistently support a monophyletic nepomorpha  <cit> . in this study, however, a monophyletic nepomorpha is supported by one analysis of the eight performed. in all previous studies, pleoidea is the sister group of notonectoidea  <cit>  and has always been included in notonectoidea  <cit> . a surprising, but strongly supported result from the mt-genome analysis was that pleoidea is not part of nepomorpha, but rather the sister group of the clade including nepomorpha, leptopodomorpha, cimicomorpha, and pentatomomorpha .

based on these results we propose that the pleoidea could be raised from a superfamily to the infraorder plemorpha, and that the infraorder nepomorpha consists of the remaining nepomorphans except pleoidea. the phylogenetic position of the infraorder plemorpha within suborder heteroptera needs further study because mt-genome data from infraorders enicocephalomorpha and dipsocoromorpha are unavailable at the present time.

the problem of aphelocheiroidea
the recently proposed superfamily aphelocheiroidea   <cit> , which was considered as part of naucoroidea by other researchers  <cit> , was proposed to be the sister group of a clade consisting of ochteroidea, notonectoidea, and naucoroidea  <cit> . in the present analysis, aphelocheiridae and naucoridae consistently formed a monophyletic clade with high data support . although the mt-genome of potamocoridae was not sequenced in this study, this family has been suggested to be the sister group of aphelocheiridae  <cit> , naucoridae  <cit> , naucoridae + aphelocheiridae  <cit> , a subfamily within naucoridae  <cit> , or unresolved by mahner   <cit> . here we propose that the aphelocheiroidea raised by hebsgaard et al.   <cit>  should be grouped within naucoroidea again.

phylogeny of "nepomorpha"
the traditional infraorder nepomorpha is not monophyletic and it should only contain corixoidea, nepoidea, ochteroidea, notonectoidea, and naucoroidea. the superfamilies nepoidea  and ochteroidea  are monophyletic and sister-groups in all trees with high support, as is generally accepted  <cit> . nepoidea has been considered as the most basal branch of nepomorpha in previous studies  <cit> . the position of ochteroidea varied between previous researchers  <cit> . because of the novel position inferred for pleoidea, the sister-group relationship between pleoidea and notonectoidea which has been consistently proposed  <cit>  was not supported and notonectoidea was inferred to be the sister group of naucoroidea.

the placement of corixoidea is very different from previous hypotheses. traditionally, this superfamily was placed as the sister group of a clade composed of naucoroidea, ochteroidea, and notonectoidea  <cit>  or the sister group of a clade composed of naucoroidea and notonectoidea  <cit> . in our results, corixoidea is always the most basal clade within nepomorpha, with naucoroidea, notonectoidea, ochteroidea, and nepoidea forming a monophyletic group.

furthermore, lycorma delicatula  was removed from the data sets and the phylogeny was re-analyzed with the same methods. same position of pleoidea and phylogenetic hypotheses within nepomorpha could be drawn . finally, the infraorder nepomorpha should consist of five superfamilies with the phylogenetic hypothesis of  + )).

CONCLUSIONS
although previous studies based on morphological characters alone or combined with dna sequence no longer than  <dig> kb confirmed the monophyly of nepomorpha, the phylogenetic inference with the evidence from mitochondrial genomes in this study supports the raise of a separate infraorder plemorpha which belonged to nepomorpha before. the well-resolved nepomorphan phylogenetic relationships at superfamily level allow a better understanding of evolutionary patterns within this group and provide a robust framework for comparative studies of nepomorphans. the present study demonstrates the great effectiveness of mitochondrial genome for inferring phylogenetic relationships at superfamily level. furthermore, this study also suggests the need of using multiple genes for future phylogenetic analyses of highly debated phylogenies.
