BACKGROUND
one of the main issues that floriculture industry has to confront is flower senescence, a term that signifies all those processes that follow physiological maturity and lead to the death of a whole plant, tissue or cell and represents the last stage of flower development. a series of events take place during flower senescence resulting in highly regulated, genetically programmed and developmentally controlled morphological, physiological and biochemical changes. by the end of this process, the flower petals wilt, lose colour and abscise  <cit> .

plants are classified as climacteric or non-climacteric, depending on their ethylene production rate. climacteric flowers such as carnation and petunia are characterized by the climacteric ethylene and respiration rate production that promotes senescence, while treatment with exogenous ethylene results in acceleration of senescence  <cit> . in addition, an inhibitor of prolyl  <dig> hydroxylase activity, pyridine  <dig>  dicarboxylate, suppressed the climacteric ethylene production in cut carnation flowers  <cit> . in contrast to carnation and petunia, the flowers of lilies , gladiolus, tulip , iris and morning glory  are classified as non-climacteric since they are not responsive to ethylene and exogenous application has little or no effect on petal senescence  <cit> . ethylene acts as a trigger to flower senescence in long-lived flowers, possibly as a mechanism to terminate flower life after pollination. in short-lived flowers on the contrary, such a mechanism would not be beneficial since the life of individual flowers is very short  <cit> .

genes that are associated with ethylene sensing and sensitivity have also been found in ethylene insensitive plants such as the two homologues of arabidopsis ethylene receptor ers <dig> which were found in gladiolus  <cit> . over the last years several signalling components have been found to be associated with petal senescence in climacteric species, such as the f-box proteins ebf1/ebf <dig> that recognize and degrade ein <dig> through the ubiquitin/26s proteasome pathway  <cit> . they also interact with ein <dig> to function in the modulation of ethylene signalling  <cit>  as well as with ein <dig>  eil <dig> and ask <dig> which is a component of the scf ubiquitin ligase complex.

in arabidopsis petals,  <dig> tfs showed differential expression patterns of which  <dig> changed expressions only in petal but not in leaf or silique senescence  <cit> . these tfs are members of  <dig> gene families while the three most represented families with up-regulated patterns of expression were the erf, nac and wrky  <cit> .

the ein/eil transcription factors  are targeting genes with an ethylene responsive element in their promoter. they belong to the ap2/erebp-type tfs and are correlated with stress response , ripening and senescence  <cit> . they are also correlated with the effect of sucrose in delaying senescence  <cit> .

in addition to erfs there are other families of tfs associated with senescence such as the wrkys and basic helix loop helix . the wrky tf family constitutes a large family with at least one wrky domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids. they are unique to the plant kingdom and some of its members have a very important role in the regulation of leaf senescence, response of the plant to bacterial infection, signaling pathways and many biotic and abiotic stresses . wrky target genes with a w-box  in their promoter  <cit>  regulating, among others, the expression of senescence associated with related genes  <cit> . members of the wrky family might constitute a hub transcription factor during senescence via mediation of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signaling  <cit> .

the bhlh proteins can be found both in mammals and plants  <cit>  and are known to interact with other proteins and transcription factors such as myb  <cit> . they were also associated with a series of developmental phenomena in the plant, such as the development of root hair and leaf trichomes  <cit> , cell proliferation and cell differentiation  <cit> .

however, little is known about the expression of tfs in petal senescence of ethylene insensitive species. in alstroemeria  <dig> tfs were identified among  <dig> ests  <cit> , while other tfs were identified in daffodil  <cit>  and iris  <cit> , while in morning glory  suppression of a leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinase displayed accelerated petal senescence  <cit> .

recently, there is an increased interest for the ornamental pot plant gardenia jasminoides ellis, since apart from its wide use as a floral plant, it is of high pharmaceutical value considering that contains the substance geniposide that can be transformed into the anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenesis agent genipin . the physical map of gardenia is not available yet, while molecular studies are restricted to discriminate gardenia species for systematic reasons or to study the phytogeography of the wild and commercial populations . gardenia is considered a non-climacteric species with flowers that do not produce detectable levels of ethylene therefore is not included in the list of climacteric flower crops  <cit> . we initiated a study to investigate the petal senescence of cut gardenia flowers at the transcriptome level considering that the visible symptoms of senescence appear within four days. towards this direction we used next generation sequencing technologies, in particular illumina hiseqtm  <dig> for de novo sequencing and characterization of gardenia petals transcriptome at four stages of senescence progression.

RESULTS
the senescence progress of gardenia flowers is completed within four days, therefore it was divided in four developmental stages. the first stage  comprises closed buds ready to open and the second stage  open flowers with the outer whorl of petals at a 90° angle to the flower stalk. at the third developmental stage  the flowers are fully open, while at the fourth stage  the yellow discoloration of petals was initiated as well as the appearance of brown spots . total rna was extracted from each development stage and used for de novo transcriptome sequencing with illumina hiseqtm  <dig> figure  <dig>

cdna sequence generation, de novo assembly and quantification of gene expression
sequencing of the gardenia transcriptome resulted in a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads that were obtained after cleaning the raw data . de novo assembly of these reads resulted in  <dig>  contigs with mean length of 360 nt that generated  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of 796 nt. these were further clustered into  <dig>  clusters and  <dig>  singletons. quantification of gene expression for the four developmental stages of gardenia flower senescence, the uniquely mapped reads for each stage and the corresponding unigenes are shown in additional file  <dig>  the e-value distribution of the top hits in ncbi non-redundant  database, the similarity distribution as well as the species distribution are included in additional file  <dig> 

gene ontology annotation of gardenia transcriptome
the gardenia genes were classified according to the gene ontology annotation in three categories, namely biological process, cellular component and molecular function .figure  <dig> 
gene ontology classification of the total assembled unigenes. the left side and the right side of the panel show the percentage of genes and the number of genes that are classified in the corresponding term, respectively.



in the category “biological process” most genes were associated with “biological regulation”, “cellular process”, “metabolic process”, “regulation of biological process”, “response to stimulus”, “single-organism process” and “signaling”. for the category “cellular component”, the dominant subcategories were those genes associated with “cell” and “cell part”, “membrane”, “organelle” and “organelle part”. in the category “molecular function”, “binding” and “catalytic activity” were the prevailing terms. overall, in the present study, genes that belong to the categories “cellular process”, “metabolic process”, “response to stimulus” , “cell”, “cell part”, “organelle”  and “binding”, “catalytic activity”, “metabolic activity”  were the most highly represented. the above mentioned gene categories were the most highly represented in other transcriptome studies as well, such as in safflower and in chrysanthemum  <cit> .

clusters of orthologus groups  annotation
search against the cog database resulted in the classification of  <dig>  unigenes in  <dig> cog categories. as it can be seen in figure  <dig>  the “general function prediction only” represents the largest group with  <dig>  unigenes followed by “transcription” , “replication, recombination and repair” , “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”  and “signal transduction mechanisms” .figure  <dig>

differentially expressed unigenes
the unigenes that are differentially expressed in pairs of two consecutive stages of senescence progress are shown in table  <dig>  as the gardenia flower develops from closed bud of stage a to early open flower of stage b,  <dig>  unigenes are differentially expressed, of which  <dig>  are down-regulated and  <dig> are up-regulated . among them, there are  <dig>  unique unigenes which are differentially expressed only in these two developmental stages but not in the other consecutive stages . the progression of the partially open into a fully open flower at stage c is characterized by  <dig>  differentially expressed unigenes of which  <dig>  are down-regulated and  <dig> are up-regulated . among them, there are  <dig>  unique, differentially expressed transcripts . the developmental stage d with visible symptoms of senescence in comparison to stage c is characterized by  <dig>  differentially expressed unigenes of which  <dig>  are down-regulated and  <dig>  are up-regulated . among them, there are  <dig>  unique, differentially expressed transcripts .table  <dig>

moreover,  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts are common between the stages a and b and those of b and c . furthermore,  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts are found in stages b and c, and c and d, while  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts are common in the stages a and b, and c and d. the comparison of the consecutive developmental stages resulted in  <dig> common, differentially expressed unigenes. among them,  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated, while  <dig> were down-regulated in all four developmental stages.

as petal senescence progresses, the number of down-regulated unigenes decreases, while that of up-regulated increases only at the stage d of visible symptoms of senescence .

the comparison between stage a and the other developmental stages b, c and d indicates that as senescence progresses, the number of differentially expressed unigenes increases . specifically,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes are differentially expressed between stages a and b, c and d, respectively, indicating significant variation in gene expression profiles among developmental stages.

the functional classification of the differentially expressed unigenes in the four developmental stages was performed as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig>

a total of  <dig>  ssrs were indentified in  <dig>   transcripts of gardenia . among them,  <dig>   transcripts contained more than one ssr, while the largest category of the ssrs was mononucleotides , followed by trinucleotides  and dinucleotides . the a/t  accounted for the  <dig> % of the mononucleotide repeats, the ag/ct  accounted for the  <dig> % of dinucleotides, while the aag/ctt , agg/cct  and aac/ggt  accounted for the  <dig> % of the trinucleotides. a small number of tetranucleotides , pentanucleotides  and hexanucleotide  were also identified.

differentially expressed transcription factors during petal senescence
the  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes that encode tfs within the four developmental stages are shown in figure  <dig>  among them, there are  <dig> tfs with differential expression patterns during progression to stage b. the prevailing family of transcription factors is the “ap2/erebp” family with  <dig> unigenes, followed by the “wrky” transcription factor family with  <dig> unigenes and the “bhlh” tfs with  <dig> unigenes, while there are  <dig> unknown/uncharacterized tfs . additional differentially expressed tfs include the “gata” and “gras” with  <dig> unigenes, the “myb” family with  <dig> unigenes and the “heat shock / stress”, “mads”, “homeobox-leucine zipper”, “lycine-specific dimethylase” and “yabbi” families with  <dig> unigenes.figure  <dig>

as senescence progresses from partial to fully open flower,  <dig> tfs are differentially expressed comprising the “wrky” family with  <dig> unigenes, followed by the “myb” and the “ap2/erebp” family with  <dig>  the “bhlh” tfs with  <dig>  and the “auxin response”, “gata” and “kinesine” with  <dig> unigenes .

there are  <dig> differentially expressed tfs when the symptoms of flower senescence become visible at stage d. the most prevailing tf families include the “wrky” family with  <dig> unigenes, the “bhlh” with  <dig>  the “ap2/erebp” with  <dig> while “auxin response” and “dna binding” comprise  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes, respectively .the clusters a, b, e and h mainly comprise wrky tfs and their expression levels are higher in stage d while the cluster c mainly comprise bhlh tfs and their transcript abundance decreases after stage b . the gras and gata tfs are grouped in cluster d and their expression decreases during senescence progression. ap2/erebp tfs are mainly present in five clusters, b, e, f, g and i showing different patterns of expression. in clusters b and e the expression of the unigenes is higher in stage d, in clusters f and g is higher in the intermediate stages b or c and in cluster i the expression of the unigenes is high at the first stage and then decreases throughout senescence .

kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway mapping
the  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the most abundant pathways were ‘metabolic pathways’ , ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’ , ‘plant-pathogen interaction’ , ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ , ‘spliceosome’ , ‘rna transport’ , ‘endocytosis’  and ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’ . the prevailing categories, based on transcript abundance, between stages a and b were ‘metabolic pathways’, ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’, ‘ribosome’ and ‘plant-pathogen interaction’, while between stages b and c were ‘metabolic pathways’, ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’, ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’, ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ and ‘plant-pathogen interaction’. the prevailing categories between stages c and d included ‘metabolic pathways’, ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’, ‘plant-pathogen interaction’, ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ and ‘starch and sucrose metabolism’, while between the stages a and d included ‘metabolic pathways’, ‘biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’, ‘plant-pathogen interaction’, ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ and ‘ribosome’.

there are  <dig> wrky unigenes which are differentially expressed when the visible symptoms of senescence appeared, while  <dig> among them are unique to this developmental stage indicating specific involvement on the initiation of senescence symptoms. only two wrky and one bhlh unigenes showed a progressive increase and decrease, respectively in expression throughout petal senescence .figure  <dig>

validation of expression of selected unigenes using real time pcr
the patterns of expression of selected unigenes during the four stages of petal senescence were determined by real-time pcr using two reference genes, actin  and pp2a  . two wrky and one bhlh unigenes were up- and down-regulated, respectively throughout senescence showing similar to rnaseq patterns of expression . in addition, the transcript abundance of five differentially expressed wrkys  and three differentially expressed bhlhs  were also determined during senescence. their patterns of expression are similar to those determined using rnaseq indicating that quantification of expression profiles with this technological platform might be considered reliable. moreover, five ethylene sensing components such as ctr <dig>  mpk <dig>  ein <dig> and two erf1/ <dig> were further characterized by quantifying their mrna levels during petal senescence with real-time pcr . each one of the five ethylene signal transduction pathway components showed a distinct pattern of expression confirming the rnaseq analysis .figure  <dig>

discussion
a large scale transcriptome analysis of petal senescence in a non-climacteric species, gardenia jasminoides ellis, was performed. four distinct developmental stages of senescence were analyzed leading to the identification of  <dig>  unigenes which were annotated against known sequences in various databases, whereas differentially expressed unigenes were also identified. the relative transcript levels of  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were further validated by using real time pcr.

annotated unigenes in all databases  comprised  <dig> % of the total number of unigenes, which should be considered adequate taking into account the lack of sequencing data on gardenia species. in other similar studies in other species, such as bamboo and cucumber, the annotated unigenes represented 55% and 72% of the total number of unigenes, respectively  <cit> . the e-value distribution of the top hits in nr database also showed high homology, even in the absence of a reference genome.

the functional classification of gardenia genes according to go annotation identified genes associated to ‘biological process’, ‘cellular component’ and ‘molecular function’ categories. genes annotated to ‘biological process’ were identified during flower development of eustoma grandiflorum  <cit>  and in three genotypes of eichornia paniculata
 <cit> , while those involved in metabolic process were also identified in carnation, snapdragon, alstroemeria, tobacco and arabidopsis  indicating significant metabolic activity during petal senescence progression.

gene categories associated with ‘cellular component’ were also identified during flower senescence of bamboo  <cit>  implicating the “membrane” associated genes to alterations in membrane permeability due to changes in composition and structure of the lipid bilayers  <cit> . gene categories associated with ‘molecular function’ were also found to be highly represented during flower formation and petal senescence in safflower, carnation, orchids and wallflower . search against the cog database that briefly shows the proteomic profile indicated similarities between gardenia petal senescence and dendrocalamus latiflorus flower development  <cit> .

microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  are considered reliable and informative markers in plant research. in this study a total number of  <dig>  ssrs were identified in  <dig>  sequences. the majority of ssrs were mononucleotides followed by trinucleotides and dinucleotide repeats, as is the case in chickpea  <cit> . these ssrs can be used for fingerprinting and breeding efforts within gardenia species.

a large number of genes are differentially expressed among the four different developmental stages of senescence. among them, a plethora of transcription factors such as the wrky, ap2/erebp and bhlh were the most highly represented.

the wrky family comprises the highest number  of differentially expressed unigenes in the final stage of gardenia petal senescence indicating significant involvement in this process compared to the other tf families. no other wrky tfs had been identified up to now in petal senescence of ethylene insensitive species  <cit> . it is of particular interest the fact that there are  <dig>  differentially expressed genes at the initiation of visible symptoms of senescence compared to the open flower stage indicating a significant shift in the expression profiles, which might be coordinated by up-regulated tfs in these two developmental stages. such candidate tfs might be the two wrkys  exhibiting expression profiles of up-regulation throughout petal senescence. these patterns were also confirmed using real time pcr . moreover, another five wrky tfs were shown to be up-regulated mainly at the last stage of senescence progression according to real time pcr analysis. the wrky tfs are well known to be up-regulated during senescence in various organs in arabidopsis, while petal and silique senescence was associated with the expression of more members of this gene family  <cit> . in addition, wrky tfs were also found to be highly abundant during bamboo flower development  <cit> .

in gardenia petals, the bhlh unigenes are expressed in a stage specific manner and the expression pattern is distinct related to the other tfs while only one unigene  is differentially expressed throughout senescence. the expression of this unigene is progressively down-regulated according to rnaseq and real-time pcr analysis . moreover, there are ten differentially expressed unigenes at the stage of visible symptoms of senescence appearance; two were up- and eight were down-regulated . real time pcr analysis confirmed the expression profiles of three of them; two showed an increase in transcript abundance and one a decrease . the bhlh tfs are known to be associated with flower organogenesis, floral development and promotion of the proliferation inside the flower on a tissue-specific way . they are also known to interact with other proteins and tfs such as the myb families  <cit>  which are also differentially expressed throughout gardenia flower senescence .table  <dig>

the spots represent differentially expressed unigenes of the transcription factors wrky and bhlh during the progress of senescence. each spot represents a single unigene while spots with the same colour refer to the same unigene.



although gardenia is a non-climacteric flower,  <dig> ap2/erebp tf unigenes were found to be differentially expressed with  <dig> of them up- and one down-regulated when the visible symptoms of senescence appeared. in addition to these positive tf regulators of ethylene response, other ethylene signaling components seem to be up-regulated in earlier stages of flower senescence such as the ctr <dig> and ebf1/ebf <dig> unigenes, which serve as negative regulators of ethylene response. these results suggest a pattern of expression for ethylene sensing and response genes in which the negative regulators are expressed early in flower senescence, while the positive regulators at later stages in order to possibly accelerate this developmental program.

the expression patterns of these five ethylene sensing components were validated using real time pcr suggesting involvement of ethylene in gardenia petal senescence.

overall, the mrna levels of several genes of interest by rnaseq analysis were further validated by real time pcr analysis indicating the reliability of rnaseq data.

the transcriptome analysis of gardenia petal senescence resulted in the identification of several tfs which might serve as targets for manipulation of their expression using genetic engineering approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
the de novo transcriptome analysis of gardenia jasminoides ellis resulted in the identification and functional classification of differentially expressed unigenes during petal senescence as well as in a large number of ssr markers. the assignment of these unigenes in kegg pathways revealed potential involvement of ethylene sensing components in this developmental program. moreover, differentially expressed transcription factors such as two wrkys and one bhlh were identified showing specific temporal expression patterns which might play the role of senescence progression regulators. their expression patterns as well as of other members of these gene families were further validated using real time pcr approaches. however, further research is required to investigate the specific role of transcription factors in gardenia flowers in order to develop molecular tools for delaying petal senescence.
