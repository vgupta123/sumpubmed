BACKGROUND
cation-chloride cotransporters largely determine the action of gaba during neurogenesis . in immature neurons, na–k–2cl  mediates active cl− uptake, promoting depolarizing gaba action, whereas in adult neurons the cl−-extruding kcc <dig> is generally considered to be involved in generating the hyperpolarizing effect of gaba. mature dorsal root ganglion neurons , however, express high nkcc <dig> levels and maintain high intracellular cl− concentration  with resulting gaba-induced depolarization  <cit> . this property is crucial for presynaptic inhibition of spinal sensory feedback .

a nkcc <dig> downregulation has been observed around birth in different neuronal types of central nervous system   <cit>  as a result of circulating maternal oxytocin . previously, we showed that drgn at embryonic day  <dig>  displayed higher nkcc <dig> activity and higher intracellular i levels than age-matched motor neurons   <cit> . here, we investigated whether drgn also display nkcc <dig> downregulation at fetal stages near term, before increasing again to high expression levels in adult stage  <cit> .

our data show a marked decrease in drgn i at e <dig> and e <dig> compared to e <dig>  decreased activity of nkcc <dig> at e <dig> and e <dig> fully accounts for this reduction in i. a possible role for this transient shift in gabaergic responses in drgn is discussed.

RESULTS
gaba-induced currents were measured in cultured e <dig> and e <dig> drgn. the results were quantitatively compared to data previously obtained in drgn at e <dig>  <cit> .

total membrane capacitance remained stable between e <dig>  <cit>  and e <dig> at 24 ±  <dig> pf , and slightly increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> pf at e <dig> , indicating that most of the cells examined were small drgn   <cit> . based on egaba, i markedly decreased from 44 mm at e <dig> to  <dig> and 29 mm at e <dig> and e <dig>  respectively . in the presence of the selective nkcc <dig> blocker bumetanide , i was significantly reduced to ~20 mm at all stages, indicating that nkcc1-dependent cl− influx significantly dropped between e <dig>  and e <dig> , with no further decrease up to e <dig> .figure  <dig> intracellular  and bumetanide-induced cl− reduction in drgn. the resting i  dropped significantly between e <dig>  and e <dig> , with no further decrease at e <dig> . in the presence of 10 μm bumetanide , a specific blocker of nkcc <dig>  i was decreased to 20 ± 1 mm  at e <dig> and to 18 ± 1 mm  at e <dig> and e <dig>  the bumetanide-insensitive component remained stable at all stages .



changes in nkcc <dig> regulation were further explored by studying i recovery after cl− load and cl− depletion in drgn at e <dig>  applying  <dig>  mm gaba for 5 s at a membrane potential of +70 mv consistently shifted the reversal potential in the positive direction, indicating an increase in i from  <dig> to 43 mm . similar results were previously obtained in e <dig> drgn  <cit>  . following cl− loading, recovery to basal i levels followed a single exponential function with a time constant of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min , which is not different from that previously recorded in e <dig> drgn  <cit>  . applying  <dig>  mm gaba for 5 s at a membrane potential of −100 mv reduced i by only 3 mm  whereas in e <dig> drgn, i dropped by 8 mm. this difference in i reduction between e <dig> and e <dig> drgn during the depletion protocol was significant . following cl− depletion, recovery to the resting i level was also significantly slower in e <dig> drgn   than in e <dig> drgn  . together, these data strongly suggest that nkcc1-related cl− fluxes markedly decreased in small drgn after day e <dig> figure  <dig> cl− load  and depletion  in drgn at fetal stages e <dig> and e <dig>  drgn were held at −40 mv and 500 μm gaba was applied for 1 s every 30 s. cl− load was induced by a 5 s gaba pulse  during a depolarizing step to +70 mv while cl− depletion was induced by applying the same pulse of gaba during a hyperpolarizing step to −100 mv. i
gaba was normalized to the value obtained during the voltage step to + <dig> or −100 mv. the continuous lines show the fit of data during recovery using a single exponential function. recovery time constants after cl− load were  <dig>  and  <dig>  min at e <dig>  and e <dig> , respectively. recovery time constants after cl− depletion amounted to  <dig>  and  <dig>  min at e <dig>  and e <dig> , respectively. insets

it was previously shown that mature and embryonic drgn sustain high i owing to high nkcc <dig> expression  <cit> . here, we show that embryonic drgn undergo a significant downregulation of nkcc <dig> between e <dig> and e <dig> , which significantly affects cl− homeostasis. the resulting overall decrease in i limits the depolarizing action of gaba. notably, i at e <dig> is comparable to the level reported in the postnatal period   <cit>  and possibly in adult drgn  <cit>  implying that the observed drop in i between day e <dig> and e <dig> is only a transient phenomenon. the underlying mechanism most probably involves decreased nkcc <dig> activity rather than lower expression level .

CONCLUSIONS
these data accord with previous observations in other cns neuronal types showing that nkcc <dig> activity is decreased as a result of increasing levels of circulating maternal oxytocin at near term. however, in contrast to other neuronal types, the activity-dependent downregulation of nkcc <dig> in drgn is not permanent but only transient. since we predominantly studied small drgn   <cit>  in which gaba-induced depolarization is essential for sensory perception , we suggest that the transient gabaergic hyperpolarizing shift observed between e <dig> and e <dig> reflects oxytocin-induced fetal adaptation to delivery  <cit> , contributes to fetal analgesia and protects the fetus against neuronal insult.
