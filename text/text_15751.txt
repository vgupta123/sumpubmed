BACKGROUND
plant biomass offers a sustainable, low-carbon-emitting source of biofuel feedstock to potentially alleviate both environmental and economic disadvantages of fossil fuel usage
 <cit> . fossil fuel combustion has resulted in elevated atmospheric co <dig> levels that continue to rise, threatening air quality, wildlife habitat, and human health
 <cit> . a viable, cost-effective alternative is to replace and/or blend gasoline and diesel fuels with biofuel. the efficiency of existing approaches to generating biofuels can be improved through research into plant feedstock attributes, namely biomass yield and recalcitrance to conversion
 <cit> .

plant cell walls are mostly comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. the composition and interaction among these three constituents largely dictate the amenability of a plant feedstock for conversion to simple sugars and then to biofuels. cellulose and hemicellulose are important raw materials, for they are an abundant source of monomeric sugars that can be hydrolyzed by enzymes and fermented by microbes, while lignin cannot
 <cit> . due to the recalcitrance of plant cell walls, a strong acid, heat, or other chemical pretreatment is required to first break up cell wall fibers and access the polysaccharides for enzyme treatment. lignin in particular can impede the pretreatment process by adhering to the hydrolytic enzymes used to saccharify cellulose and other polysaccharides, affecting their ability to work efficiently. additionally, some lignin degradation products can inhibit subsequent fermentation steps by releasing aromatic compounds that inhibit enzymes used for converting sugars to ethanol
 <cit> . saccharification of medicago sativa expressing antisense transcripts designed to silence lignin biosynthesis genes showed an inverse relationship between lignin content and sugar yield, revealing that lignin is indeed a significant obstacle to obtaining high yields of cell wall sugars
 <cit> . consequently, there has been strong interest in the engineering of bioenergy crops, namely grasses, that are more amenable to feedstock conversion, notably by the manipulation of lignin biosynthesis, in order to improve efficiency of the pretreatment process and obtain maximum fuel yield
 <cit> .

lignin is a complex phenolic polymer, and despite its recalcitrant properties, it is important in providing structural support, hydrophobicity, and protection against pathogens
 <cit> . it is comprised of p-hydroxyphenyl , guaiacyl , and syringyl  units derived from the monolignol precursors p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols, respectively. a series of ten enzymes is involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway for monolignol biosynthesis
 <cit> . the eudicot arabidopsis thaliana has served as a valuable tool to understand lignin biosynthesis
 <cit> . however, there are major plant cell wall structural differences between eudicots and grasses including the type and abundance of lignocellulosic components, pectins, and proteins and the linkages between them
 <cit> .

cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase  functions in one of the final steps of monolignol biosynthesis that catalyzes the reduction of cinnamyl aldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol prior to polymerization into the lignin polymer. the highly conserved rossmann fold nadh/nad+ binding domain found in cad monolignol-synthesizing proteins indicates the use of nadph as a cofactor in the reduction reaction
 <cit> . cad tends to exist in multi-gene families with one gene being primarily responsible for lignin biosynthesis. the effect of cad downregulation has been studied using a transgenic approach in several eudicot species including nicotiana tabacum <cit> , m. sativa <cit> , populus sp. <cit>  and eucalyptus camaldulensis <cit> . reports of lignin modification by downregulation of cad in grasses are limited to panicum virgatum <cit> , zea mays <cit> , and festuca arundinacea <cit> . in general, the transgenic downregulation of cad does not affect total lignin content; instead, the inhibition of monolignol biosynthesis leads to changes in lignin composition, such as incorporation of accumulated aldehyde precursors or novel units into the lignin polymer, changes that make biomass more digestible
 <cit> .

caffeic acid o-methyltransferase  is an o-methyltransferase that tends to be broad in substrate affinity and can potentially act in various branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway. the highly conserved s-adenosyl methionine  binding domain in comt proteins indicates the use of sam as the methyl group donor to the hydroxyl group of a methyl acceptor molecule
 <cit> . comt is involved in the methylation of caffeic acid to ferulic acid, which is then hydroxylated at position five by ferulate-5-hydroxylase. the subsequent methylation by comt at this position yields sinapic acid. similarly, comt catalyzes the 3-o-methylation of caffeal- and coniferal- aldehyde/alcohol precursors to g and s lignin
 <cit> . in brachypodium distachyon, comt has high affinity for a variety of substrates including flavonoid compounds, with the greatest activity with caffeic acid and caffealdehyde
 <cit> . transgenic downregulation of comt has been reported in eudicots including m. sativa <cit> , n. tabacum <cit> , and populus sp. <cit> . reports of comt-downregulated transgenic grasses are more limited, including p. virgatum <cit> , z. mays <cit> , f.arundinacea <cit>  and lolium perenne <cit> . perturbation of the comt enzyme often results in the inhibition of s lignin formation and consequently the accumulation of 5-oh coniferyl alcohol that could not be synthesized into s lignin is instead converted into a g lignin monomer, resulting in incorporation of a novel 5-hydroxyguaiacyl lignin unit into the lignin polymer
 <cit> . accordingly, comt transgenics with altered lignin composition tend to be more digestible
 <cit> .

in the early 1920’s, brown midrib  mutants were identified in z. mays as displaying a brownish-red to tan pigmentation of the leaf midrib associated with reduced lignin content or altered lignin composition
 <cit> . a similar discoloration was observed in lignified tissues in the stalk. changes in development are also apparent, as exemplified by variation in flowering time
 <cit> . while the bmr mutants tend to have improved digestibility, various unfavorable traits including decreased grain and stem yield, increased lodging, and increased disease susceptibility sometimes develop
 <cit> . mutants have been isolated in the c <dig> grasses z. mays, s. bicolor, and pennisetum glaucum. four bmr loci in z. mays, bm <dig>  bm <dig>  bm <dig> and bm <dig>  represent spontaneous mutants that were first isolated almost a century ago; an additional locus, bm <dig>  was identified later
 <cit> . in s. bicolor, four brown midrib loci, bmr <dig>  bmr <dig>  bmr <dig>  and bmr <dig>  were isolated from mutagenized populations
 <cit> . three brown midrib mutants have been isolated in p. glaucum, although they have not been as well characterized
 <cit> . in z. mays and s. bicolor, the bmr phenotype is associated with orthologous loci that encompass cad and comt genes. the bm <dig> mutation affects expression of zmcad <dig> and five alleles of the orthologous bmr <dig> have been characterized in s. bicolor <cit> . the bm <dig> locus in z. mays and bmr <dig> in s. bicolor correspond to orthologous comt genes
 <cit> . the bmr mutants have the potential to act as viable bioenergy crops, as the visual phenotype seems to be an effective marker for impaired lignin biosynthesis associated with improved digestibility. a more complete understanding of the genes responsible for the phenotype will help provide novel breeding strategies and expand the resources of conversion-efficient plants.

grasses are a key source of grain and forage and have recently gained in importance as feedstocks for the biofuel industry. large perennial bioenergy crops such as p. virgatum and miscanthus sp. have a relatively long generation time, complex genomes, and tall stature that make these species difficult research subjects. in order to better understand grasses, the small annual grass, b. distachyon, was used here as a research model from which we can translate results to the improvement of crops for efficient biofuel production
 <cit> . it has many attributes of a model system including a small diploid and sequenced genome, rapid generation time, short stature, and it is easily transformable
 <cit> . in this study, we used artificial micrornas to disrupt the function of candidate cad or comt genes, with the objective of characterizing their role in lignin biosynthesis in b. distachyon.

RESULTS
characterization and phylogenetic analysis of bdcad and bdcomt gene families
given their importance to monolignol synthesis in other plants, cad and comt genes with a potential role in secondary cell wall lignification were identified and perturbed in order to evaluate their role in b. distachyon . candidate genes were selected based on sequence homology to previously characterized genes. seven putative bdcads were identified by blast search of the b. distachyon genome with the oryza sativa cad protein family
 <cit> . the bdcad family consists of bradi3g <dig> , bradi3g <dig> , bradi3g <dig> , bradi4g <dig> , bradi4g <dig> , bradi5g <dig> , and bradi5g <dig> ; numbered sequentially as they appear in the genome. multiple amino acid sequence alignment was performed with the seven candidate b. distachyon cad family members along with s. bicolor , saccharum officinarum , z. mays , p. virgatum , o. sativa , f. arundinacea , and triticum aestivum  cad proteins. alignment results indicate a high degree of similarity in conserved domains and binding residues characteristic of alcohol dehydrogenases, especially in bdcad <dig> . all seven cad family members in b. distachyon contain the zn- <dig> binding domain motif ghe2g5g2v and the conserved zn- <dig> catalytic residues c <dig>  h <dig>  and c <dig>  the sequence of the zn- <dig> binding motif is most highly conserved in bdcad <dig>  with  <dig> % homology to the motif in the other aforementioned grass species cad proteins. a glycine-rich repeat gxg2g, involved in nadp cosubstrate-binding, is conserved amongst all cad proteins. the consensus sequence gd <dig> c2c2c7c for binding the zn- <dig> metal ion is preserved in the bdcads. additionally, twelve amino acids have been identified as substrate-binding residues in the bona fide cads of various plant species
 <cit> . of the seven cads in b. distachyon, bdcad <dig> contains ten of these twelve conserved residues, while the other family members are more variable at these positions. interestingly, only bdcad <dig> contains both active substrate-binding residues, w <dig> and f <dig>  which determine specificity for aromatic alcohols, and the conserved s <dig> residue that determines nadp binding at that position, as seen in oscad <dig> in rice
 <cit> . pairwise sequence alignments with the bdcad <dig> protein revealed high percent identity to f. arundinacea , t. aestivum , o. sativa , p. virgatum , z. mays , s. officinarum , and s. bicolor . based on amino acid sequence, it appears that bdcad <dig>  contains the conserved functional and structural features of a medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase specific to enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis in secondary cell walls.

four comts were identified in b. distachyon, bradi1g <dig> , bradi2g <dig> , bradi2g <dig> , and bradi3g <dig> . multiple amino acid sequence alignment was then performed with the four derived b. distachyon comt family members and with known comts in t. aestivum , f. arundinacea , s. bicolor , s. officinarum , z. mays , and p. virgatum . sequence comparison with the functionally characterized comt proteins from various plants showed a high degree of similarity at the amino acid level . the s-adenosyl-l-methionine  binding domain, lvdvgggxg, a signature of o-methyltransferases, is conserved in bdcomt <dig>  bdcomt <dig>  and bdcomt4; however, one residue is inconsistent at position  <dig> in bdcomt <dig>  where isoleucine replaces valine in the sequence motif. catalytic residues e <dig>  e <dig>  and r <dig> are conserved in all b. distachyon comt family members and all other characterized comt lignin proteins. interestingly, catalytic residue h <dig> found in p. virgatum, f. arundinacea, s. bicolor, and z. mays, is conserved only in bdcomt <dig> and bdcomt <dig>  of the four bdcomt family members, only bdcomt <dig> has all substrate-binding and positioning residues m <dig>  n <dig>  l <dig>  a <dig>  h <dig>  f <dig>  m <dig>  h <dig>  i <dig>  m <dig>  n <dig> conserved in the known comts specific to the synthesis of secondary cell wall lignin. pairwise sequence alignments with bdcomt <dig> revealed high percent identity to f. arundinacea , t. aestivum , o. sativa , p. virgatum , s. officinarum , z. mays , and s. bicolor . the prevalence of common signatures in the amino acid sequence supports the idea that bdcomt <dig> is a comt ortholog functioning as a sam-dependent o-methyltransferase in b. disatchyon.

evidence for the role of bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> as functional lignin biosynthesis proteins was further enhanced by phylogenetic analysis. an unrooted neighbor-joining tree with  <dig> bootstrap permutations was generated from the deduced multiple amino acid sequence alignments of the aforementioned cad and comt proteins. the phenogram established a single clade in which the characterized cad proteins known to be involved in monolignol biosynthesis in monocots were clustered with one protein from our candidate b. distachyon family, bdcad <dig> . within that clade, bdcad <dig> clustered with f. arundinacea, t. aestivum and o. sativa proteins. a second, closely related group consisted of cads in p. virgatum, z. mays, s. bicolor, and s. officinarum. the remaining seven cad family members in b. distachyon did not fall into any such existing clades. a similar trend was observed in the phylogenetic analysis of the comt sequences isolated from the previously mentioned species. a common clade formed amongst the known comt lignin proteins and included one comt from the b. distachyon family, bdcomt <dig> . within the clade, bdcomt <dig> clustered with f. arundinacea and t. aestivum proteins, while a closely related group consisted of p. virgatum, z. mays, s. bicolor, and s. officinarum proteins. in contrast, the other three bdcomts did not show a similar relationship to known comt enzymes. the relationships among the cad and comt sequences specifically portray bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> as unique from any other candidates in the corresponding multi-gene families in b. distachyon.

bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> are highly expressed in developing stem
anatomical expression data were also considered in evaluating the multi-gene bdcad and bdcomt families for a role in lignification. we used microarray data to analyze gene expression of each member of the family in developing stems, roots, and leaves. lignin biosynthesis genes are expected to be highly expressed in stems, where secondary cell walls are prevalent and lignification occurs, while remaining at relatively low levels in roots and especially leaves. of the seven cad genes identified in b. distachyon, bdcad <dig> expression was greatest in stem tissue, exhibiting ten-fold higher transcript level than any of the other seven bdcad genes . expression of bdcomt <dig> was also greatest in the stem and was eighteen-fold greater than the expression of the other three bdcomt genes . as might be expected, both bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> were expressed at a slightly lower level in roots, where lignin is also present, and at a significantly lower level in leaves, where there is not much lignin at all.

bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> transgenic plants
in order to functionally characterize bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig>  reduction-of-function mutants were developed and assayed for changes in secondary cell wall composition. highly specific artificial microrna  constructs were designed to target and silence bdcad <dig> or bdcomt <dig> . the wmd version  <dig> web-based tool was used to design amirna sequences for the transgenes. the bdcad <dig> transcript was targeted by a 21-mer sequence at nucleotides 950– <dig> in the fourth exon . the bdcomt <dig> transcript was targeted by a 21-mer sequence at nucleotides 556– <dig> in the second exon . two transformation events targeting bdcad <dig>  and three transformation events targeting bdcomt <dig>  were selected for further characterization in the t <dig> generation. transgenic b. distachyon containing the empty binary vector pol <dig> were used as control in all experiments. anatomical expression data revealed that bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> were highly expressed in stems; therefore, we analyzed the expression levels of the target genes in stems of the selected transgenic lines for both bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> in order to confirm silencing. quantitative real-time pcr of the bdcad <dig> or bdcomt <dig> transcript was performed to investigate the artificial microrna induced suppression of cad or comt. relative expression of bdcad <dig> was significantly reduced in amir-cad1- <dig> by 55% and amir-cad1- <dig> by 31% compared to empty vector control . the expression level of bdcomt <dig> was significantly decreased by  <dig>   <dig>  and 34% in lines amir-comt4- <dig>  amir-comt4- <dig>  and amir-comt4- <dig> respectively, compared to the empty vector control .

the velocity of cad in crude protein extracts was determined for aboveground tissue of empty vector control and amir-cad <dig> transgenic plants as the inflorescent first emerged from the flag leaf . sinapaldehyde was used as a substrate to evaluate total cad activity that includes seven other putative cad enzymes . although not statistically significant, total cad activity was reduced by 6% in amir-cad1- <dig> and 17% in amir-cad1- <dig> plants relative to empty vector control.

effects of downregulation of bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> on development
transgenic plants were assayed for changes in growth and development typical of lignin deficiency including time to flower, tiller number, and stem weight. both cad-downregulated events showed a significant delay in inflorescence emergence, flowering on average ten days later than empty vector control plants . on the other hand, amir-comt4- <dig> and amir-comt4- <dig> plants flowered significantly earlier than the empty vector control, but this difference was not observed in amir-comt4- <dig> . the amir-cad1- <dig> and amir-cad1- <dig> events showed a significant, near two-fold increase in tiller number . the tiller count among the amir-comt <dig> mutants was significantly increased relative to the empty vector control for amir-comt4- <dig> and amir-comt4- <dig> . total stem weight was measured at senescence following the removal of seeds and leaves. events amir-cad1- <dig> and amir-cad1- <dig> showed a significant increase in stem biomass , while all amir-comt <dig> events were similar to the empty vector control .
 <dig> 

transgenic plants have lignin-associated phenotypes
the typical brown midrib phenotype was observed in all cad-downregulated plants, but not in empty vector control or comt-downregulated plants . the leaf midrib appeared a brownish tan color in leaves of amir-cad1- <dig> and amir-cad1- <dig> plants and discoloration was consistently observed in successive leaves, while the control leaves remained green until senescence. leaf midribs in amir-comt4- <dig>  amir-comt4- <dig>  and amir-comt4- <dig> appeared similar in color to the control.

the effect of changes in bdcad <dig> and bdcomt <dig> transcript abundance on lignification was evaluated by histochemical analysis. since cad is involved in the last step in the production of the precursors to s, g, and h lignin, we expected bdcad1-deficient plants to be altered in lignin . lignin amount and localization was observed with wiesner staining of hand-cut stem cross sections from the first internode of developmentally equivalent transgenic and empty vector control plants. the wiesner reaction stains lignin in a concentration-indicative manner, whereby lignified tissue stains a dark red color and less lignified tissue an orange-yellow color. empty vector control stem stained the dark red color for lignin . there was a noticeable difference in staining in both amir-cad <dig> and amir-comt <dig> stem sections relative to the control. the amir-cad <dig> stems stained a visibly lighter yellow color in regions that appeared red in the control, most notably in the sclerenchyma fibers, epidermal cells, and vascular bundle sheath . the amir-comt <dig> stems stained an orange color relative to the red in the control, although this was mainly restricted to sclerenchyma fibers .

since comt is important in the production of the sinapyl alcohol precursor for s lignin, we expected bdcomt4-downregulated plants would exhibit a more drastic change, specifically in s lignin, more so than in total g and h lignin content . the maule reagent was used to observe s lignin amount and localization in stems; the reagent stain s lignin a dark red-purple color. a shift to yellow-brown is indicative of a decrease in s lignin. empty vector control stem sections treated with the maule reagent stained a red-purple color . examination of the amir-cad <dig> stems revealed a reduction in red staining and a slight shift to yellow-orange color, notably in the epidermal cells and sclerenchyma fibers . there was a striking decrease in staining of the amir-comt <dig> stem sections, in which the majority of tissue stained pale brown in color, with slight purple coloration seen in the outer regions of the pith . the dramatic shift in color was reflective of a severe loss of s lignin in amir-comt <dig> stems compared to the empty vector control.

effect of bdcad <dig> or bdcomt4downregulation on lignin composition
to determine total lignin polymer content, plant material was subjected to hydrolysis by acetyl bromide  and fluorescent products, acbr soluble lignin, were quantified by spectrometry. there was no significant difference in acbr lignin content in cad-downregulated plants as compared to the empty vector control . on the other hand, acbr lignin was significantly reduced by an average of  <dig> % in amir-comt4- <dig> and amir-comt4- <dig> plants and 24%  in amir-comt4- <dig> relative to the control.
 <dig> 

lignin composition was evaluated by thioacidolysis, which cleaves β-o- <dig> ether bonds within the lignin polymer to reveal the monomer components. the recovered monomeric degradation products, namely s, g, and h units, were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. empty vector control samples consisted of approximately 55% s, 40% g, and 5% h lignin units. monomer levels were altered in amir-cad <dig> and amir-comt <dig> plants . downregulation of bdcad <dig> was associated with a significant decrease in s units and a slight yet not statistically significant increase in g units, resulting in a reduced s/g ratio. although h units were relatively scarce, they were increased in amir-cad <dig> plants. the amir-cad1- <dig> plants showed the most dramatic phenotype, in which the amount of s units and the s/g ratio were 16% and 22% lower than control. although not statistically significant, the bdcomt4-downregulated plants exhibited a 10% decrease in s units and a 17% reduction in g units, along with an increase in the s/g ratio relative to empty vector control plants. no consistent difference in h lignin was observed in amir-comt <dig> plants.

1senesced stem tissue of amircad <dig> and amircomt <dig> were grown in different experiments with separate empty vector controls.

biological conversion efficiency in transgenic plants
in order to evaluate the impact of lignin pathway modification on biofuel feedstock quality, we measured the potential of the transgenic plants to produce ethanol following inoculation with the cell-wall-degrading, ethanogenic bacterium c. phytofermentans. a slight increase in average ethanol concentration was detected for both the amir-cad <dig> and amir-comt <dig> lines . fermentation of the cad-downregulated plants resulted in ethanol yields that were increased by 9% in amir-cad1- <dig> and 17%  in amir-cad1- <dig> lines relative to empty vector control plants. digestion was slightly improved by comt-downregulation, as ethanol yield was increased by 4% in amir-comt4- <dig> , 10% in amir-comt4- <dig> , and 8% in amir-comt-4- <dig> lines .

discussion
in this study, we used a candidate gene approach to identify the cad and comt genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis in b. distachyon. while well studied as key enzymes in the lignin pathway that influence forage quality, understanding of these enzymes is now of increased interest due to an apparently similar effect on biofuel feedstock quality
 <cit> . to date, there have only been a few reports of cad or comt downregulation in transgenic monocots
 <cit> . these species, such as f. arundinacae and l. perenne have proven to be challenging research subjects. we report here the effectiveness of artificial microrna silencing in a species considerably more amenable to research, b. distachyon, from which gained knowledge can be contributed towards the optimization of bioenergy grasses.

in monocots such as z. mays, s. bicolor and o. sativa, cad tends to exist as a multi-gene family with one cad primarily involved in monolignol biosynthesis
 <cit> . in contrast, in the eudicot a. thaliana, the last step of monolignol biosynthesis is controlled synergistically by two genes, atcad-c and atcad-d <cit> . based on amino acid sequence and gene expression pattern, we identified bdcad <dig> as a likely candidate for having a role in lignin biosynthesis. albeit with significantly lower efficiency than bdcad <dig>  bradi4g <dig> can also use coniferyl aldehyde and coniferyl alcohol as substrates and may also have a role in monolignol biosynthesis
 <cit> . unlike the other bdcads, bdcad <dig> contains all sequence features characteristic of a zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase and more specifically, appears to be a member of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. high similarity in sequence motifs and substrate binding position suggests that bdcad <dig> shares the same function as the bona fide cads
 <cit> . consistent with multi-gene cad families in z. mays, s. bicolor and o. sativa, one particular protein in b. distachyon shared a significantly higher degree of homology with other known cads than any other family member
 <cit> . gene expression analysis revealed that bdcad <dig> was the most highly expressed member of the gene family and that transcript abundance was particularly high in stem and root, where secondary cell walls are prevalent. lignin-associated cad expression was similarly high in stem and root tissues in p. virgatum, f. arundinacae, o. sativa, and s. bicolor <cit> .

the downregulation of bdcad <dig> caused phenotypes characteristic of lignin deficiency without reducing plant biomass. the delay in flowering time of the amir-cad <dig> plants is consistent with the phenotypes in five s. bicolor bmr mutants including cad impaired bmr <dig> <cit> . the variation in flowering time observed in lignin mutants from s. bicolor and b. distachyon reinforces the possibility of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism between cell wall biosynthesis and production of flowers
 <cit> . because lignin has a significant role in xylem function, it is possible that changes in lignin may alter development by perturbing water transport. however, this rationale seems unlikely considering that, while amir-cad <dig> plants were developmentally delayed, mature transgenic plants were significantly larger than empty vector control plants . an increase in aboveground stem biomass, even coupled with delayed flowering, is a favorable trait for a perennial energy crop, considering crop rotation will not be part of cultivation. while mutations in cad can sometimes lead to pleiotropic effects of dwarfing, lodging, and a decrease in grain and/or biomass yield, these effects are mostly background-dependent
 <cit> . further understanding of gene-by-gene interactions that result in these deleterious effects will increase the efficiency of cultivar development.

we present here the brown midrib leaf phenotype for the first time in a c <dig> grass
 <cit> . genetic redundancy may explain why the phenotype has not been observed in mutant polyploid species such as t. aestivum and f. arundinacae; however, cad mutants of diploid o. sativa do not exhibit a leaf brown midrib
 <cit> . it has been suggested that the brown midrib phenotype may present itself differently in various species. in o. sativa, a mutation in gold hull and internode  <dig>  which encodes a cad enzyme, caused a red-brown pigment in the hull, internode, and basal leaf sheath while the leaf midrib did not show the same discoloration
 <cit> . similarly, recent research in b. distachyon indicated that cad mutants displayed the red-brown pigmentation in various tissues including nodes and flowers, but not in the leaf midrib
 <cit> . we did not observe color differences in tissues other than leaf midrib. in other species, including populus sp. and n. tabacum, transverse stem cross-sections of transgenic cad-downregulated plants exhibited unusually red xylem
 <cit> . on the other hand, no visible mutant phenotype was observed in cad-rnai z. mays plants
 <cit> . here, the bdcad1-downregulated plants phenotypically resembled z. mays, s. bicolor, and p. glaucum leaf brown-midrib mutants. the brown-midrib phenotype may occur only when cad activity is decreased beneath a certain threshold
 <cit> . for example, in four lines of antisense-cad transgenic tobacco with residual cad activity ranging from 8-56%, the extent of cad downregulation was correlated with the presence and pattern of reddish-brown xylem
 <cit> . we measured relatively small changes in cad activity, but at a developmental stage that had not yet exhibited the brown-midrib phenotype. nonetheless, the amir-cad1- <dig> plants which were most reduced in cad activity were significantly more digestible when the plant had completely senesced. it is possible at a subsequent developmental stage characterized by greater lignin biosynthesis that diminished cad activity would be more evident.

the quality of lignin was altered in amir-cad <dig> plants, as indicated by a significant decrease in s units observed by thioacidolysis and in agreement with histochemical staining by the maule reagent. previous research in cad-downregulated n. tabacum and cad mutant b. distachyon showed that the most dramatic change in lignin composition in plants was a severe decrease in s lignin
 <cit> . some cad gene knockouts produce functional lignin through increased incorporation of cinnamyl aldehyde subunits into the lignin polymer
 <cit> . previous reports for z. mays, n. tabacum, and populus sp. demonstrated an incorporation of aldehydes into the lignin polymer, in which increased coniferyl aldehyde caused an increase in intensity of the wiesner stain
 <cit> . on the contrary, the wiesner stain in amir-cad <dig> lines was less intense than control plants. a likely explanation is that the inhibition of s lignin synthesis still caused an accumulation of aldehydes, but specifically sinapyl aldehydes, which are not detected by wiesner staining. this is consistent with decreased wiesner staining and incorporation of 8-o-4-coupled sinapyl aldehyde in b. distachyon cad mutant plants
 <cit> .

consistent with reports in n. tabacum, m. sativa, e. camaldulensis, populus sp., f. arundinacae, and z. mays, amir-cad <dig> plants were unchanged in the amount of acetyl bromide soluble lignin polymer, but thioacidolysis indicated changes in lignin monomer composition
 <cit> . the lignin in cad downregulated plants was generally more reactive. this has been illustrated by improved pulping properties in populus sp., forage digestibility in n. tabacum and f. arundinacae, saccharification in p. virgatum and b. distachyon, and digestibility in z. mays <cit> . along the same lines, the modified lignin in amir-cad1- <dig> improved biological conversion efficiency by a statistically significant 17%.

one protein among the four comts identified in b. distachyon, bdcomt <dig> , contained all of the signature features of a plant o-methyltransferase. plant o-methyltransferases tend to have broad substrate specificity, and all nine substrate binding and positioning residues in bdcomt <dig> are common to comt proteins in other species. similar to l. perenne, f. arundinacae, p. tremuloides, and m. sativa comt genes
 <cit> , bdcomt <dig> was the most highly expressed comt in stem, root, and leaf tissues than any of the three other b. distachyon family members. similar to observations made in p. tremuloides, bdcomt <dig> expression was relatively low in leaves compared to stems
 <cit> . phylogeny, amino acid sequence, and the abundance of transcript in lignified tissues concurrently support that bdcomt <dig> is an o-methyltransferase involved in monolignol biosynthesis in b. distachyon.

the downregulation of comt resulted in changes in various phenotypic traits. mutants tended to flower earlier than the empty vector control, as seen for the lignin mutants bm <dig> in z. mays and bmr <dig> in s. bicolor <cit> . in general, the brown midrib phenotype is not common in comt-downregulated transgenic plants, with the only reports of a reddish-brown coloration of the leaf and internodes being in z. mays <cit> . although the cause of discoloration in plants with impaired cad activity is often attributed to the incorporation of aldehydes into the lignin polymer, there is no obvious correlation between the phenotype and the activities of other enzymes of the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. previous biochemical analysis has indicated that the brown coloration is not a result of accumulated carotenoids, anthocyanins, flavones, tannins, or flavonols, but could possibly be due to incorporation of other phenolic compounds into the lignin polymer
 <cit> . accumulation of novel 5-oh-g units has been observed in comt-downregulated transgenic m. sativa and z. mays, although a visual phenotype associated with this phenomenon has not been defined
 <cit> .

in our transgenic b. distachyon, the perturbation of the comt enzyme had a deleterious effect on the total quantity of lignin produced in the plant. similarly, downregulated comt mutants in z. mays, f. arundinacae, l. perenne, s. bicolor, and saccharum spp. were also reduced in total lignin
 <cit> . staining with the maule reagent revealed an obvious difference between control and amir-comt <dig> transverse stem cross sections. we measured an increase in ethanol yield of up to 10% in amir-comt <dig> lines, which is consistent with the characterization of comt mutants in other species

CONCLUSIONS
one of the more costly steps of producing liquid fuels from biomass on the biochemical platform is the pretreatment required to reduce biomass recalcitrance for the enzymatic and fermentation steps. as a result, there has been increasing effort to identify the factors behind biomass recalcitrance. in this study, modification of cad and comt expression induced changes in cell wall composition that improved amenability to conversion. a significant 17% increase in ethanol yield from plant biomass, as observed here by cad downregulation, would increase industrial efficiency of processing such feedstock. genetic modification of lignin biosynthesis may provide a means of improvement of biofuel crop conversion efficiency by reducing biomass pretreatment costs, thereby improving the bioethanol production process overall.
