BACKGROUND
leishmaniasis is a spectrum of parasitic disease caused by leishmania spp. protozoa, transmitted to its mammalian host by bite of an infected female sand fly vector. the clinical manifestations of the disease range from the potentially fatal visceral disease caused by l. donovani complex  to disfiguring, but self curing cutaneous form caused by l. major in the old world and l. amazonensis and l. mexicana in the new world. within the sand fly, leishmania exists as an extracellular, flagellated form and gets transformed into an intracellular, sessile amastigote in phagolysosome of the macrophages. the role of many molecules like gp <dig>  <cit> , lipophosphoglycan  <cit> , cysteine proteases  <cit>  etc. that are differentially expressed in the two developmental stages of the parasite have been studied for their involvement in adaptation of the parasite in such disparate environments and enhancing virulence of the parasite. a lot more remains to be learnt, including the functions, of many such virulence factors. understanding the mechanistic details of function of virulence factors will help us develop novel intervention strategies against the parasite and the disease.

meta <dig> was one such gene identified in l. major, found to be conserved across the leishmania genus. both transcript and protein was found to be up-regulated in the metacyclic stage of promastigotes. the meta <dig> protein was found to localize surrounding the flagellar pocket in l. major stationary phase promastigotes  <cit> . on meta <dig> overexpression in l. amazonensis, parasites were found to be more virulent than wild-type  <cit> . another gene in leishmania, also up-regulated in metacyclic promastigotes is named meta <dig>  and contains three meta domains and a calpain-like domain at the carboxy terminus  <cit> . meta  is currently described as a small domain family of unknown function in leishmania meta <dig> and in bacterial proteins, hypothetically secreted/implicated in motility. however, apart from some of its developmental expression and its suggested role in virulence, the precise functions of meta <dig> in the parasite remain unknown.

in order to understand meta1's function, we investigated its relationship with its near homologs in other organisms. based on several criteria, we have been able to establish in this study that meta <dig> of leishmania is a homolog of a bacterial gene for a heat shock inducible protein, hslj that has been transferred by an ancient lateral gene transfer event between bacteria and a trypanosomatid ancestor. we have highlighted similarities in various characteristics of the two proteins like their relatedness to pathogenicity/virulence, heat inducible expression and also shown by homology modeling that they are not only evolutionarily linked but structurally similar as well. furthermore, our homology modeling identified yet another structural homolog mxim, a secretin pilot protein of shigella flexneri, which is involved in that pathogen's type iii secretion system. based on structural homology between meta <dig> & mxim and subsequent mutagenesis, we have identified a putative hydrophobic cavity in leishmania meta <dig> that seems to be important for function of meta <dig> and indicates a role for meta <dig> in leishmania secretory processes.

RESULTS
sequence similarity searches
the meta <dig> sequence is highly conserved across the leishmania genus  <cit> . based on this high degree of conservation and the convenient accessibility of l. major genome sequence and other related resources over those for other leishmania species, all of our bioinformatics analyses have used l. major meta <dig> as the representative species. we began our study by using blastp to search for homologs of meta <dig> protein against the ncbi nrdb. homologs of meta <dig> were found in all other leishmania species and trypanosomes .

since blastp search failed to detect any functionally characterized homolog within or outside the trypanosomatidae family, a psi-blast search was performed against ncbi nrdb. this search yielded hits beyond the trypanosomatids as early as the second iteration. interestingly, these significant hits were all homologs of the heat shock inducible protein hslj from bacteria. table  <dig> lists representative hits after  <dig> iterations. all sequence homologs of meta <dig>  are characterized by the presence of at least one meta domain. although there is a low direct pairwise sequence identity of 25% between meta <dig> and hslj , bacterial hslj is currently the closest relative of leishmania meta <dig> outside the family trypanosomatidae. the most likely explanation for this unusual phyletic relationship is that meta <dig> in trypanosomatids originated as a result of a lateral gene transfer  event from bacteria.

anomalous nucleotide composition
most genomes have distinct overall gc content and the genes in their genome are fairly similar in base composition and patterns of codon usage. a laterally transferred gene continues to carry imprints of its origin and ancestry whilst residing in its current recipient genome. such 'foreign genes' can be identified by their unusual sequence characteristics vis a vis the recipient genome  <cit> . gc content at first and third codon positions and synonymous codon usage are generally used for such analysis. orfs are identified as atypical if their gc contents at first and third codon positions  are two or more standard deviations  higher or lower than the respective means for all genes in that genome. our analysis revealed that the total gc content of l. major meta <dig> is 54%, which is  <dig>  sd lower than the average of the total gc content of all genes in l. major genome. in addition, lmjmeta <dig> has a gc <dig> content of  <dig> %  and a gc <dig> content of 77% , as summarized in figure 2a. gc content anomaly results establish that meta <dig> nucleotide composition is distinct from the overall leishmania genome and therefore, is possibly of foreign origin.

codon adaptation index , on the other hand, gives an account of similarity of synonymous codon usage to that of a standard set of highly expressed genes for that organism. thus, for a native gene cai is high and for a gene of exogenous origin cai value is low. as part of cai determination, we analyzed a set of other genes for reference along with meta <dig> 
. the genes that were included: amastin & gp <dig> , hexokinase & ribosomal protein s <dig> , Î±-tubulin  and ptr- <dig> & coproporphyrinogen, previously predicted to be laterally transferred in l. major from bacteria  <cit> . meta <dig>  ptr- <dig> and coproporphyrinogen all have low cai values when compared to the other reference genes , suggesting again, that meta <dig> is of exogenous origin. we also carried out a similar analysis on meta <dig> homologs in t. cruzi 
; where once again the cai of the meta homologs is lower than that of other trypanosoma genes . these analyses, and the striking frequency of bacterial hslj hits, point to bacterial hslj being the exogenous source of meta <dig> into trypanosomatids.

phylogenetic relationship between meta <dig> and hslj
in order to study the phylogenetic linkage between meta <dig> and hslj, we generated a phylogenetic tree based on the protein sequences of meta <dig> homologs in trypanosomatids and hslj homologs in bacteria. a multiple sequence alignment containing  <dig> sequences  was used to create a phylogenetic tree using phyml. topology of the phylogenetic tree and the bootstrap values of the branch points , again indicate the occurrence of a lgt event of meta/hslj from bacteria to a trypanosomatid.

synonymous and non-synonymous rate estimates
estimation of synonymous  and non-synonymous substitution  rates is an important tool for understanding molecular sequence evolution and the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous rate of substitution  reflects the selection pressure on a gene  <cit> . we observed that meta <dig> and the meta domain in bacterial hslj homologs are under strong purifying selection as indicated by the ka/ks values <  <dig> in a pairwise comparison of lmjmeta <dig> and meta domain of  <dig> bacterial hslj homologs . therefore, lower substitution rates for meta <dig> emphasizes the selection pressure on it, a constraint on the leishmania genome not to change it rapidly and thus, the importance of conservation of this gene.

meta <dig> expression in leishmania
hslj transcript is up-regulated in more pathogenic strains of e. coli  <cit>  and the protein is heat inducible  <cit> . to delineate similarities between meta <dig> and hslj, we investigated the expression pattern of meta <dig>  meta <dig> transcript levels were determined by qrt-pcr at different developmental stages of virulent and attenuated lines of l. donovani. meta <dig> transcript is up-regulated from log to stationary phase promastigotes as well as from promastigote to amastigote stage . meta <dig> protein in l. donovani is maximally expressed in amastigotes  even though meta <dig> transcript levels in amastigotes are lower than stationary phase promastigotes. meta <dig> protein is induced within  <dig> hours of shift to amastigote culture conditions, increases further upto  <dig> hours and its expression decreases within  <dig> hours of reversal back to promastigote conditions . the most striking observation is that attenuated leishmania have reduced meta <dig> expression under all conditions, as compared to virulent cells .

acidic ph and increased temperature  are very important cues for the in vivo as well as in vitro conversion of promastigotes to amastigotes  <cit> . since we found that meta <dig> is up-regulated in amastigotes stage, we investigated the role of these two parameters individually. we found that while both acidic ph and increased temperature induce meta <dig> expression, increased temperature has a greater effect . levels of meta <dig> on western blots have been quantified as shown in additional file  <dig> 

structural homology between meta <dig> and hslj
in the absence of a solved structure of leishmania meta <dig> protein, we used 3d-jury  <cit>  structure prediction to look for structural homologs of meta <dig>  consistent with our earlier searches, we found the top scoring model for meta <dig> was based on e. coli hslj. hslj structure has  <dig> Î²-strands, which resembles a Î²-barrel structure except of the discontinuity caused due to the presence of the Î±-helix. we also generated a structural model by homology modeling using modeller 9v <dig>  <cit>  for leishmania meta <dig> using e. coli hslj  as the template. the final model  comprises of complete meta <dig> sequence  threaded on known nmr structure of e. coli hslj  for residues 25- <dig> . the two proteins share a similar structural fold given that  <dig> cÎ± atoms of total  <dig> cÎ± atoms across the length of the proteins could be superposed with a root mean square deviation  value of  <dig>  Ã and a sequence identity of ~ 28%. the striking structural similarity underscores that despite low sequence identity, meta <dig> and hslj have been under evolutionary constraints to retain a similar fold.

comparison to proteins with similar folds of known function
since little is known about e.coli hslj's function with respect to its structure, we decided to look for additional proteins with similar fold. in dali server  <cit> , we found a structural homolog of hslj: the shigella flexneri protein mxim . despite a low sequence identity between hslj and mxim of only ~13%,  <dig> cÎ± atoms of the total  <dig> cÎ± atoms could be superposed with an rmsd value of  <dig>  Ã, as determined by dali pairwise comparison  <cit> . similarly, meta <dig> and mxim share a sequence identity of ~9%; yet,  <dig> cÎ± atoms out of the total  <dig> cÎ± atoms could be superposed with an rmsd of  <dig>  Ã. mxim is a type iii secretion apparatus  pilot protein, which is a 142-residue lipoprotein, essential for the assembly and membrane association of the shigella secretin, mxid  <cit> . a deficiency in mxim leads to complete loss of ttss function and virulence  <cit> . the structure of mxim contains a 'cracked barrel' motif that creates a striking cleft in the centre of the protein. the cavity is entirely hydrophobic in nature and binds to lipid moieties of outer membrane  of the bacteria  <cit> . likewise, we observed that meta <dig> and hslj also have a similar hydrophobic cavity upon their superposition to mxim . however, unlike in mxim, the putative hydrophobic cavity in meta <dig> has at least one charged residue in its core . overall, structural comparisons between meta <dig>  hslj and mxim further reinforce their fold similarity. this pattern of structural and not sequence conservation signifies selection pressure on the structure of these proteins, probably for maintaining similar functions.

meta <dig> is involved in secretory processes in leishmania
in l. major, meta <dig> is reported to localize around the flagellar pocket  <cit> , the site for exo- and endocytosis in leishmania  <cit> . mxim, in addition to its known participation in shigella ttss, is also known to be structurally similar to the bacterial lipocalin  <cit> . lipocalins are known extracellular transporters that bind small hydrophobic molecules  <cit> . against this background of information, the striking structural similarity between meta <dig> and mxim prompted us to examine whether leishmania meta <dig> had a role in leishmania secretory processes. secreted acid phosphatase  is the most abundant secreted glycoprotein of l. donovani  <cit>  and estimation of extracellular sap activity is routinely used as an indicator of the status of secretory processes in the parasite  <cit> . therefore, sap activity was assayed in culture supernatants in the context of different levels of meta <dig>  extracellular sap activity was found to be lower at both log and stationary phase in l. donovani virulent promastigotes that have more meta <dig> protein, when compared to attenuated promastigotes . in order to determine whether extracellular sap activity is directly related with levels of meta <dig> expression, we ectopically expressed meta <dig> in both virulent and attenuated l. donovani promastigotes. the ectopic copy of l. donovani meta <dig> protein was tagged with gfp at the c-terminus to distinguish from the endogenous protein. on meta <dig> overexpression, extracellular sap activity further reduced in both virulent and attenuated overexpression lines in comparison to their respective wild-types . overexpression of meta <dig> at protein level and its effect on growth kinetics is shown in additional file  <dig>  this suggests that cells having higher amounts of meta <dig> protein have lower extracellular sap activity, indicating a role for meta <dig> in secretory processes in leishmania.

mutations in putative hydrophobic cavity of meta <dig> alter secretion in leishmania
to examine whether the predicted hydrophobic cavity has any role in meta1's function, we decided to mutate smaller hydrophobic residues in the cavity to bulkier ones, wherein we replaced leucines at 58th and 80th position with a phenylalanine individually and both simultaneously . l <dig> is located at the entry of the cavity and is conserved across trypanosomatids and bacterial hslj. on the other hand, l <dig> is inside the hydrophobic cavity and is conserved in trypanosomatids, with the exception of l. braziliensis and t. cruzi as shown in additional file  <dig>  mutant proteins were c-terminally tagged with gfp, in order to distinguish from endogenous protein and were ectopically expressed in l. donovani promastigotes.

extracellular sap activity increased by 40% in l. donovani overexpressing l58f mutant meta <dig> protein, as compared to cells overexpressing the wild-type  meta <dig> . however, l80f mutation in meta <dig> decreased the extracellular sap activity with respect to wt overexpression. moreover, extracellular sap activity of the double mutant l <dig> f was found to be similar to that of l80f mutant in l. donovani 
. we also determined the intracellular sap activity in all of these leishmania lines. consistent with the changes in extracellular activity, the percentage of intracellular v/s total sap activity is higher in cells overexpressing wt, l80f and l <dig> f meta <dig>  but lower in the l58f mutant, as compared to gfp control . these results suggest that the 58th and 80th position are critical for the function of meta <dig> in l. donovani. similar results were obtained when l58f and l80f mutations were introduced into l. major meta <dig>  either individually or simultaneously , reiterating that the l. donovani and l. major meta <dig> proteins have a conserved function. we also observed a growth defect only in the double mutant in both l. donovani and l. major, which have higher multiplication rate at late logarithmic phase and start declining sooner than wt overexpression cells . the difference in sap activity between cells overexpressing wt versus meta <dig> mutant forms was not due to different amounts of meta <dig> protein being expressed, as shown by western blots . in order to eliminate the possibility of misreporting extracellular sap activity due to cell lysis, a western blot on culture supernatants was done with gp <dig> and bip antibodies, along with whole cell lysates as control. the culture supernatants that we used for the experiment did have extracellular gp <dig> but lacked er chaperone bip, as shown in additional file  <dig>  overall, alteration in extracellular sap activity in cells expressing meta <dig> mutants points to a role for meta <dig> in leishmania secretory processes and highlights the importance of the putative hydrophobic pocket to meta1's function.

discussion
despite leishmania meta1's well known association with virulence, its functions have remained poorly understood. we have attempted to elucidate the functions of meta <dig> by identifying and examining its known homologs in other organisms. we have observed an unusual phyletic relationship between bacterial hslj and trypanosomatid meta <dig> which highlights lgt as the most rational explanation for the origin of meta <dig> sequences in trypanosomatids.

analyses of several pathogen genomes suggest a widespread occurrence of lgt  <cit> . these studies have relied on combinations of aberrant nucleotide composition or sequence similarity searches and phylogenetic analyses. in our study we have included all of these approaches: sequence similarity, overall gc content bias, gc content bias at 1st and 3rd codon positions and codon usage bias of meta <dig> over whole genome of l. major and phylogenetic distribution pattern. all of the individual analyses are consistent with the notion of meta <dig> being laterally transferred from bacteria into trypanosomatids . in the analyses of such lgt events it is crucial to factor in multiple lines of evidence  <cit> . by itself, the phylogenetic tree may be open to additional interpretations such as a "reverse" lgt flow from trypanosomatids into bacteria or a retention of meta <dig> in trypanosomatids, from a common ancestor  with a loss from other species. however, the consistent topology of the phylogenetic tree, rooted in multiple manners  taken together with the striking anomalous nucleotide composition of meta <dig> in leishmania make it unlikely that the lgt flow of meta <dig> was from trypanosomatids into bacteria. or, that meta <dig> was retained within leishmania from a common ancestor: if meta was persisting from an ancient common ancestor, its gc composition would have been assimilated into the trypanosomatid genomes. however, we cannot exclude a possibility that meta <dig> was present in an ancient common ancestor, was lost during the evolutionary emergence of eukaryotes and at some point, regained by trypanosomatids through a lgt from bacteria. clearly, more definitive answers to such events will emerge as the genome sequence information coverage of various taxa expands.

analyses of anomalous nucleotide composition is quite effective in the detection of recent lgt events but becomes handicapped as the time scale of the event in question increases typically because the gene in question has more time to adjust to the host genome  <cit> . given the diversity of bacterial species that have the meta domain and the limited occurrence of meta only in trypanosomatid eukaryotes, it is most likely that the transfer of meta <dig> into trypanosomatids was an ancient event. in this regard, it is striking that the anomalous nucleotide composition of leishmania meta <dig> continues to be easily discernible.

maintenance of the foreignness of a laterally transferred gene in the context of its recipient genome could reflect either a recent transfer event or a selective pressure to maintain certain features. given the occurrence and conservation of meta <dig> sequence throughout trypansomatids, it is most likely the transfer of meta <dig> from bacteria was an early event into a trypanosomatid ancestor. an organism always maintains certain evolutionary constraints on its essential genes, in order to prevent loss of function caused due to mutations. thus, a gene under purifying selection will evolve at a slower rate than a gene under positive selection. upon comparison of meta <dig> with its bacterial homologs, we found that meta <dig> is under strong purifying selection, therefore, highlighting the importance of function of this gene for the organism .

selection constraints on the meta1/hslj pair also underline the possibility of having similar properties. our results have highlighted some of the properties shared by hslj and meta <dig>  hslj transcript up-regulation was found to be associated with pathogenicity in e. coli  <cit>  and recovery of heat injured salmonella enteritidis  <cit> . in comparison, we observed that meta <dig> expression too is regulated in developmental stages in l. donovani, consistent with earlier reports  <cit> . we have also shown that attenuated leishmania have lower meta <dig> expression than virulent cells, consistent with a role for meta <dig> in leishmania virulence. in leishmania, meta <dig> expression is inducible by both temperature and acidification, with the temperature-mediated change being more significant . this observation underscores the heat-inducible property of meta <dig>  like its bacterial homolog hslj  <cit> .

hslj has been associated with increased resistance against a gyrase inhibitor novobiocin  <cit> . we examined in leishmania if meta <dig> expression is associated with novobiocin resistance in virulent & attenuated lines of leishmania as well as in meta <dig> overexpressing lines. in the above mentioned conditions, we found no such correlation . clearly, not all functions are common between meta <dig> and hslj. recently, l. amazonensis meta <dig> that has  <dig> meta domains and a c-terminal calpain-like domain was reported to be implicated in novobiocin resistance  <cit> . this raises the possibility that our observations may be explained by meta <dig> complementing for novobiocin resistance independent of meta <dig> expression levels.

the 3d-modeling studies of meta <dig> allowed us to identify an additional structural homolog of meta <dig>  the secretin pilot protein of shigella flexneri, mxim . these three proteins: meta <dig>  hslj and mxim share a strikingly similar fold, in spite of a very low sequence identity. the essential features about the structural similarity of these proteins highlighted upon superposition are: a common cracked barrel motif and a set of conserved hydrophobic residues in the central pocket of the protein . such a structural homology between meta <dig>  hslj and mxim suggests a possibility of similar function of these proteins. many proteins with similar function have been known to retain similar structural folds despite very low sequence identity and ambiguous secondary structure prediction  <cit> . the hydrophobic cavity in mxim is known to bind lipid moieties of bacterial membranes. however, unlike mxim, the putative cavity of meta <dig> has at least one charged amino acid suggesting that the ligand of this putative pocket may be different from mxim . it is possible that these proteins participate in similar activities, with certain residues in the cavity defining specificity of the ligand.

changes in levels and predicted structure of meta <dig> affect the quantum of extracellular activity of the well characterized marker for leishmania secretory processes, sap . a comparison of proportion of intracellular v/s total sap activity shows that overexpression of either wt or mutant meta <dig> changes the extracellular sap secretion . however, while ectopic expression of l80f mutant and wt reduces extracellular sap activity, the l58f mutant meta <dig> caused an increase in extracellular sap activity. the l58f mutation appears to act as a loss of function event: there is more meta <dig> protein but with a reduced negative effect on sap activity. the proximity of this 58th position to the entrance of the putative hydrophobic cavity  suggests impairment in interactions with the probable ligand of the putative cavity that may interfere with meta1's function, in turn interfering with meta1's ability to suppress sap secretion. additionally, in l. donovani, l <dig> epitopic region seems to be highly antigenic: when lysates of cells overexpressing the different forms of meta <dig> were probed with polyclonal meta <dig> antisera on a western blot, the l58f reactivity was extremely low compared to wt overexpression control. however, when the same proteins, all of which have gfp tagged to their c-termini, were probed with polyclonal gfp antibody, cell lysates exhibited equivalent amounts of gfp-tagged proteins .

the l80f mutation dominates over l58f mutation in case of the double mutant , as seen by its overall effect on sap activity . contrary to the l <dig> position, l <dig> lies in the core of the cavity: this change in position may also explain the altered consequences of the two mutations. overall, our results on meta <dig> mutagenesis in its putative hydrophobic cavity are consistent with a role for meta <dig> in secretory processes in leishmania and that this cavity is important for meta1's function. however, the double mutant has an altered growth , suggesting that meta <dig> may also be participating in events other than secretion.

overall, the consequences of meta <dig> mutations on extracellular sap activity are consistent in both l. donovani and l. major: l58f overexpression leads to increased sap activity; l80f has an equivalent effect on sap activity to wt meta <dig> and l80f dominates over l58f in the double mutants . additionally, the l58f,80f double mutant has growth effects in both species . however, we did observe some differences between the two leishmania species. one, the extent of effect on sap activity is greater in l. donovani. second, l80f has distinct effects in l. major. in l. major, l80f and l <dig> f mutant meta <dig> protein expression was not seen while l58f mutant protein is equivalent in expression as the overexpressed wt . in spite of the presence of meta1-gfp fusion transcripts in both l80f and l <dig> f , there is barely any detectable amount of mutant protein suggesting that the mutant protein is possibly getting degraded. these observations reiterate the fact that l80f mutation is dominant in l <dig> f mutation. since l <dig> lies in the core of the cavity which might be important for ligand binding , it is possible that mutation at this site has disrupted ligand binding resulting in an unstable meta <dig> conformation, leading to its degradation.

it is increasingly clear that lgt is an important mechanism in the evolution of eukaryotes  <cit> . an interesting finding has been the observed transfer of gene sets for metabolic pathways  <cit> . this is particularly of importance in the case of unicellular eukaryotes: lgt from bacteria allows the acquisition of new abilities such as exploitation of ecological niches, infective abilities and metabolic capabilities. a practical advantage of such knowledge is that such lgt acquired genes are more likely to be conducive targets for drug development since the host eukaryote typically lacks these genes  <cit> . furthermore, over time, lgt event has played a significant role in the subsequent evolution of the meta <dig> gene family in trypanosomatids, as can be seen from the occurrence of a number of paralogs in trypanosomes and a separate gene in leishmania, meta <dig>  which has three meta domains.

it is conceivable that, for leishmania, at least one of the advantages of the lgt mediated acquisition of meta <dig> was additional modulation of secretory processes. secretion can be an important process for a pathogen seeking to modulate its host's responses via the export of effector molecules/virulence factors. leishmania secrete various bioactive molecules that are involved in pathogenesis  <cit> . recently, a novel exosome-based pathway was identified as a general mechanism of protein secretion by leishmania that is involved in pathogen-to-host communication and export of exosomal cargo into host macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, the exosomal cargo influences myeloid cells and is immunosuppressive  <cit> . our data is consistent with the correlation of meta <dig> levels associated with leishmania virulence. this work adds new information on functional role for meta <dig> in secretory processes in leishmania. additionally, it identifies a domain within meta <dig> that may be critical for its functions.

CONCLUSIONS
meta <dig> has long been associated with virulence but its activity and the processes it influences to modulate virulence have remained unknown. in order to identify the function of this enigmatic yet essential protein, we have used an evolutionary biology approach to first identify the origins of meta <dig>  having provided several lines of evidence that meta <dig> arose in leishmania as the result of a lgt event of hslj from bacteria, we leveraged this information to get clues about meta <dig> function by comparing it to its bacterial homologs. we utilized 3d-modeling to show that meta <dig> shares a structural scaffold with hslj and mxim. the striking structural similarity between these proteins despite a limited sequence homology points to evolutionary constraint on retaining structural folds in proteins and the retention of related functions. the sequence divergence most likely allows for specificity of interacting molecules. the conserved scaffold between meta1/hslj/mxim identified a shared cavity in these proteins. we have extended the known involvement of mxim in secretion and the possibility of a role for such a cavity with regards to meta <dig> function. using molecular biology approaches, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of meta <dig> and site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues in the predicted meta <dig> cavity do affect secretory processes in leishmania, thus establishing a function for this poorly characterized protein as well as identifying a functional domain within the molecule. overall, our study demonstrates the utility of a multidisciplinary approach that combines insights from evolutionary origins of a molecule with bioinformatics analyses and computational approaches, leading to a predicted structure and activity, both of which are testable at a molecular level.
