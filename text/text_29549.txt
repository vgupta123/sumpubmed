BACKGROUND
anti-glomerular basement membrane  disease, also known as goodpasture’s disease, is an organ specific autoimmune disorder characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage and presentation of anti-gbm autoantibodies  <cit> . linear deposition of immunoglobulin g  along gbm is the hallmark of anti-gbm glomerulonephritis, and is occasionally accompanied by deposition along tubular basement membrane . the pathogenicity of anti-gbm igg has been demonstrated in passive transfer studies using the renal elute taken from patients, which is subsequently injected into squirrel monkeys. the authors observed a similar linear deposition of igg along the gbm, which contributed to the development of crescentic glomerulonephritis  <cit> . the target antigen has been identified as the non-collagenous domain  of α <dig> chain of type iv collagen on gbm . there are two major conformational epitopes within the antigen, ea and eb, which are sequestrated in the quaternary structure of gbm by critical sulfilimine bond  <cit> .

human igg are categorized into four subclasses  according to their heavy chains, which elicit different immunological and inflammatory responses. previous studies have reported that there is anti-gbm igg subclass restriction in the circulation of patients with anti-gbm disease, in which igg <dig> and igg <dig> were predominant  <cit> . our recent studies showed that during the initiation and progression of anti-gbm glomerulonephritis, there is an attendant increase of frequencies of anti-gbm igg <dig> and igg <dig>  <cit> . this correlation highlights the pathogenic role of igg <dig> and igg <dig> in the development of renal injury. animal models also showed that the severity of anti-gbm antibodies induced glomerulonephritis was dependent on the different types of igg subclasses  <cit> . however, in human anti-gbm disease, igg subclass distribution along gbm has not been clearly elucidated, and their association with disease severity remains elusive.

the aim of the current study is to investigate the distribution of igg subclass deposition along gbm and tbm on renal biopsy specimens from patients with anti-gbm disease in different clinical spectrum. their association with the clinical and pathological parameters and the outcomes of patients was further explored.

RESULTS
demographic and clinical data of patients
the demographic, clinical and pathological parameters of the  <dig> patients with anti-gbm disease are listed in table  <dig> 

gbm: glomerular basement membrane; anca: anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.

of the  <dig> patients, the average age was  <dig> ± <dig>  years, with a male to female ratio of  <dig> : <dig> . fifteen  patients had pulmonary hemorrhage and presented as goodpasture’s syndrome. the mean level of serum creatinine at presentation was  <dig> ± <dig>  μmol/l. the median level of serum anti-gbm antibodies was 63u/ml . nine  patients were anca positive, with  <dig> specific to mpo and  <dig> specific to pr <dig> 

on renal biopsy, an average of 22± <dig>  glomeruli could be seen in each specimen.  <dig> ± <dig> % of the glomeruli formed crescent and  <dig>  patients were diagnosed of crescentic glomerulonephritis. the percentage of crescents in glomeruli was positively correlated with the level of serum creatinine on diagnosis . linear igg immunofluorescence along gbm was demonstrated for each of the  <dig> patients with staining intensity of 1+~4+ on the scale of  <dig> to  <dig>  in the absence of fluorescence for albumin or a diagnosis of diabetes. complement   <dig> was detected in  <dig> patients . the staining intensity of igg along gbm was correlated with that of c <dig> . the staining intensity of neither igg nor c <dig> presented correlation with the percentage of cellular cresents  or fibrotic crescents .

the distribution of igg subclass deposition along gbm
all the four igg subclasses deposition along gbm were detected on renal biopsy sections from the  <dig> patients  .

anti-gbm igg <dig> was observed along gbm on renal sections in all the  <dig> patients . thirty-nine  patients showed weak and segmental staining on glomeruli, and  <dig>  patients showed strong and linear deposition.

anti-gbm igg <dig> was found on glomeruli in  <dig>  patients, with  <dig>  patients having weak and segmental deposition and  <dig>  patients presenting strong and linear staining.

anti-gbm igg <dig> and igg <dig> were less abundant on the glomeruli. for igg <dig>  only  <dig>  renal samples stained positive and the intensity was weak, spotty and segmental staining along gbm. for igg <dig>  only  <dig>  patients were detected of positive staining, with  <dig> displaying a strong linear deposition along the gbm.

no correlation was found among the four igg subclasses of their distribution and intensity along gbm .

the correlation between igg subclass deposition along gbm and clinical parameters
correlation between the deposition of each igg subclass along gbm and the clinical, pathological data and outcomes of patients were analyzed, including age, gender, exposure to hydrocarbon, smoking, serum level of anti-gbm antibodies, positive anca, prevalence of nephrotic syndrome, hematuria and oliguria/anuria, serum creatinine at presentation, renal histopathology, and the renal/patient outcomes .

gbm: glomerular basement membrane; anca: anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody.

we found that the patients with strong linear staining of igg <dig> along gbm presented with lower prevalence of gross hematuria , higher level of hemoglobin , and lower level of serum creatinine , compared with those with weak staining of igg <dig>  although not statistically significance, the levels of anti-gbm antibodies also seemed to be lower in patients with strong igg <dig> deposition than those with weak deposit .

no correlation was found between the gbm deposition of igg <dig>  igg <dig> or igg <dig> subclass and the clinical, pathological parameters or outcomes of patients with anti-gbm disease .

the distribution of igg subclass deposition along tbm
anti-gbm igg deposition along tbm could be detected in  <dig>  patients . among these patients, the igg subclass distribution along tbm was similar to that of the gbm: igg <dig>  <dig> % , igg <dig>  <dig> % , igg <dig> 100%  and igg <dig>  <dig> % . no correlation was found between the igg subclass distribution along tbm and the clinical data or the outcomes of patients . the degree of interstitial inflammation was more severe in patients with stronger deposits of igg <dig> along tbm .

the correlation between igg subclass deposition on gbm and their level in the sera
out of  <dig> patients whose renal specimens were examined, serum from  <dig> individuals were collected and tested for igg subclass distribution in circulation. the positive rate of igg <dig>  igg <dig>  igg <dig> and igg <dig> were  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , 75%  and  <dig> % , with the average level of  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig> ,  <dig> ± <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig> , respectively. we analyzed the correlation between the serum antibody levels and the intensity of igg subclass deposition on gbm and tbm. no relations was found between them .

discussion
in the current study, we examined the distribution of igg subclass deposition along gbm and tbm on renal biopsy specimens from a large cohort of  <dig> patients with anti-gbm disease. we found that all four igg subclasses could be detected with vastly different distributions. for the deposition on the gbm, igg <dig> was detected in all patients with mild segmental to strong linear staining. igg <dig> was found in approximately half of the patients. igg <dig> was only detected in one fourth of the patients and the intensity of deposition was weak and segmental. igg <dig> was the least abundant subclass detected on the gbm.

the general detection of igg <dig> along the gbm and the tbm suggests that it is likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of renal lesions, which contribute to the development of human anti-gbm disease. the structural characteristics that distinguish the four subclasses are the size of the hinge region and the number and position of the interchain disulfide bonds between heavy chains. with an elongated 62-amino-acid hinge region, igg <dig> molecules are the most effective complement activator  <cit> . therefore, clq could bind more readily to the fc region of igg <dig> and thus facilitate the complement-associated inflammatory response. the general finding of linear or granular c <dig> deposition accompanying igg on gbm supports the activation of complement system in glomeruli during the progress of anti-gbm nephritis  <cit> . another mechanism for igg <dig> inducing tissue damage lies in its high affinity binding to fc receptors  on phagocytic cells to mediate opsonization  <cit> . the igg fc-fcr interaction in glomeruli could also mediate the accumulation of macrophages to induce renal injury  <cit> . accelerated models of anti-gbm glomerulonephritis induced in fcγri−/−, fcγriii−/− and fcrγ−/− mice have demonstrated that fcrγ, especially fcγriii, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis through the antibody-dependent pathway  <cit> . moreover, the copy number variation of fcgr3a <cit>  and the gene polymorphism of fcgr2b <cit>  have been demonstrated as contributors to the susceptibility of anti-gbm disease in chinese population. these mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of renal injury after igg <dig> deposition along gbm and tbm.

in our study, we also detected the circulating igg subclasses against rhα3nc <dig>  which showed that all the four subclasses were presented. in comparison with our previous study  <cit> , we found that most patients from our present study had severe renal damage, with all the four igg subclasses in circulation. the level of circulating igg subclasses was not correlated with the deposition of igg subclasses on renal tissue. the predominant of igg <dig> deposition on glomeruli is in contrast with previous reports about the anti-gbm igg subclass distribution in circulation  <cit> . it is demonstrated that anti-gbm igg in sera is mainly of igg <dig>  and igg <dig>  subclasses. igg <dig> was found in only 12% of the sera from patients  <cit> . we assume it might be difficult to detect igg <dig> in the serum because of its short life time , but it located on glomeruli and induced damage with formation of crescents. although it had no statistical significance, the circulating igg <dig> and tissue igg <dig> showed a mild correlation, which p= <dig> , which might be contributed to the longer life time of igg <dig> in circulation  for easier detection  <cit> . despite its deficiency in sera, the close relationship between igg <dig> and the progression of human anti-gbm nephritis was proven, as igg <dig> being absent in natural anti-gbm antibodies from healthy individuals  <cit> , while occurring in patients with renal dysfunction  <cit> . animal experiments also showed that monoclonal igg2a and igg2b  against α3nc <dig> could induce severe nephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage in rats  <cit> . as an organ-specific autoimmune disease, the immune response of anti-gbm autoantibodies is directed to the target antigen in situ of the glomerular and alveolar basement membrane. thus, the target organs may be damaged much directly by humoral or cellular mechanisms in the local immunity rather than the systemic immunity.

the correlation between the igg subclass deposition and the clinical and pathological parameters of patients was analyzed in the current study. it was shown that patients with strong linear deposition of igg <dig> on gbm presented with milder disease severity with lower serum creatinine and lower circulating anti-gbm antibodies on diagnosis. this finding emphasizes the important role of igg <dig> in the early stage of kidney impairment in human anti-gbm disease. cellular immunity has also been demonstrated to participate in the formation of severe crescentic glomerulonephritis  <cit> . it may be speculated that the structure of glomerular capillary walls are severely damaged and fractured in the later stage of crescent formation, which may result in the deposition of igg showing weaker segmental staining in more severe renal lesions. this may also be the explanation for the different findings from noël et al., who found that igg subclass deposited in glomeruli were mostly igg <dig> and igg <dig>  <cit> . the discrepancies might be explained by the different demographics and ethnicity of patients, different detecting monoclonal antibodies and differences in investigating approaches. in our study, we performed immunohistochemistry instead of immunofluorescence, which was employed by the previous study . we both utilized direct immunofluorescence with strict positive and negative controls. however, the large number of patients in the current study contains patients with different stages of renal impairment, i.e. from the mildest, to severe kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis, provided better opportunities to reveal the distribution of igg subclasses in a wide spectrum of kidney lesions.

igg deposition on tbm was also detected in  <dig> % of the patients, with accordant distribution as it was along gbm. tbm deposition is not common in anti-gbm nephritis  <cit> . we suggested that the high detection rate of igg deposits along tbm may be due to the high sensitivity of immunohistochemistry used in the current study. using this method, we further found that the inflammatory cell infiltration in interstitium was more severe in patients with strong anti-tbm igg <dig> deposits, which implies that the deposition of autoantibodies on tbm may contribute to the inflammatory cell infiltration in renal interstitial and/or causes direct tubular damage.

CONCLUSIONS
anti-gbm igg <dig> predominantly deposits along gbm and tbm on renal biopsy specimens from patients with anti-gbm disease, which may play a pivotal role in the development of anti-gbm glomerulonephritis.
