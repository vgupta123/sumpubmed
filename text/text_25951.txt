BACKGROUND
the pathobiology of acute damage to the cns includes production of the superoxide anion  and other reactive oxygen species that rapidly induce oxidative injury by lipid peroxidation, dna damage and protein nitration  <cit>  many studies in the last decade have focused on the study of antioxidant proteins dealing with oxidative stress in physiological conditions and after injury.

superoxide dismutases are among the most important cellular mechanisms that cope with oxidative stress. in normal conditions, cytosolic copper zinc superoxide dismutase  and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase  are responsible for maintaining low levels of intracellular o2-. by catalyzing its dismutation to oxygen and h2o <dig>  <cit> . in neuronal cells, endogenous cu/zn sod is normally expressed but is rapidly downregulated after several types of acute brain insults  <cit>  rendering the brain more susceptible to oxidative stress. in agreement with its antioxidant role, over-expression of cu/zn sod in adult transgenic rats show pronounced neuroprotection in most acute cns injury models  <cit>  and targeted deletions of the cu/zn sod gene or extracellular sod genes worsens the outcome after focal ischemia in the adult brain  <cit> .

after hypoxic/ischemic injury to the immature cns, contradictory results have been reported in regards to the role of cu/zn sod. brain damage as a result of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic insult is a serious clinical problem with severe neurological consequences, where oxidative stress is known to play a fundamental role  <cit> . in previous studies using n-methyl-d-aspartate -mediated excitotoxicity, a model for hypoxic-ischemic injury to the postnatal brain  <cit> , we have shown an upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase  and cyclooxygenase- <dig>   <cit>  and increased levels of the oxidative marker nitrotyrosine  <cit> . however, while a slightly worsened neuropathological outcome was observed in postnatal transgenic mice over-expressing cu/zn sod  <cit> , several antioxidant molecules including sod mimetics like o2-. dismuting metalloporphyrins have been shown to be neuroprotective  <cit> . in this sense, several differences between immature and adult animals in terms of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses have been described including: upregulation of gluthathione peroxidase in the damaged adult brain but not in the damaged immature brain after trauma  <cit> , the rapid free iron accumulation within  <dig> hours after transient cerebral ischemia stimulating fenton reactions in the immature brain  <cit> , the lesser concentration of metallothioneins, potent metal-binding antioxidant enzymes in the immature brain  <cit> . finally, the postnatal brain is more sensitive than the adult brain to the neurotoxic actions of nmda  <cit>  which will lead to increased o2-. generation  <cit> . in view of these contradictory findings of cu/zn sod expression, we induced a transient post-injury overexpression of cu/zn sod after excitotoxic damage to the immature rat brain using a novel non-viral gene therapy approach.

the design of non-viral vectors showing transgene expression in the brain has recently gained interest  <cit>  due to the limitations imposed by viral vectors  <cit> . non-viral modular approaches for gene therapy vectors based on the combination of several functional domains in a single polypeptide chain are of particular interest because of recombinant dna methodologies that allow tailored designed vectors. the production of such protein vectors also permits a convenient scaling up and the vehicles exhibit high stability suitable for therapeutic uses. we have previously reported the construction of a recombinant modular protein vector that combines different functional domains displayed by e. coli β-galactosidase then engineered to conveniently accommodate a poly-lysine tail with dna condensing/attaching properties and an integrin targeting rgd motif with cell attachment and internalization properties  <cit> . the resulting vector was capable of transferring a transgene to the intact and lesioned brain without any detectable acute inflammatory reaction or immune activation  <cit> . we have further improved the transfection efficiency of this modular vector by introducing the nuclear localization motif of the sv <dig> virus, generating the vector nlsct  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to assess the potential efficacy of the recombinant modular protein vector nlsct complexed to the cu/zn sod gene to improve neurological outcome after an acute excitotoxic injury to the immature brain.

RESULTS
lesion volume and neuronal cell death
the injection of nmda into the sensorimotor cortex of the postnatal brain induces a well-characterized excitotoxic lesion  <cit>  which includes the sensorimotor cortex, the dorso-medial striatum, and the rostral hippocampus.

rat brains injected two hours after the lesion with the nlsct vector carrying the antioxidant enzyme cu/zn sod transgene  showed a pronounced reduction in the neurodegenerative area when compared to both the nmda only group and the nmda+saline group. the percentage of lesioned hemisphere volume was reduced by  <dig> % in comparison with nmda+saline animals . the distribution of the lesion along the antero-posterior axis showed that the reduction in the neurodegenerative area extended rostrocaudally to all affected regions including cortex, striatum and hippocampus . both primary lesioned areas such as the sensorimotor cortex, and secondary lesioned areas like the caudal sub-plate neuronal layer, striatum and hippocampus showed a reduction in the extent of neurodegeneration. surprisingly, the negative control, with the nlsct vector carrying the gfp transgene , showed a less pronounced but significant reduction in the neurodegenerative area. the nmda+gfp group was only significantly different from the nmda+saline group and not the nmda only group .

to confirm the reduction in the extent of neurodegeneration, remaining neurons  and degenerating neurons  present in various secondary degenerating regions were quantified. in nmda+cu/zn sod animals, the number of nissl stained neurons in secondary degenerating regions such as, the lateral sensorimotor cortex where higher than those observed in nmda+gfp animals. nmda+cu/zn sod animals also showed increased neuroprotection at the caudal region of hippocampal ca <dig> layer . accordingly, in nmda+cu/zn sod animals, fluoro-jade b stained degenerating neuron cell counts showed a significant reduction in the number of stained neurons at the caudal region of hippocampal ca <dig> layer whereas a not significant reduction was seen in the temporal cortex  . in contrast, in the nmda+gfp group similar numbers of nissl stained neurons in the sensorimotor cortex were seen when compared to nmda+saline animals. moreover, the number of nissl-stained neurons at the ca <dig> layer of the hippocampus was only significantly higher at a greater distance from the lesion site in nmda+gfp animals when compared to nmda+saline animals, showing less pronounced neuroprotection than the nmda+cu/zn sod animals . although nmda+gfp animals displayed reduced numbers of fluorojade b degenerating neurons in the hippocampal ca <dig> region in relation to the nmda+saline group, the reduction occurred only to a limited extent when compared to nmda+cu/zn sod animals .

to determine if the reduction in the neurodegenerative area observed after the treatment with the nlsct vector carrying the control gfp transgene was due to the dna molecule or intrinsic to the nlsct vector, we injected lesioned rats with the naked nlsct vector. interestingly, the nlsct vector alone induced a significant  <dig> % reduction of lesion volume , reproducing the results obtained after the treatment with the nlsct vector carrying the gfp transgene.

tyrosine nitration
protein tyrosine nitration is a footprint of peroxynitrite and other reactive species formation  <cit> . as we have previously described in detail  <cit> , excitotoxic damage induces nitration in astrocytes and neuronal cells within the neurodegenerating area during the first  <dig> hours post-lesion and in the border of the lesion at longer survival times . in nmda+cu/zn sod animals, densitometrical measurements in a degenerating area at the border of the lesion such as the caudal region of the ca <dig> hippocampal layer showed a significant reduction in tyrosine nitration  in relation to nmda+saline animals . densitometry in the nmda+gfp animals  was not significantly different from the nmda+saline group .

functional outcome
interestingly, neurological tests carried out showed that only the cu/zn sod overexpressing animals recovered significantly from the injury. in the inclinated grid climbing test, where general motor coordination is evaluated, only nmda+cu/zn sod animals showed significant and near complete recuperation of the time spent in the inclinated grid at  <dig> days, statistically indistinguishable from the non-lesioned saline injected animals . both nmda+saline and nmda+gfp injected animals showed a reduced performance in this task until  <dig> days, the last time analyzed. in addition to the improvement of the nmda+sod injected animals observed in the grid climbing test, the spontaneous turning behaviour, a neurological sign of un-balanced striatal neurotransmission, also showed a similar profile . nmda+saline and nmda+gfp animals showed a significant spontaneous net turning toward the ipsilateral side at  <dig> day when compared with non-lesioned saline injected animals. in contrast, nmda+cu/zn sod animals did not show any bias on their net turning behaviour, not differing significantly from the non-lesioned saline injected rats. all groups performed equally well on an open field motor task , demonstrating similar motor activity, which could not account for the differences observed in both of the neurological tests performed. in addition, a general improvement of the cu/zn sod overexpressing rats could also be observed in the development-mediated daily weight increase  where again, only the cu/zn sod over-expressing animals were statistically indistinguishable from the non-lesioned saline injected controls.

discussion
this study shows for the first time that consistent functional and neuropathological recovery from acute immature brain damage can be achieved by post-lesion overexpression of the cu/zn sod antioxidant enzyme delivered through a modular multifunctional protein vector. this treatment protected against excitotoxic damage, thought to be an important mechanism underlying neuronal death after hypoxic/ischemic injury to the neonate  <cit> , but also in acute adult brain neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke  <cit>  and traumatic brain injury  <cit> , as well as in chronic ones as alzheimer's  <cit> , parkinson's  <cit>  and huntington's  <cit>  disease.

cu/zn sod as a therapeutic transgene
in this study, the cu/zn sod transgene was expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter and as such, expressed in any cell type. we have previously shown that after postnatal excitotoxic injury, neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells are the main cell types showing transgene expression mediated by nlsct-type vectors  <cit> . under physiological conditions, cu/zn sod is mainly expressed in neurons  <cit> , however, in our experimental conditions several glial cell types are also transfected  <cit>  and could indirectly mediate the neuroprotective effect. noteworthy, o2-. produced after damage in both neurons and glial cells can be dismutated to h2o <dig> by cu/zn sod activity, hindering the formation of the potent oxidant and protein nitrating agent peroxynitrite  <cit> . the reduction in the levels of nitrotyrosine reported here support this mechanism of cu/zn sod neuroprotection. interestingly, there is a great deal of evidence that suggests that o2-./peroxinitrite species toxicity is higher than that of h2o <dig>  a study of cu/zn sod overexpressing astrocytes exposed to o2-. found that they had higher survival rates than control astrocytes even when glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities were blocked and gsh levels depleted  <cit> . cu/zn sod overexpressing astrocytes also survived better that control astrocytes after oxygen glucose deprivation, in the absence of glutathione peroxidase upregulation and with a lower catalase upregulation in comparison to control astrocytes  <cit> . these cu/zn sod overexpressing astrocytes, unlike controls, also maintained elevated gsh concentration. peroxinitrite but not h2o <dig> has also been shown to trigger an in vitro reactive phenotype of astrocytes that is toxic for co-cultured motor neurons  <cit> . these data suggest that overproduction of h2o <dig> is not a major factor in astrocytic injury. on the other hand, specific scavenging of o2-. can also increase neuronal survival under some pathologically relevant conditions. for example, motor neurons can be rescued from trophic factor withdrawal by liposome-mediated cu/zn sod protein delivery  <cit>  and synthetic sod mimetics  <cit> . neuronal cultures can also be protected from excitotoxicity by sod mimetics  <cit> , adenovirally mediated overexpression of cu/zn sod  <cit> , or transgenically overexpressed cu/zn sod  <cit> . however, in some particular cases, cu/zn sod overexpression can reduce neuronal survival during direct extracellular exposure to superoxide generators by a mechanism involving excess h2o <dig> accumulation  <cit> , while protecting from direct h2o <dig> treatment  <cit> . finally, some research suggests that o2-. is more toxic than h2o <dig> by reacting with no to form peroxinitrite  <cit>  as been shown by inhibition of no production in neuronal cultures submitted to an excitotoxic damage. this treatment is sufficient for inducing neuroprotection  <cit> , while o2-. and h2o <dig> are still being formed but will not be so toxic. thus, the increase in cu/zn sod expression in neurons and astrocytes most likely contributes to the neuroprotection observed in vivo.

regarding lesion volume, we show a significant decrease in all nlsct treated animals when compared to nmda+saline injected animals, but no difference between these nlsct treated groups. however, only the cu/zn sod treated animals showed a significant reduction in lesion volume compared to nmda alone lesioned animals, which is in fact the real control of the therapeutic gene therapy approach. it is important to consider the functional recovery induced by cu/zn sod therapy in both of the neurological evaluation tests that could reflect increased preservation of functional synaptic contacts and white matter tracts. the reduction in the developmental increase in daily body weight observed in lesioned animals and gfp treated animals was not observed in cu/zn sod treated animals, which also supports the general improvement of these animals.

in accordance with our findings, sod mimetics  were shown to be neuroprotective after ischemia in the immature brain  <cit> . however, our results contrast with the previously reported exacerbation of hypoxic/ischemic injury occurring in immature transgenic mice over expressing cu/zn sod  <cit> . though the reason for this difference is not clear, several reasons besides species specificity and lesion model could contribute to its explanation. in our experimental conditions, the nlsct vector induced a transient and lower level of cu/zn sod transgene expression compared to the higher and permanent expression found in transgenic mice. it has previously been shown that very high levels of cu/zn sod, as those observed in transgenic animals, can produce alterations such as, an increase in basal lipid peroxidation  <cit> , mitochondrial vaquolation  <cit> , abnormalities in neuromuscular junctions  <cit> , or deficits in long-term potentiation  and spatial memory  <cit> . furthermore, after life-long overexpression of cu/zn sod, compensatory changes in the basal levels or induction of other antioxidant enzymes like mn sod  <cit> , heme oxygenase  <cit> , or glutathione peroxidase  <cit>  have been documented that provide an altered redox balance in transgenic animals.

in regards to expression levels, it has been reported that polyethylene glycol-conjugated cu/zn sod treatment after focal ischemia showed a u-shaped dose-response curve, implying that the effective neuroprotective dose of this enzyme may be in fact concentration restricted  <cit> . therefore, several parameters like protein levels, time-course and cell population of cu/zn sod expression could affect the overall outcome after the lesion and underlie the differences between gene therapy and transgenic mice approaches.

nlsct vector for neuroprotective gene therapy
studies showing phenotypic or functional effects derived from transgene expression in the cns are generally absent  <cit> . regarding non-viral vectors, only one flexible liposome/antibody-conjugated non-viral vector has been reported to induce functional recovery, reversing motor abnormalities after a 6-hydroxydopamine striatal lesion  <cit> .

several multifunctional protein vectors have been developed by combining functional modules from different origins, driving the four main steps for successful dna transfer to the cell nucleus: dna ligation-condensation, cell attachment-internalization, endosome disruption-escaping, and nuclear import. although many of these prototypes can transfect cells in culture, their efficiency in vivo is very limited . we have previously shown that an earlier version of the nlsct modular vector had a restricted capacity for transgene delivery to the intact brain. however, it was very efficient in conducting widespread transgene expression after an excitotoxic lesion  <cit> , probably due to the disruption of the extracellular matrix and the small size of the vector/dna complexes   <cit> . in this study, we show that nlsct had a very high transfection efficiency, only  <dig> ng of nlsct-coated cu/zn sod plasmid was able to reduce oxidative stress and rescue neurons from cell death in different areas of the lesion border, that considerably reduced the total lesion volume and increased functional outcome. this transfection efficiency could be due to integrin mediated endocytosis and enhanced transit towards the nuclear compartment mediated by the sv <dig> viral nuclear localization sequence of nlsct  <cit> . it could also be due to massive neuronal endocytosis that reaches the nuclear compartment, a process previously described in neuronal cells within a few hours after injection of toxic and sub-toxic doses of nmda or kainate  <cit> .

transient cu/zn sod expression induced by nlsct-mediated gene therapy seems to be an important parameter in conferring neuroprotection. in the same experimental model as the one used here, and also using the transgene regulated by the cmv promoter, the expression of the gfp transgene was transient, almost disappearing at  <dig> days postinjury  <cit> . whereas a prolonged stable delivery of a transgene would be desirable for long-term improvement of pathologies such as inherited monogenic defects, transient transgene delivery may be more beneficial than a constitutive expression for therapeutic intervention after acute cns damage.

interestingly, both the nlsct vector carrying a control transgene and the nude vector showed a significant grade of neuroprotection, indicating that the effect was intrinsic to the nlsct vector. one of the bioactive motifs of nlsct is the foot-and-mouth disease virus integrin-interacting rgd peptide, which interacts preferentially with different αv integrins  <cit> . this may suggest that our results with the vector show a neuroprotective effect mediated by the interaction between the rgd motif of nlsct and specific integrins through an unknown mechanism. this is supported by a recent study showing that blocking αd/β <dig> integrins is strongly neuroprotective after spinal cord injury  <cit> . in addition, although the nlsct vector inhibits the interaction of rgd dependent integrins with their natural extracellular matrix ligands, it could be directly activating integrin outside-in signaling events  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we show that transient overexpression of cu/zn sod after an excitotoxic injury to the immature rat brain using a modular protein for non-viral gene delivery can be neuroprotective and improve functional outcome; signalling this vector as a promising tool for in vivo gene therapy strategies for acute cns lesions.
