BACKGROUND
prion diseases are infectious neurodegenerative diseases with slow development and lethal outcome. the active agents in this disease family are called prions. prion diseases are unique as a normal host cellular protein, prion protein , is usually affected by conformational change and aggregation which leads to the accumulation of prpd , usually in the nervous system  <cit> . there is indeed no specific nucleic acid involved  <cit> . prpd is partly resistant to digestion by proteases and the resultant product of such digestion  is used in diagnostic applications as a highly reliable disease marker  <cit> . usually, the brain shows microscopic symmetrical spongiosis. prion diseases are therefore also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies . these diseases in animals are mainly transmitted by the dietary route and already described for centuries in sheep as scrapie. other examples of tse are chronic wasting disease in deer and elk , creutzfeldt-jakob disease in humans , transmissible mink encephalopathy and bovine spongiform encephalopathy , also known as mad cow disease. evidence for transmission of bse was found in various other mammals including humans, where it causes a form of cjd - variant cjd  - which affects especially young persons and exhibits unique molecular and histological features  <cit> .

while in scrapie and other tses strain variations were found, bse initially showed strain homogeneity  <cit> . indeed, incubation time, vacuolar lesion profile and biochemical signature of prpd were identical for all investigated cases. this uniform aspect of the bse prions during the epidemic was probably due to the contamination of the food chain by a single strain in united kingdom  <cit> .

however, due to the extensive active surveillance and new research techniques, rare variants of bse have been reported since  <dig>  <cit>  of which most could be classified in two new types of bse: h- and l-type  <cit> . the analysis of their features in bioassay showed that these emerging types represent different strains of bse  <cit> . two well identified atypical forms of bse have been described. western blot studies showed that, in comparison to classical bse , they are characterised by a higher or lower molecular mass of the unglycosylated prpres and were thus named h-type and l-type bse  <cit> . l-type is also called bovine amyloid spongiform encephalopathy or base. the prpres glycoprofile is a very practical marker for the l-type, which shows a much lower proportion of diglycosylated prpres  than c-type . for h-type, a relatively high reactivity with antibody 12b <dig> is archetypal because of the characteristic presence of its epitope at the n-terminal end of prpres. a second characteristic of h-type involves a dualistic glycoprofile depending on the antibody used. as the brain area of the prpres deposition can differ drastically between the l- and c-type  <cit>  and potentially also between h- and c-type, it would be better if the sampling techniques presently used are adapted to these atypical types.

such types are very rare; only  <dig> cases were described worldwide and these were all detected in old bovines   <cit> , except one case from a  <dig> month old cow that could not be further investigated in depth due to shortage of sample  <cit> . they were reported on different continents. indeed they might correspond to natural "sporadic" forms of bse, not originating from the contamination of the food chain  <cit> . in the past, a  <dig> month old unclassified bse case was described in belgium when molecular typing techniques and comparison with l- and h-types was not available  <cit> . this sample was re-examined with the current techniques in the present study. it is essential for the surveillance programmes to determine the prevalence on a global level of these atypical types. therefore this study retrospectively analysed the bovines of at least 7-years-old in the belgian archive of bse-diagnosed cattle, using the latter criteria and techniques, in order to determine whether these types of atypical bse were present in old bse-positive bovines in belgium.

RESULTS
firstly the h-, l- and c-type reference samples were investigated. in the h-type sample, the unglycosylated band migrated at a higher gel position than in the c-type; moreover the h-type reacted strongly to 12b <dig> contrary to c- and l-type. it showed a dualistic glycoprofile between group b antibody sha <dig> and group c antibody saf <dig> . furthermore, h-type bse showed a fourth band of low molecular mass when antibody saf <dig> was applied . in addition of the absence of 12b <dig> reactivity as mentioned above, the analysed l-type showed similar glycoprofile with group b and c antibody, with a high proportion of monoglycosylated band .

the analyses of the belgian bse archive did not yield any atypical case. as an illustration, blots obtained with the five different antibodies for seven given samples are presented in fig.  <dig>  in this figure, prpres was clearly detected with group b and c antibodies. as it is typical for c-type and l-type bse, the 12b <dig> n-terminal epitope is largely removed by proteinase k in all analyzed samples and this is most evident when comparing the signals of 12b <dig> with those of sha <dig> 

the apparent molecular mass  obtained for the  <dig> samples with sha <dig> can be found in fig.  <dig>  the observed molecular masses display a great variability which can be ascribed to the inaccurate capacity of sds-page for a reliable estimation of the small mr differences between the unglycosylated prpres bands of different samples even if measured in triplicate or more. as main evidence for discrimination, the group a antibody 12b <dig> hardly bound compared to group b antibody sha <dig>  and the glycoprofiles of all the samples exhibited a typical c-type glycoprofile with group b and group c antibodies with >55% diglycosylated prpres band. to further exemplify this, the glycoprofiles of the individual samples as probed with antibody 94b <dig> have been plotted in fig.  <dig> and compared with the l-type and h-type results. in this last figure, it is clear that the glycoprofiles of the samples did correspond to that of c-type, as characterized by a fraction of diglycosylated prpres of 55% or more using group c antibody ; the l-type and h-type showed diglycosylated fractions below 50%. therefore, all cases of age  <dig> years and older have the features of c-type bse. the discrimination is easier than in a previous report  <cit> ; this can be due to a better resolution of the blots and thus a more accurate estimation linked to the use of an imager in the present study instead of photographic film plus subsequent digitalisation with a scanner. while another group c antibody  also allowed a straightforward discrimination, a group b antibody  did not . thus, depending on the antibody used, the h-type sample exhibited a different glycoprofile .

a previously reported 5-year old case demonstrated a fast migration of the unglycosylated band at the time  <cit> . however, reinvestigation of available little left-over material with the current improved tools and knowledge lead to the conclusion that this case does belong to the c-type category .

discussion
this study supports that, among the bse cases of  <dig> years and older identified in belgium, none was apparently of the h- or l- type. unfortunately, three aged bse cases have not been investigated due to insufficient availability of positive tissue. nevertheless, as atypical bse remains very rare, our results are not incongruous. our previously reported case from  <cit>  reinvestigated with the current improved tools lead to the conclusion that this case does belong to the c-type category.

the results shed some light on the worldwide prevalence of atypical bse. the absence of atypical cases can be linked to the limited sample size due to the dimension of belgium, and is also likely to occur when comparing the variable prevalences found in other countries like france , poland , italy , the netherlands , germany , united kingdom , switzerland  and catalunya, spain   <cit> . in all these countries, all cattle of  <dig> years and older have been tested post-mortem for the presence of bse using sensitive screening methods. an extensive study already estimated the frequency of h-type and l-type bse in france to  <dig>  and  <dig>  per million cattle more than eight years of age  <cit> . this corresponds to  <dig>  and  <dig>  atypical cases per million of tested cattle. with almost three million cattle tested in belgium since  <dig>  one could have expected to find roughly one h-type and one l-type . it is also possible though difficult to prove, that atypical cases have been missed during the routine surveillance programme due to 1) an unusual location of the prpres deposition in the brain since at least l-types have a preferential distribution of prpres in the forebrain region  <cit>  and active surveillance methods are based on the brainstem; and 2) a susceptibility of critical epitopes of prpres in l- and/or h-type cases to proteinase treatment used for detection combined with the method  used for initial screening . with respect to the latter point, screening tests have been developed using c-type cases which appear to be more resistant to digestion with proteinase k than h- and l-type cases  <cit> . however, it must be mentioned that a significant proportion of l- and h-type cases were detected using this type of capture elisa  <cit> , the most frequently test used up till  <dig>  this issue of suitability of screening tests needs nevertheless more attention in future studies when sufficient material is available e.g. from experimentally infected animals.

the age of tested cohort is a determining factor. for example, the cattle population in poland is older than in other european countries and this country presents high atypical-bse prevalence   <cit> . however this does not fully explain the prevalence of atypical bse, as the netherlands have a higher prevalence with an age structure of bovine population similar to that of belgium. for now, the importance of the spontaneous aspect of  bse remains an open question.

the frequencies of atypical bse cases are similar to those of the human sporadic creutzfeldt-jakob disease . indeed atypical cases were detected in bse-exposed countries  as well as in a low bse-exposed country . this reinforces the hypothesis of a sporadic origin of atypical bse  <cit> . these atypical bse cases might have existed previously and by their very low frequency remained undetectable for veterinarians, until the introduction of the active surveillance programmes and improvements of diagnostic tools

the origin of the current bse epidemic could be linked to atypical bse, especially in view of the properties of l-type   <cit> . it is however also not excluded that the real source of the epidemic was derived from c-type case , and thus that such cases have always existed sporadically. in such situation when continuing surveillance, c-type cases will be detected in older animals at a stable sporadic level. potentially brain stem might not be the first site for prpres development.

about the typing technique used, it is important to note that the apparent molecular mass differences can be useful but present as rather imprecise and impractical criteria for molecular typing of prpres . the h-types can be discriminated with that measure if compared with c-types . however, given the precision of the western blot technique, the differences in apparent molecular mass of prpres for l-types are too small to be undoubtedly detected   <cit> . other properties yield a more robust approach. for example, the affinity to prpres to the antibodies from different groups makes h-types easily detectable. group a antibodies like 12b <dig> are in comparison to group b antibodies highly reactive due to the n-terminal epitope present, and group c antibodies like saf <dig> and 94b <dig> recognize a fourth band . this band corresponds to the unglycosylated moiety of a second population of prpres triplet. this feature is unique for h-type and thus a fundamental characteristic of this strain  <cit> . it is not known if this phenomenon occurs in vivo or is a by-product of proteinase k treatment. a powerful discrimination tool remains the comparison of glycoprofiles, i.e. the proportions of the three forms of the prp. l-types and c-types differ by their proportion of diglycosyl-prpres which is respectively at/below and above 50% of total prpres. these proportions remain visible whether detection is performed with group b or c antibodies. however, h-types have a dualistic glycoprofile with high proportion of diglycosyl moiety when tested with group a and b antibodies and high proportion of monoglycosyl-prp when tested with group c antibodies . in h-types the dualistic phenomenon is linked to the presence of a second prp population with a very short c-terminal region detected only by c-terminus specific antibodies. the three prpres moieties of this second population  are 5- <dig> kda smaller in molecular mass than those of the first population  and are only detectable by group c antibodies like saf <dig> and 94b <dig>  consequently the migration position of diglycosylated band in prpres- <dig> coincides with that of the monoglycosylated band of population prpres- <dig>  <cit> .

the emergence of atypical types of bse is due to the active surveillance screening, a better awareness of prion strain variations, and more efficient diagnostic techniques. however considering molecular properties, prpres in atypical cases is more susceptible to proteinase k treatment and the area in the brain where prpres is deposited differs at least between c- and l-types. it is therefore essential to ascertain that the routine sampling and analytical techniques are adapted to these new types. as these new strains seem more virulent than classical types, at least in mice models  <cit> , they represent one of the next challenges in the field of prions.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis of the old bovines in the belgian archive did not show any atypical bse case in these cohorts. the study implied  <dig> bovines of at least  <dig> years of age. even with the restricted size of belgium, one could have expected a few atypical cases . this difference can be random or linked to an unknown particularity of our samples. anyway, the results help to estimate the worldwide prevalence of atypical bse.
