BACKGROUND
developmental signals induce changes in gene expression and chromatin structure in order to define cell identity. epigenetic mechanisms, and dna methylation in particular, are essential for mammalian development being involved in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity by creating cellular memory during embryonic development . dna methylation controls x-chromosome inactivation, expression of imprinted genes, represses the transcription of repeated sequences and prevents relocation of transposable elements . in addition, dna methylation affects gene expression by regulating promoters and distal regulatory elements, such as enhancers and insulators . in the last few years, global analyses of dna methylation dynamics in pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny have begun to uncover the mechanisms involving coordinated changes occurring in the epigenome that are essential for lineage-specification and maintenance of cellular identity . very recently, we reported the genome-wide comparison of the dna methylation profiles of pluripotent embryonic stem cells and muscle stem cells showing, in agreement with other studies, that cellular differentiation is associated with a modest but global increase in dna methylation, which interestingly is accompanied by lineage-specific demethylation  <cit> . although the mechanisms controlling dna demethylation are still not well defined, several studies suggest the involvement of two major pathways in this process: the activity of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase proteins  <cit>  and aid/apobec cytidine deaminase enzymes . importantly, active dna demethylation was reported in human muscle-specific genes in heterokaryons derived from the fusion of human non-muscle cells with mouse muscle cells, indicating a dynamic dna methylation/demethylation interplay during muscle differentiation  <cit> .

skeletal muscle is the tissue accounting for the largest percentage of body mass and contributes to multiple body functions including the voluntary movements. the skeletal muscle is mainly composed of highly specialized and terminally differentiated multinuclear, post mitotic and contractile myofibres, and a small pool of muscle stem cells, known as satellite cells , which are essential for the growth, maintenance and regeneration of skeletal muscle throughout life , as well as silencing of other lineage-specifying genes . in addition, members of the pax gene family pax <dig> and pax <dig> lie upstream of mrfs and their expression is crucial to regulate muscle progenitor cell functions  <cit> . pax <dig> is essential for the formation and maintenance of scs, being expressed in quiescent and activated scs, as well as in proliferating myogenic progenitors  <cit> .

in the present study, we addressed for the first time the dna methylation dynamics of the major genes orchestrating myogenic determination and differentiation by comparing pluripotent escs, myogenic precursors from pax7-inducible escs, proliferating muscle stem cells, and their respective myotube derivatives. our results showed a common muscle-specific dna demethylation signature required to acquire and maintain the muscle-cell identity. notably, downregulation of the muscle-specific cytidine deaminase apobec <dig> in es-derived myogenic precursors reduced myogenin-associated dna demethylation and dramatically affected the expression of differentiation markers and, ultimately, muscle differentiation.

RESULTS
dna methylation profile of myogenic genes harbouring cpg island-promoters during myogenic differentiation
to elucidate dna methylation dynamics associated with skeletal myogenic lineage commitment and terminal differentiation, we focused the analysis on genes known to be associated with this process: developmental genes , myogenic regulatory factors  and terminal differentiation genes . interestingly, these genes could also be classified according to their cpg distribution, which represent sites of potential dna methylation. pax <dig>  pax <dig> and myod contain cpg islands  in their promoters, belonging to the cpg-rich genes category; meanwhile, the other genes do not have cgi and their promoters are considered cpg-poor. using bisulphite sequencing analysis, we compared the dna methylation state of undifferentiated escs and muscle stem cells, isolated from adult skeletal muscle tissue, along with respective differentiated myotubes and mature myofibres . in addition, to assess whether the dna methylation events were muscle-lineage specific, we analysed the methylation profiles of the following non-myogenic cell lines: neuronal precursor cells , mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and cardiomyocytes . as shown in additional file 1a, b, all analysed cgis in pax <dig> and pax <dig> regulatory regions were completely unmethylated in all the samples. similar results were previously reported for myod cgi  <cit> . these results were expected since cgis, usually located in the promoter regions of housekeeping and developmental genes, are known to be largely resistant to dna methylation .fig.  <dig> epigenetic profile of myogenic genes harbouring a cpg island-promoter during myogenic differentiation. a diagram of the myogenic differentiation model and the main genes driving myogenesis. cpg-rich and cpg-poor promoter genes are indicated in green and in blue, respectively. b scheme of the pax <dig>  pax <dig> and myod genes and their associated cgis  and enhancer regions . dna methylation and expression of each gene were analysed in two biological duplicates of escs, myoblasts , myotubes , myofibres , and npc, hl <dig> and mef cell lines. each circle represents a cpg dinucleotide, and its position relative to the tss is indicated below. the colour gradient represents the level of methylation indicated in the legend. bar charts show gene expression values measured by qrt-pcr and normalized by 18s expression . n.d. means non detectable. c histone marks distribution and p <dig> binding in esc , mb  and mt  obtained from encode project and dynlatch’s lab  <cit> . cgis cpg islands, escs embryonic stem cells, npcs neuronal precursor cells, hl <dig> cardiomyocytes, mefs mouse embryonic fibroblasts, tss transcription start site



since dna methylation often occurs in non-cgi regions, we investigated whether enhancers and promoters present a cell-specific deposition of this modification. previous studies of other groups identified two muscle-specific regulatory regions upstream of the myod transcription start site , located at -20 kb and -5 kb, respectively . importantly, it was shown that the distal myod enhancer located at -20 kb of the tss was modulated by dna methylation in mouse tissues  <cit> . therefore, we analysed the methylation status of pax <dig> hypaxial somatic enhancer  <cit>  located at -8 kb of the pax <dig> tss, the pax <dig> region containing the critical rbp-jκ binding site  <cit>  located at - <dig>  kb of pax <dig> tss, and the two myod enhancer regions. as shown in fig. 1b, although these regulatory regions were totally or partially methylated in escs and in non-muscle cells, pax <dig> and -20 kb myod enhancers were almost completely free of methylation in myogenic cells, which correlates with gene expression . on the contrary, the pax <dig> and -5 kb distal regulatory region of myod were both found highly methylated in muscle cells , suggesting that their activation would be independent of dna methylation. notably, npcs and hl <dig> cells presented high levels of pax <dig> expression, despite high dna methylation levels. this result would suggest that the pax <dig> hypaxial enhancer might be mainly associated to enhance pax <dig> expression in committed skeletal myogenic cells.

next, to further characterize the epigenetic landscape involved in myogenic regulation, we took advantage of publicly available chip-seq data of histone post-translational modifications  <cit> . as schematized in fig. 1c, pax <dig>  pax <dig> and myod promoters showed a bivalent chromatin state characterized by histone  <dig> trimethylated on lysine  <dig>  and lysine  <dig>  in escs, which has been associated to poised transcription  <cit> . this bivalent state was clearly resolved in favour of the positive mark h3k4me <dig> at myoblast  and myotube  stages for myod, whereas the developmental genes pax <dig> and pax <dig> retained the bivalent state . the analysis of these loci, including enhancer and distal regions, showed a gain in deposition of histone  <dig> monomethyl-lysine <dig> , acetyl-lysine  <dig>  and increased recruitment of the p <dig> acetyltransferase at mb stage, and also at mts in the case of myod. since myod is already higher expressed in mbs, this maintenance of active enhancer marks in mts might be involved in keeping an open chromatin state of the region to maintain gene expression, rather than promoting further transcriptional activation. all together, these results indicate that the unmethylated state of cgis is conserved across the different cell types, whereas pax <dig> and -20 kb myod enhancer element show cell type-specific dynamic methylation patterns associated with changes in gene expression.

myogenic-specific promoters undergo dna demethylation during muscle-lineage specification
unlike myod, all the other mrfs myf <dig>  mrf <dig> and myog, as well as the muscle differentiation markers display low cpg content promoters. the analysis of the promoter region, containing e-box and mef <dig> binding sites, of myog and the other differentiation genes ckm, myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> revealed high levels of methylation in escs and non-muscle cells, correlating with gene silencing, whereas the promoter regions in muscle cells were unmethylated . interestingly, these differentiation genes became demethylated at the mb stage but remained silenced. these myogenic genes were not bivalent at the esc stage and only presented active chromatin marks  in the promoter regions according to their expression timing. strikingly, the terminal differentiation genes myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> gained the repressive mark h3k27me <dig> in mb cells after dna demethylation, suggesting that gene expression was maintained epigenetically repressed by prc <dig> complex until the onset of the terminal differentiation stage . interestingly, mrf <dig> followed a different dna methylation pattern, being highly demethylated only in mature myofibres, where it is specifically highly expressed .fig.  <dig> epigenetic profile of muscle-specific cpg-poor promoter genes during myogenesis. a scheme of the myog, mrf <dig>  ckm and myh <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci. regions analysed by sodium bisulphite sequencing are indicated in red. two biological replicates were performed for escs, myoblasts , myotubes  and myofibres  and in npc, hl <dig> and mef cell lines. each circle represents a cpg dinucleotide and its position relative to the tss is indicated below. the colour gradient represents the level of methylation indicated in the legend. bar charts show gene expression values measured by qrt-pcr and normalized by 18s expression . n.d. means non detectable. b histone marks distribution and p <dig> binding in esc , mb  and mt  obtained from encode project and dynlatch’s lab  <cit> . escs embryonic stem cells, npcs neuronal precursor cells, hl <dig> cardiomyocytes, mefs mouse embryonic fibroblasts, tss transcription start site



we also investigated the epigenetic profile of highly expressed pluripotency genes in esc that become silenced in mb and mt. genes containing a cgi overlapping their promoter region, such as sox <dig> and fgf <dig>  were totally unmethylated in all cell types, whereas genes with cpg-poor content promoters, such as dppa <dig> and pou5f <dig>  became highly hypermethylated upon cellular differentiation . regarding histone marks, esc showed high levels of h3k4me <dig> in the promoter regions of sox <dig> and fgf <dig>  whereas mb and mt cells gained h3k27me <dig> in association with gene silencing . dppa <dig> and pou5f <dig> promoters presented also the active marks h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac. however, in differentiating cells the h3k27me <dig> mark was not acquired  or in a very small extent , leaving the gain of dna methylation as the postulated epigenetic silencing mechanism .

all together, these results suggest that myogenic differentiation genes become demethylated at cpg-poor regulatory regions during muscle-lineage determination, and are maintained silenced by the polycomb repressive histone mark h3k27me <dig> until gene activation. in contrast, pluripotency gene silencing involves complete dna methylation or gain of h3k27me <dig> mark, depending on promoter cpg context.

pax7-induced es-derived muscle differentiation recapitulates myogenic dna methylation changes
in order to recapitulate the commitment of myogenic precursors during embryonic development, we utilized mouse es cells engineered to express pax <dig> under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter   <cit> . at day  <dig> of embryoid body  differentiation pax <dig> transgene expression was induced by doxycycline , and at day  <dig> of eb differentiation the mesodermal precursor cells  were sorted, with or without dox, and grown for  <dig> more days . importantly, only the ipax7-es-derived myogenic precursors treated with dox expressed myogenic differentiation markers such as myogenin, ckm and myh <dig> and generated myotubes upon differentiation . to assess to what extent the ipax7-es-derived myogenic progenitors were epigenetically reprogrammed, we evaluated the dna methylation state of the main myogenic genes in three independent time courses. as expected, preliminary analysis revealed the complete unmethylated state of the cgi located at the pax <dig> and myod promoter regions during the differentiation process . importantly, the cpg-poor myogenic regulatory regions also showed a very similar dna methylation signature compared to primary muscle stem cells and, interestingly, a stepwise dna demethylation was identified . the pax <dig> hypaxial enhancer became completely demethylated at day  <dig> of eb formation, independently of pax <dig> induction and despite the lack of pax <dig> expression at any stage of differentiation . contrarily, the -20 kb enhancer of myod, the -111 kb enhancer of myf <dig>  and myf <dig> promoter became partially demethylated at a later time and exclusively in pax7-induced myogenic precursors, coinciding with the increase in mrna expression. notably, at day  <dig>  the demethylated state persisted, despite the dramatic reduction of myod and myf <dig> expression levels . myogenin promoter showed a similar demethylation time course, reaching a total loss of dna methylation at the ipax7-mb-precursor stage when myogenin was slightly expressed, and maintained in ipax7-mts, when the myogenin gene showed the maximum expression level . interestingly, the promoters of the late differentiation genes myh <dig> and ckm remained fully methylated until the ipax7-mt stage, when they became partially demethylated simultaneously with gene activation . importantly, we did not observe any loss of dna methylation in the absence of pax <dig> expression in the control cells , indicating that the observed demethylation was skeletal muscle-specific. finally, the analysis of the promoter regions of the pluripotency genes pou5f <dig> and dppa <dig>  which are progressively silenced, showed a similar gain of dna methylation during cell differentiation as observed in primary myoblasts .fig.  <dig>

impaired myogenic differentiation in apobec <dig> knockdown myogenic precursors is associated with reduced dna demethylation
dna demethylation at specific myogenic regulatory regions was clearly observed in primary myoblasts and in ipax <dig> esc-derived myogenic precursors . at first, we questioned whether the reported demethylation could result from a passive loss of methylation, in which the lack or the significant reduction of dna methyltransferases  coupled to the successive cell divisions would lead to the loss of this epigenetic mark. we analysed the expression levels of the dnmt <dig> responsible for the maintenance of the existent dna methylation pattern, and dnmt3a and dnmt3b, which add de novo methyl groups after dna replication. all dnmts were expressed, and, as shown in additional file  <dig>  the expression levels of dnmt <dig> and dnmt3a did not significantly change during eb differentiation, while dnmt3b expression decreased during cell differentiation independently of pax <dig> expression. these observations would suggest that specific dna methylation reduction on muscle-related genes might be mediated by an active mechanism rather than by a passive one.

the two major pathways involved in controlling the dna demethylation process are the oxidation-mediated demethylation by tet proteins and the cytosine deamination by aid/apobec cytidine deaminase enzymes. the expression levels of tet <dig>  tet <dig> and tet <dig> did not change in the presence or absence of pax <dig> expression during the eb differentiation, as shown in additional file 4b. however, the expression levels of apobec <dig>  the skeletal muscle specific member of the aid/apobec family, were highly induced upon pax7-mediated muscle-commitment, being very high at the progenitor stage and derived mts . importantly, despite the lack of high specificity of the apobec <dig> antibody  a clear increase of apobec <dig> protein was observed by western-blot concomitant with the differentiation progression .fig.  <dig> impaired myogenic progression and differentiation and reduced dna demethylation in apobec <dig> knockdown myogenic precursors. a time course of apobec <dig> expression during differentiation of ipax <dig> es cells in presence or absence of pax <dig>  which was induced by adding doxycycline  to the culture media. apobec <dig> expression was measured by qrt-pcr , and by western blotting  . apobec <dig> mrna expression was normalized by gapdh expression  and as a reference the expression level in primary myoblasts  was measured . myog and actin wb were used as controls for myogenic differentiation and equal loading, respectively. b dna methylation and gene expression analyses of myogenin were performed in a daily time course after dox induction in the inducible myogenic model . each circle represents a cpg dinucleotide and its distance to the gene tss is indicated below. the colour gradient represents the methylation level indicated in the legend. n.d. means non detectable. c scheme of the experimental approach followed to knockdown apobec <dig> in the inducible pax <dig> model . gene expression and protein level to evaluate apobec <dig> knockdown efficiency using two independent clones were compared to control vector  . d

in order to test whether apobec <dig> is required for the myogenic process, we performed loss of function experiments by down-regulating apobec <dig> levels using lentiviral vectors encoding for specific shrnas. to identify the most appropriate time point for shrna viral-mediated transduction  we performed and analysed a daily time course starting from dox-treated pdgfrα+/flk1- sorted cells from day  <dig> ebs until ipax7-mb precursor stage . as shown in fig. 4b, we observed a perfect correlation between gradual dna demethylation of the myogenin locus and increased gene expression, which starts at eb day  <dig>  based on these data, we decided to transduce dox-treated pdgfrα+/flk1- cells at day  <dig> of differentiation using two different apobec <dig> shrnas . as expected, four days after transduction, apobec <dig> shrnas dramatically knocked-down apobec <dig> mrna and protein levels  without affecting pax <dig> expression . importantly, apobec <dig> knockdown was associated with a severe down-regulation of myogenin expression, both at mrna and protein level and, ultimately, impairment of terminal muscle differentiation . interestingly, the methylation analysis of the myogenin promoter upon apobec <dig> knockdown showed a significant methylation gain in 70 % of the promoter cpgs  compared to the control cells . finally, we also analysed the impact of apobec <dig> knockdown in myod and myf <dig> dna methylation levels, and, as shown in additional file 5a,b, although we observed a small increase of methylation in some of the cpgs, it was not statistically significant. all these results together, suggest that apobec <dig> might participate more actively in the dna demethylation process required to drive myogenic differentiation rather than in regulating the dna methylation-dependent myogenic commitment.

discussion
tissue-specific stem cells are lineage-restricted cells that have lost pluripotency capacities and gained cell-type identity. epigenetic regulation, including dna methylation and the post-translational modifications of histones, is crucial in the establishment and maintenance of cellular identity . in this study, we analysed for the first time the dna methylation dynamics of the principal genes orchestrating myogenic determination and differentiation programs by comparing es cells and their pax7-induced skeletal myogenic derivatives with muscle stem cells, both in proliferating and differentiating conditions. the detailed analysis of cpg-poor regulatory regions for the developmental gene pax <dig>  myod and myogenin genes as muscle cell-identity transcription factors, and ckm, mhy <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> as myogenic terminal differentiation genes revealed a specific dna demethylation signature required to acquire and maintain muscle-cell identity during the establishment of the muscle lineage . these results reinforce observations reported in other cellular models that lineage-specific dna demethylation, together with pluripotency genes hypermethylation, occur during early cell fate decisions conferring unique dna methylation patterns which correlate with defined cellular identities . interestingly, our results showed that the crucial myogenic differentiation factor myogenin became fully demethylated in muscle-committed cells before gene expression . however, these results were in disagreement with previous work performed in c2c <dig> cells where loss of methylation was observed between myoblasts and myotubes  <cit> . to address this controversy, we isolated freshly satellite cells from adult mice, and, interestingly, the dna methylation analysis of the myogenin promoter revealed the complete demethylation of the promoter in ex vivo isolated muscle stem cells . these results would indicate that dna demethylation of myogenin promoter occurs during muscle-lineage determination, allowing the acquisition of a transcriptional poised state before gene expression during muscle differentiation. notably, gene silencing of terminal differentiation myosin genes in proliferating myoblasts upon dna demethylation is maintained by the acquisition of the polycomb repressive mark h3k27me <dig> , as previously reported for myog and ckm promoters  <cit> . during terminal differentiation, h3k27me <dig> is replaced by the positive marks h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac, which result in gene transcription. this two-step repressive mechanism, where dna methylation is replaced by h3k27me <dig>  is also observed when escs are induced to differentiate  <cit>  and represents a switch from a stable repression mediated by dna methylation to a more facultative repression mediated by the histone code  <cit> .

mrf <dig> is considered a determination and differentiation myogenic gene and is the only mrf expressed in mature myofibres  <cit> . curiously, mrf <dig> promoter is the only one still repressed by dna methylation in undifferentiated myoblasts, being highly demethylated only in mature myofibres where it is highly expressed . a recent paper demonstrated that adult satellite cells emerged from embryonic founder cells in which the mrf <dig> gene was activated  <cit> , but intriguingly, our results showed that mrf <dig> promoter was completely methylated in all cell types analysed except in mature myofibres. very recently we demonstrated that the multiple enhancers regulating the complex spatial-temporal expression of the myf5/mrf <dig> locus during embryogenesis were specifically demethylated in muscle-committed cells  <cit> . in that context, we speculate that complete demethylation of mrf <dig> promoter would be only required in mature myofibres to fully activate and maintain its high expression levels.

it is well known that pax <dig> has a key role in the formation and maintenance of muscle committed progenitors. the engineered ipax7-esc model let us recapitulate the commitment of myogenic precursors during embryonic development and revealed the acquisition of a very similar dna methylation signature, compared to primary muscle cells . importantly, these results support the use of ipax <dig> es-derived myogenic progenitors as a bona fide model to generate in vitro myogenic precursors with therapeutic purposes. the detailed analysis of this stepwise model showed that the myogenic differentiation process occurred coupled to a gradual loss of dna methylation in myogenic regulatory regions in consecutive waves. initially, pax <dig> enhancer became demethylated before pax <dig> induction in line with its expression pattern, which is not restricted to the myogenic lineage  <cit> . next, myf <dig>  myod and myogenin cpg-poor regulatory regions became demethylated in ipax7-myoblast precursors correlating with transcriptional activation . finally, the terminal differentiation myogenic genes ckm and myh <dig> became simultaneously demethylated and activated during late differentiation, when ipax <dig> myogenic precursors differentiated and fused forming myotubes. this late demethylation wave only occurred in es-derived differentiating myocytes and not in primary myotubes, already demethylated in the mb stage. this observation points out an epigenetically accentuated myogenic commitment of adult muscle stem cells compared to myogenic precursors. importantly, the loss of dna methylation only took place upon pax <dig> expression  indicating that pax <dig> is required for skeletal muscle-specific demethylation. notably, the differentially methylated enhancer located at -111 kb of myf <dig> tss is a direct target of pax <dig> in satellite cells  <cit> , suggesting a link between pax <dig> and dna methylation. in the last years, several studies have shown the crosstalk between muscle transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. in this regard pax <dig> has been shown to recruit the wdr5-ash2l-mll <dig> histone methyltransferase complex to target genes, in order to stimulate myogenic transcription  <cit> . in the same line, myod interacts with the chromatin remodelling complex swi/snf  <cit> , and recruits the histone acetyltransferase p <dig> and the histone methyltransferase ash2l to activate muscle genes . in that context and taking into account our results we propose a model  where dna methylation prevents inappropriate expression of muscle genes in escs, being removed during the commitment to the skeletal muscle lineage. the expression of myogenic transcription factors might modulate both the recruitment, direct or indirect, of dna demethylases to reduce dna methylation and chromatin compaction, and histone modifiers/chromatin remodelers to activate transcription of muscle genes. in proliferating myoblasts, the differentiation genes would be kept in a silenced/poised transcriptional state by prc <dig> and hdacs complexes, whereas in myotubes they would be expressed upon the recruitment of chromatin activating complexes.fig.  <dig> model for the epigenetic control of muscle-specific gene expression during myogenesis. diagram proposing a simplified model where myogenic transcription factors would activate muscle genes by modulating both the recruitment, direct or indirect, of dna demethylases to reduce dna methylation levels and chromatin compaction, and histone modifiers/chromatin remodelers to activate transcription of muscle genes. in proliferating myoblasts, the differentiation genes would be kept in a silenced/poised transcriptional state by prc <dig> and hdacs complexes, whereas in myotubes they would be expressed upon the recruitment of chromatin activating complexes. abbreviations: ddms dna demethylases, hats histone acetyltransferases, hdacs histone deacetylases, hmts histone methyltransferases, prc <dig> polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  swi/snf swi/snf atp-dependent chromatin remodelling complex, yy <dig> yin and yang 1



to investigate the possible pathway involved in dna demethylation during myogenesis we focused on apobec <dig> , a member of the cytidine deaminase family expressed exclusively in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues with unknown functions  <cit> . the generation of apobec2-/- mice showed no major defects in mouse health, fertility or survival up to 1 year of age  <cit> . however, detailed analysis of these animals revealed a 15–20 % reduction in body mass from birth onwards, a clear histological evidence of a mild myopathy during aging, and a markedly increased ratio of slow to fast fibres in soleus apobec2-/- muscles  <cit> . although the cytidine deaminase activity of apobec <dig> is still controversial , it has been reported that during zebrafish development apobec2b stimulates dna demethylation  <cit> , and aid/apobec proteins promote demethylation of 5hmcs in mammals  <cit> . our results showed that apobec <dig> expression was highly induced upon muscle-commitment in ipax7-myogenic precursors  and, importantly, the downregulation of apobec <dig> dramatically impaired muscle differentiation, abolishing myogenin and myosins expression , in agreement with experiments performed on c2c <dig> myoblast cells showing that apobec <dig> was required for myotube formation  <cit> . recently, powell and co-workers reported that apobec <dig> had an essential role during retina and optic nerve regeneration  <cit> , although the small changes observed in dna methylation during tissue-regeneration were independent of apobec <dig> expression  <cit> . interestingly, our results showed that myogenin dna methylation levels were significantly higher in ipax7-myoblast precursors when apobec <dig> activity was abolished, correlating with gene silencing . however, the myod and myf <dig> dna methylation changes observed upon apobec <dig> knockdown were smaller, and not statistically significant. that could be due to the existence of some cell heterogeneity during the process of pax7-dependent myogenic induction, which could mask the demethylation events occurring in myod and myf <dig> genes. another explanation could be related to the fact that myod and myf <dig> play a very early role in muscle-lineage determination, as mouse embryos with targeted mutation in both genes lack myoblasts and differentiated skeletal muscles  <cit> . therefore, we cannot rule out the involvement of other mechanisms, such us tet-mediated dna demethylation, in the epigenetic activation of these two early-induced genes. altogether, our results suggest that apobec <dig> might participate in the active dna demethylation process required to drive myogenic differentiation. apobec <dig> has emerged as an important myogenic regulator that would merit further studies regarding how it is recruited to genomic loci affecting epigenetic regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents for the first time the dna methylation dynamics of the principal genes orchestrating the myogenic determination and differentiation programs during myogenesis. our results show that a common dna demethylation signature is required to acquire and maintain the muscle-cell identity, and that downregulation of the muscle-specific cytidine deaminase apobec <dig> in es-derived myogenic precursors reduces myogenic-associated dna demethylation and impairs muscle differentiation. importantly, we have also identified muscle epigenetic markers that may be useful to ensure the efficient and safe generation of es- and ips-derived myogenic progenitors for therapeutic applications.
