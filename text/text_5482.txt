BACKGROUND
decapoda is one of the most diverse groups of crustaceans, with over  <dig>  extant species in  <dig> families  <cit> . seven main groups  are generally recognized in decapoda. they are dendrobranchiata , caridea , stenopodidea , lobsters , mud shrimps or ghost shrimps , anomura  and brachyura . the phylogenetic relationships amongst these groups within the decapoda and even the monophyletic status of these groups have long been debated amongst carcinologists and general consensus has yet to be reached, with recent morphological cladistic and molecular analyses still showing contrasting results . one the most controversial recent findings is that the mud shrimps are not monophyletic  <cit> , with some of them representing the sister taxon of the other reptantia .

mud shrimps have a worldwide distribution from shallow to deep waters, and more than  <dig> extant species have been described to date  <cit> . the classification scheme of mud shrimps have been in flux at all levels. they are often considered to be a monophyletic group up to the rank of infraorder, i.e., thalassinidea  <cit> . according to different authors, these animals have been treated under anomura  <cit> , as an independent group within the reptantia  <cit> , or aligned with the lobsters  <cit> . while some authors  <cit>  had long questioned the monophyly of thalassinidea and divided it into two groups , the monophyly of thalassinidea has been supported by some morphological cladistic analyses  <cit> , molecular data  <cit>  or combined morphological and molecular analysis  <cit> . nevertheless, the latest molecular analyses  <cit>  mostly concur in the separation of thalassinidea.

in most molecular analyses, partial dna sequences are used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of decapod crustaceans  <cit> , but they are often too short to contain a sufficient amount of genetic variation for resolving higher systematics  <cit> . in the previous studies involving mud shrimps  <cit> , the total length of partial sequences used is less than 5300 bp. the animal mitochondrial  dna is a small, extrachromosomal, and circular double-stranded dna molecule of 12–20 kb in size, and usually contains the same set of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> protein-coding genes, two ribosomal rna genes and  <dig> transfer rna genes  <cit> . recent advances in dna sequencing technology have allowed rapid, cost-effective sequencing of the complete mtdna genome. and it has become increasingly popular in studies of molecular evolution, phylogeography, and phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic levels  <cit> , mainly because of its maternal inheritance, the presence of strictly orthologous genes evolving at different rates, and lack of genetic recombination  <cit> . complete mtdna sequences provide sets of genome-level characteristics, such as gene rearrangement, which is rather conserved within some major metazoan lineages, and therefore can be especially powerful in resolving systematic relationships among higher taxa  <cit> .

complete mitochondrial genome sequences are now available for  <dig> decapod crustaceans  that represent all the main groups. however, the latest phylogenetic reconstruction of decapod crustaceans using complete mitochondrial genome sequences  <cit>  still has low resolution in most of the deep branches, notably with the status of stenopodidea, lobsters and mud shrimps unresolved. moreover, only a single species of mud shrimp collected from korea, namely upogebia major  belonged to gebiidea, has been sequenced for mitochondrial genome  <cit> .

in this paper, we report the complete mitochondrial genomes of five thalassinidean species with representatives from both gebiidea and axiidea. they are austinogebia edulis , upogebia major  and thalassina kelanang moh and chong,  <dig> of gebiidea, and nihonotrypaea thermophilus lin, komai and chan,  <dig> and neaxius glyptocercus  of axiidea. considering the difference in sampling location and sequence variation, we only included the mitochondrial genome of upogebia major we sequenced in the analysis. the mitochondrial genome structure of these five mud shrimps were compared with those of other decapods. the gene rearrangement occurred in mud shrimps were identified. moreover, the infraorder status of axiidea and gebiidea was analyzed based on all  <dig> malacostracan mitochondrial genomes currently available.

RESULTS
genome composition
the complete mtdna sequences of a. edulis, u. major, t. kelanang, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus were determined to be  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp long, respectively . they all contained  <dig> protein-coding genes , two ribosomal rna genes ,  <dig> transfer rna genes  and a putative control region as in other metazoans . the structural organizations of the five mitochondrial genomes are shown in figure  <dig> 

the overall a + t content of a. edulis mtdna is  <dig> %, higher than that of other decapod species except scylla tranquebarica  . the overall a + t content of u. major, t. kelanang, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus ranged from  <dig> - <dig> %, similar to other decapods . this pattern of base composition in five mud shrimps held for the protein-coding, rrna, trna genes, and the control region when considered separately.

for the  <dig> pcgs of five mitochondrial genomes, nine protein-coding genes  were encoded on the h-strand, while the remaining four  were encoded on the l-strand . this transcriptional polarity is identical in all reported decapod mitochondrial genomes. moreover, they all contained two reading frames overlapped on the same strand: atp <dig> and atp <dig>  nad <dig> and nad4l each shared seven nucleotides. no notable reduction or extension of gene length as compared to other decapods was observed.

in a. edulis, u. major and t. kelanang mitochondrial genomes, lrrna and srrna were separated by trnaval, while the two rrna genes in n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus mtdna were adjacent to each other . the rrnas were both coded on l-strand. all five mitochondrial genomes had typical  <dig> trna genes, which ranged from  <dig> to 73 bp in length , and all of them ) formed a typical cloverleaf secondary structure. the trnaser lacked dhc arm, a feature commonly observed in metazoan mtdnas  <cit> .

the non-coding regions of a. edulis, u. major, t. kelanang, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus mtdnas were  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  581 bp, respectively . of these regions, the largest non-coding region in each genome was assumed to be the control region  with high a + t composition . the mtdna of n. glyptocercus had the shortest cr  among decapods, and its a + t content was the lowest  . the remaining non-coding regions of the five mitochondrial genomes were considered to be intergenic spacers. most intergenic spacers contained a few nucleotides  . however, a relatively large spacer, 177 bp in length, was found between srrna and trnagl in the u. major mtdna . further analyses showed that this large region had an a + t content of  <dig> %, higher than that in control region .

gene order
the complete genome arrangements of five mud shrimps were depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the gene order of t. kelanang mtdna was identical to that of the pancrustacean  ground pattern  <cit> , while the genomic organization of four other mud shrimps showed two novel gene orders compared to other mt genomes in the mitozoa database. specifically, the mitochondrial genomes of a. edulis and u. major, and n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus, shared the same gene order, respectively.

compared with the pancrustacean ground pattern, at least five genes were rearranged in each of the mt genome of a. edulis, u. major, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus . the trnaleu , located between nad <dig> and lrrna in other arthropod mtdnas, was found between trnaleu  and cox <dig> in a. edulis and u. major, and between cox <dig> and trnaleu  in n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus. the trnaile  was located between trnaser  and nad <dig> in a. edulis and u. major, and between srrna and cr in n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus. in a. edulis and u. major, trnagln  moved upstream to the putative control region, and trnacys  and trnatyr  moved to the location between cr and trnamet . additionally, in n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus mtdnas, the trna gene trnaval  changed to downstream of trnagly , trnaasp  moved to upstream of trnamet , and only one protein-coding gene cox <dig> was involved in the rearrangement. the cox <dig> located between atp <dig> and trnagly  in other crustaceans moved upstream to trnaala  in n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus. all these genes rearranged in the same orientation as the mitochondrial gene arrangement of pancrustacean ground pattern with the exception of trnaleu  in the four mud shrimps, and trnaile  and trnaval  in n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus. noticeably, the two trnaleu sequences in each mt genome of the four mud shrimps shared significant identity with each other, and the similarity was 86% in a. edulis, 80% in u. major, 77% in n. glyptocercus and 93% in n. thermophilus.

phylogenetic analysis
the concatenated alignments of nucleotide and amino acid data from all  <dig> protein-coding genes were used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among major lineages of decapoda. for each dataset, the bi and ml analyses generated nearly identical tree topology except for two branches denoted by open arrowheads, which strongly supported the monophyly of decapoda . values of nodal support were typically congruent between the two trees. both the nucleotide and amino acid phylogenies indicated strong support  for the separation of two suborders dendrobranchiata and pleocyemata in decapoda. the placing of caridea at the base of pleocyemata was well supported . the remaining natant decapod stenopodidea was sister with reptantia with a strong support in amino acid phylogeny  but only moderate support in nucleotide phylogeny . reptantia was strongly supported to be a monophyletic group .

within repantia, the brachyura and anomura  were reciprocally monophyletic , and their sister relationship also received supported . the monophyly of thalassinidea  was not supported in the nucleotide phylogeny or the amino acid phylogeny. yet au test could not reject monophyly of thalassinidea. gebiidea and axiidea were both shown to be well supported clades , with moderate support  for the sister relationship between gebiidea and mieura. however, the position of axiidea in reptantia was incongruent between the nucleotide and amino acid trees. similarly, there was no support for the monophyly of the lobsters .

discussion
molecular features of mitochondrial genomes in mud shrimps
features of decapod mitochondrial genomes include a high a + t content and rearranged gene structure  <cit> . these features are also apparent in the complete mtdna sequences of four of the mud shrimps studied, i.e., a. edulis, u. major, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus. together with t. kelanang mtdna, all five mitochondrial genomes have the same gene number as other pancrustaceans . however, the u. major mtdna annotated by kim et al.  <cit>  has an extra trnaleu between nad <dig> and lrrna. the different annotation is due to amphibolous beginning of lrrna and identification of trnaleu. no anticodon and trna-like secondary structure of trnaleu is identified between nad <dig> and lrrna in the u. major mtdna we sequenced, as in the one sequenced by kim et al.  <cit> .

most variations in size in mitochondrial genomes are caused by sequences in non-coding regions  <cit> . n. glyptocercus mtdna has the shortest control region among the decapod mtdna published, while in u. major mtdna, a relative large intergetic spacer  with high a + t content is discovered. such a large at-rich region other than cr rarely occurs in malacostracan species and has only been reported in the stomatopods oratosquilla oratoria <cit>  and squilla mantis <cit> . but the length and position of the second at-rich region are different among the above three species. moreover, such an at-rich region is notably absent in the other four mud shrimps, indicating that it is not a conserved feature of thalassinidean mtdna.

the pancrustacean ground pattern is well retained in t. kelanang mitogenome, suggesting that the ancestor of mud shrimps  had a typical pancrustacean mtdna gene order. however, the other four mud shrimps, a. edulis, u. major, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus have rearranged mitochondrial genomes compared to the pancrustacean ground pattern   <cit> . further searches in the mitozoa database show that mitochondrial sequences of a. edulis and u. major, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus exhibit two novel genome structures, respectively. except for trnaleu, the rearranged genes of a. edulis and u. major belonged to gebiidea occur at trnaile—trnatyr junction. however, the rearranged genes of the two axiids n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus occur more dispersedly.

possible mechanisms for gene rearrangement
two major categories of mechanisms have been suggested to explain mitochondrial gene rearrangement:  tandem duplication followed by random or non-random deletion  <cit> , and  non-homologous recombination  <cit> . the first mechanism may explain many or most of the observed rearrangements, while the second one has been proposed to explain gene translocation and inversion  <cit> . combined the above mechanisms and the results from crex , the rearrangement of four mud shrimps mtdnas can be depicted as three or four steps .

for a. edulis and u. major mtdna, firstly, transposition of trnaile , trnacys  and trnatyr  occurred before duplication. if this event occurred after duplication, more genes were duplicated and longer distance translocation were required . secondly, an independent duplication/random loss events occurred to account for the translocation of trnagln  . thirdly, a duplication/anticodon mutation/non-random loss event  <cit>  is expected to account for translocation of trnaleu  . a duplication of trnaleu  on h-strand might have happened. one of the duplicated trnaleu  changed into trnaleu  by anticodon mutation. subsequently the ancestral trnaleu  lost the function and eventually is deleted from l-strand.

for n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus mtdna, transposition of trnaile  occurred first followed by one recombination event . then an independent duplication/random loss event occurred to account for the translocation of cox <dig> . this was followed by transposition of trnaasp  and trnaval  and a recombination event . finally, a duplication/anticodon mutation/non-random loss event  <cit>  occurred to account for the translocation of trnaleu  .

another possibility for the translocation of trnaleu  predicted by crex is based on “duplication/random loss model”  <cit> . this interpretation seems less likely given that there is a long distance between trnaleu  and trnaleu  in the ancient arrangement, as well as the presence of inversion in trnaleu   <cit> . moreover, the sequence homology between trnaleu  and trnaleu  in a. edulis, u. major, n. glyptocercus and n. thermophilus is higher than any two other randomly chosen trnas. it seems to be more possible that two trnaleu arose from duplication followed by anticodon mutation. the similar duplication/anticodon mutation events have also been reported in other crustaceans, for example in amphipods caprella scaura <cit>  and gammarus duebeni <cit> , and decapods geothelphusa dehaani <cit>  and stenopus hispidus <cit> .

under the above models, including the random and nonrandom loss, incomplete deletion or partial retention of duplication resulted in the formation of the multiple intergenic spacers . these results indicate that intergenic spacers might serve as a guide in deducing the generation of gene rearrangement  <cit> . moreover, the distinct rearrangement processes suggest that gebiidea and axiidea evolved independently from the pancrustacean ground pattern.

phylogenetic relationships of the major clades in decapoda
with higher taxon samplings and the inclusion of all the major groups of decapod crustaceans, the present complete mitochondrial genomic analysis strongly supports that the caridea is sister to the other pleocyemata. similar to the results of shi et al.  <cit> , stenopodidae is revealed to be a sister clade of reptantia. while this relationship is only weakly supported in shi et al.  <cit> , this grouping is strongly supported in our tree based on amino acid sequences.

within the reptantia, the sister relationship between brachyura and anomura  has always received very high support in complete mitochondrial genomic analyses  <cit> . the present result suggests that gebiidea is the sister group of meiura though only with moderate support. in general, the topology of the currently most extensive complete mitochondrial genomic tree of decapod crustaceans  is most similar to the most recent mt genome analyses by kim, park, et al.  <cit> , and those of scholtz and richter  <cit>  and ahyong and o’meally  <cit>  deduced from morphology and combined morphology and molecular  data, respectively. the trees of scholtz and richter  <cit>  and ahyong and o’meally  <cit>  are essentially the same except for the identity of the sister clade of thalassinidea , which is considered to be monophyletic. thalassinidea is sister to mieura in ahyong and o’meally  <cit>  but in scholtz and richter  <cit>  it is sister to the clawed lobster astacidea which is shown to be polyphyletic. the main difference between the present result with these two analyses is that gebiidea and axiidea do not make up a monophyletic group while the position of astacidea is unresolved. the mitogenome tree of kim et al.  <cit>  includes only one mud shrimp species belonged to gebiidea. adding two more species and genera of gebiidea in the present work reveals a similar topology of gebiidea being sister to mieura. however, the other mud shrimp group axiidea does not cluster with gebiidea.

as the results of complete mitochondrial genome sequence analysis are now rather consistent with the conclusions deduced from some morphology and partial gene sequence data, it seems to be promising in using complete mtdna sequence to reconstruct the evolutionary history of decapod crustaceans. nevertheless, more taxon sampling, particularly the inclusion of certain key groups such as the sergesteid shrimp , blind lobsters polychelida  <cit> , primitive cave shrimp procarididea  <cit> , the living fossil lobster glypheidea  <cit> , the enigmatic shrimp luciferidae  <cit>  and the various bizarre anomuran groups  <cit> , will be necessary to achieve this goal.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents five complete mitochondrial genomes of mud shrimps, austinogebia edulis, upogebia major and thalassina kelanang of gebiidea, and nihonotrypaea thermophilus and neaxius glyptocercus of axiidea. the contents of individual mt genes in these five mud shrimps are similar to that in other decapods. the u. major mt genome contain a relative large intergenic spacer with higher a + t content than that in control region. the n. glyptocercus mt genome, the shortest decapod mtdna known, has the shortest control region. except for t. kelanang, the other four mud shrimps have rearranged mt genomes compared to pancrustacean ground pattern. a duplication/loss  and recombination model may result in their mt gene order. the different gene arrangement process suggests the derived gene orders of gebiidea and axiidea might have evolved independently. phylogenetic analyses do not support the monophyly of mud shrimps, while the positions of gebiidea and axiidea in reptantia are poorly resolved.
