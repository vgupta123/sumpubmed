BACKGROUND
the cultivated brassica species, like arabidopsis thaliana, are members of the brassicaceae family  <cit> . brassica rapa  contains the brassica a genome, which is the smallest, at ca.  <dig> mb  <cit> . a genome sequencing project is underway http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/. a number of genome analysis studies have shown that the brassica genomes contain extensive triplication, consistent with their having evolved from a hexaploid ancestor  <cit> . two sequence-level studies, one in b. oleracea  <cit>  and one in b. rapa  <cit>  have provided further support for the hypothesis of hexaploid ancestry for the brassica species. recent cytogenetic studies have shown that a distinctive feature of the brassiceae tribe, of which the brassica species are members but a. thaliana is not, is that they contain extensively triplicated genomes  <cit> .

an elegant study using sequenced rflp markers demonstrated that  <dig> segments of the genome of a. thaliana, representing almost its entirety, could be replicated and rearranged to generate a structure approximating that of the b. napus genome  <cit> . in a similarly ground-breaking study, an ancestral karyotype  of n =  <dig> was proposed for the brassicaceae, which has been related to the a. thaliana genome sequence and the structure of the b. rapa genome derived by linkage mapping  <cit> . thus the genome sequence of a. thaliana is being used, either directly via the b. napus comparative analysis or indirectly via the ak inferred genome, to inform studies in the brassica species. a complication in such comparative studies is that there are typically multiple orthologues in brassica species for each gene represented in a. thaliana, although interspersed gene loss has reduced the number that might be expected in paleohexaploids such as the brassica species  <cit> .

brassica species have been used to study the early responses of genomes to the induction of polyploidy, via resynthesis of b. napus by hybridization of b. rapa with b. oleracea. such lines display genome instability, which can persist for many generations  <cit> . although this is hypothesised to involve homoeologous non-reciprocal translocations, such evolutionary events have not been studied at the sequence level. indeed, sequence-level studies in brassica to date have focussed on regions that show collinearity between the brassica genome studied and that of a. thaliana. similarly, in comparative studies in grass genomes, which are considered very much in terms of rearranged collinear blocks  <cit> , little attention has been paid to the regions of collinearity breakdown.

we aimed to test the veracity of our present understanding of the evolution of the brassica and arabidopsis genomes from the ak genome by identifying and sequencing bac clones containing genomic dna of b. rapa that represent a sample of collinearity discontinuities  relative to the a. thaliana genome. this involved the development of bioinformatics tools and accessing data arising from ongoing activities to sequence the first four of the ten chromosomes of b. rapa.

RESULTS
identification of bac clones putatively containing collinearity discontinuities
we developed a method by which candidate b. rapa bac clones spanning cds with the arabidopsis genome could be identified and selected for sequencing. our starting point was the set of bac end sequence  data available for the combined libraries from the 'chiifu' cultivar, which is the subject of the multinational genome sequencing project. using a strategy opposite to that employed for selection of seed bacs for that programme, we analysed the mate-pairs within the bes data primarily for inferred disruptions in short- to medium-range synteny . we first conducted a blastn similarity search against the arabidopsis genome sequence with all  <dig>  individual bes available from  <dig>  b. rapa bac clones, these sequences comprising  <dig>  mate-pairs and  <dig>  singletons. for each bes we recorded the pseudochromosome coordinates of the most significant alignment above a threshold e-value of 10- <dig>  of the clones with both mate-pair bes available,  <dig>   gave mappings with each e-value above this threshold and were therefore amenable to further analysis.

we loaded these pseudochromosome mappings into our own copy of the atidb arabidopsis genome database  <cit>  to enable a programmatic analysis. a perl script was developed to interrogate the database and to identify associations between non-contiguous regions of the arabidopsis genome that are linked by a number of disjoined mate-pair mappings and thus produce a list of cognate b. rapa bac clones that might contain discontinuities. the algorithm we used is described in more detail in methods. our initial approach took into account several factors; filtering out instances of clone duplications and discounting mate-pair mappings whose dna strand dispositions differed from the majority. we experimented with a threshold number, over the range of 2- <dig>  of independent mate-pair mappings linking any given pair of bins required to signal an association.

bac clones potentially representing cds with the a. thaliana genome were thus selected, one from each association identified by three or more bac clones. these bac clones were sequenced and annotated, inter alia, for similarity to a. thaliana gene models and to b. rapa bes using blastn. of the  <dig> sequenced bacs,  <dig> were found not to contain cds. in the majority of these , the bacs show alignment of multiple gene models from two regions of the a. thaliana genome. these pairs of regions of the a. thaliana genome are related to each other, representing paralogous segments. the sequences at one end of each b. rapa bac shows the highest similarity to the corresponding gene model from one of the a. thaliana genome segments, whereas the sequences at the other end of the b. rapa bac shows the highest similarity to the corresponding gene model from the other a. thaliana genome segment. we termed this paralogue conflation. in the remaining cases, there appears to be at one end of the clone a small stretch of inverted sequence or a single gene  with similarity elsewhere in the a. thaliana genome. the remaining  <dig> b. rapa bac clones contain similarity to two or more collinear runs of multiple a. thaliana gene models.

these findings enabled us to substantially improve the algorithm and to reduce the false positive rate, using the sequenced bacs as a training set. graphical representations of the results are shown in figure  <dig> and a summary is given in table  <dig>  a majority proportion of the cds we were seeking would be ancestral to the divergence of the b. rapa a genome and b. oleracea c genome lineages and so we experimented with adding supplementary data obtained from a b. oleracea bac library. using identical methods we analysed  <dig>  bes derived from  <dig>  b. oleracea clones, these sequences comprising  <dig>  mate-pairs and  <dig>  singletons. of the clones with both mate-pair bes available,  <dig>  clones  yielded significant mappings at the same e-value threshold as before. this proportion was almost half that obtained from the b. rapa dataset, probably due to the higher repeat content in b. oleracea reducing the probability of each bes in a mate-pair containing conserved  sequence. when these b. oleracea mappings were added and the database re-analysed, the number of associations revealed was increased significantly at each threshold value .

sequence validation of putative collinearity discontinuities
a genome sequencing project is underway for b. rapa, with sequences derived using a bac-by-bac strategy and with annotation being made publicly available http://brassica.bbsrc.ac.uk/. during the course of this effort, we sequenced a number of bac clones  containing cds relative to the a. thaliana genome. several of these had not had both mate-pair bes available previously and hence would have been undetectable by our computational analysis. these clones, along with those identified from the genome-wide analysis, were then assessed rigorously in order to exclude any that might not be representative of the genome . this was done by using the sequence annotation to assess whether there are additional b. rapa bac clones overlapping and confirming the discontinuity. this process involved the identification, based on congruous bac end sequence alignments, of additional bac clones that confirm the cd, and is illustrated in figure  <dig>  this resulted in the confirmation of a further  <dig> discontinuities represented in sequenced bac clones, making a total of  <dig>  as listed in table  <dig>  relative to the a. thaliana chromosome structure,  <dig> of these represent inter-chromosomal rearrangements, with the remaining  <dig> representing the end points of intra-chromosomal rearrangements .

inter-chromosomal rearrangements
fifteen of the  <dig> inter-chromosomal cds were genetically mapped in the b. rapa genome, either by direct linkage mapping or by sequence overlap with a bac mapped by linkage mapping described elsewhere  <cit> , as summarised in table  <dig>  these could be related to the position in the brassica a genome of cds previously inferred by linkage mapping-, defined relative to a. thaliana chromosomes  <cit>  and subsequently to the ak  <cit> . we will use the nomenclature at to refer to the previously described a. thaliana chromosome blocks  as described in  <cit>  and ak to refer to the ancestral karyotype blocks , as described in  <cit> .

one sequenced cd  mapped to linkage group a <dig> and is consistent with the position of the inferred cd between blocks at3a and at4b , as illustrated in figure  <dig>  however, the transition revealed by the bac sequence is between the expected part of at3a  but with at1d . the linkage mapping study  <cit>  had identified markers on a <dig> with similarity to this region of the a. thaliana genome, but there was insufficient evidence to call the block. only one copy of akd had been identified previously  <cit> , so our study has identified the position of one of the "missing" two blocks in the b. rapa genome that would be expected from its paleohexaploid ancestry.

five sequenced cds  mapped to linkage group a <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the position of kbrh110m <dig> is consistent with the position of the inferred cd between at5e and at2b/c . however, the transition revealed by the bac sequence shows an additional small segment in between these, with collinearity to a more distant  part of at2b/c . this structure may be the result of rearrangements within this collinearity block.

the sequences within kbrh010m <dig> represent the end of collinearity block at3c  and sequences internal to collinearity blocks at5f , but neither had been identified previously on linkage group a <dig> 

the sequences within kbrh034p <dig> are internal to collinearity blocks at3d and at4b . although at4b  had been identified previously on b. rapa linkage group a <dig>  at3d  had not. therefore the transition previously inferred on this linkage group between collinearity blocks at4b  and at3a   <cit>  may be more complex than anticipated. this is supported by the results of analysis of the structure of the brassica a genome as represented in b. juncea, in which akn and akg-h were identified between akt and akf  <cit> .

the sequences within kbrb055e <dig> represent the ends of collinearity blocks at3a and at4a . this is consistent with the transition inferred on the basis of linkage mapping  <cit> , but is not consistent with the inferred interpolation of akp between akf and ako that has been proposed  <cit> .

the sequences within kbrh004i <dig> correspond to the end of at3a  and sequences internal to at2a . although at3a  had been identified previously on linkage group a <dig>  at2a  had not. only two copies of akk had been identified previously  <cit> , so our study may have identified the position of the "missing" third block in the b. rapa genome that would be expected from its paleohexaploid ancestry. the linkage mapping study  <cit>  had identified markers on a <dig> that have similarity to this region of the a. thaliana genome, but there was insufficient evidence to call the block.

three sequenced cds  mapped to linkage group a <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the sequences in kbrh109l <dig> represent the end of collinearity block at3c  and sequences internal to collinearity blocks at5f . block at5f  had been position on linkage group a <dig> previously, but no copy of at3c  had been positioned previously on this linkage group. thus this bac represents the position of an additional copy of this segment . the linkage mapping study  <cit>  had identified markers on a <dig> that have similarity to this region of the a. thaliana genome, but there was insufficient evidence to call the block.

the sequences within kbrh004m <dig> correspond to the end of at2a  and sequences internal to at5d  and confirm one of the cds on linkage group a <dig> previously inferred  <cit> .

the sequences within kbrh001j <dig> correspond to the end of collinearity block at3c  and sequences internal to collinearity blocks at1b . block at1b  had been position on linkage group a <dig> previously, but no copy of at3c  had been positioned previously on this linkage group. thus this bac represents the position of the third copy of this segment .

two sequenced cds  mapped to linkage group a <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the sequences in both correspond to those close to the ends of collinearity blocks at4b  and at1b . thus they are both candidates for representing the cds on linkage group a <dig> previously inferred  <cit> . however, the transition revealed by the sequence of kbrb089j <dig> shows an additional small segment in between these, with collinearity to a more distant  part of at4b . this structure may be the result of rearrangements within this collinearity block.

four sequenced cds  mapped to linkage group a <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the sequences in kbrh106n <dig> represent sequences within collinearity block at4a  and within at3b . although at4a  had been identified previously on linkage group a <dig>  at3b  had not. only two copies of akl had been identified previously  <cit> , so our study has identified the position of the "missing" third block in the b. rapa genome that would be expected from its paleohexaploid ancestry. there is an additional small collinear segment between ako and akl, corresponding to sequences anticipated to have been positioned between ako and akp, suggesting that the previously defined boundary of ako   <cit>  may have been incorrect, with this block extending to an orthologue of a4g <dig> 

the sequences in kbrb028f <dig> represent sequences at the end of collinearity blocks at2a  and within at1d . although at1d  had been identified previously on b. rapa linkage group a <dig>  at2a  had not. therefore the transitions previously inferred on this linkage group bordering block at1d   <cit>  may be more complex than anticipated. this is supported by the results of analysis of the structure of the brassica a genome as represented in b. juncea, in which akh was identified as being adjacent to akd  <cit> . the linkage mapping study  <cit>  had identified markers on a <dig> that have similarity to this region of the a. thaliana genome, but there was insufficient evidence to call the block. the transition revealed by the bac sequence shows an additional small segment in between at2a  and at1d , with collinearity to the end of at3a .

the sequences in kbrb026a <dig> represent sequences at the end collinearity block at2a  and within at5d . although at5d  had been identified previously on linkage group a <dig>  the part of at2a corresponding to akk had not. therefore the transitions previously inferred on this linkage group bordering block at5d   <cit>  may be more complex than anticipated. only two copies of akk had been identified previously  <cit> , so our study has identified the position of the "missing" third block in the b. rapa genome that would be expected from its paleohexaploid ancestry. the linkage mapping study  <cit>  had identified markers on a <dig> that have similarity to this region of the a. thaliana genome, but there was insufficient evidence to call the block.

the sequences in kbrh006i <dig> represent sequences at the end of collinearity blocks at3d  and within at2b . they confirm one of the cds on linkage group a <dig> previously inferred  <cit> , but indicate that at2b , as represented on linkage group a <dig>  may be truncated.

segmental inversions
twenty four of the  <dig> cds representing the end points of intra-chromosomal rearrangements  were mapped in the b. rapa genome, either by direct linkage mapping or by overlap with a bac mapped by linkage mapping. their occurrence appears genome-wide, as summarised in table  <dig>  few such rearrangements had been inferred previously, and these had not been clearly defined. the positions on linkage group a <dig> of bac clones kbrb022j <dig> and kbrh064i <dig>  and on linkage group a <dig> of bac clones kbrh001c <dig>  kbrh027b <dig>  kbrb008f <dig> and kbrb090f <dig> are consistent with those expected for the inversions noted in at4b segments on these chromosomes  <cit> .

some of the cds classified as segmental inversions on the basis of the relationships of genes represented in the bacs to their orthologues in a. thaliana may have actually represented inter-chromosomal rearrangements, but segments of those ancestral chromosomes have subsequently come together in the a. thaliana genome. this is most notably the case for a. thaliana chromosome  <dig>  for which we have three "segmental inversion" cds spanning relatively large regions of the chromosome. these three are represented by kbrh066l <dig>  kbrb129c <dig> and kbrb055o <dig>  and are illustrated in figure  <dig>  the sequences in kbrh066l <dig>  which has been mapped to linkage group a <dig>  represent sequences near the end of collinearity block at5d  and between at5b and at5c . both at5d  and at5b  had been identified on this linkage group previously, but not adjacent to each other. this suggests that the transitions previously inferred on this linkage group bordering these collinearity blocks  <cit>  may be more complex than anticipated. the identification of sequences corresponding to a region between akq and aks suggests that the previously defined boundary of akq   <cit>  may have been incorrect, with this block extending to an orthologue of a5g <dig>  the distal part of this extended collinearity block akq contains a small segmental inversion  that is wholly contained within the bac. the sequences in kbrb129c <dig> represents a cd between the ends of collinearity blocks at5e and at5a  and is consistent with the position of a previously described cd on linkage group a <dig>  <cit> , to which the clone maps. the sequences within kbrb055o <dig> represents a cd between at5f and at5b , respectively, but we were unable to determine its position in the genome.

in addition to the small segmental inversion  contained within kbrh066l <dig>  we found further examples of secondary rearrangements at the points of cds in kbrb022j <dig> and kbrh108b <dig>  and wholly contained inversions within kbrb011d <dig> and kbrh064i <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  we identified one example of a cd apparently representing intra-chromosomal rearrangements that were separated by sequences from elsewhere in the genome. the sequences in kbrh026a <dig> represent a small segment from the end of at4a  at one end of a segmental inversion within at2b , as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

analysis of collinearity discontinuity sequences
none of the bac clones containing the cds was found to contain b. rapa satellite repeat sequences characteristic of centromeres  <cit> , nor was any found with tandem tracts of tttaggg repeats that are associated with telomeres  <cit> , although clone kbrh108b <dig> did have a cluster of  <dig> such repeats interspersed over  <dig> bp, but some  <dig> kb from the cd.

minimal sequences defining the confirmed cds were then selected from these bacs by manual inspection, aided by annotated ab initio gene predictions and brassica est alignments. these cd regions were then compared with the complete set of annotated b. rapa genome sequence currently available . the results are given in table  <dig>  the cd sequences appear to have nucleotide compositions intermediate to those of genic and intergenic regions in terms of microsatellite  density. although the cds show densities of apparent gene features typical of the averaged genome sequence, detailed analysis reveals that these features are often gene fragments with homology to arabidopsis gene models from regions outside those brought together at the discontinuities. furthermore, they are relatively transcriptionally inactive, with the proportion of models with est support  being about half that of the average for predicted genes. the cd regions also appear to be relatively transcriptionally silent when analysed with the very sensitive but targeted method of alignment with brassica a genome solexa reads derived from the b. napus leaf transcriptome.

discussion
computational methods were used to successfully identify bac clones representing verified cds between the genomes of b. rapa and a. thaliana, and relative to an ancestral karyotype. along with cds identified during the ongoing chromosome sequencing project, these represent a substantial  sampling of the cds in the genome of b. rapa. previous studies had defined a segmental structure for the paleohexaploid brassica genome based largely on genetic linkage of markers with similarity to sequences in the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . whereas the seminal study in this area  <cit>  compared the arrangements of the b. napus genome with that of a. thaliana, and ours compared the arrangement of the b. rapa genome with that of a. thaliana, we anticipate that the results should be directly comparable as there seems to be little difference in the organization of the a genome in these two brassica species  <cit> . remarkably few of our cds correspond to those expected from this structure:  <dig> of the  <dig> representing inter-chromosomal rearrangements and  <dig> of the  <dig> representing intra-chromosomal rearrangements. the relatively high "noise" inherent to comparative genomics studies in brassica species, which is a consequence of the widespread occurrence of apparently transduplicated fragments of genes  <cit> , means that multiple instance of collinear alignments are required to correctly identify collinear genome segments. this requirement limits the ability to identify relatively small segments using, for example, comparative linkage mapping based on rflp markers. although the paleopolyploid ancestry of brassica species is now widely accepted, the lack of discernable triplication throughout the genome has not been fully explained. the hypothesised segments that have not been identified had been assumed to have been deleted. however, we have found evidence for the existence of numerous additional copies of genome segments, bringing the count of many of these to  the predicted three. in one case  we identified and mapped onto the b. rapa genome three copies where none had been identified previously in that species, with only one copy having been identified in the brassica a genome as represented in b. juncea  <cit> .

our analyses of cds enable us to hypothesise how parts of the genomes of a. thaliana and b. rapa have evolved from the ak. for b. rapa linkage group a <dig>  which contains one copy of ak blocks t-u, our data enable the development of a model for the derivation of the chromosome from the ak, as shown in figure  <dig>  the detection of sequences from akt at both ends of an aku collinearity block indicates that there may have been a circular intermediate derived from linkage group ak <dig> which was integrated into ak <dig> to form the progenitor of b. rapa a <dig>  some rearrangements of the ak seem to have taken place in the brassica lineage before genome triplication, but not in the a. thaliana lineage. for example, as shown in figure  <dig>  a. thaliana chromosome  <dig> contains the pairs of ak blocks akq-akr and akw-akx . whereas these ak blocks appear to have been recombined in the ancestor of b. rapa. this recombination is represented in b. rapa three times  <cit> , on linkage groups a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> for akw-akr, and at least twice for the reciprocal outcome of the recombination, akq-akx .

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that previous studies of segmental collinearity between a. thaliana, brassica and ak genomes, although very useful, represent over-simplifications of the true inter-relationships of the genomes. in addition to the occurrence of individual genes in non-collinear regions of the genomes previously noted  <cit> , the presence of numerous cryptic collinear genome segments and the frequent occurrence of segmental inversions mean that inference of the positions of genes based on the locations of orthologues in a. thaliana can be misleading. indeed, excessive reliance on collinearity with the genome of a. thaliana may prove problematic for the ongoing efforts to sequence the b. rapa genome. polyploidy is common in plants, and there is no reason to conclude that the greater complexity of segmental rearrangement and evolution that we have observed is unusual. therefore, our results will be of relevance to studies in a wide range of polyploid plant genomes, many of which are being considered as having blocks of conserved synteny with respect to the genomes of model species, and studies relating to evolutionary breakpoints and their relation to genome organisation  <cit> .
