BACKGROUND
neonatal diarrhoea is a well-known clinical condition, present at varying prevalence in most commercial swine herds. however, since  <dig> field experiences on an apparently new diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices have been reported . the emergence of a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome  has been suggested in different countries  <cit> . a common feature of the reported cases is that known enteric pathogens cannot be associated with the clinical outbreaks in routine laboratory submissions.

routine laboratory testing protocols may vary from region to region. disregarding local procedures, the following agents are usually included in diagnostic protocols for neonatal diarrhoea: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli , clostridium perfringens type a , clostridium perfringens type c , clostridium difficile  rotavirus group a  and coronavirus  <cit> . parasites, which may be relevant to consider in relation to neonatal diarrhoea are cryptosporidium spp, giardia spp, cystoisospora suis and strongyloides ransomi <cit> . systematic investigations of piglets from herds affected by the apparently new diarrhoeic syndrome are lacking.

the overall aim of this study was to investigate whether a detailed microbiological examination of a larger number of piglets from affected herds could link the presence of neonatal diarrhoea with known enteric pathogens. such associations would challenge the hypothesis that a new disease syndrome has evolved. another aim was to determine if diarrhoeic piglets from different herds had characteristic and consistent gross and microscopic lesions to support the elaboration of a joint case definition of nnpds.

the article describes the prevalence of well-known enteric pathogens in age-matched diarrhoeic- and non-diarrhoeic piglets from four herds affected by neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion. furthermore, results of gross pathology and histopathology are presented. summarizing these findings, the article suggests a case-definition on nnpds.

RESULTS
epidemiologic data on piglets
a total of  <dig> diarrhoeic  and  <dig> non-diarrhoeic piglets  at the age of three to seven days were included in the study. clinically, the diarrhoeas were non-haemorrhagic. eighty percent of diarrhoeic piglets had been diarrhoeic for either two or three days prior to euthanasia. diarrhoea for four days was seen in 14% of the diarrhoeic piglets whereas only 6% had been diarrhoeic for five days.

microbiology
table  <dig> summarizes the microbiological findings in relation to diarrhoeic status. none of the microbiological agents was significantly more prevalent in diarrhoeic than in non-diarrhoeic piglets.

1: positive associations with diarrhoea tested by one-sided fisher’s exact test.

non-haemolytic e. coli was the predominant finding in the aerobic culture from both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets, whereas haemolytic strains were found in only three piglets in total . the main part of e. coli isolates were non-typeable. sixty-three e. coli isolates were subjected to virulence gene determination by pcr. fimbrial genes were detected in nine of  <dig> isolates from diarrhoeic piglets. the fimbrial distribution among isolates was; f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , f5/f <dig>  and f5/f <dig> . in non-diarrhoeic piglets fimbrial genes were detected in seven of  <dig> isolates. the fimbrial distribution among these isolates was; f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig>  and f <dig> . table  <dig> gives an overview of toxin genes detected in fimbriated and non-fimbriated isolates from the two groups of piglets. classic etec with simultaneous occurrence of both fimbrial and toxin genes were detected in only one diarrhoeic piglet.

1: heat-stable enterotoxins a and b. 2: heat-labile enterotoxin. 3: verotoxin 2e.

in the anaerobic culture, cpa was a very frequent finding. these bacteria were more prevalent in non-diarrhoeic than in diarrhoeic piglets .

necropsy
necropsy findings are presented in table  <dig>  very few extra-intestinal lesions were observed , and only one of these; a pale or icteric liver, was observed in more than one piglet .

1: one-sided fisher’s exact test. findings having a statistically significant positive association with diarrhoea are presented in bold.

as indicated in table  <dig>  six findings showed a statistically significant higher prevalence in diarrhoeic versus non-diarrhoeic piglets. table  <dig> outlines the prevalence of these six findings in the two groups of piglets within each herd. within all herds, a poor body condition, flaccidity of the small intestine, flaccidity of the large intestine and liquid large intestinal contents seemed positively associated with diarrhoea . flaccidity of the large intestine was in most cases  seen in conjunction with small intestinal flaccidity. figure  <dig> shows a flaccid and figure  <dig> shows a normal intestine.

* denotes significant statistical positive association with diarrhoea ) within the individual herds.

histopathology
in the small intestine, villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia was the most frequently observed lesion. figure  <dig> shows atrophic villi in ileum as compared to normal villi shown in figure  <dig>  overall, an atrophic pattern was seen in the jejunal and/or ileal mucosa in 63% of diarrhoeic and 12% of non-diarrhoeic piglets. the severity of atrophy varied, with no obvious association with diarrhoeic status. in ileum, the villous atrophy was most pronounced over the peyer’s patches. duodenal villi were not affected. a statistically significant association  between villous atrophy and flaccidity of the small intestine at necropsy was seen. in 76% of piglets having villous atrophy, small intestinal flaccidity had been recorded at necropsy.

irrespective of diarrhoeic status approximately 30% of piglets had a slight to moderate local infiltration of neutrophils in the lamina propria. occasionally, the lamina propria in the diarrhoeic piglets was congested and edematous.

mild epithelial lesions were seen at the tip of the villi in 20% of the diarrhoeic and 6% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets and were usually associated with villous atrophy. crypts of lieberkühn epithelium were intact in both groups. foci of mucosal necrosis were seen in the small intestines of 6% of the diarrhoeic piglets versus none of the non-diarrhoeic ones. in colon, mild epithelial lesions were seen in 33% of the diarrhoeic piglets and 11% of the non-diarrhoeic piglets. occasionally, the colonic crypts in diarrhoeic piglets were irregular and elongated. mucosal necrosis in the colon was seen in one diarrhoeic piglet, which also had necrotic changes in the small intestine.

no parasites were seen in the intestinal mucosa of any piglet.

table  <dig> depicts histopathological findings in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets within the four herds and summarizes the overall prevalences. both villous atrophy and large intestinal epithelial lesions showed an overall statistically significant positive association with diarrhoea, and seemed positively  associated with diarrhoea within all herds.

discussion
non-enterotoxigenic  e. coli was a frequent finding in both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic piglets, whereas only one enterotoxigenic isolate was detected. hence, etec did not seem to play any pathogenic role in relation to the investigated outbreaks of diarrhoea. other studies have indicated that attaching and effacing e. coli , carrying neither fimbrial nor toxin genes, are able to induce diarrhoea in newborn piglets  <cit>  and to induce villous atrophy  <cit> . the prevalence of aeec in the present study is currently being investigated.

cpc was cultured in four piglets of the study. due to the low prevalence the significance of this bacterium in relation to the investigated outbreaks is probably minimal. the significance of cpa in relation to diarrhoea in neonatal piglets is controversial, since it has been concomitantly recognized as part of the normal intestinal flora and as a potential intestinal pathogen  <cit> . in this study we found a significantly higher prevalence of cpa in non-diarrhoeic vs. diarrhoeic piglets. most likely, this finding merely reflects the intact intestinal flora within the non-diarrhoeic piglets. cd has been reported in cases of neonatal diarrhoea in piglets  <cit> . however, in this study, this bacterium was only detected in two piglets and the characteristic histopathological lesions previously reported to be associated with cd infections  <cit>  were not seen. accordingly, cd does not seem to be associated with the investigated outbreaks.

the scarcity of known pathogens in the outbreaks of the study supports the hypothesis that the investigated herds experienced diarrhoea of unknown aetiology. therefore the outbreaks may be representative of the new syndrome nnpds.

a poor body condition and dehydration were rather prevalent findings in diarrhoeic piglets in this study. however, unless very pronounced, these features are not characteristic for specific diarrhoeic syndromes, since they merely reflect the loss of nutrients and water associated with any diarrhoeic condition. milk-filled stomachs, in contrast, seem to be a characteristic finding associated with this syndrome. since neonatal diarrhoea is commonly associated with malabsorption caused by starvation, the filled stomachs seen in 100% of diarrhoeic piglets in this study are interesting findings which clearly differentiate this syndrome from outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea related to starvation. however, since the vast majority  of piglets in this study were diarrhoeic for two or three days only, we do not have information on the contents of stomachs at later stages of disease. obviously, one would expect long lasting diarrhoea to keep piglets from suckling due to malaise, and therefore this criterion is probably only valid at early stages of disease.

intestinal flaccidity was the most prominent and consistent gross lesion. flaccidity of intestines is seen in different conditions, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome   <cit>  and diet-induced malabsorption being the most obvious examples. liquid contents in colon are expected in all diarrhoeic conditions and are therefore not considered diagnostic to any specific syndrome. somewhat surprising, half of the diarrhoeic piglets did not have liquid content in colon at necropsy, which probably reflects that these piglets were in the recovery phase of disease. if so, this potentially implies a diagnostic problem due to less pronounced lesions and decreased excretion of infectious agents at this phase. however, since the clinical course of diarrhoea turned out to be very short  it would not have been practically feasible to avoid selection of piglets in recovery.

the most consistent and predominant histological lesion observed in diarrhoeic piglets was villous atrophy . villous atrophy is a very common finding in diarrhoeic conditions  <cit>  and in this study, the atrophy was neither associated with infection by well-known pathogens nor malnutrition. the strong association between villous atrophy and grossly visible intestinal flaccidity indicates that decreased mucosal thickness is reflected grossly as a thin-walled, atonic intestine. epithelial lesions in the large intestine also seemed to be consistently associated with diarrhoea in this study , but due to the low prevalence, these lesions do not seem to be relevant to include in a case definition.

overall, the present study suffers from lack of comparable piglets from non-nnpds-affected herds in order to correctly classify findings as typical or diagnostic of nnpds. moreover, the selection of study herds posed some difficulties since the selection was basically based on a high prevalence of diarrhoea and absence of agents . obviously, potential misclassification of herds is an issue to consider – though hard to address or control at this stage of investigation.

to our knowledge, this is the first study investigating outbreaks of diarrhoea in herds suspected to suffer from nnpds. the aetiology behind these outbreaks was either undetected pathogens or non-infectious factors. practical experience indicates that eg. high levels of protein in sow feed can lead to diarrhoea in neonatal pigs. however, all of the investigated herds used restricted levels of protein in sow feed, and had previously tried minimizing protein content with no preventive effect. as previously underlined, the diarrhoea seemed unrelated to postnatal starvation, bot intrauterine events may have affected the normal development of intestinal absorptive capacity. thus, the villous atrophy seen in the study may reflect prenatal under-development of villi.

the unspecific nature of intestinal lesions seen in this study underlines the complexity of intestinal pathology in neonatal pigs. interestingly, even early studies from the seventies and eighties concluded that gross lesions seem similar and unspecific irrespective of the underlying aetiology in this age group of piglets  <cit> . moreover, in the study from  <dig> no pathogens were detected in as many as 32% of fatal neonatal gastroenteropathies. thus, the existence of neonatal diarrhoa with unspecific lesions and without known pathogens is not a new phenomenon. it appears, however, that the clinical picture in the herds is new. at this point we do not know whether this clinical picture is a more severe manifestation of a syndrome already present but not recognized back in the seventies, or if we are experiencing a truly new syndrome.

from a practical point of view, obviously the most urgent issue is to recognize the aetiology behind the current problems. this study disclaims associations with established agents, but yet unestablished agents or shifts in intestinal bacteral population dynamics may play a role. therefore, culture-independent methods like metagenomics and high-throughput qpcr may be rewarding in the future investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study suggests the existence of a yet unexplained diarrhoea syndrome related to the first week of life. the syndrome is not related to starvation or infection by enterotoxigenic e. coli, clostridium perfringens type a or c, clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidium spp, giardia spp, cystoisospora suis or strongyloides ransomi. characteristic postmortem findings are flaccid intestines without mucosal pathology or lymph node enlargement. histologically, villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum are the most prominent findings and epithelial lesions in colon also seem to be associated with the syndrome. apparently, the flaccidity of intestines seen at necropsy is a reflection of the reduced length of intestinal villi. for a preliminary piglet level case-definition we suggest the following; non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, with no detection of known infectious agents and characterized by a milk-filled stomach and flaccid intestines at necropsy. since histopathological examination mainly revealed uncharacteristic lesions, this diagnostic approach does not seem to be rewarding at this stage of investigation.
