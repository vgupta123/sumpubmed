BACKGROUND
genome assemblies consist of kilobase- to megabase-sized contiguous sequences of dna  that need to be positioned in a correct order and orientation. this ordering of contigs  requires long-range structural information that reaches beyond the boundaries of contigs. commonly used reference genome assemblies, like those of human  <cit> , rat  <cit> , and mouse  <cit> , were all constructed using long-range structural information obtained by sanger sequencing based applications. for example, mapped large insert clones  and paired-end whole genome shotgun sequencing of plasmids with variable insert sizes contributed to elucidating the complexity of genomes at the structural level. despite the high quality of these assemblies, tens to thousands of intercontig gaps still persist  <cit> .

currently, genomes are frequently sequenced by cost-effective next-generation sequencing  technologies. however, long-range structural information is often not available from such efforts and would require more costly and toilsome techniques than routine fragment or paired-end sequencing. the absence of long-range information poses significant challenges for dealing with repetitive sequences that often represent 50% of mammalian genomes  <cit> . emerging technologies like long-read single-molecule sequencing  <cit>  or single-molecule mapping systems like optical mapping  <cit> , may eventually help to overcome many of the challenges put forward here. however, application of methods solely based on current ngs technology would be most optimal because such platforms are maturing fast and are very broadly available.current ngs platforms are already capable of producing positional information using paired-end  and mate-pair  templates. pe sequencing involves the generation of pairs of sequencing reads derived from both ends of a contiguous dna fragment. this sequencing modus is currently standard on most platforms but is limited by technology features  that typically only allow for insert sizes of less than  <dig> bp  <cit> . mp sequencing, however, can provide much longer distance information  <cit> , but requires several molecular sample processing steps to clone dna fragment ends through a circularization step, making it a relatively laborious approach. most commonly used mp approaches span  <dig> to  <dig> kilobase pairs  and are therefore capable of spanning many repetitive or low complexity sequence elements. however, common repetitive elements  in vertebrate genomes can span as much as  <dig> kb in size   <cit> , illustrating the need for longer range information for comprehensive analysis of genome structures. to this end, various bioinformatic algorithms like crest  <cit>  and allpaths-lg  <cit>  have been developed to increase effective pe read span by systematically merging overlapping sequences. experimentally, novel methods producing larger insert sizes have also been reported  <cit> . while these techniques clearly demonstrate the power of larger distance information, most do have limitations that could interfere with comprehensive analysis . furthermore, a systematic assessment of the utility and combination of different library insert sizes for resolving existing assembly difficulties in complex regions of genomes is currently lacking.

here, we modified existing mp library construction protocols to allow for the generation of a wide range of small, medium and large insert size mate-pair libraries  and present a systematic comparison of their individual and combined utility for exploring mammalian genome structure. our results show that two of the medium-sized mp libraries  are most efficient for bridging repeats in the rat genome as well as for contig scaffolding. furthermore, combining the medium-sized mps with large insert  libraries reduces the number of scaffolds by another 25% and results in a 3-fold increase in n <dig>  our results are useful to define the most optimal experimental paired-read approach to support the de novo assembly of mammalian genomes.

RESULTS
large insert mate-pair library generation
we constructed mp libraries through modification of the standard solid protocol for mate-pair library construction , to allow construction of mps with insert sizes up to  <dig> kb. we used ~ <dig> μg high-molecular-weight genomic dna isolated from tissue of a single brown norway rat as starting material for all libraries. sheared dna was size-separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  <cit>  followed by excision of various fragment sizes from a single lane and conversion into mate-pair libraries. in total, we generated seven different library insert sizes, including six libraries produced with this adapted mp protocol and one pe fragment library that was prepared in a separate experiment . based on paired read mapping, the libraries showed median insert sizes of  <dig> bp ,  <dig> kb,  <dig> kb,  <dig> kb,  <dig> kb,  <dig> kb, and  <dig> kb.

*** complexity is defined as minimal sequencing depth  at which over half of the pairs are clonal.

to assess library complexity by determining the maximum number of unique reads obtainable from a mp library, two of the large-insert libraries  were sequenced to a higher depth in an additional sequencing run. to assess reproducibility of the adapted mp protocol, three libraries  were generated in duplicate from independently isolated, sheared, and separated genomic dna samples. insert size distributions of the individually produced replicates were highly consistent . in total,  <dig>  million pairs of mp reads and  <dig> million pairs of pe reads were generated. a total of  <dig>  million non-duplicate mp read pairs and  <dig> million non-duplicate pe reads were consistently mapped against the rat reference genome, resulting in a genome-wide physical coverage of  <dig> × . less than 1% of the paired reads were inverted  or everted  and approximately 10% were mapped remotely . remote, inverted, or everted events represent a mixture of 1) library construction artefacts due to chimeric molecules, 2) errors in the reference genome assembly  and 3) real structural differences between the reference strain and the substrain tested here. the first category typically involves stochastic events that are supported by a single read pair and that are filtered out by requiring multiple independent supporting read pairs for calling.

library sequencing and quality assessment
sequencing libraries may suffer from low complexity due to library amplification steps in the protocol. when the proportion of unique library molecules is low due to inefficient molecular reactions or low amounts of input material, sequencing more reads of that same library would not yield any additional information, but only extra copies of previously sequenced molecules . we assessed the complexity of each library by plotting the number of read-pairs with unique genome coordinates against the total number of all mapped pairs . in general, the complexity of the small-insert libraries is higher than that of the large-insert libraries, which more quickly saturate to the level where deeper sequencing delivers predominantly non-informative duplicate reads. duplicate reads do not necessarily affect the utility of the libraries, because these reads are filtered out as a first step in the analysis procedure; however, low complexity does decrease the capacity to obtain sufficient physical genome coverage. three sample groups can be distinguished in figure 1b:  high-complexity libraries that deliver approximately  <dig> million unique pairs ,  medium-complexity libraries that result in about  <dig> million unique pairs , and  low-complexity libraries resulting in approximately  <dig> million unique pairs . several of the low-complexity libraries show a plateau in the curve, indicating that these have been sequenced to saturation . for others , deeper sequencing would be informative.

library complexity may be influenced by several experimental conditions. when starting with an equal quantity of genomic dna, fragmentation for a standard pe library provides approximately 140-fold more unique molecules than for a 25-kb library. furthermore, mp library preparation involves a circularization step  that becomes less efficient as the size of the molecule increases. quantification of dna before and after circularization  showed a circularization efficiency of up to 37% for libraries below  <dig> kb and 5–10% for libraries above  <dig> kb . each of these library generation steps has a negative impact on the recovery of material; for example, an input of  <dig> μg 25-kb size-selected dna would result in approximately  <dig> ng  of dna for adapter ligation and subsequent adapter-mediated pcr. as a consequence, more pcr cycles are required for larger insert libraries to obtain sufficient amounts of library dna for ngs . although the 3- and 5-kb insert libraries could routinely be generated at high complexity, we observed more technical variation for the large insert libraries. for example, the 20-kb library required only  <dig> pcr cycles during the library preparation procedure and performed well in the complexity analysis . the 15- and 25-kb libraries required  <dig> and  <dig> cycles, respectively, and resulted in libraries of lower complexity . these results indicate that the number of required pcr cycles is a very good predictive parameter for library complexity.

the 5-, 8-, and 15-kb libraries were generated in duplicate using dna isolated from two different tissues of the same animal. the insert size distribution was found to be highly reproducible , but the library complexity was much more variable between duplicates . these differences might have been due to differences in dna quality  or purity  of the dna and subsequent differences in shearing efficiency. indeed, dna yields after size fragmentation were as much as  <dig> -fold lower for the duplicate dna sample , which systematically resulted in less complex libraries. most importantly, however, statistics for the amount of consistently mapped read pairs were comparable for all replicates , indicating that the mapped unique read pairs were similar in quality  and insert size. low complexity in libraries could be circumvented by using larger amounts of input dna and/or by optimization of shearing conditions to concentrate dna in the desired size range. in our experiments we aimed for a broad size distribution to be able to simultaneously extract dna for a range of different sizes.

although the larger insert libraries come with more duplicate reads, far fewer sequencing pairs are required to physically cover the complete genome. it should be noted, that for all mp libraries in the experiments described here more than 10x physical coverage was obtained, including 48x coverage for  <dig> kb inserts.

to assess the value of the various insert size libraries for genome structure analysis, we determined the ability of each library to  physically cover the reference genome and overlap various repeat elements,  drive contig scaffolding, and  fix contig assembly issues in the current genome assembly .

spanning repeats and physical genome coverage
the ability to physically cover a complete genome by sequencing is not only determined by the length of the read, the insert size of the library, and the number of paired reads, but also depends on genome-specific characteristics, like the composition and distribution of repetitive elements. the rat genome is representative for other mammalian genomes and contains  <dig>  gb of repetitive sequences, which is over 49% of the  <dig>  gb in the current reference genome assembly . retrotransposable line  elements are the largest class of repeats with a total length of  <dig>  mb , followed by retrotransposons that are flanked by long terminal repeats . to evaluate the effect of library insert size on the degree of physical genome coverage, we merged data from duplicate libraries with the same insert size. although the mp libraries had far more physical genome coverage, all datasets were normalized to an equal physical genome coverage based on properly mapped and oriented read pairs, which was limited to  <dig> x by the available amount of data for the pe library. next, we determined per library the fraction of bases per contig of the rat reference genome that is physically covered, specifically focusing on repetitive elements. despite the same physical genome coverage and much higher base coverage, short-insert libraries  were much less efficient in spanning long repetitive elements, such as lines or ltrs, than larger insert mp libraries  . as expected, pe pairs overlapped hardly any of these elements but also the most widely used 3-kb mp libraries were found to only span approximately half of the 3-kb repeat elements, and only a few elements with sizes above  <dig> kb. slightly improved results were observed for the 5-kb and 8-kb mp libraries, where approximately half of the repeats with a matched size could be spanned by at least one mate-pair. the 15-, 20-, and 25-kb libraries spanned over 90% of the repeat elements across the whole size spectrum and all displayed a very similar performance, indicating that there is limited added value for even larger insert sizes.

contig scaffolding
to evaluate the utility of the various libraries for guiding genome assembly, we simulated the scaffolding step of such process by using the  <dig>  contigs from the current rat genome build and the different mp data sets as input for the sspace  <dig>   <cit>  software. to allow for library insert-size comparison, we again used the normalized datasets at  <dig> x physical coverage and determined the n <dig>  and the number of scaffolds  for each individual library and combinations thereof, using the output of the sspace software . when we consider only the utility of single libraries, the n <dig> increases from ~ <dig> kb for the pe data to 140– <dig> kb for the mp libraries of  <dig> kb and up. pe libraries are not effective in reducing the number of scaffolds as compared to the capillary sequencing-based contigs: a reduction of only  <dig> scaffolds is obtained . in contrast, individual mp libraries decreased the number of scaffolds by up to more than 50% . when considering two insert size libraries, combination of  <dig> or  <dig> kb and  <dig> or  <dig> kb are most optimal with n50's of ~ <dig>  mb. intriguingly,  <dig> kb mate-pair libraries, which are most commonly used, showed the worst performance from all mp libraries, also when combined with other libraries. including all libraries in the scaffolding process results in a further decrease of scaffolds  with an n <dig> increase up to  <dig>  mb. increasing the physical coverage for a single insert library shows to be far less effective than combining libraries with different insert size . for example, when we increase the coverage of the  <dig> kb insert library to 34x physical coverage, the n <dig> increases from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb. however, combining  <dig> x coverage data for the  <dig> kb insert library with similar coverage of any other mp library  results in much higher n <dig> values ranging from ~ <dig> kb up to ~ <dig> mb.

*all libraries were normalized to  <dig> x physical genome coverage, limited by the amount of available data for the paired-end  library.

reference genome improvement
finally, we evaluated the value of various mp insert sizes for improving the existing rat genome assembly. to this end, we compared de novo scaffolds constructed using mp data with independently obtained genome-wide optical mapping data. optical mapping is an integrated system that provides long-range genome structural information by the construction and analysis of genome-wide, ordered restriction maps  <cit> . we limited the analysis of concordance between sequence scaffolds and optical maps to one of the small rat chromosomes , because the fine level optical structural alterations  that were automatically called by the optical mapping pipeline  <cit>  were manually curated between sequence scaffolds and optical maps, which required exploration on a case-by-case basis for mediation at the nucleotide-level. we divided the chromosome into  <dig> 100-kb windows and found that  <dig> out of  <dig> of such bins harboured structural changes within scaffolds of rno <dig> when comparing the mp-updated genome structure with the original genome. the  <dig> bins contained a total of  <dig> unique inconsistent connections between contigs within scaffolds. next, we looked at structural differences between scaffolds of rno <dig>  based on the comparison of the mp-based scaffolding and the reference genome and observed many more bins to be affected . in total,  <dig> bins showed one or both types of inconsistent connections. of these  <dig> bins, only  <dig> showed concordance with the reference genome.  <dig> bins were found to contain osas including absence or discordance of alignment between the optical maps and rgsc  <dig>  genome assembly . because the optical mapping system constructs ordered restriction maps and does not evaluate genome structure at the nucleotide level, not all discordances detected by the mate-pair analysis are revealed through optical mapping data. for example, small contigs or changes that do not overlap with a swai restriction site will not be identified.

we explored two of the largest segments with long-range disagreement between optical maps and rgsc <dig>  assembly and conclude that mp-assisted re-scaffolding can recover concordance with the independently generated optical maps . the complete mp data described here has therefore also been used for building the new genome reference of the rat .

discussion
here, we show that large insert mp sequencing is a versatile tool for analysing genomes at the structural level and providing long-range information for genome scaffolding. our results show that the addition of mp sequencing can dramatically increase contingency of mammalian genome references. in all analyses, insert sizes of > <dig> kb were shown to be essential because of their ability to bridge the longer and more abundant line and ltr elements. the analysis where the fraction of long repeats that is spanned by each mp library is determined shows that large insert mps are capable of spanning ~90% of the annotated long repeats. the remaining approximately 10% of elements that could not be bridged by any of the mp reads can likely be explained by a highly repetitive nucleotide context around the repeat elements themselves. when a repeat element is surrounded by other repeats  one or both reads of the pair that would span such region can not be mapped uniquely to the genome and can thus not be included in the analysis. in agreement with this, our data show that even a combination of all libraries in this study fails to span 4–5% of repetitive elements larger than  <dig> kb in size . because rat and other vertebrate genomes contain tens of thousands of repeat elements that exceed the routinely used paired-end insert sizes , but include the very common line elements, we conclude that the inclusion of mate-pair libraries with insert sizes of  <dig> kb and above are instrumental for comprehensive reconstruction of genome structures.

the largest insert libraries  were instrumental for increasing the n <dig> of scaffolds to megabase levels. because the draft rat genome is already of relatively high quality, the improvements presented here have only mild effects. however, we anticipate that large insert mp sequencing will be very useful for finalizing low-pass capillary sequenced or ngs-based genomes like those of most primates as well as many of the vertebrate genomes. genomes with large fractions or large segments of repeats, like that of the zebrafish or certain plants, might benefit even more from large insert mate-pair data as their genomes have a very high repeat content in combination with recently duplicated sequences. furthermore, most ongoing genome sequencing projects employ next-generation sequencing techniques, and because de novo genome assembly based on short-reads is still in its infancy, contig sizes for vertebrate genomes are typically in the kilobase range  <cit> . although paired-end data with insert sizes up to  <dig> bp are now commonly included in these processes, our results demonstrate that longer-range information as provided by the large insert mps described here is essential for comprehensive genome assembly. it should be stressed that the structure of every genome of interest is unique and variable in complexity. therefore, the optimal combination of mp insert sizes will vary as well. a quick examination of the repeat size and distribution could aid in determining which mp insert size combination is expected to be optimal, but experimental optimization or a broad range of libraries such as used here might be required.

in the analyses presented here, we focused on the application of large insert mps for genome sequencing efforts, but the findings could be extrapolated to the detection of structural variation. previous analyses of whole human genomes have shown that svs affect more base pairs than single point mutations, yet the field has struggled to find a suitable approach for comprehensive detection of such events  <cit> . hillmer et al. concluded that the most optimal insert size for sv detection is approximately  <dig> kb, although a thorough examination of the value of insert sizes above  <dig> kb was not described  <cit> . in unravelling the structure and organization of ultra-complex clustered mutation events, like the recently described chromothripsis, larger insert sizes  may extend the detection limit and help to complete the overall picture  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that a “mate-pair only” approach also comes with disadvantages: small insertions, inversions, duplications, and deletions may be missed due to the broad size distribution and relatively low coverage at the base level.

large insert mp sequencing represents a good alternative for the more traditional bacterial artificial chromosome-end sequencing because the sequencing libraries can be produced by relatively simple and scalable procedures without the need for laborious cloning and colony picking. furthermore, the protocol can be fitted to all existing ngs platforms by changing the oligonucleotide adapters that are used. the mate-pair library construction protocol is relatively laborious compared to standard fragment library construction protocols, but with the latest improvements of the mate-pair protocol , the procedure takes ~ <dig> hours of hands-on work. more importantly, robustness of the protocol has been increased and the required input genomic dna was reduced to only 1– <dig> μg for a standard ≤ 3-kb library, compared to 5– <dig> μg for the solid v <dig> protocol . the removal of column-based clean-up steps and the increased circularization efficiency  are the main factors that allow for a reduced amount of input dna. nevertheless, our results show that limiting the amount of input dna can strongly affect the complexity of the resulting library. for larger insert libraries it is therefore recommended to start with maximized amounts of dna .

although large insert mp libraries must be sufficiently complex, high physical genome-wide coverage is readily obtained at relatively low sequencing depth of tens of million read pairs. alternative large insert approaches, like fosmid di-tag sequencing  <cit> , have been documented to suffer from low library complexity, which may be overcome by using larger amounts of input material, but they have an additional disadvantage as they are restricted to a fixed insert size of approximately  <dig> kb  <cit> . our data clearly demonstrate the added value of medium-sized insert libraries for genome structure analysis, a conclusion that was supported by hampton et al.  <cit> , who had to use supporting 4– <dig> kb mate-pair data to obtain essential long-range information that could not be obtained by fosmid di-tags alone. using the mp protocol presented here, small, medium and large insert mp libraries can be generated in one go. nevertheless, we did not generate libraries of equal size to 40-kb fosmid clones, so we could not determine if inserts of  <dig> kb are sufficient to fully replace  <dig> kb fosmid clones or if  <dig> kb pairs would span the last 4-5% of repeats that could not be covered by any of the mps used here.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that large insert mp sequencing provides a robust approach for comprehensive assessment of genome structure and for driving genome scaffolding processes. applying combinations of mate-pair libraries with insert sizes that match the distributions of repetitive elements improves contig scaffolding and can contribute to the finishing of draft genomes. the sequencing platform flexibility, the scalable large insert size, the relatively limited amount of required sequencing tags, and the associated low sequencing costs make large insert mp sequencing an interesting and broadly applicable technique that is accessible for every routine sequencing lab.
