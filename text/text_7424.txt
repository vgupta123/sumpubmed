BACKGROUND
resident cardiac fibroblasts  are active regulators of myocardial function in health and disease, serving as a source of autocrine and paracrine factors to support cardiomyocyte function, as well as synthesizing the extracellular matrix —a highly dynamic structure necessary for maintaining cardiac homeostasis, transmitting contractile forces, preventing myocyte slippage and facilitating intercellular signaling  <cit> . cardiomyocytes comprise the bulk of the myocardial volume; however, interstitial fbs are the most numerous cell type and coordinate the maintenance of ecm through production and secretion of structural proteins, growth factors, cytokines and proteinases  <cit> .

while fb activity is typically low in the healthy heart, aging, stress, inflammation or damage can instigate a phenotypic conversion to proto-myofibroblasts  and myofibroblasts , resulting in dramatic up-regulation of ecm synthesis, particularly fibrillar collagen types i and iii . during this transition, fbs begin to express α-smooth muscle actin , which is incorporated into newly formed contractile bundles and stress fibers that impart cell contractility to facilitate damage repair . mfbs are further distinguished from their precursors by up-regulation of non-muscle myosin heavy chain iib  and the extra domain-a splice variant of fibronectin   <cit> . production and secretion of factors involved in cell signaling and adhesion, including proteoglycans and matricellular proteins, also increase . in the non-stressed heart, mfbs are found at the cardiac valves, playing a key role in valve maintenance  <cit> . several inducers of the fb to mfb conversion process have been identified, including tgfβ; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely defined, and it is unclear whether fb phenotype conversion is controlled by a central factor  <cit> .

the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor scleraxis  is required for development and function of ecm-rich tissues, including tendons and cardiac valves  <cit> . we have shown that scx directly regulates col1a <dig> gene expression in primary cardiac fbs and mfbs, and is up-regulated in the cardiac infarct scar or in response to tgfβ signaling  <cit> . scx similarly controls expression of col1a <dig> in tenocytes, suggesting a direct role for this transcription factor in modulating fibrillar collagen production across tissues  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether scx plays a broader role in ecm synthesis or fb biology.

here we report that scx is a required and potent regulator of the cardiac fb and mfb phenotype and attendant gene expression, including the hallmarks of ecm production and cell contraction. ex vivo, scx induced the expression of various fibrillar collagens, proteoglycans, matrix metalloproteinases  and numerous markers of the fb and mfb phenotype in primary cardiac pmfbs, and directly transactivated the gene promoters of vimentin, mmp <dig> and fibronectin. scx was sufficient and necessary for the expression of αsma via direct promoter binding, inducing the incorporation of αsma into stress fibers and consequent cell contraction. in contrast, scx knockdown significantly attenuated the expression of ecm and fb/mfb marker genes, and fully attenuated tgfβ-mediated cell contraction. these findings were recapitulated in vivo: the hearts of scx knockout mice presented with dramatic losses of ecm mass and expression of ecm and fb marker genes. the function of scx null cardiac fbs could be rescued by restoration of scx expression. we found that scx was required for smad3-mediated fibrillar collagen gene expression, and the assembly of a smad3-containing transcriptional complex at the col1a <dig> gene promoter. surprisingly, scx null hearts exhibited a ~50 % reduction in fb number. this effect may be due to a failure of epithelial precursors to undergo mesenchymal transition during development since scx was found to regulate expression of mesenchymal markers, including twist <dig> and snai <dig>  leading to elevated epithelial and reduced mesenchymal marker gene expression in scx null hearts. furthermore, scx expression in a <dig> epithelial cells reduced epithelial markers while up-regulating mesenchymal and fb markers, as well as fibrillar collagens. together, these results reveal a novel and critical role for scx in governing the hallmarks of the cardiac fb phenotype, including the regulation of mesenchymal character, conversion to mfbs, ecm synthesis and cell contraction.

RESULTS
scleraxis is sufficient and necessary for induction of cardiac ecm gene expression
we previously demonstrated that scx directly regulates the expression of col1a <dig>  one of two component chains of type i collagen, in cardiac mfbs in vitro via conserved promoter e-boxes, and others have shown that scx up-regulates the col1a <dig> chain in tenocytes  <cit> . however, while type i collagen is the primary component of the cardiac ecm, it is unclear whether scx plays a broader regulatory role in ecm gene expression, thus we examined this possibility using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. in isolated primary rat pmfbs, an intermediate phenotype between fbs and mfbs  <cit> , scx induced expression of the major cardiac fibrillar collagens , but not non-fibrillar col4a <dig> , suggesting that fibrillar collagens were specifically impacted, and that our results do not represent a general effect on collagen expression. several proteoglycans were up-regulated by scx, including fmod, lum and dcn , similar to results reported for proteoglycan regulation by scx in cardiac valves  <cit> .fig.  <dig> scleraxis up-regulates matrix target genes. a–c assay of collagen , proteoglycan  and matrix metalloproteinase  mrna expression by qpcr following over-expression of scx  in primary rat cardiac proto-myofibroblasts compared to controls  reveals numerous matrix genes are induced; n =  <dig>  d protein lysates from adgfp- or adscx-infected primary rat cardiac proto-myofibroblasts were assayed for mmp activity by gel zymography. zymograms were obtained  <dig> or 48 h following infection and revealed transient induction of prommp <dig> and loss of mmp <dig> following scx over-expression; c, control recombinant human mmp <dig> protein; n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs adgfp, #p <  <dig>  vs corresponding 24 h time point



scx over-expression significantly increased mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> expression, but decreased mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> . in agreement with these results, scx transiently increased prommp <dig> activity by over fivefold , but decreased combined mmp9/prommp <dig> activity within 24 h . by 48 h, prommp <dig> and combined mmp <dig> activity returned to control levels. some mmps  may thus be under direct transcriptional control by scx.

we confirmed that scx is required for ecm gene expression via shrna-mediated loss-of-function in primary rat cardiac pmfbs. we generated a novel adenovirus encoding a scx shrna , which rapidly and potently attenuated scx expression but had no effect on paraxis, a transcription factor with the highest homology to scx   <cit> . scx expression was lost even after treatment with tgfβ, which we have shown potently induces scx expression   <cit> . scx knockdown attenuated expression of the same fibrillar collagens induced by scx over-expression, and did not affect col4a <dig> expression . scx knockdown similarly reduced expression of several proteoglycans, including fmod, lum and dcn, complementing the over-expression results . scx loss reduced mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> expression, while inducing mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> . together, these results indicate that scx exerts broad control of genes regulating ecm synthesis and turn-over.fig.  <dig> cardiac matrix gene expression is attenuated by scleraxis knockdown. a primary cardiac proto-myofibroblasts exhibited loss of scx but not paraxis mrna following infection with adenovirus encoding an shrna targeting scx  but not control shrna  for 72 h . results were normalized to the respective adshlacz sample; n =  <dig>  b cells treated as in , with or without 10 ng/ml tgfβ or vehicle, were assayed for scx protein expression 72 h after infection and results normalized to α-tubulin; n =  <dig>  adshscx attenuated scx protein expression even in the presence of tgfβ. c–d fibrillar collagen mrna  and nascent soluble 150 kda collagen i protein  expression was down-regulated following scx knockdown , with cell treatment and normalization as in ; n =  <dig>  e–f the expression of mrnas encoding several proteoglycans  and matrix metalloproteinases   was reduced following scx knockdown; n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs corresponding adshlacz control



cardiac fibroblast phenotype regulation by scleraxis
increased ecm expression is a hallmark of fb to mfb phenotype conversion. given scx’s regulation of a broad variety of ecm genes, we hypothesized that scx governs cardiac fb phenotype, thus we assayed a broad panel of fb and mfb markers following scx gain- or loss-of-function. scx over-expression in cardiac pmfbs increased synthesis of nearly all markers tested , including the collagen receptor ddr <dig>  eda-fn/fn <dig>  vimentin/vim and periostin/postn, an integrin ligand implicated in fibrosis of various tissues and cardiac fb specification  <cit> . scx knockdown conversely decreased all markers , suggesting reversion away from the mfb phenotype. luciferase assay demonstrated that scx significantly transactivated the vim, mmp <dig> and fn <dig> gene promoters , supporting that scx’s effects are primarily due to direct target gene transactivation rather than by a secondary mediator.fig.  <dig> scleraxis regulates cardiac fibroblast phenotype. a–c fibroblast/myofibroblast marker gene mrna  and protein  expression was assayed in primary cardiac proto-myofibroblasts following scx over-expression  vs controls  , or following scx knockdown  compared to controls  , assayed by qpcr or western blot; n =  <dig>  scx loss induced similar down-regulation of fibroblast and myofibroblast markers, while scx over-expression induced marker expression. d scx transactived the vimentin, mmp <dig> and fibronectin gene promoters compared to empty vector control  as determined by luciferase reporter assays in nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts; n =  <dig>  or n =  <dig> . *p <  <dig>  vs adgfp , vs adshlacz  or vs control empty vector 



scx regulates target gene expression via interaction with dna promoter cis e-box elements  <cit> . we previously showed that scx’s basic dna-binding and helix-loop-helix protein-binding domains are functionally critical, with deletion of the basic domain resulting in a dominant negative mutant  <cit> . a scx mutant lacking both domains  had no effect on transactivation of the human col1a <dig> promoter, failed to attenuate scx-mediated transactivation and did not alter the expression of fibrillar collagens or fb/mfb markers in pmfbs, suggesting that this double mutant is inactive, and indicating that the transcriptional activity of scx is required for regulating target gene expression .

scleraxis directly regulates αsma gene expression
since scx induced the mfb phenotype, we examined the effect of scx on expression of αsma/acta <dig>  a contractile protein not typically expressed in cardiac fbs, but which is sharply up-regulated during conversion to mfbs  <cit> . scx knockdown reduced  while over-expression induced αsma expression  and incorporation into stress fibers , a characteristic of mfbs  <cit> . in agreement with this finding, scx induced cell contraction of cardiac pmfbs . intriguingly, knockdown of scx completely attenuated cell contraction induced by tgfβ , demonstrating a requirement for scx in this process.fig.  <dig> scleraxis regulates cardiac myofibroblast α-smooth muscle actin expression and cell contraction. a–b αsma mrna  and protein  expression were assayed by qpcr or western blot, respectively, following knockdown of scx  in primary cardiac proto-myofibroblasts, showing attenuated αsma expression compared to control ; n =  <dig>  c scx over-expression  up-regulated αsma expression in primary rat cardiac proto-myofibroblasts as determined by mrna or protein expression ; n =  <dig>  d induced αsma was incorporated into stress fibers, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry, indicating promotion of the myofibroblast phenotype by scx; 20× objective, scale bar = 65 μm. e primary cardiac proto-myofibroblasts seeded onto compressible collagen gel matrices were assayed for gel contraction following scx over-expression or knockdown, with or without concomitant 10 ng/ml tgfβ <dig> to induce contraction. crosses denote the detected margin of the collagen gel. f–g quantification of gel contraction images, reported as the percentage of the maximum contraction induced by 10 % fbs, demonstrates that scx over-expression induces cell contraction , while scx knockdown attenuates tgfβ1-induced contraction ; n =  <dig>  except adgfp + tgfβ and adscx + tgfβ; n =  <dig> each) or n =  <dig> . *p <  <dig>  vs adshlacz , vs adgfp  or vs adshlacz + vehicle , #p < <dig>  vs vehicle controls  or vs adshlacz + tgfβ . h alignment of putative scx-binding e-boxes  in the proximal rat, mouse and human αsma promoters. asterisks and periods denote nucleotides conserved across three or two species, respectively. i mutation of one or both e-boxes  attenuates transactivation of the rat αsma proximal promoter by scx as determined by luciferase reporter assay; n =  <dig>  j electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate scx-binding to e-boxes e <dig> and e2; this binding is abolished when the e-boxes are mutated . ns, non-shifted lane; s, shifted lane; cc, 500× cold competition. the arrow denotes the shifted complex. k scx-binding to the αsma gene promoter is significantly enriched in cardiac myofibroblasts  compared to fibroblasts  as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with qpcr quantification of scx-bound dna; n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs control empty vector  or vs fb , #p <  <dig>  vs scleraxis + non-mutated promoter 



we tested whether αsma is a direct scx gene target. the rat αsma proximal promoter contains two well-characterized e-boxes critical for cis regulation   <cit> . scx transactivated the αsma promoter nearly tenfold, and mutating these e-boxes attenuated promoter transactivation by scx . electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that scx forms complexes with the intact but not mutated e-boxes . chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed this interaction; however, due to their close proximity  we could not resolve whether scx bound to one or both e-boxes. the amount of dna-bound scx increased by over threefold in cardiac mfbs compared to fbs , congruent with increased scx-mediated αsma expression during phenotype conversion . this data contrasts with a previous report in mesangial cells reporting that scx was capable of binding only to the second e-box, resulting in an inhibitory effect on αsma expression  <cit> . our results demonstrate that scx activity across cell types is highly variable and requires empirical testing, and suggests unique roles for scx in specific tissues.

scleraxis is required for cardiac fibroblast gene expression in vivo
our ex vivo data revealed that scx regulates fb phenotype and ecm synthesis, thus we assessed its in vivo role using knockout mice. scx loss induces cardiac morphological anomalies, including altered valve structure, rounding of the ventricles and involution of the apex, but the effect on myocardial structure and composition has not been reported. it is unclear whether such alterations are pathological; however, as noted previously  <cit> , homozygous null pups were under-represented at birth. of  <dig> pups born, we identified  <dig>  nulls ,  <dig>  heterozygotes and  <dig>  wild type ; furthermore,  <dig> ko  died prior to 6 weeks of age. ko pups were runted . we noted a significant ~30 % hypotrophy of the heart . despite this decreased relative size, echocardiography revealed largely normal function , in agreement with earlier data  <cit> . left ventricular end diastolic diameter, normalized to tibia length, was modestly  but significantly elevated in ko mice and endocardial velocity trended lower, suggesting the existence of early systolic dysfunction. such modest changes seem unlikely to contribute to the elevated mortality in ko mice, thus the causes of pre- and post-natal mortality remain unclear.

we examined net fibrillar collagen expression in cardiac sections from wt or scx ko mice histologically and by immunolabeling, and noted a clear reduction in collagen staining . notably, collagen fibrils appeared diminished in number and size, and there was considerable reduction of perivascular collagen staining. the reduction in red/yellow fibers visible with picrosirius red staining under circularly polarized light is indicative of a net loss of organized collagen bundles . cardiac ecm dry weight was reduced up to 49 % . congruent with these data, mrna and protein  levels of the major cardiac fibrillar collagens were dramatically decreased by 30–45 %. as in our ex vivo data, non-fibrillar col4a <dig> expression was unaltered.fig.  <dig> scleraxis null mice exhibit reduced cardiac extracellular matrix and fibroblast marker gene expression. a cross sections of hearts from wild type  or scx null  hearts stained for fibrillar collagen using picrosirius red , masson’s trichrome or via immunolabeling for total collagen i  revealed matrix loss in ko hearts; collagen i: 20× objective, scale bar = 35 μm; picrosirius/trichrome: 40× objective, scale bar = 66 μm. the blue color channel was extracted from the masson’s trichrome sections for improved visualization. samples are representative of at least three individual animals of each genotype. b decellularized and dehydrated cardiac ventricular ecm from wt or ko mice was normalized to cardiac ventricular wet mass or tibia length and revealed ecm loss in ko hearts; n =  <dig> animals of each genotype. c–d fibrillar collagen gene expression by qpcr  or western blotting normalized to gapdh or β-actin  was decreased in scx ko hearts compared to wt; n =  <dig>  or collagen i blot in ) or n =  <dig> ). collagen i protein expression was the sum of the α <dig> and α <dig> isoforms. e–f the expression of mrnas encoding several proteoglycans  and matrix metalloproteinases   was lost in scx ko hearts; n =  <dig> animals of each genotype. g mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> activity  of protein lysates from wt or ko hearts was reduced in null animal hearts; n =  <dig> animals of each genotype. *p <  <dig>  vs wt. h–i fibroblast/myofibroblast marker gene mrna  and protein  expression was assayed in wt and scx ko mice, assayed by qpcr or western blot; n =  <dig>  and vimentin in ) or n =  <dig> ). scx loss induced similar down-regulation of fibroblast and myofibroblast markers. *p <  <dig>  vs wt



also in agreement with our ex vivo data, ecm alterations were not limited to collagens: we observed a general decrease in proteoglycan expression in the hearts of scx ko mice compared to wt, with significant loss of fmod, vcan and bgn . conversely, decorin expression was undisturbed, thus proteoglycan loss was also not universal.

similar to our ex vivo data, ko hearts exhibited significantly reduced mrna expression of mmp <dig>  mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> . this down-regulation correlated with a generalized loss of activity of both the mature and latent  forms of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> . scx gene deletion in vivo thus resulted in altered expression of collagen, proteoglycans and mmps, which closely recapitulated our knockdown data.

scx regulated cardiac fb phenotype ex vivo , thus we assayed relevant marker expression in wt and ko hearts. all markers tested were significantly down-regulated by over 50 % in scx ko mice . in agreement with our data demonstrating direct regulation of αsma expression by scx , we also observed a significant loss of αsma protein in scx ko hearts . since αsma is not expressed in cardiac fbs in the healthy heart, this loss likely reflects changes in vascular smooth muscle cells.

scleraxis is required for smad3-mediated gene expression
it is unclear whether the in vivo alterations in cardiac fb gene expression reflect an inherent transcription defect in these cells, thus we tested whether scx could rescue gene expression in cardiac pmfbs from wt and ko mice via adenoviral transgene delivery. ko cells exhibited virtually no scx expression, but adscx drove scx to approximately sixfold of wt expression . the significant loss of vim, acta <dig>  fn <dig>  col1a <dig>  col1a <dig> and col3a <dig> observed in these cells was similarly rescued . loss of expression of these genes in scx null cells is thus not due to a generalized defect in the transcription mechanism, but rather is specific to loss of scx transcriptional activity. in accordance with our earlier data, neither loss nor rescue of scx altered col4a <dig> expression.fig.  <dig> requirement of scleraxis for smad3-mediated gene expression. a over-expression of scx  for 24 h rescues expression of vimentin, αsma, ed-a fibronectin and fibrillar collagen mrna  in primary cardiac proto-myofibroblasts obtained from scx null mice compared to controls ; n =  <dig> independent samples per genotype. impaired collagen expression in scx null cells is thus due to scx loss and not a defect in the basal transcriptional machinery. b up-regulation of fibrillar collagen mrna expression by smad <dig>  is attenuated following scx knockdown  compared to shrna control in cardiac proto-myofibroblasts ; n =  <dig>  c scx and smad <dig> physically interact. expression vectors for ha-tagged scx and myc-tagged smad <dig> were individually or jointly transfected into nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts, then immunoprecipitated  by anti-ha antibodies and subjected to western blotting with anti-myc antibodies . non-immunoprecipitated input and non-specific igg antibodies were employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. equal loading of transfected whole-cell lysates is shown by anti-ha and anti-myc western blots. conversely, co-immunoprecipitation with smad <dig> was not observed when a scx mutant lacking its protein-interaction domain  was employed . d smad <dig> and rna polymerase ii interaction with the col1α <dig> gene promoter is significantly impaired in cardiac fibroblasts derived from scx ko mouse hearts compared to wt, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation  and re-chip  followed by qpcr, indicating that scx loss impairs smad <dig> signaling and smad3-mediated recruitment of the transcription complex to the col1α <dig> gene promoter; n =  <dig> independent samples per genotype. e adenovirus-mediated over-expression of a dna-binding scx mutant  in human ventricular myofibroblasts attenuates smad <dig> and rna polymerase ii recruitment to the smad-binding element of the col1α <dig> gene promoter compared to control  performed as in ; n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs wt  or vs adgfp + adshlacz  or vs igg , #p <  <dig>  vs ko + adgfp  or vs adsmad3 + adshlacz  or vs wt  or as indicated 



we previously demonstrated strong synergy between scx and smad <dig> in regulating col1a <dig> expression, and that deletion of scx-binding sites in the col1a <dig> promoter attenuated smad <dig> transactivation of this promoter  <cit> . we therefore examined the impact of scx knockdown on smad3-mediated collagen gene expression in primary pmfbs. smad <dig> induced expression of the fibrillar collagens col1a <dig>  col1a <dig> and col3a <dig>  but this was significantly attenuated by scx knockdown . given this dependence of smad <dig> activity on scx, we tested whether smad <dig> and scx physically interact using co-immunoprecipitation of scx and smad <dig>  we observed a clear interaction between the two proteins , in agreement with a recent report that smad <dig> binds scx in tendons  <cit> . deletion of the helix-loop-helix protein interaction domain of scx attenuated binding to smad <dig> 

given the close physical and functional relationship between scx and smad <dig>  we examined the effect of scx loss on smad <dig> recruitment to the col1a <dig> gene promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation. smad <dig> binding to the col1a <dig> gene promoter smad binding element was significantly reduced in scx ko hearts compared to wt , and re-chip demonstrated a similar loss of smad3-bound rna polymerase ii. this effect was recapitulated in a dose-dependent manner by delivering a scx dominant-negative mutant scxΔbd  <cit>  to human adult ventricular mfbs , suggesting that the mutant exerts its effect by sequestering smad <dig> away from the promoter. together, these results demonstrate that smad <dig> signaling is attenuated in the absence of scx due to impaired transcriptional complex formation.

loss of cardiac fibroblasts in scleraxis null mice
scx loss clearly impairs cardiac fb function, but it is also possible that cardiac fb number may be negatively impacted. we analyzed cardiac cell identity by flow cytometry using markers for cardiomyocytes , fbs , vascular smooth muscle  and endothelial cells  . the number of αsma+ and ddr2+ cells was significantly reduced with a similar trend in cd31+ cells . since αsma is primarily expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells in the healthy heart, the cardiac vasculature may be negatively impacted in these animals. a significant ~25 % decrease in capillary density in ko hearts further indicates reduced vascularity . although αmhc+ cardiomyocyte number was not affected by scx knockout, we found that cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area significantly decreased by 29 % in ko mice . the net hypotrophy noted in ko hearts thus appears to be due to reduced myocyte volume.fig.  <dig> loss of cardiac fibroblasts following scleraxis deletion in vivo. a–b representative flow cytometry histograms of wt and scx ko heart single-cell suspensions show cardiac cells stained for αsma  or ddr <dig>  in wt  and ko  mice. unstained cell sample was used as control . c total αmhc+, αsma+, cd31+ or ddr2+ stained events per 5 ×  <dig> events in wt or ko mice normalized to wt counts demonstrating normal cardiomyocyte counts but reduced numbers of fibroblasts; n =  <dig> independent samples per genotype. d representative cardiac sections from wt and ko mice immunolabeled for ddr <dig> confirm the loss of ddr2+ cells; 63× objective, scale bar = 20 μm. e qpcr assay of tcf <dig> mrna expression in wt and scx ko mice; n =  <dig> independent samples per genotype. f cardiac sections as in  were immunolabeled for twist <dig> expression ; 20× objective, scale bar = 64 μm. g cardiac mrna from wt and scx ko mice was assayed for expression of mesenchymal and epithelial marker genes by qpcr, indicating reduced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in ko hearts; n =  <dig> independent samples per genotype. h–i cardiac proto-myofibroblasts were subjected to scx knockdown  or over-expression  and emt markers assessed by qpcr, indicating that scx regulates mesenchymal marker gene expression; n =  <dig>  j scx dose-dependently transactivates the snai <dig> and twist <dig> proximal gene promoters as determined by luciferase assay or gfp western blot, respectively; n =  <dig>  k representative fibroblast/myofibroblast, mesenchymal, epithelial and tendon marker gene mrna expression was assayed in a <dig> epithelial cells following scx over-expression  vs controls , assayed by qpcr; n =  <dig>  l scx mrna expression was assayed by qpcr in a <dig> cells following treatment with  <dig>  ng/ml tgfβ or vehicle; n =  <dig>  m mesenchymal marker gene mrna expression was assayed in a <dig> cells following scx dominant negative mutant over-expression  vs controls , with or without treatment with  <dig>  ng/ml tgfβ or vehicle; n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig>  vs wt , vs adshlacz , vs adgfp , vs control transfected vector  or vs vehicle ; #p < <dig>  vs adgfp + tgfβ . n putative model of action of scx. top panel, scx is required for cardiac fibroblast to myofibroblast phenotype conversion , and possibly for transition of epithelial precursors to the mesenchymal/fibroblast phenotype . bottom panel, scx is sufficient to directly transactivate numerous genes that characterize the myofibroblast phenotype, and is required for tgfβ/smad3-mediated gene expression by facilitating smad <dig> and rna polymerase ii interaction at target gene promoters such as col1α2




ddr <dig> is enriched in cardiac fbs and not expressed in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . nearly half of all ddr2+ cells were lost in scx ko hearts , and cardiac tissue sections exhibited greatly reduced numbers of ddr2-expressing fbs . it is unlikely that cell loss is due to increased cell death, as shrna-mediated knockdown of scx had no such effect . the loss of cardiac fibroblasts may be responsible for the decrease in cardiomyocyte size, since co-culture of fibroblasts with adult cardiomyocytes promotes hypertrophy  <cit> .

we hypothesized that missing ddr2+ cells in ko hearts may reflect an altered cell fate of fb precursors, rather than actual cell loss. differentiation of cardiac fbs during development, with further phenotype refinement to mfbs, has been ascribed to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition   <cit> . in ko hearts, we observed a ~30 % loss of mrna expression of tcf <dig> , a transcription factor required for emt of cardiac fbs from proepicardial organ precursors  <cit> , thus we assayed emt marker expression using a selection of epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes that, while not individually definitive for emt, have collectively been widely used in the literature to assess emt progression. immunofluorescence revealed a notable loss of labeling for the mesenchymal marker twist <dig> in ko hearts, with fewer twist1-positive nuclei consistent with a loss of fibroblasts . mrna of all mesenchymal markers tested  was significantly down-regulated by 25–40 % in ko hearts, while epithelial markers  increased . while a definitive assessment of embryonic emt is beyond the scope of the present study, this result is consistent with an attenuation of emt during the developmental process. knockdown of scx in pmfbs significantly reduced mesenchymal marker expression, while scx over-expression had the opposite effect . scx dose-dependently transactivated the snai <dig> and twist <dig> gene promoters .

strikingly, over-expression of scx in the a <dig> human lung epithelial cell line caused a potent up-regulation of a variety of fb and mesenchymal markers while reducing epithelial marker expression , demonstrating that scx was sufficient to induce emt in these cells. furthermore, scx did not alter expression of the tendon marker tnmd in a <dig> cells, indicating that scx induced a fb rather than a tenocyte phenotype. this result is in contrast to c3h10t1/ <dig> mouse embryonic fbs, in which scx induced fb and mesenchymal markers as well as tnmd , in agreement with a recent report that scx induces a tenocyte fate in these cells  <cit> . we note that induction of fb and mesenchymal markers in either cardiac pmfbs or c3h10t1/ <dig> cells required adenoviral gene delivery of scx at only  <dig> moi—an order of magnitude less than the amount required to induce emt in a <dig> cells . the ability of scx to regulate a mesenchymal fb phenotype thus appears to be cell type-specific and dose-dependent. tgfβ induces emt in a <dig> cells  <cit> , and we observed potent up-regulation of scx by tgfβ similar to our findings in cardiac fb   <cit> . the induction of mesenchymal marker expression by tgfβ was significantly attenuated by our scx dominant-negative mutant scxΔbd, demonstrating a requirement for scx in this process .

discussion
the transcriptional regulators that govern fb phenotype and function are poorly defined. our study demonstrates for the first time that scx is a critical regulator of virtually all hallmarks of the mesenchymal phenotype of fbs and mfbs. this includes both sufficiency and necessity for the ex vivo and in vivo expression of numerous ecm genes, fb/mfb markers, αsma and cell contraction, and mesenchymal markers—expression patterns that virtually define the fb and mfb phenotypes. we also provide the first evidence that scx could potentially be important for emt programming of fbs in the myocardium.

tendons and cardiac valves possess a collagen-rich ecm, and scx ko profoundly affects both tissues. scx deletion results in the loss of force-transmitting tendons due to a failure of tendon progenitor differentiation, disorganization of the tendon matrix and loss of type i collagen production via an undefined mechanism  <cit> . conversely, scx commits embryonic stem cells to a tenocyte fate and induces expression of tnmd, a direct scx target gene in c3h10t1/ <dig> cells  <cit> . scx ko mice exhibit thickened cardiac valves with altered collagen expression and fiber organization due to reduced valve precursor cell differentiation, although scx target gene identity was unclear  <cit> . scx thus appears to regulate progenitor cell behavior and tissue structure in ecm-rich environments through undefined mechanisms, resulting in significant cell fate and ecm alterations when this function is disturbed.

our results indicate that scx performs a fundamental role in fb cell fate/phenotype in the collagen-rich myocardium, and for the first time reveal the underlying mechanisms. our identification of vim, mmp <dig>  fn <dig>  acta <dig>  snai <dig> and twist <dig> as novel transcriptional targets of scx  explains the loss of expression of these genes following scx loss, and complements previous work by our laboratory and others identifying the col1a <dig> and col1a <dig> genes as additional direct targets  <cit> . we anticipate that other genes assayed here, including col3a <dig>  col5a <dig>  fmod, lum, ddr <dig>  myh <dig> and postn, are likely to also be direct transcriptional targets given the close agreement between their expression and scx. however, our work also reveals the critical interplay between scx and smad <dig>  including physical interaction , resulting in impaired assembly of a transcriptional complex at the col1a <dig> promoter in scx null mice or at the col1a <dig> promoter following treatment of human adult ventricular fbs with our dominant-negative scx mutant , as well as complete attenuation of tgfβ-mediated pmfb contraction . the dominant-negative mutant lacks a dna-binding domain, and we had hypothesized that this mutant acted by sequestering key binding partners away from target genes  <cit> . here we demonstrate that this mutant dose-dependently reduced smad3-binding to the col1a <dig> promoter, in turn reducing recruitment of rna polymerase ii , in support of this model. together, these results provide the mechanism for our previous observation of both the synergy between smad <dig> and scx, as well as their mutual requirement for full transcriptional activity on the col1a <dig> promoter  <cit> , and suggests a model for how scx may interact with smad <dig> or other binding partners to modulate additional downstream genes.

in both tendons and cardiac valves, scx gene deletion resulted in a failure of progenitor cells to specify, differentiate and/or proliferate, but without apoptosis  <cit> . it was also recently shown that scx is required for tendon stem cell differentiation to tenocytes  <cit> . our data fits with the theme of scx behaving as a cell fate mediator. emt plays an important role in the generation of fbs in the adult myocardium  <cit> , and we show that scx directly transactivates the gene promoters of the mesenchymal markers vim, snai <dig> and twist <dig> . the loss of mesenchymal marker expression in scx ko hearts, with increased epithelial marker expression, supports the possibility that scx may be important in the developmental emt programming of fbs from epithelial precursors , and we show for the first time that scx is sufficient to reprogram a <dig> epithelial cells to a mesenchymal, fb-like phenotype . tgfβ/smad <dig> signaling is a potent driver of emt  <cit> . we found that tgfβ up-regulated scx expression in a <dig> cells, and scxΔbd significantly attenuated tgfβ-mediated mesenchymal marker induction , demonstrating a requirement for scx in this process and consistent with a central role for scleraxis in mediating tgfβ/smad <dig> downstream events. the loss of fbs in scx ko hearts may thus reflect a failure of emt. the regulation of emt in the embryonic myocardium by scx is an intriguing focus for future study, requiring direct assessment of emt and nascent fb numbers during development. fb to mfb conversion is an extension of this emt, with further refinement of the cell phenotype to increase ecm synthesis, induce expression of αsma and other mfb genes, and initiate cell contraction. here, too, scx was both necessary and sufficient to govern broad ecm gene expression , to directly transactivate the αsma promoter , to facilitate cell contraction  and to regulate fb/mfb marker gene expression . scx thus governs the main features of fibroblastic cells in the heart along the full phenotype continuum.

in the developing mouse heart, high pericardial expression of scleraxis was observed at embryonic day  <dig>  <cit> . this is consistent with the localization of proepicardial organ-derived scx+ cells at the epicardial surface at the same time point reported by katz et al.  <cit> . however, katz also noted that scx+ cells had already migrated into the right ventricle by e <dig> , suggesting they had undergone a prior emt event, and migration continued to at least e <dig> . approximately two thirds of wt1+ cells in the katz study did not express scx, and of the scx+ cells, 60 % gave rise to fibroblasts, epicardium and other derivatives, 24 % gave rise to endothelial cells,  <dig>  % gave rise to smooth muscle cells, and  <dig>  % gave rise to cardiomyocytes. thus it appears that a sub-population of cells expressing scx gives rise to fbs, although the exact size of this cell population remains unclear. however, the existence of such a sub-population could explain why scx ko hearts lacked only ~50 % of fbs, rather than exhibiting the nearly complete loss that was observed in tcf <dig> null hearts  <cit> . tcf <dig> ko and scx ko hearts bear a striking physical resemblance to one another, including right-side enlargement, and rounding and involution of the apex, and tcf <dig> has been shown to regulate scx expression in sertoli cells  <cit> . scx ko may thus partially phenocopy tcf <dig> loss, and investigation of a similar regulatory regime in the myocardium is warranted. in this regard, it is noteworthy that tcf <dig> was down-regulated in scx ko hearts . an intriguing possibility is that a net loss of fibrillar collagen and extracellular matrix, and thus structural support, in the thinner and physically weaker right ventricular wall may lead to specific remodeling of this chamber, consistent with the right ventricular enlargement observed in both scx ko and tcf <dig> ko hearts. it is also notable that, unlike tcf <dig> ko hearts, we observed evidence of reduced smooth muscle and endothelial cell numbers. this is consistent with katz’ report of scx+ cells contributing to these cell populations, and may reflect an impairment in the development of these populations. katz also noted that scx+ cells contributed in a minor fashion to the cardiomyocyte population. while we saw no evidence of a decline in cardiomyocyte number, we did note a reduction in cardiomyocyte size , suggesting that scx may play a role in the growth of these cells. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that this alteration may instead reflect a response of cardiomyocytes to the altered extracellular matrix environment present in scx ko hearts.

the fbs that do arise in the scx ko heart appear to be functionally impaired: pmfbs isolated from ko hearts exhibited dramatic loss of col1a <dig>  col1a <dig>  col3a <dig>  vim, fn <dig> and acta <dig>  demonstrating a clear functional deficit in these cells . however, this deficit could be corrected simply by restoring scx expression, further demonstrating the critical central role of scx in fibroblastic gene expression. furthermore, this effect was dependent on intact dna-binding and protein-interaction moieties within scx, as a mutant lacking these sequences failed to impact gene expression .

transition of fbs to mfbs in connective tissues of the heart, lungs, liver, kidney and dermis is integral to pathologic ecm remodeling and scar formation  <cit> . while the identity of definitive fb/mfb markers remains controversial, scx induced and was required for the expression of virtually all commonly-employed fb/mfb markers, including ddr <dig>  fn <dig>  myh <dig>  vim and acta <dig>   <cit> . scx also induced the incorporation of αsma into stress fibers , a hallmark of full conversion to mfbs  <cit> , and we found that scx potently up-regulated postn , which is implicated in cardiac fibrosis  <cit> . promotion of the mfb cell fate and induction of ecm synthesis by scx is clearly congruent with a role in cardiac fibrosis.

further investigation into the specific role of scx in cardiac fibrosis and ecm remodeling is thus an important next step, particularly given our finding that pro-fibrotic tgfβ/smad <dig> signaling potently up-regulate scx expression  <cit> . investigation of the impact of scx loss on cardiac fibrosis is beyond the scope of the present inquiry, but the potential for scx to play a pathogenic role is clear. the cardiac developmental defects noted in scx ko mice, including abnormal valve formation, prevents their use in experimental models of cardiac dysfunction such as pressure overload, infarction or β-agonist administration, but conditional gene deletion offers an alternative strategy to address this important question in future studies. the central role of scx in fb phenotype and ecm synthesis demonstrated here should spur investigation into methods of attenuating scx function in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for fibrosis, which at present are completely lacking  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here identify the transcription factor scleraxis as not only a potent activator of ecm gene expression and synthesis in vitro and in vivo, but also and for the first time as a key regulator of the phenotype of cardiac fibroblasts. epithelial cells, mesenchymal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts represent a cellular continuum from development to disease, and our data demonstrate the central role of scleraxis in the transition of cells through these phenotypes. although a definitive role for scleraxis in emt during fibroblast formation in cardiac development remains to be demonstrated, scleraxis induced and was required for emt in a <dig> epithelial cells, and the loss of fibroblasts concomitant with up-regulation of epithelial markers  in the scleraxis null heart is consistent with a role in developmental emt. fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition was attenuated by scleraxis gene deletion or knockdown, and was induced by scleraxis over-expression. given the significant contributory role of fibroblast activation in fibrotic diseases, and the conservation of key signaling pathways, including tgfβ/smad in fibrosis across tissue types, scleraxis represents an attractive new target for the development of therapies targeting fibrosis in the heart and other tissues.
