BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes, control of cell cycle progression is driven by an evolutionarily conserved family of serine/threonine kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases . cdks form functional heterodimers with regulatory cyclin subunits  <cit> . together, cdks and their cyclin partners control cell cycle progression at the g <dig> -to-s  and the g <dig> -to-m  phase transitions through the phosphorylation of target proteins involved in dna replication and mitosis, respectively  <cit> . the activity of cdk/cyclin complexes is regulated at multiple levels, including the interaction with inhibitors or scaffolding proteins, and phosphoregulation of the cdk subunit.

in contrast to fission yeast  and budding yeast , in which only a single cdk  controls the cell cycle  <cit> , animals and plants possess multiple cdks  <cit> . the most conserved cell cycle regulators possess a typical pstaire cyclin-binding motif . in addition, a class of cdks specific to plants has been shown to control the cell cycle, being called the b-type cdks  <cit> . b-type cdks in higher plants possess a variant of the pstaire motif, either pptalre  or ppttlre   <cit>  and, unlike the a-type cdks that are required for both the g1-to-s and g2-to-m phase transition, they only play a role at the g2/m boundary  <cit> .

with the recent advances in sequencing techniques, more genomes have become available, including several from different algal groups  <cit> . this wealth of new data makes it possible to study b-type cdk evolution by comparative genomics. cdkb-like sequences have been identified in different algal species, including the green algae ostreococcus tauri  <cit> , chlamydomonas reinhardtii  <cit> , micromonas sp. and micromonas pusilla, the red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae  <cit> , and also the brown alga ectocarpus siliculosus  <cit> . remarkably, the cdkb-like sequences of o. tauri and c. reinhardtii have been reported to represent functional homologs of a-type cdks, mainly by their ability to complement cdc <dig> temperature-sensitive yeast mutants  <cit> , indicating that b-type cdks might originate from a duplication and subsequent specification of the a-type cdks  <cit> . however, to date, their functionality to complement higher plant b-type cdks has not been investigated.

phaeodactylum tricornutum is a unicellular marine diatom belonging to the heterokont  lineage  <cit> . this diatom multiplies by binary division and, unlike most other diatoms, it lacks a sexual phase during its life cycle, rendering this diatom a perfect model species to study vegetative reproduction  <cit> . furthermore, due to the presence of a light-dependent phase during its cell cycle  <cit> , the cell division process in p. tricornutum can easily be synchronized by implementation of alternating light/dark cycles  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of all cdks identified in p. tricornutum revealed the presence of two a-type cdks, of which cdka <dig> shows the classical pstaire motif, while cdka <dig> shows the divergent pstalre cyclin-binding motif  <cit> . the latter deviates only by one amino acid from the cdka  and cdkb  hallmarks. such a pstalre motif is also present in the dictyostelium discoideum cdc <dig> homolog   <cit> , the c. merolae cdka protein  <cit> , the o. tauri cdkb protein  <cit>  and the e. siliculosus cdka <dig> protein  <cit> . moreover, unlike typical cdkas, transcription of the p. tricornutum cdka <dig> gene is cell cycle-regulated and shows a peak of transcription at the g2-to-m phase transition  <cit> . however, based on its current phylogenetic position and its transcription pattern, it is impossible to define whether cdka <dig> represents a functional ortholog of a- or b-type cdks.

the main objective of this study was to functionally elucidate the role of cdka <dig> during the cell cycle in p. tricornutum. overexpression of cdka <dig> resulted in a delayed growth phenotype, mainly at the g2/m phase of the cell cycle. moreover, microscopic analysis of cells expressing a fluorescently-tagged version of cdka <dig> showed a relocalization of cdka <dig> from the nucleus to the cell division plane just before cytokinesis. together, these data suggest a role for cdka <dig> during mitosis in diatoms.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of cdka2
considering the ambiguous classification of cdka <dig>  its phylogenetic position among the cdk family members was reanalyzed . the recent release of genome data from several stramenopile algae, including the diatom fragilariopsis cylindrus, the brown alga e. siliculosus  <cit>  and the eustigmatophyte alga nannochloropsis gaditana  <cit> , allowed us to include cdk sequences of these species in the multiple sequence alignment. in the updated phylogenetic tree, the diatom cdka <dig> sequences group together with cdka <dig> and cdkb-like sequences from the other stramenopile groups  as a well-supported clade that may represent a stramenopile-specific cluster. although this cluster is clearly distinct from the plant b-type cdk cluster, it does not belong to the archetypical a-type cdk cluster either. based on this updated phylogenetic analysis, it therefore remains impossible to determine whether cdka <dig> is more related to the a-type or b-type cdks .figure  <dig>

cell cycle phase-dependent expression of cdka2
previous work suggested that cdka <dig> transcription is cell cycle-regulated and shows a peak at the g2-to-m phase transition  <cit> . however, the experimental setup used in that study did not allow assessing expression levels beyond the metaphase point, since a microtubule depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, was added to the cells to increase the proportion of cells at mitosis. here, we further analyzed the temporal expression of cdka <dig> and cdka <dig> during the cell cycle in synchronized p. tricornutum cells in the absence of nocodazole . in contrast to cdka <dig>  which displays no reproducible temporal expression profile during the cell cycle, cdka <dig> levels start accumulating during the g1/s phase and reach a maximum peak at the g2/m phase, coinciding with the peak expression of the mitotic marker cyclin b <dig> .figure  <dig>

cdka <dig> interacts specifically with cks1
to identify putative interactors of the p. tricornutum cdka proteins, yeast two-hybrid  cdna library screens were conducted using the full-length cdka <dig> and cdka <dig> sequences fused to the gal <dig> dna-binding domain as bait. using cdka <dig> as bait, four possible interacting proteins were detected . however, only one of these interactors  could be confirmed . previously, we have shown that cks <dig> is predominantly transcribed during the g2/m phases, coinciding with the expression pattern of cdka <dig>  <cit> . using cdka <dig> as bait,  <dig> clones were isolated, representing  <dig> different putative interacting proteins . of these, three belong to the cyclin family , cyclin p <dig>  and diatom-specific cyclin  <dig> )  <cit> .

to test the binding specificity of the two baits, pairwise y2h assays were performed by co-transforming them in yeast with the prey proteins cks <dig>  cycp <dig>  cycp <dig>  dscyc <dig> and dscyc <dig>  which was previously described as an interactor of cdka <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, cdka <dig> was not able to bind cks <dig> in the y2h assay, whereas cdka <dig> did not interact with any of the cyclins tested , indicating that the interactions picked up by y2h library screens are specific for each cdk.figure  <dig>

overexpression of cdka <dig> reduces the cell growth rate by interfering with g2/m phase progression
to study the function of cdka <dig> during the cell cycle of p. tricornutum, the effect of cdka <dig> overexpression on cell cycle progression was determined. transgenic lines were generated that overexpress cdka <dig> fused at its c-terminus to yellow fluorescent protein   under control of the fucoxanthin chlorophyll binding protein b  promoter. overexpression of cdka2-yfp was evaluated by transcript analysis of cdka <dig>  and yfp  using real-time quantitative pcr  in wild-type  and transgenic cells. two lines expressed an approximately two- to three-fold higher level of cdka <dig> transcripts compared to wt cells   due to the overexpression of the cdka2-yfp fusion , while another line  showed no increase of cdka <dig> . in contrast to the cdka2-yfp a <dig> and b <dig> lines, no expression of yfp could be detected for the cdka2-yfp b <dig> line . this line was therefore used as an internal transformation control in downstream analyses.figure  <dig>

to determine if cdka <dig> overexpression alters cell cycle dynamics, a growth analysis was performed. optical density determination, which can be used as an estimate of cell number, was performed in the morning during nine consecutive days, in lines grown under constant light conditions. cells expressing increased levels of cdka2-yfp  showed longer generation times compared to the control cells  . to determine which cell cycle phase was affected, we measured the transcript levels of cycp <dig>  e2f <dig> and cycb <dig> in exponentially growing asynchronous cdka2-overexpressing and control cells. these genes represent diatom cell cycle marker genes specific for the g <dig>  s and g2/m phases, respectively  <cit> . in both cdka <dig> overexpression lines, we detected higher transcript levels of the mitotic marker cycb <dig>  and slightly lower e2f <dig> levels compared to those of the control cells , indicating that cdka2-overexpressing cells spend more time at the g2/m phase.

cdka <dig> relocalizes from the nucleus to the division plane before cytokinesis
to explore the subcellular localization of cdka <dig> during the cell cycle, we monitored yfp fluorescence in the cdka2-yfp overexpression cells. to avoid aberrant localization patterns due to the overexpression of cdka <dig>  we selected the cdka2-yfp a <dig> line for this analysis, which shows only about two-fold higher expression levels of cdka <dig> . for microscopic observations, cells were synchronized to enrich for cells at the different phases of the cell cycle, including interphase and mitosis. confocal laser-scanning microscopy  revealed a predominant nuclear and weak cytosolic yfp fluorescence in interphase cells that contain undivided or divided translocating chloroplasts . this predominant nuclear localization of the yfp signal was confirmed by co-localization of hoechst <dig> dna staining . remarkably, in cells with fully translocated daughter chloroplasts, the yfp fluorescence extended to the cell division plane between the two daughter chloroplasts and resembled dot-like signals . three-dimensional reconstruction of the z-stack of confocal images clearly demonstrated the localization of cdka2-yfp fluorescence to a plate-like structure . following division, the yfp signal is localized in the nucleus of both daughter cells.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we provide experimental evidence elucidating the role of cdka <dig> in the diatom p. tricornutum, a cdk previously assigned to the a-type family, but displaying a pstalre motif, a motif in-between those of the conserved a-type and plant-specific b-type cdks  <cit> . in contrast to classical a-type cdks, transcription of diatom cdka <dig> fluctuates during the cell cycle, increasing from the g1/s phase onward and showing a peak in its expression at mitosis, thus resembling the expression pattern of b-type cdks  <cit>  and suggesting a role for cdka <dig> in the control of mitosis. re-examination of the phylogenetic position of cdka <dig>  by including closely related organisms, assigned it to a stramenopile cluster of cdka/b-like sequences. the phylogenetic tree indicates a rapid radiation of cdk types near the base of the cdka and cdkb lineage, possibly representing a cdk gene diversification phase during the early stages of eukaryotic evolution. the hypothesis that cdka <dig> may function as a mitotic regulator is further supported by the localization of cdka2-yfp at the cell division plane in pre-cytokinetic cells. this localization pattern suggests that cdka <dig> may play a role in the positioning of the cleavage furrow or the formation of cytokinetic structures, or in the recruitment of one or various components to the cell division plane. in mammals, the activity of prc <dig>  a microtubule  binding and bundling protein responsible for mt stabilization during cytokinesis, is regulated through phosphorylation by cdks  <cit> . also in plant cells, mt-dependent association of cdks with mitotic structures and the functional involvement of cdks in the organization of specific mt arrays have been reported  <cit> .

cdka <dig> was found to interact with cks <dig>  whose gene was previously reported to be transcribed mainly at the g2/m phase in synchronized cells  <cit> . the interaction with cks <dig> was not surprising, since cks <dig> is a member of a conserved family of small proteins that are believed to act as docking factors that mediate the interaction of cdks with regulatory proteins and putative substrates  <cit> . cks <dig> might therefore represent a good bait to identify putative substrates of cdka <dig> in further studies, which might help us to determine the precise function and action of cdka <dig> during diatom mitosis. interestingly, cks <dig> was found not to bind cdka <dig>  resembling the situation in animal cells, in which cks proteins have been reported to bind to cdk <dig> complexes, but not to the g1/s-specific cdk4/ <dig> complexes  <cit> .

in plants, overexpression of wild-type cdk genes generally does not trigger a phenotype  <cit> . however, recently, the overexpression of cdka <dig> in tomato fruit was reported to cause an increase in cell division  <cit> , while the overexpression of cdkb <dig> or cdkb <dig> reduces the cell division rate in tomato fruit pericarp  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of cdkb2; <dig> and cdkb2; <dig> in arabidopsis reduces cell cycle progression in the meristem due to regulatory defects at the g2-to-m transition  <cit> . therefore, overexpression of b2-type cdks appears to induce a consistent cell cycle phenotype, suggesting a universal role for these cdks during cell cycle regulation. here, we observed major growth defects in p. tricornutum cells overexpressing cdka <dig>  most prominently, cell generation time almost doubled, despite only a slight increase in cdka <dig> transcript levels. analysis of the expression of cell cycle marker genes demonstrated that this delay most probably results from a lengthening of the g2/m phases, as cycb <dig> levels were clearly elevated in cdka2-overexpressing cells. several hypotheses could explain the cdka <dig> overexpression phenotype. first, the overexpression construct could compete with endogenous cdk genes for rate-limiting interacting proteins . on the other hand, the mitotic arrest observed in the cdka2-overexpressing cells might result from aberrant levels and timing of cdka <dig> activity. in eukaryotes, exit from mitosis strictly depends on the downregulation of cdk activity, which is initiated by the destruction of mitotic cyclins by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome   <cit> . in a previous study, we have identified all essential components of this ubiquitin ligase complex in p. tricornutum and reported the cell cycle phase-specific transcription of its activators cdc <dig> and cdh <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that a similar control mechanism for mitotic exit by a decline in cdk activity might exist in diatoms.

in yeast and metazoans, cdc <dig> phosphatases are known to activate cdks by opposing the activity of the wee1/myt1/mik <dig> family of inhibitory kinases  <cit> . phosphorylation of conserved thr  and/or tyr  residues results in cdk inactivation upon activation of the cell cycle checkpoints caused by triggers that should stop the cell cycle, such as dna damage or mitotic defects. dephosphorylation of these residues by cdc <dig> renders the cdk/cyclin complex active and hence stimulates cell cycle progression  <cit> . although tyr phosphorylation in plants is important to arrest the cell cycle under stress conditions, it does not seem to be crucial for g2-to-m progression  <cit> . interestingly, all organisms in which b-type cdks have been identified appear to lack a functional cdc <dig> phosphatase  <cit> . the only exception is o. tauri, which contains both a cdc <dig> phosphatase and a b-type-like cdk. however, functional analysis of the o. tauri cdkb indicated some cdka features, including the ability to complement a yeast cdc <dig> mutant, suggesting that this protein is rather atypical and has not yet achieved all the functional properties of higher plant b-type cdks  <cit> . because of an intriguing number of parallels in transcriptional, biochemical and functional properties of mammalian cdc <dig> and plant b-type cdks, it was suggested that the cdc25-mediated regulatory mechanisms might have been replaced in plants by a mechanism governed by the plant-specific b-type cdks  <cit> . despite the presence of almost all regulatory components of the eukaryotic cell cycle in p. tricornutum, diatoms also lack a clear cdc <dig> phosphatase homolog  <cit> , which may explain the need for a cdkb-like cdk, such as cdka <dig>  controlling the g2-to-m progression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we addressed the ambiguous nature of cdka <dig> in p. tricornutum. cdka <dig> was originally assigned to the a-type cdks, but displays some typical characteristics of the plant-specific b-type cdks, including cell cycle phase-dependent transcription at the g2-to-m transition. subcellular localization of cdka <dig> at the cell division plane during cytokinesis and its interaction with the g2/m expressed cell cycle regulator cks <dig>  point to a function for cdka <dig> during mitosis. in addition, cdka <dig> overexpression resulted in the prolongation of the mitotic phase and an increase in cell cycle duration, demonstrating its role as a mitotic regulator. this is the first functional characterization of a cdk with clear cdkb properties in a non-green lineage, indicating that, while b-type cdks form a clear plant-specific clade at the phylogenetic level, functional orthologs can be identified in other eukaryotic groups.
