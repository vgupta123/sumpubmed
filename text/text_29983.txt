BACKGROUND
the molecular basis for the coordinated regulation of iron acquisition systems by iron was first described for escherichia coli  <cit> . several bacteria are now known to regulate their iron acquisition systems via fur   <cit> . fur is a sequence-specific dna-binding protein that acts mainly as a negative regulator of transcription in vivo by complexing with ferrous  ion to repress the expression of iron-regulated genes  <cit> . fur also activates the expression of many genes by either indirect or direct mechanisms  <cit> . mutations in the fur gene resulted in constitutive expression of siderophores and outer membrane fe3+-siderophore receptors potentially required for iron uptake  <cit> .

nitrosomonas europaea is an aerobic chemolithoautotroph that uses nh <dig> and co <dig> for growth  <cit> . mechanisms for iron transport are essential to this bacterium for maintaining the many cytochromes and other heme-binding proteins involved in ammonia metabolism  <cit> . the genome of n. europaea has 4% of its genes dedicated for iron acquisition, but no evidence for siderophore production was found  <cit> . n. europaea's inability to produce siderophores in fe-replete or fe-limited media was further confirmed by universal chrome azurol s assay  <cit> . n. europaea responds to iron limitation by elevating production of fe3+-siderophore receptors normally repressed under iron-replete conditions  <cit> . several n. europaea iron-repressible genes contain sequences similar to the e. coli fur box  in their promoter regions; hence it is likely that a fur-like repressor regulates iron uptake genes in n. europaea as well. indeed, sequence annotation of n. europaea genome revealed three genes encoding fur homologs  that contain characteristic fur domains  <cit> .

multiple fur homologs have been described for several bacteria. different species have a variable number of genes bearing the fur domain. for example, e. coli  <cit>  has two, bacillus subtilis  <cit> , mycobacterium smegmatis have three, staphylococcus aureus and some species of brucella have four and thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis has five fur homologs  <cit> . the apparent redundancy in fur homologs has been clarified by a considerable amount of experimental data obtained from genetic and biochemical analysis in bacteria such as e. coli and b. subtilis  <cit> . the experimental data suggests that the fur protein family has several subclasses with different functions  <cit> . the major fe-sensing fur subclass is mainly involved in the control of iron homeostasis  <cit> . a second subclass controls the expression of genes involved in the response of bacteria to oxidative stress , but it does not appear to be involved in the cellular response to iron  <cit> . a third subclass called zur  controls the uptake of zinc in e. coli  <cit>  and b. subtilis  <cit> .

the fe-sensing fur protein has been extensively studied and is shown to act as a global regulator in response to environmental iron concentration due to its involvement in the regulation of activities as varied as the acid tolerance response, the oxidative stress response, metabolic pathways, and virulence factors  <cit> . in this study, we aimed to characterize the regulatory role of a fur homolog from n. europaea. using genetic complementation studies, we demonstrated that one fur homolog  out of three in n. europaea encoded a functional fur protein. here we report the construction of the n. europaea fur promoter knockout mutant  strain, its effect on the expression of fe-regulated proteins and the physiology of n. europaea.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of n. europaea fur homologs
the three n. europaea fur-like repressors encoded by ne <dig>  ne <dig>  ne <dig> are only distantly related to each other with 25% to 35% amino acid identity. the fur homolog encoded by ne <dig> is most similar  in sequence to various gram-negative fe-sensing fur proteins. the publication of the crystal structure of the pseudomonas aeruginosa fur protein provided considerable insight into its  <dig> metal binding sites. binding site  <dig> represents the putative iron binding regulatory site and is coordinated by amino acids h <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig>  and h <dig> and site  <dig> is coordinated by h <dig>  e <dig>  h <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . all these residues are conserved only in the n. europaea ne <dig> fur homolog but not in fur homologs encoded by ne <dig> and ne <dig> . phylogenetic analysis of fur homolog coding sequences from n. europaea with fur proteins from other bacteria placed ne <dig> in the group b comprised of fe-sensing fur proteins, ne <dig> in the group a comprised of zn-sensing zur proteins. surprisingly, ne <dig> fur homolog was also placed in group b. no fur homologs of n. europaea grouped with peroxide sensing perr proteins i.e., in group c .

based on well-studied model systems, expression of the fur gene itself is iron regulated and there is strong evidence that this is through a mechanism of autoregulation  <cit> . fur recognizes and binds specifically to a dna sequence, known as the fur box, that is typically located in proximity to the - <dig> and/or - <dig> promoter elements of target genes  <cit> . analysis of several fur-binding sites allowed the early definition of a 19-bp inverted repeat consensus fur box in e. coli  <cit> . since then, canonical fur boxes have been described in several bacteria such as p. aeruginosa  <cit> , neisseria gonorrhoeae  <cit>  and vibrio cholerae  <cit> . the canonical fur box identified by b. subtilis fur revealed a different conserved 15-bp  inverted repeat present twice within this 19-bp consensus sequence  <cit> . we have used an in silico approach, fed with experimentally confirmed n. europaea fur boxes , to identify candidate fur-binding sites in promoter regions of all  <dig> n. europaea fur homologs. a potential fur box  in the promoter region of ne <dig> gene, - <dig> bp upstream of the proposed initiation of translation of the fur gene was found. we were unable to find potential fur boxes in the promoter region of the other n. europaea fur homologs, ne <dig> and ne <dig> 

complementation of an e. coli fur mutant by n. europaea fur homologs
in order to determine which fur homolog of n. europaea encodes the fe-sensing fur protein, pfur <dig>  pfur <dig> and pfur <dig> plasmids  were used to transform the e. coli fur mutant h <dig>  <cit> . e. coli h <dig> strain was engineered to be fur deficient and to include the fur-regulated gene fiu fused to a promoterless lacz gene. this reporter gene, fiu-lacz, cannot be repressed in this strain due to the fur mutation, and therefore the gene encoding the enzyme β-galactosidase is constitutively expressed and the strain always shows lac+ phenotype  <cit> . the pfur616-kanc  plasmid carrying kanamycin resistance cassette  insertion in the c-terminal region of ne <dig> gene was used to transform h <dig> as a negative control.

*- u&d denotes upstream & downstream region.

all strains evaluated for lac phenotype were grown on mcconkey lactose plates with  <dig> μm iron supplement, since iron is required to ensure that fur is functional as a repressor  <cit> . in these studies, e. coli h <dig>  h <dig> , h <dig> , h <dig>  and h <dig>  strains were compared. lac+ phenotype was observed for e. coli h <dig> whether grown in the presence or absence of added fe supplement as predicted since it is deficient in fur protein . complementation of e. coli h <dig> with pfur <dig> rescued the fur defect of this strain and resulted in the repression of transcription of the fiu-lacz reporter gene, as shown by the lac- phenotype . when pfur616-kanc plasmid containing the disrupted ne <dig> gene, was transformed into the e. coli h <dig> mutant, lac+ phenotype was maintained . when pfur <dig> and pfur <dig> plasmids containing the n. europaea fur homologs ne <dig> and ne <dig> were transformed separately into e. coli h <dig> strain, lac+ phenotype was observed . these results clearly demonstrate that the n. europaea ne <dig> fur homolog is expressed in e. coli in a functional form and is capable of regulating the fur-dependent fiu promoter in h <dig>  the other n. europaea fur homologs  were not capable of regulating the fiu promoter in h <dig>  ne <dig> is here after referred to as n. europaea fur.

the n. europaea fur promoter is repressed by fur
several studies have employed e. coli h <dig> strain to allow the detection of iron-regulated promoters in bacteria such as e. coli and salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . e. coli h <dig> strain has a chromosomal iron-regulated fhuf promoter fused to lacz. this fusion is exceptionally sensitive to small changes in iron concentration because of the weak affinity of the fhuf promoter for the fur-fe2+ repression complex. introduction of a multi-copy plasmid carrying fur-binding sites into the test strain depletes the intracellular fur pool. this gives rise to the dissociation of the repressor from the fusion promoter, thereby allowing expression of enzyme β-galactosidase. we have screened plasmids pfur <dig> carrying intact fur box and pfur616-kanp carrying disrupted fur box using e. coli h <dig> strain to determine ne <dig> fur box functionality. the pfur616-kanc plasmid  carrying kmr insertion in the c-terminal region of ne <dig> gene was also used to transform e. coli h <dig> as a positive control.

in these studies, e. coli h <dig> in the presence and absence of fe supplement, h <dig> , h <dig>  and h <dig>  strains were compared. lac- phenotype was observed for e. coli h <dig> when grown in the presence of  <dig> μm fe supplement, since it does not carry any multi-copy plasmid with a functional fur box on it . lac+ phenotype was observed when h <dig> was grown with no added fe supplement, since there is not enough fe to suppress fhuf-lacz fusion . when pfur <dig> carrying putative fur box was transformed into e. coli h <dig> and the resulting strain was grown in presence of  <dig> μm fe supplement, it resulted in derepression of the fhuf-lacz reporter gene, as shown by the lac+ phenotype . this result indicates that the predicted fur box is functional and must have titrated the intracellular fur-fe pool. when a pfur616-kanp plasmid containing the disrupted ne <dig> fur box, was transformed into the e. coli h <dig> strain, lac- phenotype was restored  indicating that the kmr insertion led to disruption of fur box functionality. when a pfur616-kanc plasmid containing kmr insertion in the c-terminal region of ne <dig> gene was transformed into e. coli h <dig> strain, lac+ phenotype was observed  indicating that kmr in c-terminal region of ne <dig> did not affect its fur box functionality. these results demonstrate that the promoter of n. europaea ne <dig> fur homolog carries a fur box and it is functional as recognized by e. coli fur protein.

isolation of the n. europaea fur:kanp mutant strain
to address the physiological role fur plays in n. europaea, we attempted to generate an n. europaea fur null mutant but were unsuccessful. however, we were successful in isolating an n. europaea fur:kanp mutant strain with kmr inserted in the fur box located in the promoter region of ne <dig> gene . the pfur616-kanp plasmid was electroporated into n. europaea wild-type cells. the fur:kanp mutant was obtained through homologous recombination and confirmed by pcr  and southern hybridization . the fur probe detected a  <dig>  kb ecor <dig> fragment and a  <dig>  kb pst <dig> fragment in wild type and a ~  <dig> kb ecor <dig> fragment and a ~  <dig>  kb pst <dig> fragment  in fur:kanp mutant strain. the kanamycin-cassette probe detected the same ~  <dig> kb ecor <dig> fragment and the ~  <dig>  kb pst <dig> fragment in fur:kanp mutant but not in the wild type. these results confirm that a single copy of kmr was correctly inserted in the fur box located in the promoter region of ne <dig> gene of the n. europaea genome . a fur transcript was not detected in the fur:kanp mutant by either rt-pcr or qrt-pcr analysis  indicating the inactivation of fur gene due to kmr insertion in its promoter region. transcripts of ammonia monooxygenase c  component used as positive control both for the efficiency of the rt-pcr procedure and for rna and cdna recovery showed no significant difference in expression in wild type and the fur:kanp mutant .

effect of fur:kanp mutation on growth of n. europaea
growth of the n. europaea fur:kanp strain was compared to that of the wild-type strain in both fe-replete  and fe-limited  media. surprisingly, there was no significant difference in growth of fur:kanp in both fe-replete and fe-limited media compared to the wild-type strain . the fur:kanp mutant did not exhibit a growth advantage over the wild type when iron was limiting or show increased sensitivity to iron-induced redox stress when grown in the presence of fe . however, growth of fur:kanp mutant was affected when grown in medium containing  <dig> μm fe . the mutant was unable to grow in media containing more than  <dig> μm fe . growth of wild type was inhibited only when concentrations of fe exceeded  <dig> mm  <cit> .

n. europaea can use the siderophore ferrioxamine for its iron uptake after a  <dig> to  <dig> day lag period suggesting that the ferrioxamine uptake system in n. europaea requires induction  <cit> . when n. europaea fur:kanp mutant was grown in fe-limiting media containing ferrioxamine, there was no lag phase  indicating that the ferrioxamine uptake system was already induced in the fur:kanp mutant.

effect of fur:kanp mutation on induction of fe-regulated outer membrane proteins in n. europaea
previous studies have shown that n. europaea grown in fe-limited medium stimulated expression of several fe-regulated outer membrane proteins  with molecular masses of ~  <dig> kda  <cit> . to determine whether the expression of these proteins was regulated by fur, the n. europaea wild type and the fur:kanp mutant strains were cultured in fe-replete and fe-limited media and their total outer membrane proteins were isolated. sds-page analysis of the outer membrane protein profiles demonstrated that fur:kanp mutant shared a major protein band  with wild type cells grown in fe-limited media irrespective of the concentration of iron in the medium. this band contained several tonb-dependent om fe3+-siderophore receptors  <cit> . this result is consistent with the model in which the tonb-dependent receptors with putative roles in iron uptake are regulated by fur  <cit> .

effect of fur:kanp mutation on fe and heme c contents of n. europaea
fur deficient mutants generally express iron transport systems constitutively , and have increased free cellular iron levels   <cit> . to determine the effect of fur:kanp mutation on iron contents of n. europaea, wild type and fur:kanp mutant cells were cultured in fe-replete and fe-limited media and their total cellular iron contents were measured by icp-oes analysis. n. europaea fe-limited cells showed significantly  lower total cellular iron contents compared to fe-replete cells irrespective of the fur mutation as observed previously   <cit> . the fur:kanp mutant had  <dig> -fold significantly  more total cellular iron than the wild-type cells when grown in fe-replete media . the total iron contents of wild type and the fur:kanp mutant did not show significant  variation when grown in fe-limited medium . the fur:kanp mutation also influenced both the amount of soluble cytochromes produced and the proportion of iron distributed to cytochromes . these data suggest that in n. europaea, fur regulates the concentration of intracellular iron through modulation of iron acquisition and iron consumption, and that, in the absence of fur, n. europaea is unable to regulate its iron acquisition.

effect of fur:kanp mutation on nh4+- and nh2oh-dependent o <dig> uptake activities of n. europaea
as indicators of the overall cell activity, nh4+- and nh2oh-dependent o <dig> uptake rates in wild type and fur:kanp mutant cells grown in fe-replete and fe-limited media were measured. n. europaea fe-limited cells showed significantly  lower activities compared to fe-replete cells irrespective of the fur mutation as observed previously   <cit> . the activities of wild type and fur:kanp mutant strains did not show significant  variation when grown in fe-replete media . the nh4+-dependent o <dig> uptake activities, which require both ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase activity, when measured at per mg basis were not affected; however the nh2oh-dependent o <dig> uptake activity, which requires hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, but not ammonia monooxygenase activity, was significantly  two-fold lower in fur:kanp fe-limited cells compared to wild type fe-limited cells . this result is consistent with our observation of lower heme contents in fur:kanp mutant than wild type. hydroxylamine oxidoreductse contains  <dig> hemes per enzyme  <cit>  and the lower nh2oh-dependent o <dig> uptake activity in fe-limited cells of fur:kanp mutant than wild type might be due to the low availability of heme under fe-limited conditions. this data also suggests that the fur:kanp mutation led to an improper balance of iron allocation in n. europaea.

discussion
we provide several lines of evidence that the fur homolog encoded by n. europaea gene ne <dig> is the fe-sensing fur protein. first, we have shown that ne <dig> shares all eight of the metal binding amino acid residues of p. aeruginosa fur   <cit>  and that the fur homolog encoded by ne <dig> is clustered with fe-sensing fur proteins from other bacteria . an e. coli fur titration assay  system for fur analysis was utilized as a second method to confirm that the cloned ne <dig> fur encodes a functional protein. the h <dig>  strain carrying ne <dig> fur homolog on a plasmid was evaluated for its ability to utilize lactose as described by hantke et al.,  <cit> . utilization of lactose by h <dig>  strain was detected by color change of colonies from white to red on mcconkey lactose plates indicating the formation of lactic acid. lactose utilization was not detected when h <dig> strain carrying plasmids pfur616-kanc, pfur <dig>  pfur <dig> were plated on mcconkey lactose plates .

one of the major limitations in our research on the role of fur has been the inability to make a fur null mutant. null mutations have been successfully isolated for e. coli  <cit> , v. cholerae  <cit> , shigella flexneri  <cit> , neisseria meningitidis  <cit> . unsuccessful attempts to isolate insertional null mutants were reported for p. aeruginosa  <cit> , pseudomonas putida  <cit> , and n. gonorrhoeae  <cit> . to date, multiple attempts to generate a n. europaea fur mutant have been unsuccessful. loss of the fur gene may be a lethal mutation in n. europaea, as occurs in some other gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . however, we were successful in generating an n. europaea fur promoter knockout mutant  . southern analysis with probes internal to fur or the kmr corroborated insertion of kmr in the promoter region of the fur gene  and hence fur:kanp mutant strain was selected for further analysis. although we were unable to detect the ne <dig> transcript in fur:kanp mutant strain by rt-pcr or qrt-pcr, it is possible that there is some leaky transcription of fur in our mutant strain, since it is a promoter knockout mutant. this could be the reason why we were able to generate a promoter knockout mutant but not a fur null mutant.

the effects of fur:kanp mutation on n. europaea were broad. inactivation of the fur gene  increases sensitivity to redox stress when grown under iron-rich conditions in some bacteria such as e. coli  <cit> . the n. europaea, wild-type and the fur:kanp mutant strain showed similar growth patterns when grown in fe-replete  and fe-limited  media . however, the fur:kanp mutant did not grow well when cultured in media containing  <dig> μm iron . the fur:kanp mutant was unable to grow beyond  <dig> μm fe concentrations while the wild-type strain was able to withstand iron concentrations up to  <dig> mm . these results indicate that n. europaea fur plays a role in regulating uptake of iron when present in excess and also probably helps to overcome oxidative stress.

increased intracellular free iron is likely to result from deregulated iron uptake by the fur mutant  <cit> . the n. europaea fur:kanp mutant strain grown to mid exponential phase in fe-replete media  contained  <dig> -fold higher total cellular iron than that of the wild-type strain as measured by icp-oes . our measurements of total acid-soluble non-heme iron cannot distinguish between free iron and iron bound to proteins. hence we measured the heme contents of wild type and fur:kanp mutant strains and observed that the fur:kanp mutant had  <dig> -fold lower heme contents compared to wild type . in addition, the activity of iron-rich hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme was lower in fur:kanp mutant strain . these results indicated that the balance between acquiring enough iron and allocating it to various fe-dependent proteins is lost in n. europaea fur:kanp mutant.

n. europaea protein profiles showed over expression of several outer membrane proteins upon fe-limitation  <cit> . we have observed similar over expression of outer membrane proteins in n. europaea fur:kanp mutant  irrespective of iron availability. these data are consistent with previous studies describing fur mutations in other bacterial species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified and characterized through insertional inactivation one of the three n. europaea fur homologs. the n. europaea fur protein encoded by gene ne <dig> has extensive homology to the e. coli fur protein and was able to complement an e. coli fur mutant. the n. europaea fur:kanp mutant is unable to regulate its intracellular iron and heme concentrations and appears to induce its iron acquisition systems constitutively. additional studies are required to fully delineate the role of this n. europaea fur homolog.
