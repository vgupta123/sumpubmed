BACKGROUND
euglenids  are marine and freshwater unicellular flagellates with diverse modes of nutrition, including phagotrophy, osmotrophy and phototrophy. they are members of the euglenozoa within the supergroup excavata  <cit> . plastids of the phototrophic species, surrounded by three membranes, originated through secondary endosymbiosis between an eukaryovorous euglenid and a green alga closely related to members of the genus pyramimonas . despite many years of study, knowledge about the organization of the genetic material in euglenids is still limited. while their chloroplast genomes have been well characterized , information on their nuclear genomes is rudimentary.

nuclear genomes of all eukaryotes studied so far  contain introns excised by the ribonucleoprotein complex, the spliceosome. such conventional spliceosomal introns are also present in nuclear genes of euglenids. they have been found in the following genes: nop1p  <cit> , tuba, tubb, tubg , hsp <dig>  <cit> , eno <dig>  gapa, pbgd, peta, psaf, psbm, and psbw  <cit> . however, conventional spliceosomal introns are not the only type of intervening elements in most of the analyzed genes of euglenids – they also contain another type of intron, termed nonconventional. introns of this sort have non-canonical borders and form a stable rna secondary structure bringing both ends together. the presence of nonconventional introns has been confirmed in such genes as lhcp <dig>  <cit> , rbcs  <cit> , gapc  <cit> , tuba, tubb  <cit> , hsp <dig>  <cit> , petj, and psbw  <cit> . the length of nonconventional introns is variable, ranging from tens of bases to more than a kilobase; their rna secondary structure is rather weakly preserved compared to other non-spliceosomal introns for which appropriate conformation is crucial for splice sites identification and proper removal . the most strongly conserved nucleotides are at positions + <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig> at the 5' end of the intron and the complementary nucleotides − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> at the 3' end. in addition, the following rules seem to apply to most of these introns:  a pyrimidine at the 3' end of the upstream exon and at the 3’ end of the intron,  a purine at the 5' end of the intron and at the 5' end of the downstream exon, and  cytosine at the third position of the downstream exon  <cit> . the mechanism of nonconventional intron removal is unknown, but the spliceosome appears to be uninvolved in excision due to a lack of complementarity between their 5' ends and u <dig> snrna  <cit> . the origin of nonconventional introns is also a mystery, although based on the presence of inverted repeats near their ends and the frequent representation of direct repeats, insertion of mite-like transposable elements has been proposed as a possible source  <cit> . an analysis of tuba and tubb genes from  <dig> species of euglenids has revealed contrasting distribution patterns of conventional and nonconventional introns. while the positions of conventional introns were conserved, those of nonconventional ones were unique to individual species or clades grouping closely related taxa  <cit> .

in  <dig> canaday et al. distinguished a third type of nuclear intron in euglenids, so-called intermediate introns. they form a stable secondary structure bringing together intron ends and one or even both of their borders are consistent with the gt/c-ag rule characteristic for conventional introns  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that intermediate introns could be a transitional form between conventional and nonconventional introns  <cit>  and could be recognized by two different mechanism of intron excision  <cit> . the subdivision of intermediate introns into two groups, conventional/intermediate and intermediate/nonconventional, was proposed based on an analysis of intron sequences and their distribution in tubulin genes. the former group includes cases with junctions typical for conventional introns and the potential to form a stable rna secondary structure bringing intron ends together. the latter group includes introns with one conventional junction  and a stable rna secondary structure formed by intron ends consistent with the model of nonconventional intron junctions  <cit> . however, on the basis of previously published data it is not clear whether the features of intermediate introns reflect their kinship with both conventional and nonconventional introns or if they are the effects of other processes.

in order to shed new light on this issue, we analyzed intron sequences of hsp <dig>  tubb, and gapc genes of six euglena agilis strains. a comparison of homologous sequences from different strains of a species can help to identify the most conserved features of introns, thereby verifying intron provenance. e. agilis is a perfect choice for such an analysis due to its well documented high genetic variability .

RESULTS
tubb gene
six tubb sequences from five e. agilis strains were obtained, encompassing 86 % of the coding region . the obtained sequences were compared with tubb sequences from the e. agilis acoi  <dig> reference strain. all the sequences contain four introns at the same positions .  shows sequences of all intron-exon junctions in the tubb gene.fig.  <dig> intron positions in three genes of e. agilis and other euglenids. a

in all the species studied so far, the intron at position  <dig> has gt-ag boundaries and the ability to form a stable secondary structure has not been detected with the exception of the e. agilis acoi  <dig> strain  <cit> . in the sequences obtained in this study, the gt-cag boundaries of intron  <dig> are preserved and a stable rna secondary structure bringing together intron ends can be formed only by the intron from the po strain. the intron at position  <dig> occurs only in those species in which intron  <dig> is also present  <cit> . in all the cases examined earlier as well as in the e. agilis strains studied herein, intron  <dig> has gt-ag ends and cannot form a stable rna secondary structure bringing its ends together. thus, position  <dig> contains a typical conventional spliceosomal intron. the intron located at position  <dig> is present only in closely related species euglena gracilis, euglena longa, and e. agilis. in e. longa it is a typical nonconventional intron, whereas in e. gracilis and e. agilis strain acoi  <dig> it has been classified as intermediate/nonconventional because of the gt 5' end  <cit> . in the strains studied herein, a stable rna secondary structure of introns at position  <dig> and all elements characteristic for nonconventional intron were detected . additionally, in comparison to introns at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  much greater length variation was observed . furthermore, at the 5' end of the intron a purine  is always present, while the following nucleotide is not conserved; a gt end is found in acoi  <dig> and wa strains whereas a gc end is present in the wi strain. a purine is located at the 3' end of the introns of pr and wi strains and this is the only deviation from the model of nonconventional intron junctions. the intron at position  <dig> is observed only in tubb genes from four species of the euglena genus: euglena gymnodinioides, e. gracilis, e. longa and e. agilis  <cit> . in all these species it is a typical nonconventional intron lacking the gt/c-ag ends and able to form a stable rna secondary structure consistent with the proposed model. this is also true for the e. agilis strains studied here. the only deviation from the model is nucleotide t  at the third position of the downstream exon in the gene from the po strain . similarly to intron  <dig>  the variability of the length of this intron  is much higher than for introns  <dig> and  <dig> 

hsp <dig> gene
amplification of the hsp <dig> gene fragment encompassing 98 % of the coding region  was successful only for the po strain . the obtained sequence contains six introns. new primers were designed encompassing a shorter gene fragment with all the introns defined for the po strain . amplification with ea9s f0/r <dig> and easf1/r <dig> primers was successful for acoi  <dig> , pr , wi  and wa  strains. the gene fragment from the acoi  <dig> strain was amplified in two parts using ea9sf0/r <dig>  ea9sf1/r <dig> and ea9sf2/r <dig>  ea9sf3/r <dig> primers . all of the sequences contain six introns at the same positions. however, all introns from e. agilis are at different positions than the three introns in the peranema trichophorum  gene, the only known hsp <dig> gene from an euglenid . table s <dig>  shows sequences of intron-exon junctions in the hsp <dig> gene.

the stable rna secondary structure characteristic for nonconventional intron ends can be formed by all the introns in the hsp <dig> gene from all the examined e. agilis strains. additionally, the presence of a purine at the 5' end of downstream exons was observed in all introns. a few deviations were observed for other attributes of nonconventional intron junctions in the analyzed sequences:  a purine at the 3' end of the upstream exon of intron  <dig> from all strains ,  a pyrimidine at the 5' end of intron  <dig> from acoi  <dig>  pr, po and wa strains,  a purine at the 3' end of introns  <dig> and  <dig> from acoi  <dig>  intron  <dig> from wi and intron  <dig> from acoi  <dig>   a non-cytosine nucleotide at the third position of the downstream exon of introns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from all strains. the gc 5' end was found in  <dig> introns . moreover, intron  <dig> from the acoi  <dig> strain has gc-ag ends characteristic for the conventional type. high variation in intron length was observed in introns at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

gapc gene
nine gapc sequences from six e. agilis strains were obtained, encompassing the coding region for which three introns were defined in the gene from e. gracilis . sequences from five strains of e. agilis contain two introns at the same positions as in the e. gracilis gene. sequences from the acoi  <dig> strain contain a third additional intron at a new position. table s <dig>  shows sequences of all intron-exon junctions in the gapc genes from e. agilis.

the intron at position  <dig> in the sequence of the gapc gene from e. gracilis  was described as nonconventional because of its ability to form a stable secondary structure and despite gt-ag ends. at the moment of publication only nonconventional introns were known in genes of euglenids  <cit> . however, the secondary structure of this intron resembles – to a small extent – the structure of nonconventional introns, therefore it should be classified as a conventional/intermediate rather than simply a nonconventional one. all gapc gene sequences obtained in this study contain introns at position 1; all of them have gt-ag ends and the ability to form a stable secondary structure was not detected. thus, they should be classified as conventional introns. all the examined introns at position  <dig> can form a stable secondary structure bringing intron ends together and do not obey the gt/c-ag rule; also other elements characteristic for nonconventional introns are present .

analysis of intron distribution in tuba and tubb genes revealed that nonconventional introns appear in nuclear genes of euglenids quite often and many of them are unique for single species  <cit> . results presented herein allow for an even more far-reaching conclusion – nonconventional intron gain is an ongoing process that can be observed at the level of a single species. the gapc gene of strain acoi  <dig> contains an intron at position  <dig> which is absent in the sequences of other e. agilis strains, suggesting that this intron is a new structure and was acquired relatively recently. intron  <dig> has all of the features of nonconventional introns. interestingly, eight nucleotide direct repeats were observed at the intron-exon junction . similarly, short direct repeats are also present at the intron-exon junctions of recently acquired conventional introns in several genes from daphnia pulex, explained as the fingerprint of intron gain by the double-strand break repair process  <cit> . it is worth considering if this process could also be the source of new nonconventional introns. this is particularly interesting in the case of euglenids because of their remarkable resistance to uv and ionizing radiation related to high double-strand break rejoining activity  <cit> .

identification of nonconventional introns
the recognition of the borders of nonconventional intron is not trivial due to the lack of close end preservation, even when compared to the sequence of the mature transcript. direct repeats often observed at intron-exon junctions make intron position difficult to determine precisely. this is why the boundaries of many nonconventional introns deposited in databases have not been defined correctly. a comparison of all known intron sequences and elucidation of the common characteristics of non-conventional introns greatly improved our understanding  <cit> , although in many introns, including those studied in this work, numerous deviations from the common model are observed.

the ends of all nonconventional introns studied herein, as well as all others known so far, form a stable secondary structure bringing together intron ends and the ends of adjacent exons. nevertheless, comparisons of homologous introns indicate that this structure is conserved to a very limited extent. the ends of some introns form strict stems of several nucleotides without any internal loops or bulges , while in homologous sequences unpaired nucleotides at different positions are observed . the presence of many compensatory base changes between homologous sequences underlines the significance of secondary structure, although mutations creating internal loops or bulges were also found. the only nucleotides which always form base pairs in the analyzed nonconventional introns are present at positions + <dig>  + <dig> and − <dig>  − <dig> ; nucleotides at positions + <dig> and − <dig> are unpaired only in one sequence. in most introns cag/ctg nucleotides are found at these positions , in agreement with a previous study for all known nonconventional introns  <cit>  . other stem-forming nucleotides are also conserved in several cases, but only within the groups of homologous introns, not between different introns . this means that close location of junctions, the effect of intron end base pairing, is crucial for splicing site recognition, although no distinct common motif in intron secondary structure is noticeable. the question is whether cag/ctg nucleotides observed in most but not all nonconventional introns act as a signal of key importance in the process of intron excision or if they are just the “fingerprint” of the source sequence of all nonconventional introns. in the latter case, these nucleotides could be changed in time by compensatory mutations appearing at a slower rate due to the importance of this process for maintenance of proper secondary structure.fig.  <dig> homologous introns at position  <dig> in tubb genes. a comparison of rna secondary structure of introns at position  <dig> in tubb genes from six strains of e. agilis. the middle part of the sequence is omitted and indicated by dots. exons in black circles, introns in gray; nucleotides present in all six sequences highlighted in red, in five of six in orange, in four of six in yellow. classical watson-crick base-pairing interactions are marked by single  or double  lines, non-canonical gu pairs by single line with circle. note: the u/a base pair is present at positions +5/- <dig> instead of a/u observed in other nonconventional introns

the base pairing of ends is not the only feature of nonconventional introns, i.e. nucleotides at the close ends of exons and introns are also conserved to a certain extent: purines at the 5' end of an intron  and at the 5' end of a downstream exon  and pyrimidines at the 3' end of an upstream exon  and 3' of an intron . this pattern suggests that deviations from the model at the end positions of exons and introns are tolerated. alterations at the third position of the downstream exon were also observed – c is present only in  <dig> of  <dig> analyzed sequences. notably, an a at the second position of downstream exons is more conserved than the c at the third in  <dig> of  <dig> sequences . it seems that nucleotide identity at the exon and intron ends are rather weak splicing determinants that can be recognized only when the secondary structure of intron ends is formed. the question whether slightly conserved cis signals are sufficient for defining exon-intron borders remains open. participation of trans factors, such as antisense rna molecules, should also be taken into account.

intermediate introns – true or false?
intermediate introns have characteristics of both conventional and nonconventional types. introns at position  <dig> in tubb genes from e. agilis acoi  <dig> and po strains were classified as conventional/intermediate with both borders typical for conventional introns and the potential to form a stable rna secondary structure. a comparison of the modeled rna secondary structures of these introns shows no common elements; characteristic features of nonconventional introns are not apparent either . gt-cag ends as well as a few other nucleotides near the 5' end are essentially the only conserved features of introns at this position from all strains. as mentioned earlier, intron  <dig> in the gapc gene of e. gracilis should also be classified as conventional/intermediate. however, the only features in common with nonconventional introns are purines at the 5' ends of the intron and the downstream exon . homologous introns  <dig> from e. agilis strains obtained in this study are typical conventional types and the secondary structure required to bring together intron ends was not detected in any of them. this indicates that the introns at position  <dig> in gapc and in tubb genes are conventional spliceosomal introns. moreover, the ability to form a stable rna secondary structure by some is probably not a result of their relationship with nonconventional introns. it is assumed that the secondary structure sometimes observed in conventional introns of many organisms could facilitate their splicing , although its presence in conventional introns of euglenids could also have a different explanation. previous studies have suggested that nonconventional introns are excised before conventional ones  <cit> . the presence of conventional and nonconventional introns in the same gene could disturb the process of nonconventional intron folding. for instance, the ability of conventional introns to form a secondary structure could facilitate the correct folding of nonconventional introns and their fast excision. however, the primary determinant of the assignment of intron to type should be the mechanism of intron excision. it cannot be excluded that conventional/intermediate introns, such as introns  <dig> in tubb and gapc genes, could be excised from the primary transcript by both spliceosomal and nonconventional mechanisms, in the latter case on lower level. it cannot be excluded also that other nuclear genes of euglenids contain conventional/intermediate introns forming secondary structure consistent with the slightly conserved model for nonconventional introns. such hypothetical intron would be the example of the real intermediate intron excised by two mechanisms.fig.  <dig> rna secondary structure of introns. a and b introns at position  <dig> in tubb genes from e. agilis . c intron at position  <dig> in gapc gene from e. gracilis . d intron at position  <dig> in the hsp <dig> gene from e. agilis strain acoi  <dig> . exons in black circles, introns in gray; nucleotides present in all six homologous sequences of e. agilis highlighted in red, in five of six in orange, in four of six in yellow. classical watson-crick hydrogen bonding marked by single  or double  lines, non-classical gu pairs by single line with circle



thirteen of fifty five analyzed introns meeting the characteristics of the nonconventional type have gt or gc 5' ends, meaning that they should be classified as intermediate/nonconventional introns. it has been hypothesized that the presence of gt or gc ends may not be the result of the relationship with conventional introns, but rather an effect of evolutionary pressure to preserve the purine at the 5' end , a feature of most nonconventional introns  <cit> . an analysis of  <dig> introns in tubb, hsp <dig>  and gapc genes confirms this hypothesis. most nonconventional introns  have a purine at the + <dig> position, while nucleotides at positions + <dig> and + <dig> are not conserved between different introns, as well as between homologous introns from closely related taxa . the presence of the gt/c end is not in itself evidence of kinship to conventional introns. such sequences should rather be considered as nonconventional introns susceptible to potential transformation into conventional ones. is this transformation possible? all analyzed introns at position  <dig> in hsp <dig> have typical features of nonconventional introns with one exception, i.e. the intron from acoi  <dig> strain has an unusual ag 3' end, while the 5' end of the intron is gc . thus, this intron may be removed by two mechanisms. if this is confirmed, then this intron should be defined as intermediate. notwithstanding the foregoing discussion, intron  <dig> from the acoi  <dig> strain of e. agilis is the first example of a nonconventional intron which potentially could also be excised by the spliceosome with the same cleavage sites. this also means that the change of intron type from nonconventional to conventional is possible.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we analyzed thirteen introns in tubb, hsp <dig>  and gapc genes from six strains of e. agilis. sequence and rna secondary structure analyses of the nonconventional introns confirmed that the most strongly conserved elements are base pairing nucleotides at positions + <dig>  + <dig> and +6/ - <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig>  their complementarity is maintained rather than sequence conservation, although in most introns cag/ctg nucleotides were observed; the close ends of these introns are preserved to a lesser extent.

it was shown that the presence of the 5' gt/c end of intermediate/nonconventional introns is not the result of their kinship with conventional introns, but emerges as a result of the evolutionary pressure to preserve the purine at their end , a characteristic for most nonconventional introns. an intermediate intron candidate containing features of both types of introns was also discussed.

the presence of recently acquired nonconventional introns in the gapc gene from one strain of e. agilis indicates that nonconventional intron acquisition is an ongoing process and can be observed at the level of a single species. in the recently acquired intron in the gapc gene an extended direct repeats at the intron-exon junctions are present, what suggests that double-strand break repair process could be the source of new nonconventional introns.
