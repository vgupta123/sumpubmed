BACKGROUND
information about an organism’s capabilities can be derived from a variety of sources. when genomic information is combined with biochemical, phenotypic or genetic data, functional roles and interrelationships of components within metabolic or regulatory networks become better defined  <cit> . thus, to obtain a global view of an organism’s capabilities, it is often beneficial to develop models that integrate data from different types of experiments. in obtaining such integrated views, genome-scale metabolic network models can serve both as databases for storage and organization and as tools for the combination and analysis of heterogeneous data sets  <cit> . a particular interest of our laboratory is developing an integrated understanding of metabolic networks in photosynthetic microbes, because of their abundance in nature, the unique aspects of a solar-driven lifestyle and their growing importance in biotechnological applications  <cit> .

we study purple non-sulfur bacteria, a group of photosynthetic microbes that display great metabolic and energetic diversity  <cit> . the purple non-sulfur bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides represents one of the best studied photosynthetic organisms, and has been used to develop models of photon capture, light-driven energy metabolism and other aspects of its diverse lifestyles  <cit> . this facultative microbe is capable of anoxygenic photosynthetic growth, aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration  <cit> . furthermore, r. sphaeroides has been studied for potential biotechnological applications including the ability to produce h <dig> <cit>  and ubiquinone  <cit> , production of polyhydroxybutyrate, which can be used as a source of biodegradable plastics  <cit> , remediation of radioactive contamination  <cit> , and its ability to fix co <dig> and n <dig> <cit> . the available genetic, genomic and physiological tools  <cit>  also make r. sphaeroides an excellent system in which to improve our understanding of solar energy capture, metabolic and energetic aspects of photosynthesis and other energetic pathways, and the networks which regulate processes of societal and biotechnological interest. to obtain an integrated understanding of photosynthesis or other aspects of r. sphaeroides’ lifestyles requires the use of high-throughput data to develop better predictive models of its metabolic network.

in this work, we take a systematic approach to expand our knowledge of the metabolic and energetic networks of r. sphaeroides by combining data from genetic, phenotypic and transcriptional analyses with constraint-based modeling. we use high-through phenotypic microarrays to show that wild type r. sphaeroides grows on a diverse array of substrates and that this nutrient utilization profile varies significantly between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic growth conditions. using the conserved bioenergetic enzyme pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase  as an example, we identify carbon sources where recycling of pyridine nucleotides by this enzyme is essential for photosynthetic or non-photosynthetic growth. we use a genome-scale metabolic model to predict flux distributions and identify alternative nadph producing reactions that can compensate for the loss of pntab and thereby explain the conditional growth of Δpntab cells on selected carbon sources. transcriptional and phenotypic analyses of defined single and double mutants were used to verify the potential use of some of these alternative nadph producing reactions under defined conditions. the new data derived from analyzing the growth of wild type and mutant cells were used to develop irsp <dig>  a significant update to the existing genome-scale reconstruction of the r. sphaeroides metabolic network  <cit> , with increased coverage of metabolic pathways and improved predictive ability. irsp <dig> accounts for  <dig> genes,  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> reactions. this work illustrates the new insights into important cellular processes that can be acquired by integrating data from genetic, genomic and other complementary experiments into predictive models of biological systems.

RESULTS
global analysis of substrate utilization by r. sphaeroides
one important step in acquiring a global understanding of cellular processes in an organism is to develop a broad perspective of its metabolic repertoire. an assessment of the literature reveals that r. sphaeroides has been reported to grow on  <dig> carbon,  <dig> nitrogen,  <dig> phosphorus and  <dig> sulfur sources  <cit> . in contrast, the existing genome-scale model of r. sphaeroides metabolic network, irsp <dig>  predicted an ability to grow on a significantly larger number of substrates   <cit> . thus, to improve our knowledge of the metabolic capabilities of r. sphaeroides, and aid subsequent analyses of genetic or physiological perturbations, we used phenotype microarrays   <cit>  to assess the ability of wild type  cells to utilize carbon sources under anoxygenic photoheterotrophic conditions , aerobic and anaerobic respiratory conditions . we also determined the suite of, nitrogen , phosphorus  and sulfur  sources that do or do not support photosynthetic growth.

r. sphaeroides utilizes different arrays of nutrients across growth conditions
the results from analysis of substrate utilization by wt r. sphaeroides cells , significantly expands the array of compounds that support growth of this organism. while the carbon utilization profiles were largely similar during photosynthetic and aerobic respiratory growth, several important differences were observed. eight carbon sources appeared to support growth photosynthetically but not aerobically, while  <dig> supported growth aerobically but not photosynthetically . potential causes for the observed differences might include:  longer lag times under individual conditions , which may result in an apparent inability to utilize the carbon source under one experimental condition;  insurmountable metabolic, bioenergetic or regulatory bottlenecks ; or  potential differences between the data derived from the photosynthetic pm assay  and the aerobic pm assay   <cit> .

of the  <dig> carbon sources that were used both photosynthetically and aerobically,  <dig> were tested for their ability to support growth under anaerobic respiratory conditions using dimethyl sulfoxide  as the terminal electron acceptor . only  <dig> of these carbon sources were capable of supporting anaerobic respiratory growth  after 10 days of incubation. we propose that the inability of wt r. sphaeroides to grow in the presence of several carbon substrates during anaerobic respiratory growth is likely due to regulatory and/or bioenergetic constraints, as pathways required for their catabolism are either known or predicted to be present in the genome.

pm assays also revealed that  <dig> nitrogen,  <dig> phosphorus and  <dig> sulfur sources supported growth photosynthetically in wt r. sphaeroides . this is a number of nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur substrates which is similar to those shown to support growth of other well-studied facultative bacteria like escherichia coli <cit>  and bacillus subtilis <cit> .

the ability of r. sphaeroides to grow on a wide variety of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur sources  is a further demonstration of its metabolic versatility. of particular interest for future studies is the pattern of substrate utilization observed under different growth conditions, which we propose likely reflects regulatory differences, since enzymes needed to carry out the required reactions are predicted to be encoded in the genome. below we show that these pm analyses of wt cells provide important reference points for studying the effects of mutations on the metabolic, energetic and regulatory pathways that are potentially used during various modes of growth.

analyzing the role of pntab under defined growth conditions
to illustrate how knowledge of the substrate utilization profile of wt r. sphaeroides can be used to assess the effects of genetic perturbation on the metabolic network, we describe insights gained from analyzing an important and widely conserved energetic enzyme, pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase . pntab is a heterotetrameric membrane-bound enzyme consisting of α and β subunits that catalyzes the reversible exchange of reducing equivalents between pyridine nucleotides based on the magnitude of the proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> .

thus pntab plays a major role in maintaining the balance of cellular pyridine nucleotides . nadph is a source of reducing equivalents in a large number of crucial anabolic pathways such as the calvin cycle in autotrophic cells, fatty acid biosynthesis and tetrapyrrole or pigment biosynthesis in photosynthetic organisms  <cit> .

extensive studies have shown that e. coli pntab expression is induced when there is a demand for nadph  <cit> . in addition, e. coli pntab is required for optimal growth on carbon sources whose metabolism does not directly generate nadph, such as glycerol  <cit> . e. coli also possesses an energy independent soluble transhydrogenase, udha, which is induced when there is an excess of nadph  and mediates conversion of nadph to nadp+ <cit> . in addition to pntab and udha, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  and isocitrate dehydrogenase  can help maintain bacterial nadph pools under specific conditions  <cit> . we compared growth of r. sphaeroides wild type and Δpntab cells  using pms to identify conditions with an increased need for nadph in this bacterium.

pntab is conditionally essential for photosynthetic and aerobic respiratory growth
under photosynthetic conditions, only  <dig> carbon sources supported growth of pnta <dig> compared to  <dig> substrates that were used by wt cells. importantly, only pnta <dig> cells using d-glucose achieved a final optical density that was equivalent to that of its parent, while pnta <dig> cells using d-aspartate grew well, whereas the wt parent did not grow on this substrate , suggesting these were the only tested carbon sources that supported normal photosynthetic growth in pnta <dig>  to independently confirm the differences observed in the pm assays, we compared photosynthetic growth between pnta <dig>  its wt parent and a pnta <dig> cells expressing pntab from an iptg inducible plasmid . the combined results of these analyses can place the carbon sources that support photosynthetic growth in r. sphaeroides into  <dig> groups . group i carbon sources such as d-glucose, result in net production of nadph during their metabolism, via enzymes like the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. these group i carbon sources support comparable photosynthetic growth in wt and pnta <dig> cells . group ii carbon sources  are incapable of supporting photosynthetic growth in the absence of pntab. metabolism of these group ii carbon sources require net consumption of nadph, in addition to that required for anabolic processes . growth of pnta <dig> using group iii carbon sources , was significantly impaired compared to that of wt cells, and exhibited a long lag before growth commenced . it should be noted however, that several group iii carbon sources such as succinate, failed to support photosynthetic growth on agar plates , reinforcing the need for pntab activity when using these carbon sources.

aphoto – photosynthetic growth; aero – aerobic respiratory growth.

combined, these data suggest that pntab is the major source of nadph for photosynthetic growth on carbon sources except glucose and d-aspartate. furthermore, the fact that pnta <dig>  but not its wt parent grows on d-aspartate suggests either that this strain contains unlinked mutations that allow it to metabolize this substrate or that the metabolism of the substrate is induced when the nadph pool is reduced. this observation could also indicate that r. sphaeroides possesses an nadph-linked pathway for aspartate catabolism  <cit> , even though its genome does not contain an open reading frame with significant amino acid sequence similarity to known enzymes with such an activity. in the case of group iii carbon sources , other nadph producing pathways could be activated to support growth albeit at a slower rate. for example, the delayed photosynthetic growth that is seen with some group iii carbon sources might be the result of metabolic or genetic alterations that are needed to provide pntab-independent routes for nadph synthesis . in addition, we predict that for group ii substrates , the date predict that the combined nadph demand for metabolism and anabolic processes is too high to be provided by such alternative pathways.

in contrast, pm assays show that under aerobic conditions pnta <dig> grows similarly to its wt parent on the many of carbon sources assessed . of the  <dig> carbon sources tested,  <dig> allowed essentially equivalent growth  between pnta <dig> and its wt parent. in addition,  <dig> carbon sources that allowed aerobic growth of the wt parent did not support aerobic respiration/growth of pnta <dig> after 96 hrs of incubation, while another  <dig> showed significantly reduced aerobic respiration/growth in cells lacking pntab. both l- and d-aspartate, supported improved aerobic respiration/growth in pnta <dig> cells compared to its wt parent . these results underscore potential differences in the relative need for pntab activity under distinct metabolic states and provide a further indication that an, as yet unidentified nadph-linked pathway for metabolism of aspartate and potentially other carbon sources exists in r. sphaeroides.

alternative nadph-generating pathways can be utilized under different growth conditions
for group ii and iii carbon sources , which require pntab for photosynthetic growth, growth of pnta <dig> was indistinguishable from its wt parent under aerobic respiratory conditions . one explanation for this observation is that alternative nadph-generating reactions can function to replace pntab under aerobic respiratory conditions. indeed, irsp <dig>  predicts  <dig> other routes that could generate nadph under defined conditions in r. sphaeroides . the relative expression of these candidate alternative nadph-generating pathways was assayed using quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr  to determine if transcript levels for the respective genes are increased in the absence of pntab when compared to a parent strain, when cells were grown by aerobic respiration in cultures containing one of the  <dig> groups of carbon sources defined above  . this analysis revealed carbon source-dependent differential expression of potential alternative nadph generation pathways. during aerobic respiratory growth on a carbon source that requires nadph consumption , the loss of pntab was accompanied by an ~ <dig> fold increase in expression of a putative nadph:ferredoxin reductase gene . when using glucose, a carbon source that generates net nadph, we found that zwf  transcript levels are increased > <dig> fold during aerobic respiratory growth on glucose compared to acetate or succinate, in both the wt parental strain and pnta <dig>  furthermore, transcripts for genes encoding putative malic enzyme , isocitrate dehydrogenase  and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase  enzymes were each increased > <dig> fold in pnta <dig> during aerobic respiratory growth compared to its wt parent . we recognize that changes in gene expression may not necessarily result in equivalent changes in flux through the corresponding reactions in the direction of nadph synthesis . however, these data illustrate the potential of alternative nadph-generating pathways during aerobic respiratory growth to contribute to the growth of pnta <dig> when using many carbon sources.

*6pgl – d-glucono- <dig> -lactone 6-phosphate; mlthf –  <dig> -methylenetetrahydrofolate; methf –  <dig> -methenyltetrahydrofolate; thf dehydrogenase –  <dig> -methylene-tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase.

interestingly, none of the transcript levels for the tested genes were significantly increased in the succinate-grown pnta <dig> cells under aerobic respiratory conditions. this could indicate that the contribution of pntab is minor under this condition and that alternative nadph-generating pathways provide sufficient nadph to support growth. alternatively, other as yet unidentified nadph-generating pathways or post-transcriptional events might exist in both wild type and Δpntab cells.

the metabolic flux predictions from irsp <dig> predict that gluconeogenesis is one potential route which could be utilized during growth on succinate in the absence of pntab, to produce glucose-6-phosphate, which would then be metabolized via the entner-doudoroff pathway to produce nadph . to test this hypothesis, we experimentally analyzed the impact of loss of zwf under different growth and nutrient conditions. we found that loss of zwf alone  did not significantly impair aerobic respiratory growth on succinate, consistent with the prediction that this enzyme is not required for growth under these conditions. however, loss of zwf in pnta <dig>  resulted in a significant decrease in aerobic respiratory growth on succinate compared to the pnta <dig> mutant , suggesting that zwf makes a significant contribution to nadph production, but only in the absence of pntab, even though zwf transcript levels are not increased in pnta <dig> cells under this condition. additionally, the observed growth difference between the zwf <dig> and pnta1-zwf <dig> mutants indicates that pntab makes even a more significant contribution to nadph production when cells are grown aerobically with succinate as a carbon source . these data confirm the model’s prediction and suggest that zwf is a major nadph generating enzyme utilized by the cell in the absence of pntab during aerobic respiratory growth on succinate.

under photosynthetic conditions, the pnta1-zwf <dig> double mutant was incapable of growth on either glucose, succinate or acetate . however, growth is partially restored for glucose and succinate when the pnta-zwf <dig> mutant is complemented with a plasmid containing the zwf gene . these findings indicate that zwf also serves as a major route for nadph generation during photosynthetic growth with these carbon sources, an observation that was predicted by metabolic flux analysis in irsp <dig> . additionally, growth of zwf <dig> cells is impaired when using glucose either photosynthetically or aerobically , suggesting that the entner-doudoroff pathway is the major glycolytic pathway in r. sphaeroides, despite significant expression of genes encoding enzymes of the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway in these cultures. this conclusion is also consistent with both experimental analysis of 13c-glucose metabolism in r. sphaeroides under aerobic respiratory conditions  <cit>  and with the metabolic flux predictions made by irsp <dig> .

the conditional ability of alternative pathways to compensate for the loss of pntab could reflect a higher demand for nadph during photosynthetic or other energetic conditions. for example, under photosynthetic conditions, r. sphaeroides produces significantly larger amounts of fatty acids, photopigments and other components of the photosynthetic apparatus  <cit>  that are each synthesized via nadph-dependent pathways. indeed, irsp <dig> predicts there is a 2– <dig> fold increase in the demand for nadph under photosynthetic conditions in cells using succinate or glucose as a major carbon source . if this prediction is accurate, our data suggests that this significantly greater demand for nadph during photosynthetic growth cannot be met by using alternative nadph-generating pathways that are sufficient under aerobic respiratory conditions. however, irsp <dig> also predicts that the need for nadph during aerobic respiratory growth in the presence of acetate is greater than that required for photosynthetic growth on either succinate or glucose, indicating that the cell might have the metabolic capacity to generate sufficient amount nadph to support photosynthetic growth via these alternative pathways. thus, additional studies are needed to determine if there are additional constraints under photosynthetic conditions which make alternative nadph-generating pathways that function under aerobic respiratory conditions insufficient to support growth under other energetic states. combined, these data illustrate the centrality, and previously unrecognized importance, of the routes for nadph production in the photosynthetic lifestyle of r. sphaeroides. given the ubiquitous nature of pntab across biology, it is possible that this enzyme plays a major energetic role in other photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organisms.

irsp1140: a revised experimentally-validated genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for r. sphaeroides
the above results provide new information about the metabolic capabilities of r. sphaeroides that can be utilized to refine biochemically, genetically and genomically structured databases employed in constraint-based analysis  <cit> . we previously constructed and validated a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for r. sphaeroides, called irsp <dig>  using its annotated genome, published organism-specific data and information from continuous cultures of wt cells  <cit> .

however, the substrate utilization predictions of irsp <dig> could not explain a large amount of the data obtained during pm analysis of wild type and mutant cells . consequently, we performed a 2-step refinement and extension of irsp <dig> that involved addition and removal of appropriate reactions, metabolites and genes to increase its agreement with the pm data, while also incorporating newly available metabolic data for r. sphaeroides since release of irsp <dig> . an initial refinement process resulted in addition of  <dig> reactions,  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> genes to irsp <dig>  while removing  <dig> reactions and  <dig> genes . ninety-six of these  <dig> additional reactions consisted of newly added enzymatic activities, for which no apparent genes were present in the annotated r. sphaeroides genome. to identify candidate enzymes for these reactions, we conducted new blast analyses utilizing protein sequence of experimentally verified enzymes from other organisms. these searches resulted in the identification and annotation of  <dig> new candidate enzymes. an additional  <dig> enzymes already included in irsp <dig>  with previously predicted functions, were identified as candidates to catalyze new reactions in the model .

of the  <dig> reactions added to irsp <dig>   <dig> are predicted membrane transport reactions. organisms utilize a variety of transporters to import nutrients  <cit> . however, r. sphaeroides appears to favor the use of atp-dependent abc transporters . an analysis of the r. sphaeroides genome reveals that of the genes encoding abc transporters with no known or predicted functions,  <dig> are organized in operons encoding proteins with an atpase domain, an integral membrane permease domain and a substrate-specific substrate binding domain  . to test the function of these putative transport operons, we deleted the gene for each of these  <dig> predicted substrate binding proteins and assessed growth of the resulting mutants using pm. this analysis, plus subsequent liquid growth studies led to identification of substrate-specific growth defects in mutants lacking individual genes for candidate transporters . based on this data set we have provisionally identified substrates for  <dig> previously uncharacterized transporters . these transport reactions were incorporated into irsp <dig> by the addition of  <dig> genes,  <dig> reactions and one metabolite .

and - not determined. specific substrates for these transporters could not be determined from pm assay and the analysis of mutants lacking single genes in each of these predicted operons .

these updates resulted in a refined metabolic model for r. sphaeroides, irsp <dig>  consisting of  <dig> reactions,  <dig> metabolites and accounting for  <dig> genes within its genome . overall, irsp <dig> includes a larger number of reactions, metabolites and genes, and it is supported by increased physiological, genetic and genomic evidence for the inclusion of many components in the network. the predictions of irsp <dig> are in better agreement with the pm data compared with those of irsp <dig> , verifying the improved predictive ability of irsp <dig>  in addition, predictions made by irsp <dig> for growth rate or production of h <dig>  polyhydroxybutyrate and co <dig> evolution were in excellent agreement with published data  <cit>  . we expect that irsp <dig> will enable improved modeling of metabolic behavior under a larger number of conditions. in addition, the increased number of genes in irsp <dig> provides a larger set of targets for assessing the effects of genetic perturbations on growth or metabolic activity under both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
while the development of high-throughput or global approaches can provide large amounts of data, the task of extracting meaningful biological insight from this information is still challenging  <cit> . to gain new biological insights, constraint-based and other modeling approaches can be used to integrate various data sets  <cit> .

in this study, we took an integrated approach to gain new insight into the metabolic, energetic and photosynthetic lifestyles of r. sphaeroides. we extended the number of nutrients that can support growth of wt cells. we also showed that a conserved bioenergetic enzyme  which can provide reduced pyridine nucleotides is essential for photosynthetic growth on many carbon sources. we used a genome-scale model for r. sphaeroides to make flux predictions, as well as generate and test hypotheses on alterative nadph-generating pathways that allow growth in the absence of pntab. the products of various anabolic pathways require nadph that is derived mainly from pntab activity, so exploiting these and other alternative nadph generating pathways we identified, could improve growth and metabolic end products derived from photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic wild type cells or those engineered to produce compounds of biotechnological interest.

previous studies have shown the utility of high-throughput data sets in refining and validating genome-scale metabolic models  <cit> . we used our data to produce a 2nd generation genome-scale reconstruction for r. sphaeroides, irsp <dig> with significantly improved coverage of metabolic functions and predictions that are in better agreement with experimental data. irsp <dig>  provides an improved depiction of the r. sphaeroides metabolic network, so it will be useful in studying photosynthesis, as well as a wider range of metabolic processes in this and related organisms.
