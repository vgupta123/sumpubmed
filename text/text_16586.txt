BACKGROUND
albino mutations lead to a decrease in direction selectivity of neurons in the motion sensitive cortical and subcortical areas of albino mammals  <cit> . this, in turn critically depends on gabaergic mechanisms  <cit> . while gaba is the main inhibitory transmitter in the adult brain, gabaergic transmission is excitatory during early postnatal development. this different action of gaba results from a reversed chloride concentration gradient with higher intracellular chloride concentration in immature neurons  <cit> . the na+-k+-2cl- co-transporter  and the k+-cl- co-transporter  are the most important of the many known chloride regulators in neocortical neurons  <cit> . the developmental switch to an inhibitory action of gaba is a consequence of a decrease of nkcc <dig> and increase of kcc <dig> expression after birth. cl- uptake in immature neurons is mediated by na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter  <cit> , as no gabaa mediated depolarization was found in nkcc <dig> knock out mice  <cit> . interestingly in cortical neurons, a shift in cl- homeostasis toward a higher i is implicated in the determination of developmental stage: depolarizing gabaergic and glycinergic responses mediate various developmental processes, such as neuronal migration, differentiation, and synapse formation  <cit> . in contrast to nkcc <dig>  the kcc <dig> co-transporter's central role is promoting inhibition and preventing hyperexcitability  <cit> . an inhibitory action of gaba is required to discriminate differences in input activities during processes accompanied by synaptic pruning  <cit> , i.e. the presence of gabaa receptor-mediated inhibition is essential during the critical period of ocular-dominance plasticity  <cit> . zhu et al. showed in kcc2-/- mice  <cit>  that cortical neurons lacking kcc <dig> not only fail to show a developmental decrease in i, but also are unable to regulate i on cl- loading or maintain i during membrane depolarization.

RESULTS
to test whether changed gabaar mediated currents observed in albino visual cortex neurons  <cit>  is regulated by the two major cation-chloride co-transporters: kcc <dig> and nkcc <dig>  the mrnas for these transporters were studied in the albino and pigmented visual cortex neurons of postnatal day  20– <dig> rats by single cell real time pcr. out of  <dig> neurons tested in both groups ,  <dig> were found to express nkcc <dig>  of these,  <dig> neurons were from albino and  <dig> from pigmented rat visual cortex. . this in contrast to yamada et al. who using semiquantitative single cell multiplex rt pcr didn't find any nkcc <dig> mrna in neurons of the somatosensory cortex in p11- <dig> albino  rats  <cit> . kcc <dig> mrna was detected in every cell tested in both groups . accordingly, mrna expression of the house-keeping gene β-actin was also found in every cell analyzed and served as internal control for pcr efficiency. this fact may argue that regulation of the major outward chloride co-transporter is not impaired, or not impaired to such an extent as its inward counterpart. as our two-steps real time single cell pcr did not reveal a qualitative difference in kcc <dig> mrna expression and because no reliable co-transporter blocker for kcc <dig> is available  <cit> , further investigations are needed to quantify the co-transporter participation in intracellular chloride regulation in albino visual cortex neurons compared to the brain of pigmented animals. interestingly, we detected several nkcc <dig> positive neurons in p20- <dig> pigmented rat visual cortex in agreement with the evidence for nkcc <dig> in adult human neocortex  <cit>  and in rat visual cortex  <cit>  received by use of other methods.

distribution of nkcc <dig> positive and negative cells as revealed by single cell real time pcr in albino and pigmented rat visual cortex .

in order to directly correlate cl- transporter rna expression to electrophysiology, we performed gramicidin-perforated patch clamp recordings and subsequent analysis of nkcc <dig> mrna expression in the cytoplasm of the measured cells. current-voltage curves of the electrically evoked gabaar-mediated postsynaptic currents in nkcc <dig> positive  and nkcc <dig> negative neurons  as well as the corresponding sample fluorescence curves of pcr products are presented in fig.  <dig>  we found a statistically significant difference in the reversal potential of gabaar-mediated postsynaptic currents  between albino and pigmented rat visual cortical neurons : - <dig> +/-  <dig>  mv  and - <dig>  +/-  <dig>  mv  respectively. the egaba value obtained for nkcc <dig> expressing cells was - <dig>  +/-  <dig> mv , while for nkcc <dig> negative neurons this value comprised - <dig> +/-  <dig>  mv  . additionally, the presence of nkcc <dig> rna strongly correlated with high intracellular chloride level as summarized in figure  <dig>  by application of the gabaar antagonist bicuculline  all post synaptic currents disappeared .

in the presence of  <dig> micromolar concentration of bumetanide, a specific inhibitor of the nkcc <dig> cotransporter, cells with more positive values of egaba than usual for neocortical neurons displayed a negative shift in egaba. this negative shift in egaba was observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> of albino visual cortex neurons and  <dig> out of  <dig> neurons from pigmented animals . in line with this pharmacological effect, nkcc <dig> mrna was expressed in bumetanide-sensitive neurons, but not in bumetanide-insensitive ones. the calculated contribution of nkcc <dig> action to the reversal potential of gabaar-mediated postsynaptic currents for albino and pigmented rat visual cortex neurons is presented in figure 4b. thus our pharmacological tests confirmed the link between the observed inhibitory deficit in albino visual cortex on the electrophysiological level and mrna expression of the major chloride regulator responsible for chloride uptake in immature neural cells on the single cell molecular level.

in order to evaluate the impact of elevated intracellular chloride levels in albino visual cortex neurons on cortical network properties we conducted gramicidin perforated patch clamp analysis of both albino and pigmented layer v visual cortex neurons without blocking of excitation during physiological recordings. we found that the reversal potential of postsynaptic currents  significantly differ between albino and pigmented animals, being shifted into the depolarizing direction in albinos . one should keep in mind, however, that the observed difference may result from variable inhibitory and/or excitatory inputs to characterized cells. surprisingly, minimal interspike intervals were significantly longer in albinos than in pigmented :  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  ms vs.  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  ms. oscillations within and across neuronal systems are believed to serve various complex functions, such as perception, cognition, movement initiation, plasticity and memory. gabaergic mechanisms play a major role in these oscillatory patterns. therefore, the increase in minimal interspike intervals in albino neuron may indicate a reduced possibility for high frequency neuronal coding in albino visual cortex networks. previous findings of barmashenko et al. <cit>  showed that albino rat visual cortex neurons also demonstrate a significantly lower rheobase  and a smaller chronaxy  compared to pigmented animals. these data strengthen the hypothesis of a severe inhibitory deficit in albino visual cortex.

CONCLUSIONS
in sum, our findings suggest that blocking of nkcc <dig> in albino visual cortex neurons will bring their chloride homeostasis to the pigmented brain level. this could improve processing in visual cortex and therefore might be beneficial for vision in albinos. so far this speculation is without supporting data and the role of nkcc <dig> in neuronal excitability seems controversial  <cit>  and blocking nkcc <dig> in neurons without blocking in glia is not practical. in addition caution is advisable because bumetanide therapy may be controversial for retinal processing where many cell types express functional nkcc <dig> and their egaba is either known or predicted to be positive to resting membrane potential  <cit>  for normal function.
