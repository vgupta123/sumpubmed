BACKGROUND
a major goal of molecular medicine is to replace or repair a dysfunctional gene in the context of its natural position in the chromosome. a number of avenues of investigation are being taken including those that utilize short oligonucleotides to direct the single base changes. triplex-helix forming oligonucleotides conjugated to reactive chemical groups and those constructed as bifunctional oligonucleotides continue to show promise in model systems  <cit> . most of the effort however, centers on the use of modified or unmodified single-stranded dna oligonucleotides  ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bases. the original concept for using ssodns came from studies in yeast in the 1980s that were pioneered by sherman and colleagues  and adapted to episomal targets in mammalian cells by campbell et al.  <dig>  gamper et al.  <cit>  and liu et al.  <cit>  then re-established single-stranded vectors as potential agents for the alteration of chromosomal sequences in eukaryotes.

the mechanism by which oligonucleotides-directed gene repair takes place is still being elucidated. one lab has proposed that transcription-coupled repair alone can account for base exchange or correction  <cit> . but, the majority of workers believe that dna replication and dna repair activities comprise the major pathway of gene repair. this concept was originally proposed by brachman and kmiec  <cit> , subsequently extended by parekh-olmedo et al.  <cit> , and now has been supported by data generated by numerous laboratories  <cit> . this model suggests that actively replicating genomes are more amenable to the hybridization of the ssodns at the target site because the chromatin is in a more open configuration and the target sequence more accessible. the use of agents such as hydroxyurea  <cit> , ddc  <cit> , or thymidine  <cit>  that retard the process of dna replication enable higher levels of gene repair activity by expanding the window of time within which the ssodn can locate its target site.

the role of replication in the gene repair reaction, however, has recently been met with a paradoxical series of events. the initialization of the gene repair reaction results in a plethora of problems for the cell and its metabolism because an atm-dependent dna damage response pathway is activated by the transfer of the ssodn  <cit> , confirming earlier observations by liu . activated atm signals the induction of the checkpoint regulator proteins chk <dig> and chk <dig>  which in turn direct cell cycle arrest predominantly in corrected cells. this result provided an explanation for the important observations of olsen et al.  <cit>  that the percentage of corrected cells in a population of treated cells decreases as a function of time, presumably because the uncorrected population continues to proliferate while the corrected cells are arrested. if this phenomenon is applicable to primary cells, then the use of gene repair for treating inherited diseases will suffer a severe setback. the goal of this work was to devise an experimental protocol to avert the dilution of corrected cells in a population of treated cells.

as mentioned, the addition of thymidine to cells being targeted for gene repair enhances the frequency with which single base exchange takes place  <cit>  by synchronizing cells at the g1/s border   <cit>  followed by their release into s phase en masse, which provides an increased number of accessible targets for repair. in addition to the increase level of gene repair observed after a thymidine treatment, we show that the agent is able to stabilize the correction frequency over several days, perhaps by inhibiting the replication of the entire cell population and preventing a dilution effect on the corrected cells. we also reveal a novel observation that long-term exposure to thymidine results in the reversion of dld- <dig> cells into cellular senescence and that this can be avoided by the removal of the drug prior to this point. based on this work and earlier observations, thymidine is an attractive reagent for downstream clinical applications due to its ability to elevate and maintain substantial levels of gene repair without inducing severe toxicity in vitro.

RESULTS
a mutant egfp gene, containing a stop codon in the region encoding the chromophore domain of the protein, was integrated in dld- <dig> cells and a clonal isolate consisting of 2– <dig> copies of the mutated gene was isolated and used as the target for oligonucleotide-directed gene repair  <cit> . a single-strand oligonucleotide  consisting of  <dig> bases with three phosphorothioate linkages on each end, designed to hybridize to the nontranscribed strand of the egfp gene, was used to reverse the mutation ,. as previously reported, correction resulting in the restoration of green fluorescence expression can be assessed by flow cytometry analyses at various times following ssodn introduction  <cit> .

a variety of reagents have been tested with the aim of elevating the frequency of gene repair in mammalian cells. among these are drugs that induce double-stranded dna breaks  and chemicals that form reversible adducts within the helix  <cit> . in most cases, dna damage results in a slowing of the cell cycle and an expanded s phase and so, reagents that simply reduce the rate of dna replication without causing double strand breaks have also been found to improve the efficiency of gene repair  <cit> . these agents are able to increase correction efficiency by expanding the window of time within which the ssodn gains access to the target site  <cit> . thus, our testable prediction is that a reagent such as thymidine, which increases the cellular levels of dttp via a depletion of dctp, resulting in a reduction in the rate of dna replication  <cit> , will increase gene repair activity.

pre-incubation with thymidine elevates gene repair by increasing the number of cellular targets amenable for correction
thymidine was added at various concentrations to the dld- <dig> mutant egfp cell cultures  <dig> hours prior to the introduction of the ssodn  and correction levels were determined  <dig> hours after electroporation by flow cytometry . the results show a maximal response at concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> mm thymidine, with a significant increase of about  <dig> fold from the non-treated sample. the decrease in correction efficiency as seen at higher concentrations of thymidine  is most likely due to the enhanced thymidine cytotoxicity reported previously in dld- <dig> cells due to their mutation in msh <dig>  <cit> . although these results differ from the observation of wu et al.  <cit> , who stated that the incubation of thymidine prior to the introduction of the oligonucleotide actually lowered gene repair in hela cells containing > <dig> copies of the target gene, our results are consistent with other reports that a thymidine pre-treatment is able to elevate gene repair several fold over basal levels.

it is widely known that the addition of thymidine to a mammalian cell culture leads to a synchronization of cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle or at the g1/s border  <cit> . when cells are released from the thymidine block, a large fraction of the population proceeds into s phase, resulting in an increase of ideal cellular targets for ssodn site association and thus, gene repair activity appears maximized  <cit> . as shown in figure 2a, the addition of  <dig> mm thymidine restructures the cell cycle profile such that the majority of cells are primarily stalled in g <dig>  minimally in s phase, and with only a small fraction in g <dig> . by  <dig> hours after the release of the thymidine block, the cells begin to transition into s phase , while the non-treated samples remain predominantly at the same cell cycle proportions from the time of oligo addition to  <dig> hours following electroporation . at  <dig> hours, a majority of the cells released from the thymidine treatment contain actively replicating chromosomes , as assayed by brdu incorporation. under these conditions, the number of actively replicating cells is almost twice as high as the level seen in cells that have not been pretreated with thymidine , an observation that could reflect the increased number of cells in s phase. thus, the addition of thymidine and its subsequent removal stimulates gene repair activity by enabling more cells to be in s phase when the ssodn initializes the gene repair reaction.

thymidine is able to stimulate and maintain substantial levels of gene repair
after observing the increase in gene repair levels at  <dig> hours following a  <dig> hour thymidine pre-treatment, we wanted to examine if this increase remains stable over time, beyond the  <dig> hour incubation. for this study, we repeated the experiment outlined in figure  <dig> using a single concentration of thymidine  during the pre-incubation phase and measured correction levels at  <dig> and  <dig> hours after ssodn electroporation. although the initial stimulation is seen at  <dig> hours post electroporation, figure  <dig> illustrates an important phenomenon in which the absolute level of correction decreases with time, corroborating the initial finding reported by olsen et al.  <cit> . as shown, a statistically significant decrease in repair levels is seen between the  <dig> and  <dig> hour time points  for both the pretreated  and untreated  samples. it has been suggested previously by our group that this lack of maintenance of the correction efficiency is due to the induction of the dna damage response pathway and its subsequent activation of the checkpoint proteins chk <dig> and chk <dig>  hence, a "dilution" of the corrected cells is seen as the non-corrected cell population proliferates at normal rates while the corrected cells appear stalled  <cit> .

based on this observation, we wanted to examine the idea of controlling replication of the entire cell population as a means of preventing the decrease of correction levels over time. our reasoning behind this was to transiently inhibit the replication and division of non-corrected cells until the corrected cells were able to resume normal replication. accordingly, we wanted to utilize thymidine and its ability to stall cell replication as a tool to slow down the entire cell culture, in hopes of maintaining the high initial levels of correction for extended periods of time. to address this aim, we treated the cells with  <dig> mm thymidine for  <dig> hours prior to the introduction of the 47-mer egfp3s/47nt and then divided the samples into three distinct groups. the first group of cells was grown in the absence of thymidine for either  <dig> or  <dig> hours  while the second group was grown for  <dig> or  <dig> hours in the presence of  <dig> mm thymidine . the last group was grown in thymidine for only  <dig> or  <dig> hours after electroporation , at which point the thymidine was washed out  and the incubation continued for a total of  <dig> hours in complete medium. the combination of a  <dig> mm pre- and a  <dig> mm post-treatment was optimized to produce first an initial increase in repair frequency followed by a sustained level of this with minimal cytotoxicity, data not shown. when no thymidine was present in the post-electroporation cultures, the correction efficiency decreased significantly between the  <dig> and  <dig> hour time points, coinciding with the data in figure  <dig>  in contrast, when  <dig> mm thymidine was added to the cultures following electroporation, the correction efficiency was largely maintained between  <dig> and  <dig> hours at levels significantly above those for the non-treated samples at corresponding time points. in a similar fashion, by removing thymidine after only a  <dig> or  <dig> hour incubation, correction efficiencies still remained significantly higher at  <dig> hours than with out any thymidine post-treatment. taken together, these data suggest that the presence of thymidine in the post-electroporation reaction results in a maintained level of gene repair for an extended period of time.

thymidine addition induces cell senescence in dld- <dig> cells under certain reaction conditions
after extended culturing in the presence of thymidine, we noticed morphological changes within our cultures that resembled a senescent phenotype, including flattened cell morphology with elongated cellular processes and enlarged nuclei  <cit> . to confirm these cellular changes, cultures were stained for senescence associated β-galactosidase  expression  <cit> . in figure 5a, representative fields of cells treated with thymidine under two different conditions are shown at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after introduction of the ssodn. no evidence of senescence is observed in the  <dig> or  <dig> hour cultures under either condition . however, cells pretreated with  <dig> mm thymidine and incubated in  <dig> mm thymidine after electroporation  develop a senescent phenotype within  <dig> hours, as evident by the presence of blue stain in approximately 50% of these cells. in figure 5b , multiple images obtained at the  <dig> hours under the 1– <dig> mm thymidine condition are presented, further highlighting the positive sa β-gal expression. the left-hand panels, showing cell morphology, were photographed under phase contrast while the panels on the right, aimed to enhance the blue color, were photographed with bright field illumination. here, the evidence for certain reaction conditions inducing cellular senescence is more compelling and this transition to a senescent phenotype could further explain the maintenance of gene correction over  <dig> hours with the 1– <dig> mm thymidine treatment combination. in contrast, figure  <dig> presents cells incubated for  <dig> hours with thymidine having been washed out at  <dig> or  <dig> hours, post-electroporation. here, we observe a minimal number of senescent cells at the  <dig> hour wash-out  but a significant number is observed when the thymidine is washed out at  <dig> hours , suggesting that the transition to wide-spread senescence most likely occurs shortly after this point. furthermore, it is important to note that corrected cells are neither apoptotic nor senescent , suggesting that the transition to the apoptotic state is simply as a result of the thymidine incubation. in addition, prolonged treatments with thymidine did not show evidence of cell death, as determined by a mtt - <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell viability assay in which the level of production of the purple formazan remained unchanged during the incubation .

prolonged incubation with thymidine leads to a slow-down in dna replication and cell division
as shown in figure 2a, the exogenous addition of thymidine to a dld- <dig> cell culture results in an accumulation of cells in g <dig> or at the g1/s border. in effect, thymidine reduces the overall rate of dna replication in a population of cells by synchronizing them into g <dig> and preventing their entry into s phase. thus, the presence of thymidine in a gene repair reaction could simply be maintaining the relative percentages of corrected and non-corrected cells between  <dig> and  <dig> hours by inhibiting the replication of the entire cell population and there by, preventing the dilution of the corrected cells. to examine this possibility, we measured the capacity of cells to incorporate brdu, which would indicate the percent of cells undergoing active replication at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours. when the population was pretreated with thymidine for  <dig> hours followed by a removal of the thymidine at the time of electroporation , replication activity remained fairly constant overtime. in contrast, when the pretreatment was followed by sustained incubation in thymidine following electroporation , replication activity dropped dramatically and little incorporation of brdu was evident. thus, it seems likely that the maintained correction efficiency seen between  <dig> and  <dig> hours under the latter condition  is due to an overall inhibition of dna replication and in part by the entry into cellular senescence, as seen in figure  <dig>  however, when thymidine was washed out at  <dig> or  <dig> hours , and cells allowed to resume growth in complete medium, dna replication resumed, reaching approximately half the normal level of activity by  <dig> hours of incubation. more importantly, this washout protocol preserved high levels of correction efficiency between  <dig> and  <dig> hours . therefore, the presence of thymidine during the early times of the gene repair reaction appears to help maintain correction levels without irreversibly disabling the capacity of the cell to resume dna replication.

in order to confirm these results and to evaluate the potential residual effects if thymidine on the cell cycle following the wash-out protocol, we utilized an assay to determine division rates of cells. pkh <dig>  a fluorescent cell label that binds irreversibly within the lipid region of cell membranes, was used to determine rate and extent of cell proliferation following the removal of the thymidine post electroporation. as cells divide following intercalation of the dye, each resulting daughter cell receives half of the fluorescent dye during subsequent rounds of cell division  <cit> . thus, by using flow cytometric analysis to measure the change in fluorescence intensity of pkh <dig>  we are able to estimate the number of divisions a cell population has undergone within a given period. at time zero , or at the time of electroporation following a  <dig> mm thymidine pre-treatment, cells were labeled with pkh <dig> and the starting mean fluorescence intensity  was found to be  <dig>  . at  <dig> hours following staining, cells that received no thymidine in the post treatment  displayed a shift in their mean fluorescence intensity to  <dig> , corresponding to two cellular divisions, and again at the  <dig> hour point , indicating an additional three cell divisions . in contrast, with thymidine in the post treatment for  <dig> hours , there was an insignificant change in the mean fluorescent intensity, indicating that no cell division had occurred. following the removal of thymidine at  <dig> hours, the cells underwent  <dig>  cell divisions by  <dig> hours , as determined by the change in the mean fluorescence intensity from  <dig> hours. thus, it seems as if washing out thymidine at  <dig> hours can enable cell division to resume at a rate nearly that of the 1- <dig> mm counterpart. combined with the brdu data, a case can be made that the maintenance of correction efficiency is accompanied by dna replication and normal cell division processes following the removal of thymidine.

discussion
drury and kmiec  <cit>  demonstrated the importance of target association in the gene repair reaction and suggested that the rate-limiting step is the pairing of the ssodn to the genomic site. thus, we assume that strategies aimed at increasing correction levels might be facilitated by events that enable more efficient oligonucleotide binding. several agents have been employed to achieve this goal including trichostatin a , which is a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor  <cit> . when added to cell cultures following ssodn delivery, tsa was able to increase gene repair up to 10-fold, most likely by altering the chromosome structure and enabling oligonucleotide binding  <cit> . slowing down the process of dna replication by extending s phase or synchronizing cells in s is another way to enhance the frequency of gene repair  <cit> .

our current work focused on examining this second manipulation in greater detail by studying more carefully the function of s phase in gene repair. during this phase of the cell cycle, chromatin is in a more open conformation, accessible to proteins/dna complexes that undergo a search for homology and interact at specific sites within the genome. in this study, we confirm that incubating cells with thymidine leads to elevated gene repair levels by synchronizing the cells along the g1/s border and enhancing the total number of amenable targets when, after release, the cells cycle into s phase in the presence of the oligonucleotide  <cit> . we also show that the inherent loss of gene correction with time  <cit>  can be counterbalanced by inhibiting the replication of the entire cell population, and preventing the "dilution" of the repaired population of cells by the unimpeded non-corrected cell population. lastly, we present a novel finding that shows that the long term effect of thymidine treatment can result in the induction of cellular senescence.

treatment with thymidine leads to an increased level of cellular dttp, ultimately resulting in a feedback inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. subsequently, cells are starved of dctp, due to the allosteric inhibition of the reduction of cdp  <cit> , resulting in a slowing of dna replication and an accumulation of cells that traverse s phase  or cycling through s within the first  <dig> hours following electroporation. upon removal of thymidine, cells were able to once again replicate at high levels further indicating the increased number of cells in s phase. thus, our data indicate that elevated levels of correction are mostly due to an increase of cellular targets in s phase, whose open chromatin structures facilitate ssodn association and ultimately gene repair events.

these results on the importance of s phase in the ssodn-coupled repair differs from the conclusions drawn in wu et al.  <cit>  that increasing the proportion of cells in s phase does not enhance repair levels. our data contrast these observations by identifying s phase as the critical cell cycle stage in which gene repair occurs. we find that the highest overall gene repair was evident at  <dig> hours following the ssodn introduction, for both  <dig> mm thymidine pre-treated and non-treated cells . in addition, the maximal value occurred following the  <dig> mm thymidine pre-treatment, coinciding with the highest percent of cells in s phase at  <dig> hours. when cells were pre-treated with thymidine and then sustained in thymidine for  <dig> hrs following ssodn electroporation, gene repair decreased to only  <dig> % by this time point, concurrent with an altered cell cycle profile in which a lower percent of cells were in s phase and a higher percent remained at g <dig> or in early s . however, when thymidine was simply added after ssodn introduction , gene repair levels and cell cycle profiles remained remarkably unchanged, as compared to the non-treated non-synchronized cells. thus, our results support the aforementioned observation that highlights the importance of s phase in the gene repair reaction. what is interesting to note, however, is the fact that although the gene repair is lower when thymidine is used in both the pre- and post-treatment, its repair level remains constant from  <dig> to  <dig> hours while a decrease is observed when thymidine is removed following the addition of the ssodn. ultimately, this change in repair frequency results in the appearance of higher levels of gene repair following a 1– <dig> mm thymidine treatment than a 1- <dig> mm at  <dig> hours following ssodn introduction .

recently, it was reported that the repair frequency decreases as a function of recovery time following ssodn introduction, and this lack of maintenance of the repair frequency is due to the selective recovery and proliferation of non-corrected cells  <cit> . although it is unclear whether the corrected cells are arrested in late s phase  <cit>  or at the g2/m border  <cit> , it is apparent that the single-stranded dna oligonucleotide activates a damage response pathway through the upregulation and autophosphorylation of atm  <cit> . this activation, in turn, leads to a phosphorylation of the downstream checkpoint kinases, chk <dig> and chk <dig> at ser <dig> and/or ser  <dig> and at thr <dig>  respectively  <cit> . due to the induction of the damage response and the specificity of the chk <dig> and chk <dig> activation within the corrected cells, these cells are preferentially stalled in the cell cycle and do not divide. in contrast, the non-corrected cells do not uniformly contain activated chk1/chk <dig> and thus, no halt of cellular replication is observed  <cit> . because of this lingering cell cycle block, the overall correction frequency appears to decrease as the non-corrected cells resume normal replication while the vast majority of corrected cells become arrested. in contrast to our system in which correction efficiency is measured among a background of non-corrected cells, protocols that utilize selection to isolate corrected cells, in effect, exclude all other cells from the population, only allowing corrected non-arrested cells to continue to grow. because of this, non-corrected cells are not able to out compete and over grow the corrected cells, and thus, a decrease in gene repair is not evident  <cit> . in a more biologically relevant target, in which there is no such selective pressure, however, it is imperative to accommodate and respond to the varying replicative abilities of both the non-corrected and corrected cell populations.

in this report, we establish a protocol that utilizes a thymidine treatment following the introduction of the oligonucleotide, allowing for a population wide reduction in dna replication activity, regardless of correction state of the individual cells. the post-treatment led to a decrease in cell replication by an average of nearly  <dig> fold at each time point and as a result, correction levels remained constant. this observation was also true for cells not pre-treated with  <dig> mm thymidine prior to oligonucleotide electroporation . in addition, removing the thymidine following ssodn electroporation at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours allowed for the maintenance of substantial levels of correction up to  <dig> hours. the wash-out of the thymidine treatment was accompanied by the resumption of cellular replication and a normal division rate. this implies that thymidine can be used to slow the replication of the entire cell culture temporarily in order to preserve a high level of gene correction.

in contrast, treating the cells with  <dig> mm thymidine for  <dig> hours resulted in the population entering into cellular senescence, as determined by a physiological change in cell morphology and a positive staining for sa β-galactosidase. interestingly, the development of senescence was time-dependent as removal of thymidine at  <dig> hours, but not  <dig> hours, in an assay lasting  <dig> hours showed a minimal number of senescent cells, indicating that there is a window of time in which the transition between survival and senescence is determined.

normal cells can revert to a state of replicative senescence within several days, when exposed to certain physiological stress factors . in addition, hydroxyurea , which depletes cells of dntps and rapidly shuts down cell replication  <cit> , has been shown to induce senescence following a long treatment  <cit> . not only could the entry into senescence after a prolonged treatment with thymidine be due to the cellular stress following an imbalance of ribonucleotide reductase, but also due to activation of other pathways that lead to cell senescence. excess thymidine in the cell has been shown to activate an atm-mediated protein kinase cascade which is followed by an atr-mediated response; both of which are required for cell survival following the treatment  <cit> . the response is believed to emanate from an alteration in the chromatin state  <cit>  or the formation of an altered dna structure, known as a "chicken foot," following genome-wide stalling of replication forks  <cit> , which p <dig> is able to recognize and bind to  <cit> . both structures can activate atm and along with a prolonged p <dig> induction, has been shown to mediate the onset of a senescent phenotype  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
thus, based on these data, it is clear that the maintenance of gene conversion levels resulting in a  <dig> hour thymidine treatment may be due to the overall stalling in cell replication and an eventual entry into the senescent state. on the contrary, the wash out protocol at  <dig> hours was able to prevent this senescence transition followed by a reversal of the cell replication and division effects, and thus, may be a useful tool to increase and sustain high levels of gene repair.
