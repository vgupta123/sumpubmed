BACKGROUND
pioneering research of robert koch in the guinea pigs  laid the foundation of microbiology and popularized this animal model for the study of various infectious diseases
 <cit> . since then, guinea pig has proven to be an indispensable tool in studying a range of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis  , anthrax , diphtheria , legionellosis , sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia infection , syphilis  etc.
 <cit> . these studies showed that guinea pigs bear substantial similarity to humans with respect to thymic and bone marrow physiology, innate immune responses, complement system, lung physiology, corticosteroid response, requirement of exogenous source of vitamin c and delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to infections
 <cit> . due to these features, guinea pigs emerged as one of the best models for testing bio-defense agents and vaccines and for toxicological studies
 <cit> . however, despite the tremendous contribution of this animal to medical research, the paucity of immunological reagents and molecular tools and the lack of fully annotated guinea pig genome sequence has severely hampered a holistic analysis of host responses in this model. unlike the mouse model, gene deletion technology  and trans-gene expression is also unavailable in case of guinea pigs. thus, considering the biological relevance of guinea pig model in a large number of infectious diseases, the importance of developing a comprehensive guinea pig microarray cannot be over emphasized. recently, tree and colleagues developed an oligonucleotide microarray comprising of  <dig> genes to study the host response to bcg vaccination in guinea pigs, however, despite its usefulness in immune response studies, it has limited applications due to a small number of genes in the array
 <cit> . in this study, we have overcome this limitation by extending the cross-species hybridization technique to a number of mammalian species such as human, mouse, rat, macaque, horse, cat, sheep, pig, chinchilla, chimpanzee, gray tailed opussum and cattle in order to expand the number of features and have developed a  <dig> k guinea pig oligonucleotide microarray . further, to validate the array, the transcriptome of guinea pig lungs was analysed post - m. tuberculosis infection. global gene expression profiling in this study not only facilitated the analysis of immunologically relevant genes but also helped in describing the transcriptional signature of pulmonary granulomas in guinea pigs represented by several key genes and commensurate pathways that are modulated in response to m. tuberculosis infection.

RESULTS
microarray design and annotation
for gene expression profiling of species that lack genome sequence and/or representative microarray platforms, cross-species hybridization based microarray has conventionally been used. since, fully annotated guinea pig genome sequence is not available, we employed cross-species hybridization technology to develop a  <dig> k microarray platform to study gene expression profile in guinea pigs. as described in the additional file
 <dig> and supporting table s <dig>  initially a  <dig> k microarray was designed to contain  <dig> mer oligonucleotide probes from multiple mammalian species  based on all the probe sequences available from agilent catalogue arrays and ncbi mrna sequences. especially, the array included  <dig> probes based on annotated gene sequences of guinea pig and  <dig>  probes corresponding to guinea pig ests. the  <dig> k array was then hybridized with cy <dig> labeled crna produced from pooled rna obtained from various guinea pig tissues  and cy <dig> labeled genomic dna isolated from guinea pig spleen tissue. following hybridization, the array was scanned and features were extracted. the filtration criteria during the probe selection, while developing microarray by cross-species hybridization technology on agilent platform, are based on comparison of specific signal intensity viz. the background signal intensity. probes exhibiting significantly higher signal intensity , at least  <dig> fold higher as compared to the background are selected for array development. based on this criterion, a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  probes representing different mammalian genes were selected from the  <dig> k array. similarly, a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  probes were selected for ests. however, irrespective of the intensities, all the  <dig>  probes for guinea pig were included. further, an additional of  <dig>  best probes out of  <dig>  newly added guinea pig est’s from ncbi database were added to the  <dig> k array . thus, the final design of the guinea pig  <dig> k microarray comprised of a total number of  <dig>  features including  <dig>  valid features from different mammalian species ,  <dig>  probes for guinea pig transcripts and  <dig>  probes for guinea pig ests,  <dig>  agilent positive controls and  <dig> agilent negative controls. agilent positive and negative controls are standard set of probes employed by the agilent microarray platform for mammalian microarray studies. the negative control probes are intended to have no hybridization and these are used by feature extraction software for background determination. the positive controls are used to have predictable signals, which are used for monitoring the microarray linearity, sensitivity and accuracy. based on the above-mentioned method for probe selection, many genes are represented by multiple but unique probes derived from different mammalian species. use of multiple unique probes per transcript in general increases the confidence of microarray result. the averaging of the signals from multiple probes provides improved statistical confidence, reducing the impact of inconsistent probe behavior and improving the signal to noise ratio compared to the platforms that offer fewer probes per gene. for biological interpretation, homolog gene ontology annotation was also obtained for all the probes by blast-based homology to reference sequence database of human, mouse and rat for which validated methods for biological pathway analysis are available.

bacillary load and granulomatous pathology in the lungs of m. tuberculosis infected guinea pigs
for gene expression analysis, rna was isolated from lung tissues obtained from guinea pigs at  <dig> weeks following infection with ~ <dig> tubercle bacilli. cfu analysis of guinea pig lungs at this time point revealed the presence of ~ <dig>  log <dig> tubercle bacilli/g of tissue. moreover, infected guinea pigs exhibited severe pathological damage in lungs characterized by numerous large caseating granulomas encompassing central necrosis with occasional coalescence of multiple tubercles . in addition, extensive areas of irregular thick bands of fibrous collagen deposition were observed around the granulomas . hence, the gene expression in this phase of infection represents a transcription signature of advanced progressive tb disease.

gene expression profiling of pulmonary tuberculosis in guinea pigs by employing gpom
we next compared the pulmonary gene expression profile of infected and uninfected guinea pigs by employing the gpom developed in this study. as depicted in additional file
 <dig>  clustered heat maps were obtained for all the genes on the  <dig> k gpom in case of infected guinea pigs compared to uninfected control. since, a small perturbation in the gene expression may considerably influence the biological response, a small difference in the fold change in gene expression are also relevant. hence, genes exhibiting ≥ <dig>  fold difference in gene expression with a statistical significance of p <  <dig>  were considered as differentially regulated. the rationale behind the selection of the cutoff for considerable fold difference while comparing the gene expression is based on standard practice in microarray data analysis
 <cit> .

based on this, several unique genes were identified that exhibited a significant regulation in response to infection. while,  <dig> unique genes exhibited a marked up regulation,  <dig> genes were significantly down regulated in the lungs of infected guinea pigs as compared to the lungs of uninfected animals as depicted by a heat map in figure
 <dig>  the genes exhibiting significant regulation are listed in additional file
 <dig> 

differentially regulated genes were further classified in to different categories based on their direct or indirect involvement in various biological processes or pathways. based on this categorization, a significant alteration was observed in the expression of several important genes related to metabolic pathways, cell signaling, immune response and other miscellaneous functions . some of the key pathways are listed in tables
 <dig> 
 <dig> and
 <dig> 

pathway analysis revealed that more than  <dig> genes that were differentially regulated in infected samples as compared to the uninfected control samples were associated with general metabolism . in particular, several key genes  involved in oxidative phosphorylation , purine and pyrimidine metabolism , amino acid metabolism , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid metabolism , fatty acid  and arachidonic acid metabolism , pentose phosphate pathway , tca cycle  and ether metabolism  were significantly regulated in response to infection .

among the cell signaling pathways, the most profound modulation was observed in the mapk signaling pathway with perturbation of  <dig> genes . in addition, the expression of several key genes related to wnt , calcium , neurotrophin , insulin , tgfβ , erbb , jak-stat , ppar , vegf , hedgehog , p <dig> , notch  and phosphatidylinositol signaling systems  were also affected . characteristically, majority of the genes related to mapk, wnt and calcium signaling pathways exhibited a marked down regulation .

among the immune response related genes, a significant alteration was observed in the expression of several key genes associated with chemokine signaling pathway , cell adhesion molecules  , cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction , leukocyte trans-endothelial migration , natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity , t cell receptor signaling  and b cell receptor signaling  . in addition, profound modulation was observed in genes associated with the antigen processing and presentation , hematopoietic cell lineage  and complement and coagulation cascades  . a marked regulation was also observed in the signaling pathways related to tgf-β , toll-like receptor , fc epsilon ri , adipocytokine , nod-like receptor , rig-i-like receptor , mtor  and intestinal immune network for iga production  .

validation of microarray results by real time rt-pcr
for the validation of  <dig> k gpom,  <dig> genes were selected based on the following criteria:  differential regulation,  immunological relevance and  availability of cdna sequence in the ncbi database. expression of these genes was analyzed on the same rna samples, which were used for the microarray study by semi- quantitative real time rt-pcr by employing sybr green pcr master mix  with 18s as the internal control. the primer sequences of c3ar <dig>  camp, ccl <dig>  ifnγ, c4bpa and 18s rrna genes were designed using the guinea pig gene specific cdna sequences available in the public database  based on the recommended guidelines for designing real time pcr primers  single amplicon specificity by analysis of dissociation curves and  consistently high amplification efficiency by analysis of calibration curve. for analysis of real time pcr data ΔΔct method was employed
 <cit> . consistent with our microarray results, wherein several probes corresponding to c3ar <dig>  camp, ccl <dig> and ifnγ exhibited a down regulation along with up regulation of c4bpa, real time pcr results also matched the microarray expression profile .

discussion
guinea pig model has made tremendous contribution towards the understanding of several infectious and non-infectious human diseases
 <cit> . moreover, in case of tb, guinea pig has emerged as the most preferred and biologically relevant model to investigate tb pathogenesis and therapy
 <cit> . the success of m. tuberculosis as an intracellular pathogen is primarily attributable to its ability to reside in human lungs inside hypoxic granulomas in a dormant stage for years or even decades. however, the conventional mouse model for tb does not form hypoxic granulomas, which serve as the primary host defense mechanism for the containment of infection and is the central feature of tb pathogenesis in humans. thus, due to its ability to produce hypoxic granulomas guinea pig as a surrogate model fulfills an important niche in the field of tb. however, the lack of a fully annotated genome sequence remains a major impediment towards the realization of full potential of guinea pig as an animal model. moreover, till date not even a single study has investigated the genome-wide transcriptional response associated with m. tuberculosis infection in guinea pigs. thus, development of a microarray platform to understand the host responses in guinea pigs is a critical step towards harnessing the true potential of this model.

in the present study, by employing cross-species hybridization technique, we have developed an oligonucleotide microarray with  <dig>  features assembled from different mammalian species, which to the best of our knowledge is the first attempt to employ microarray to study global gene expression profile in guinea pigs. in order to demonstrate the utility of this microarray and to gain insight into the host responses, we have carried out the expression profile of guinea pig lungs at  <dig> weeks post-infection with m. tuberculosis. at this stage of infection, guinea pigs exhibit advanced stage of tb disease with multiple coalescing granulomas along with caseation and liquefaction necrosis in the lungs
 <cit> . hence, the gene expression profile observed in this study represents a transcriptional signature of advanced progressive tb disease in guinea pigs.

in our study, the pulmonary transcriptional profiling of m. tuberculosis infected guinea pigs revealed a significant regulation of  <dig> unique targets. while,  <dig> unique genes exhibited a marked up regulation,  <dig> genes were significantly down regulated. differentially regulated genes were further classified into different categories based on their direct or indirect involvement in various biological processes or pathways. a massive re-alignment of metabolic pathways, mostly associated with catabolism, emerged as one of the interesting themes from this analysis. although, altered metabolic functions of the host have earlier been reported in human subjects and in laboratory animals in response to febrile infections involving wasting of body tissues
 <cit> , most studies have been restricted to biochemical and in silico analysis and have not looked beyond immune mechanisms in order to probe the underlying cause of pathology and active disease in case of tb
 <cit> . only recently, mi-jeong and colleagues reported a correlation between caseation of human tb granulomas with elevated host lipid metabolism in these infected tissues by microarray
 <cit> . extensive necrosis observed in the pulmonary granulomas in our study as well as a marked up regulation of several of these lipid homeostasis related genes, such as, abhd <dig>  abhd <dig>  acsl <dig>  acsl <dig>  cyp27a <dig>  cyp2b18a, cyp26b <dig>  cyp2f <dig>  cyp2a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  cyp11a <dig>  cyp2d <dig>  cyp2f <dig>  fdps, hadha and lpl correspond well with the observations associated with human caseous granulomas
 <cit> . on comparing the entire list of up and down regulated genes from our guinea pig study with that obtained from human tb granuloma study 
 <cit> , we observed that 38% of the up regulated genes of guinea pig  exhibited an overlap with the genes up regulated in humans . further, on comparing the microarray data available in the public database for tb infection in case of humans 
 <cit> , mouse 
 <cit>  and non-human primates 
 <cit> , while, the non-human primates and humans exhibited a 19% overlap between up regulated genes, the overlap between mouse and humans was 18% . the guinea pig model is known for its close similarity to humans in terms of pathological response to m. tuberculosis infection
 <cit> . our observations indicate that guinea pigs also exhibit higher resemblance to humans in terms of transcriptional response to m. tuberculosis infection, which further validates it as an excellent animal model to study tb. hence, findings of this study would have a direct implication towards the development of novel therapeutic interventions. besides, it would also permit the development and validation of biomarkers for effective vaccines and drugs in guinea pig model. 

induction of catabolic processes with consequential atp accumulation has recently been shown to provide an interface between metabolism and host defense to infection
 <cit> . atp molecules generated in response to injury to airway epithelial cells have been reported to be a critical determinant of cell migration and repair following the injury and have been shown to be associated with the activation of down-stream signaling cascades and induction of il-1β through the interaction of atp with purinergic receptors
 <cit> . a few in vitro studies have also indicated the role of atp mediated macrophage apoptosis in killing of m. tuberculosis <cit> . a concurrent up regulation in the expression of oxidative phosphorylation related genes , purinergic receptors and il-1β in this study to the best of our knowledge, provides the first in vivo evidence for the involvement of these pathways in tb. further, the lungs of the infected guinea pigs also exhibited a marked perturbation in the expression of several key genes associated with chemokine signaling , cell adhesion molecules   and cytokine and cytokine receptors , which are known to contribute to leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, inflammation and granulomatous pathology.

perturbation in the cellular signaling pathways is another typical theme that emerged from our study. the most prominent observation relates to the repression of numerous genes related to mapk, wnt and calcium signaling pathways. these observations are consistent with previous studies, which have suggested that modulation of mapk signaling pathway along with the reduction in the levels of intracellular calcium are some of the important means by which, m. tuberculosis represses phagosome - lysosome maturation and pro-inflammatory responses at the site of infection
 <cit> . mapk signaling is known to be crucial for the anti-bacterial response of the host and it also represents a strategic target for bacterial subversion tactics
 <cit> . thus, dampening of the mapk signaling has emerged as a key to achieve alteration in the antibacterial phenotype of macrophages. recently, wnt signaling pathway has been implicated in the generation of long-lived multi-potent memory t cells and in the modulation of inflammatory response of macrophages to m. tuberculosis infection
 <cit> , thus repression of wnt signaling pathway observed in this study suggests a possible mechanism by which, m. tuberculosis inhibits effective t cell memory response.

another key observation from this study relates to the modulation of several key genes involved in the re-modeling of extracellular matrix such as, col6a <dig>  col14a <dig>  col12a <dig>  mmp <dig>  timp <dig>  serping <dig>  serpinb <dig>  adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  mmp <dig>  pitrm <dig>  serpina3n, serpinb <dig>  serpine <dig>  serpinh <dig> and cndp <dig>  these observations are in agreement with the previous studies, which have implicated these genes in dual events associated with tissue remodeling as well as tissue damaging
 <cit> . the presence of extensive necrosis along with thick bands of collagen observed in the guinea pig pulmonary granulomas indicates that the balance is heavily tipped in the favor of tissue damaging events. increased expression of the complement receptor cr <dig> and numerous key genes involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation as observed in this study further substantiates that the pathogen exploits the normally effective defense system to its advantage by subverting or co-opting these pathways as has been also reported earlier
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports for the first time the development of a  <dig> k oligonucleotide microarray for guinea pigs and provides an important tool to capture the genome wide transcriptional changes in this model. the transcriptional profiling of m. tuberculosis infected guinea pig lungs not only revealed modulation of key immunologically relevant genes but also demonstrated involvement of novel metabolic and signaling pathways in tb pathogenesis. moreover, in silico analysis revealed a higher resemblance of guinea pigs to humans in terms of transcriptional response to m. tuberculosis infection when compared to mouse and non-human primates. development of the  <dig> k gpom is thus, a critical step towards characterization of the guinea pig model, which will greatly aid in improving our understanding of host responses to a number of infectious diseases. we believe that optimal use of guinea pig model and further research on its biology would generate tremendous opportunity to understand host-pathogen interaction and thus, help in the development of new therapeutic intervention strategies.
