BACKGROUND
cellular responses to environmental cues are mediated through activation of the signal transduction machinery. this machinery is best represented as a complex network that, in turn, governs the decision-making capabilities of the cell  <cit> . engagement of a cell surface receptor induces activation of signal transduction cascades that involve a series of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. these phosphorylation-dependent signaling events eventually transduce signal to transcription factors , with the latter then modulating expression levels of the downstream genes  <cit> . the cellular response thus elicited is a consequence of this alteration in the gene expression profile. information processing is an integral part of signal transmission wherein calibration of both quantitative and qualitative features of the signal is facilitated by the many regulatory elements, or motifs, that are distributed across the signal transduction and transcription regulatory networks  <cit> . these regulatory elements constitute emergent features of the corresponding networks and they play a critical role in ensuring that the cellular phenotypic response is contextually derived from the nature of the inducing stimulus  <cit> .

several studies have at least partially delineated the emergent features of the signaling network that are generated in response to engagement of a variety of cell surface receptors  <cit> . similarly, topological alterations in the transcription regulatory network that are generated under specific conditions of cell activation have also been mapped  <cit> . however, a more global perspective that rationalizes how these two networks integrate to ensure context-specificity of the cellular response is presently lacking. an understanding at this level, however, is critical for eventual resolution of the mechanisms that underlie cell fate decisions, as well as those that lead to aberrations in cellular behavior  <cit> .

in the present study we adopted a systems biology approach to address this question. for this we took the murine b-lymphoma cell line ch <dig> as the model system. these cells are a prototype of the transitional stage of immature b cells and previous studies have shown that stimulation of these cells through the b-cell antigen receptor  leads to late g <dig> arrest, which is then followed by apoptosis  <cit> . this response to bcr activation is also reminiscent of that seen for immature b cells in vivo, and contributes towards the elimination of self-reactive cells from the peripheral b-cell repertoire  <cit> . it was therefore of interest to delineate the regulatory network involved in transmission of receptor-activated signals, to eventually enforce the cell cycle arrest response.

a combination of experimental with in silico approaches enabled us to map the network of pathways emanating from the bcr, and leading up to the induction of genes responsible for the g <dig> arrest. a detailed analysis of the time-dependent phosphorylation of several signaling intermediates revealed that bcr-engagement resulted in only a partial and transient activation of the signaling network. a direct consequence of this was a weak perturbation of the transcription regulatory network, which in turn led to the expression of only those genes that were involved in the cell death pathway. these latter findings were facilitated through a large-scale survey of tfs for their sensitivities to bcr-activation, and by a microarray analysis of the gene expression profile in stimulated cells followed by experimental verification of the functional roles of the early induced genes. interestingly, our subsequent experiments revealed that integration between the signaling and the transcription regulatory networks was controlled by the map kinase signaling intermediate p <dig>  this control was enforced through a receptor-associated phosphatase and involved the feedback regulation of lyn, the kinase that initiates signaling from the bcr. it was this feedback control exercised at the level of signal initiation that then eventually resulted in the expression of genes causing cell cycle arrest. an incorporation of these observations into a mathematical model provided further insights into how changes in the basal activation state of the early intermediates defines sensitivity of the signaling machinery to a given cell surface receptor. thus, our studies also reveal the etiology of cell type-specific responses to a given stimulus.

methods
cell culture, stimulation and detection of phosphoproteins
the experimental conditions employed in this study were first established in standardization experiments involving both different doses of anti-igm, and variations in the stimulation times. a saturating effect on g <dig> arrest of ch <dig> cells was seen at an anti-igm concentration of between 3- <dig> μg/ml, with no additional effect also when the stimulation time was extended beyond  <dig> h. consequently, stimulation of ch <dig> cells for  <dig> h with a final anti-igm concentration of  <dig> μg/ml was taken as the optimal condition for our study. consequently, ch <dig> cells were maintained at a density of  <dig>  x <dig> cells/ml in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1x penicillin/streptomycin. they were stimulated with the f <dig> fragment of rabbit anti-mouse igm  in rpmi for a period of up to  <dig> hr. at appropriate times thereafter, aliquots of cells were collected, centrifuged, and the cell pellets stored in liquid nitrogen. just prior to electrophoresis, cells were lysed in lysis buffer  followed by removal of the nuclear material and other debris through centrifugation. the detergent-soluble proteins were then resolved by sds-page. specific proteins and phosphoproteins  were detected by western blot using appropriate antibodies. for this, lysates were resolved by sds-page and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . the membrane was incubated in odyssey blocking buffer for  <dig> h with gentle shaking at 37°c. the blocking buffer was replaced with an appropriate dilution of primary antibody in odyssey buffer with 10% pbs and incubation was continued at 4°c over night with gentle shaking. thereafter, the blots were washed thrice with pbst for  <dig> min each. after washing, the blots were incubated with infrared dye labeled secondary antibodies  at 37°c for  <dig> h. blots were scanned using odyssey scanner using an  <dig> nm laser, and band intensities were determined by using odyssey software. minimum intensity surrounding the bands on the film was taken as its background and subtracted to give the true intensity. all blots were re-probed for gapdh as loading controls. intensities were normalized against the intensities of gapdh molecule.

co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis
lysates were prepared from between 2- <dig> ×  <dig> cells in a buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mm egta, 1% triton x- <dig>  and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail . the clarified supernatant was quantified for protein concentration by the bradford assay . for immunoprecipitation,  <dig> mg of total protein in  <dig> μl of lysis buffer was incubated with  <dig> μl of sepharose 4b  for  <dig> h at 4°c. the pre-cleared lysate was then incubated with  <dig> μg of the antibody overnight at 4°c, followed by  <dig> μl of protein a-agarose beads for  <dig> h at 4°c. after five washings in lysis buffer, the beads were boiled in laemmli buffer, and the proteins were separated by sds-page. further steps for western blot analyses were as described above.

in-vitro phosphatase assay
this was done essentially as described earlier, using para-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate  <cit> . that comparable amounts of the phosphatase shp- <dig> were present in samples from the individual groups was again ensured through western blot analyses on parallel sets of immunoprecipitates.

cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry
cells were plated in the wells of a 96-well plate and stimulated with anti-igm for  <dig> h after which the cells were washed and replaced with fresh medium without anti-igm. at  <dig> h after initiation of stimulation, the cells were harvested and stained with propidium iodide for analysis by flow cytometry. the extent of cell cycle arrest was determined by measuring the relative proportion of cells in the g0/g <dig>  versus the s and g2/m phases in each of the experimental groups.

sirna-mediated suppression of bcr-induced genes
all the specific sirnas were procured from qiagen. hiperfect  was used for transfection of cells with the sirnas  strictly following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. in initial standardization experiments, the silencing obtained was between  <dig> and 95% at  <dig> h after transfection, as detected by rt-pcr. the list of catalog numbers and source of sirnas used is provided in additional file 1: supplemental table s <dig>  for all of the experiments described here, a parallel control set was always included wherein cells were treated with sirna specific for gfp . after  <dig> hr of sirna transfection cells were stimulated for  <dig> h and at the <dig> h time point they were harvested and stained with propidium iodide for acquisition and subsequent cell cycle analysis . in experiments involving the use of specific inhibitors, these inhibitors were added to cells at  <dig> min prior to stimulation. at the end of the  <dig> h stimulation period with anti-igm, however, these inhibitors were also washed out and no fresh inhibitor was added for the remainder of the experiment.

rna isolation and realtime-pcr
total rna was isolated with trizol  and digested with rnase free dnase i prior to the reverse transcription reaction. estimation of relative transcript levels by real time pcr was obtained as a commercial service from labindia life sciences . the assay and analysis were performed as previously described  <cit> . also refer additional file  <dig> for detailed methods.

confocal microscopy
staining protocol
staining was performed as described  <cit> . to examine co-localization between p <dig> and shp- <dig>  ch <dig> cells  seeded on glass coverslip coated with celltak  were stimulated with anti-igm for 5'min. cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in pbs for  <dig> min at room temperature followed by quenching with  <dig> mm ammonium chloride for  <dig> min. fixed cells were permeabilized by incubating with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in pbs for  <dig> minutes followed by blocking  for  <dig> hours. cells were incubated for 1-hour with respective primary antibodies . this was followed by three washes with pbst and incubation with respective secondary antibodies ). all cover slips were mounted on slides with antifade .

image capturing
stained cells were observed with a nikon te 2000e laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with 60x/ <dig>  na planapochromat dic objective lens. alexa flour  <dig> and  <dig> were excited at  <dig> and  <dig> nm with an argon ion and he-neon laser respectively. the emissions were recorded through emission filter set 515/30; 605/ <dig>  serial confocal sections  within a z-stack spanning a total thickness of 10- <dig> μm were taken in individual green and red channels using the motor drive focusing system. images were acquired, with a scanning mode format of  <dig> ×  <dig> pixels. the transmission and detector gains were set to achieve best signal to noise ratios and the laser powers were tuned to limit bleaching of fluorescence. the refractive index of the immersion oil used was  <dig>  . all settings were rigorously maintained for all experiments.

image analysis
all images were quantified using image-pro® plus version  <dig> , a commercially available software package from media cybernetics.

the merged confocal images were subjected to co-localization analysis to determine the "pearson coefficient" proposed by  <cit> .

where s1i is signal intensity of the ith pixels in channel 1; s1avg is the average intensity of all pixels in channel 1; s2i is signal intensity of the ith pixels in channel 2; s2avg is the average intensity of all pixels in channel  <dig> 

about  <dig> cells were analyzed in  <dig> sets of slides for the co-localization studies. all the images are in the tiff rgb  <dig> format. to reduce the unwanted background noise generated by the photomultiplier signal amplification, all the image stacks were treated with two-dimensional filters .

protein/dna arrays
aliquots of either unstimulated cells, or cells stimulated with anti-igm for the indicated times, were collected, centrifuged, and nuclear extracts were prepared as prescribed by the manufacturer.  <dig> μg of each nuclear extract was separately incubated with the biotinylated probe mix from the array kit for  <dig> min at 15°c. this mix contains oligonucleotides representing the consensus binding sites for  <dig> tfs. at the end of this incubation period, probes bound to transcription factors present in the nuclear extract were isolated by column chromatography, and these bound probes were then dissociated from the respective transcription factors by using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. these samples were then hybridized  with the panomics protein-dna spin combo array kit  membranes, which contains an array of oligonucleotide sequences that are complementary to those of the tf binding sites in the probe mix . the array was then washed, blocked, incubated with steptavidin-hrp, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminesence. the blot was imaged using a phosphoimager  and spot intensities were quantified using imagequant tl. the quantified spots values were normalized against the average value of all the controls spotted on the border of membrane. array experiment results from samples that were stimulated with anti-igm were directly compared to the unstimulated control blot and spots that had increased by greater than 2-fold in the stimulation experiments were scored as positive for activation. all transcription factor array experiments were done in duplicate and only those tfs that were activated in both experiments were scored as positive for activation. values for individual spot intensities are provided in additional file 1: supplemental table s <dig>  whereas the raw images of the blots are shown in additional file 1: supplemental fig. s3

identification of overrepresented transcription factor binding site for the set of early induced genes
the transfac® database was used for our analysis and the commercial license for the same was obtained from biobase. we employed the match algorithm to identify the overrepresented transcription factor binding site in our gene of interests. tfbs was scanned for  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig> bp downstream for the gene of interest. the gene sequence was for mouse was downloaded from genome browser http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hggateway?hgsid=145319238&clade=mammal&org=mouse&db=mm <dig> 

RESULTS
bcr-dependent signaling arrests cycling of ch <dig> cells
the murine b lymphoma ch <dig> cells express surface antigen receptors  of the igm class. transient stimulation of cell through these receptors with anti-igm antibodies for  <dig> h resulted in an arrest of these cells in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. this arrest could be detected at  <dig> hr, with consequent apoptosis of the cells at the later time points . further, as expected  <cit> , this g <dig> phase arrest was also characterized by an increase in intracellular levels of the p <dig> protein . this protein inhibits the cell cycle-regulatory kinases cdk4/ <dig> and cdk <dig> in a stoichiometric manner, thereby attenuating their ability to promote g <dig> to s phase transition  <cit> . thus ch <dig> cells mimic primary immature b cells insofar as their response to bcr cross-linking and, therefore, provide a good model for studying antigen-induced clonal deletion of transitional stage b-lymphocytes  <cit> .

we next examined the early signaling events activated by this receptor. for this cells were stimulated with anti-igm and the time-dependent phosphorylation profiles of a panel of twenty signaling intermediates were examined by western blot analyses. these signaling intermediates were selected on the basis that they collectively represented a diverse set of known canonical signaling pathways . however, of the twenty molecules examined, we could observe bcr-dependent phosphorylation for only fourteen intermediates, with no significant effects being evident for the remaining six molecules . the remaining fourteen molecules were phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner by anti-igm, although the individual profiles varied significantly . this is evident from the quantified representations shown in figure 1b. thus stimulation of cells with anti-igm resulted in vigorous phosphorylation of the members of the map kinase  family erk-1/ <dig>  and jnk and, to a slightly lesser extent, also raf- <dig> and mek-1/ <dig>  . bcr-dependent phosphorylation, but with distinct kinetics and amplitude was also observed for akt, pkcδ, p <dig>  lyn, and camkii . particularly surprisingly, however, was that stimulation elicited only a nominal phosphorylation response from the remaining intermediates, with molecules such as syk, bad, gsk3β, plcγ pkcδ and pka achieving peak levels that were less than 2-fold above their respective basal values . thus, even this limited examination of a small panel of signaling intermediates highlights the sparse character of the bcr signaling network - with only a few signaling pathways being activated - in ch <dig> cells.

bcr-dependent stimulation of ch <dig> cells induces the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes
we had previously examined induction of the early response genes in ch <dig> cells following stimulation with anti-igm for  <dig> h  <cit> . a microarray analysis had identified that  <dig> genes were reproducibly upregulated to levels that were >2-fold above their basal value, whereas four genes were significantly downregulated  <cit> . an ingenuity pathway analysis using these twenty-three genes as the seed nodes yielded a top network, containing activities related to cell death and cancer, that incorporated  <dig> of these genes  . the canonical pathways affected by the nodes of this network are shown in figure 1d. it is interesting to note that, in addition to the p <dig> pathway, the prominent pathways identified here were those that induced either cell death , or anti-proliferative responses . for the sake of simplicity however we subsequently concentrated on only those eleven genes from this subset, whose expression levels were upregulated on stimulation of cells with anti-igm . the cellular functions attributed to the products of these genes include regulation of cell proliferation , regulation/repression of transcription , inhibition of signal transduction , and regulation of apoptosis/cell death .

bcr-dependent regulation of transcription factor activities
the modulation of gene expression effected by signals emanating from a cell surface receptor is mediated through the regulation of transcription factor activities. therefore, we next probed for the effects of anti-igm stimulation on the activation of transcription factors . for these experiments we employed a commercial array in which oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sites of  <dig> transcription factors were spotted. this array, therefore, enabled us to simultaneously assay the activation of a large subset of tfs.

given that  <dig> h stimulation was sufficient to eventually induce g <dig> arrest, we measured the extent of tf activation in cells that were stimulated with anti-igm for either  <dig> or  <dig> min and the representative blots thus obtained are shown in figure 2a. a quantitative analysis of the intensities of the spots for each tf under the various conditions then yielded an anti-igm-specific activation profile for the individual tfs. for our analysis, however, we only considered those tfs that were affected by >2-fold from their basal value to be either activated or inactivated in a bcr-dependent manner. consistent with relatively poor activation of the signaling machinery observed earlier, anti-igm-mediated stimulation also resulted in a weak perturbation of the tf network. thus, of the  <dig> tfs examined activities of  <dig> remained unaffected, whereas that of  <dig> was suppressed. further, although the remaining  <dig> tfs were activated by anti-igm they - however - showed delayed kinetics with activation being detected only at  <dig> min of stimulation, . examples of these included nfkb <dig>  fosl <dig>  ptfb <dig>  nf <dig>  and trp <dig>  in contrast, tf inactivation was relatively more rapid and was detectable by  <dig> min of stimulation in most cases. examples of this latter group were gata <dig>  pax <dig>  sp <dig>  ep <dig>  cmyb, nfatc <dig>  and mzf <dig> . the list of molecules shown in figure 2b along with their corresponding human entrez gene ids is given in additional file  <dig> 

the activation profiles for a representative subset of the transcription factors probed here could be independently verified in western blot experiments that monitored their increase in the nuclear compartment . however, there were some minor differences that could be observed in the tf activation pattern in the case of p-p <dig> and cmyc . overall this validation supports that the results in figure  <dig> indeed identify the bcr-sensitive tfs in ch <dig> cells. further, at least some of these tfs may be expected to be involved in driving the arrest of actively cycling cells in the g <dig> phase.

defining the key transcriptional regulators that enforce the cellular response
our cumulative experiments so far helped to describe at least some of the signaling events activated by the bcr, as well as their downstream effects on tf activation, and the consequent gene expression. it was, therefore, of interest to synthesize these data to generate a more integrated perspective on the bcr-regulated arrest of cycling ch <dig> cells. to do this we combined our experimental results with an in silico approach as illustrated in figure 3a. our goal here was to extract the regulatory network that could be implicated in this process.

as the first step, we sought to identify those tfs that could be involved in regulating the set of early-induced genes described in figure 1c. for this we employed the match software to scan for tf binding sites that were over-represented in the promoter regions  of each of the eleven early-induced genes. in addition, we also surveyed the literature for tfs that have been experimentally demonstrated to regulate expression of these target genes. results from both approaches were then combined to yield a list of sixteen tfs for these eleven genes . from this list we next selected those tfs that were also either activated or suppressed by anti-igm in figure  <dig>  this exercise resulted in the further short-listing of seven of these tfs. importantly, the identification of several of these was also supported by experimental evidence in the literature demonstrating their roles in regulating expression of at least some of the target genes . linking these seven tfs to the target genes then yielded a dense overlapping regulatory  network as shown in figure 3b. such a dor network represents a typical regulatory module that is expected for the regulation of multiple genes by a common set of tfs  <cit> .

of the seven tfs described in figure 3b, tbp, nfkb <dig>  trp <dig>  and fosl <dig> were all activated upon stimulation of cells with anti-igm . of these tbp is a component of the general transcription factor tfiid  <cit> , while both nfkb <dig> and trp <dig> are known regulators of gene expression  <cit> . finally, fosl <dig> is an oncogene product with a role in tumor formation  <cit> . activity of the remaining three tfs - mzf <dig>  sp <dig>  and nfatc <dig> - was, however, suppressed in response to bcr stimulation. here mzf <dig> is known for its regulation of apoptosis  <cit> , whereas naftc <dig> and sp <dig> can both act as repressors of gene expression in specific instances  <cit> . thus the bcr-dependent activation profile of these seven tfs appears to be consistent with the induced expression of the early response genes through the links described in figure 3b.

construction of an in silico network that links bcr-signaling to gene expression
to extract the network of pathways linking bcr activation to the cellular response, we first merged the bind <cit> , dip <cit> , intact  <cit> , mint  <cit> , human protein reference database  <cit>  and protein-protein interaction database  <cit>  ppi databases to generate a compilation of all known reported ppis. eliminating those interactions that lacked experimental support from at least two independent studies then refined the resulting network. this resulted in a core undirected network of about  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. here the cd79α and cd79β subunits associated with the bcr  <cit>  were taken together and considered as a single bcr complex.

shortest path analysis of networks is generally considered to represent a reliable method for capturing information on the transduction of signals through the various intermediate nodes  <cit> . further, our experiments in figure 1b had also helped to distinguish at least some of the signaling intermediates that were either significantly activated, or ignored, upon bcr stimulation of cells. therefore, starting from the bcr, we next traced all the possible shortest paths leading to each human ortholog of the signaling intermediate that was shown to be activated in figure 1b. here, we considered a signaling intermediate to be activated only if its phosphorylation levels were increased by at least 2-fold in response to anti-igm stimulation. this filtration exercise short-listed raf <dig>  erk-1/ <dig>  mek-1/ <dig>  p <dig>  jnk, camkii, lyn and akt <dig> as the target nodes, and all the resulting shortest paths originating from the bcr to each of these intermediates were merged to create a sub-network.

in order to complete the above network we again employed the shortest path algorithm to next trace the various possible shortest paths from each of the activated signaling intermediates to the set of seven short-listed tfs described in figure 3b. these paths were then merged to yield the shortest path network from the signaling intermediates to the tfs.

in the final step we merged the three sub-networks comprising of the links between the bcr and the signaling intermediates, the signaling intermediates and the tfs, and the dor between the tfs and the target genes described in figure 3b. this synthesis generated an information-centric network that captured the pathways mediating bcr-dependent cell cycle arrest of ch <dig> cells. the resulting network was comprised of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges and is depicted in figure  <dig>  here,  <dig> of the constituent nodes  are transcription factors whereas  <dig>  are signaling molecules. it is pertinent to note here that the network shown in figure 3c is distinct from the more conventional protein-protein interaction , or, gene-regulatory networks in that it represents a hybrid of both approaches. thus while the links from the bcr through the signaling intermediates and to the tfs essentially constitute a ppi network, the downstream component incorporating links from tfs to the target genes - however - describes a set of protein-to-gene interactions.

extracting the gene expression signature of the cellular response
our next goal then was to delineate the core pathways or modules in the network described in figure 3c, that specifically regulated the cellular phenotypic response. to do this, however, it was first necessary to identify those bcr-dependent genes described in figure 3b, that were responsible for enforcing g <dig> arrest of cycling ch <dig> cells. here, we took advantage of our earlier studies in which we had determined the early bcr-dependent gene expression profile in a <dig> cells. while these latter cells also represent a murine b-lymphoma line these, however, are derived from mature b-cells and are characterized by the memory phenotype  <cit> . further, bcr-stimulation of these cells  had no effect either on their survival, or on their ability to complete the individual stages of the cell cycle  <cit> .

interestingly, four of the upregulated genes  described in figure 3b were also found to be induced in a <dig> cells that had been stimulated through the bcr for  <dig> h  <cit>  . this suggested to us that the products of these four genes were unlikely to contribute towards the g <dig> arrest of ch <dig> cells. as a result, the list of possible mediators of the bcr-dependent ch <dig> cellular response could be reduced to the seven genes that remained . to evaluate the possible relevance of members of this latter group, we resorted to a functional approach that involved sirna-mediated silencing. that is we employed target-specific sirna to silence the bcr-dependent expression of each of these seven genes, and examined for the consequences on the cell cycle arrest response . figure 4a shows that silencing of each of these genes resulted in a partial inhibition of the anti-igm-induced arrest of cycling ch <dig> cells. as opposed to this, silencing expression of either cd <dig> or tnfα - bcr-dependent genes that are induced in both a <dig> and ch <dig> cells - had no such effect . these results, therefore, support that the effects of bcr stimulation on cycling ch <dig> cells is, at least in part, mediated through the collective effects - either additive or cooperative - of the seven target genes short-listed above . thus, in other words, induced expression of these target genes likely represents the signature of the anti-igm-mediated response of cell cycle arrest in ch <dig> cells.

it is pertinent to note here that our inferred role for these seven target genes as contributors towards cell cycle arrest is also consistent with their known functions in the literature. thus, zfp <dig> has recently been described to mediate as an inhibitor of g <dig> to s progression in pro-b cells  <cit> , whereas either anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic roles have been described for both dusp <dig> and axud <dig>  <cit> . the product of the rgs <dig> gene has been shown to function as a negative regulator of g-protein coupled receptor signaling and, therefore, has been implicated in inducing apoptosis  <cit> . in a similar vein, atf <dig> is a known repressor of transcription and is involved in regulation of apoptosis in several cellular systems  <cit> , while ddit <dig> causes g <dig> arrest under cellular stress conditions through binding with cdk <dig>  <cit> . cd <dig> is also alternatively known as programmed cell death ligand- <dig>  and its receptor pd- <dig> functions as an immunoinhibitory receptor that is primarily expressed on b-lymphocytes, t-lymphocytes and myeloid cells  <cit> . the effects of pd- <dig> engagement by pd-l <dig> have primarily been studied in t cells where inhibition of proliferation has been observed  <cit> . interestingly, an analysis of the gene expression profile in unstimulated ch <dig> cells revealed that pd- <dig> was also constitutively expressed in these cells . this raises the likelihood that the anti-igm-induced expression of pd-l <dig> may initiate intercellular interactions where pd-l <dig> engages and, therefore, activates the constitutively expressed pd- <dig> on the neighboring cell.

resolving the response-specific bcr-dependent cell regulatory network
having defined the gene expression signature for inducing cell cycle arrest in stimulated ch <dig> cells, we next wanted to describe the sub-network of signaling pathways that mediated the regulation of these genes. to do this we adopted an approach in which perturbations were introduced in the bcr-dependent signaling network through the selective inhibition of several of the constituent nodes. the consequences of this inhibition on the anti-igm induced cellular response were then monitored. node-specific inhibition was achieved by the use of pharmacological inhibitors and these, along with their kinase-specificity are listed in figure 4b. experiments in which ch <dig> cells were stimulated with anti-igm in the presence of each of these inhibitors revealed that only kn <dig> and sb <dig> - highly specific inhibitors of camkii and p <dig> mapk respectively  <cit>  - were able to reverse the block in cell cycle progression to any significant extent . in contrast addition either of wortmannin, rottlerin, or u <dig> led to an increase in cell death even in the absence of any stimulation, whereas none of the remaining inhibitors had any effect on the anti-igm-dependent g <dig> arrest .

since kn <dig> and sb <dig> were both able to inhibit the effects of anti-igm, we also examined for their effects on igm-dependent gene expression. ch <dig> cells were stimulated either in the presence or absence of these inhibitors and the consequent expression of the seven cell cycle-regulatory genes short-listed from figure 3b was determined by quantitative rt-pcr . the results obtained are summarized in figure 4d. as shown, both pharmacological agents inhibited bcr-dependent induction of all seven genes although the effects of sb <dig> were significantly more potent than that of kn <dig> . the inhibitory effect of kn <dig> ranged from modest  to significant, whereas that of sb <dig> ranged from one that was near quantitative  to a marked repression to below basal levels  . thus the ability of the camkii inhibitor kn <dig>  and that of the p <dig> inhibitor sb <dig> to prevent bcr-dependent cell cycle arrest correlates with their ability to also block expression of the genes that presumably drive this response. interestingly, although sb <dig> was more potent than kn <dig> at inhibiting anti-igm-specific gene expression , both compounds were - nonetheless - similarly effective at inhibiting the cell cycle arrest response . this may suggest a relatively high threshold of vulnerability for the products of these genes, with the magnitude of the reduction in their levels achieved by kn <dig> being sufficient to neutralize their effects on the cell cycle. consequently then, the greater potency of sb <dig> - at the level of gene expression - would not necessarily translate into a greater inhibition of the effects of anti-igm on the cell cycle.

dissection of the perturbations induced by kn <dig> and sb <dig> on the bcr-signaling network
since we had two separate inhibitors that similarly suppressed the effects of anti-igm stimulation, it became possible to use these to dissect the core pathways involved. ch <dig> cells were stimulated with anti-igm either in the presence or absence of either sb <dig> or kn <dig>  and the effects on time-dependent phosphorylation of the fourteen bcr-sensitive signaling intermediates  was monitored . the resulting normalized and quantified profiles obtained are shown in figure 5a.

interestingly, although highly specific for p <dig>  <cit> , the addition of sb <dig> led to a significant inhibition in bcr-dependent phosphorylation of all the signaling intermediates examined . the only exception here was camkii where the inhibitory effect was marginal . a similar effect of a near global inhibition of bcr-dependent signaling was also observed in response kn <dig> addition . in this case, however, phosphorylation of p <dig> was also inhibited . that is, while inhibition of camkii also led to attenuation of p <dig> phosphorylation the reverse was, however, not the case .

while a mechanistic explanation for these differential effects was not immediately obvious these latter results, nonetheless, suggested that the effects of camkii inhibition may also be mediated through the consequent inhibition of p <dig> activation. here it must be emphasized that both kn <dig> and sb <dig> are reported as highly specific inhibitors of camkii and p <dig> activity thus excluding the possibility of off-target effects that might arise  <cit> .

the perturbations in the bcr-signaling network induced by these two pharmacological inhibitors also resulted in profound effects at the level of the bcr-sensitive tfs. this is apparent from the heat map shown in figure 5b, which compares the fold change in activity of individual tfs at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes of stimulation with anti-igm either in the absence or presence of these inhibitors. the green and red maps represent a >2-fold repression and activation respectively, while the grey map is indicative of no change in activity. broadly speaking, it is evident that both the inhibitors employed significantly attenuate the effects of anti-igm, during either the enhancement or suppression of tf activities .

for our further analysis, we concentrated on examining the activation profiles of only those seven tfs that were short-listed in figure 3b. this was because our primary aim was to extract the pathways through which signal perturbation by kn <dig> and sb <dig> influenced the gene expression pattern observed in figure 4d. as shown in figure 5c, stimulation of cells with anti-igm led to repression in the activity of mzf <dig>  this inactivation, however, was inhibited in the presence of both kn <dig> and sb <dig> . similarly, the anti-igm induced inactivation of sp <dig> was also partly inhibited by sb <dig>  whereas this inactivation was delayed in the presence of kn <dig> . somewhat surprisingly, stimulation also resulted in a rapid reduction of the basal activity of nfatc <dig>  further, while inhibition of p <dig> had no significant effect on this process, the inclusion of kn <dig> lead to at least a delay in the kinetics of this inactivation . in contrast to these repressive effects, bcr-crosslinking also induced a delayed enhancement in the activities of fosl <dig>  tbp, nfkb <dig> and - to lesser extent - trp <dig> . however, inhibition of either camkii or p <dig> led to a near complete suppression of this activation in the case of fosl <dig>  tbp, nfkb <dig>  but not of that of trp <dig> . thus, in at least four of the seven cases, both inhibitors exerted comparable effects on their anti-igm-induced activation profiles. the reasons for the differences observed in the remaining three tfs are unclear at the present time. notwithstanding this however, the results in figure 5c permitted us to infer that the four similarly affected tfs - mzf <dig>  fosl <dig>  tbp, and nfkb <dig> - could at least partly rationalize the overlapping effects of these two inhibitors on anti-igm-stimulated cells, both at the level of gene expression and cell cycle arrest.

the p <dig> map kinase influences bcr signaling through a constitutively active feedback regulation of lyn
the results in figure 5a that inhibition of p <dig> led to a concomitant inhibition of nearly all the bcr-dependent signaling intermediates was particularly intriguing. importantly, this also included the protein tyrosine kinase lyn. the src kinase family member lyn represents one of the earliest kinases recruited by the bcr, the activation of which then ensures activation of the downstream signaling pathways  <cit> . consequently, suppression of lyn activation by p <dig> inhibition offered a simple explanation for the near global effect of sb <dig> on bcr-signaling. in other words, these results suggested the likely existence of a positive feedback regulatory loop where p <dig> also influences lyn activation. relevant to this was the finding in figure 5a that addition of sb <dig> induced a reduction in phospho-lyn levels even in the absence of any stimulation of cells with anti-igm. that is, p <dig> may constitutively interact with lyn even in the absence of bcr engagement.

to verify this we first tested the effects of a panel of pharmacological inhibitors, including sb <dig> and kn <dig>  on the basal phosphorylation of lyn in ch <dig> cells. as shown in figure 6a, none of these inhibitors had any significant effect on intracellular concentrations of the lyn protein. levels of its phosphorylated form were, however, markedly reduced in cells treated with sb <dig>  importantly, this effect on lyn phosphorylation was specific for sb <dig> with none of the other inhibitors tested, including kn <dig>  showing such an activity . thus, at least in ch <dig> cells, the ser/thr kinase p <dig> appears to regulate the basal activation status of the protein tyrosine kinase lyn.

we have previously shown that the phosphorylation state of lyn in b cells is governed by the activity of the bcr-associated protein tyrosine phosphatase  shp- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, studies from other groups have demonstrated that the activity of shp- <dig> can, in turn, be regulated through phosphorylation at specific ser/thr residues  <cit> . it, therefore, seemed plausible to us that p38-dependent modulation of basal phospho-lyn levels may represent an indirect effect that is mediated through shp- <dig>  that is, the enhanced basal levels of activated lyn could represent a consequence of attenuated shp- <dig> activity, which is enforced through its phosphorylation by p <dig>  the possibility of a direct interaction between p <dig> and shp- <dig> was supported by our initial results involving confocal microscopy, which revealed that at least a fraction of the molecules representing these two proteins were indeed co-localized in the proximity of the cell membrane . subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments established that this co-localized pool also included that subset of shp- <dig> that was constitutively associated with the bcr. thus, a western blot analysis of bcr immunoprecipitated from either unstimulated or anti-igm-stimulated ch <dig> cells also revealed the co-precipitation of both shp- <dig> and p <dig> . finally, we could further demonstrate that treatment of the bcr immunoprecipitate with the p <dig> inhibitor sb <dig> resulted in a significant increase in the associated phosphatase activity . these collective results, therefore, confirm that activity of the bcr-associated shp- <dig> was indeed under negative control of the co-associated p <dig>  this, in turn, provides a likely explanation for the increased levels of activated lyn detected in un-stimulated ch <dig> cells.

extracting the core cellular network that mediates bcr-dependent cell cycle arrest ch <dig> cells
our results so far had helped to characterize at least some of the intermediates that were involved during anti-igm induced signal transduction. in subsequent experiments, we were also able to define the key set of tfs that were responsible for translating the pattern of signaling events generated into the expression of those target genes that were, at least primarily, involved in driving the g <dig> phase arrest. having thus generated the molecular map of the network emanating from the bcr and extending up to the enforcement of the specific cellular response, we then also identified a feedback interaction between p <dig> and shp- <dig> that functioned, through the regulation of lyn activity, as a key regulatory motif of this network.

these cumulative results, therefore, allowed us to further refine the rather generic network map derived in figure 3c, and obtain a more precise description of the bcr-dependent regulatory network for g <dig> arrest in ch <dig> cells. by combining known experimental pathway information on b cell signaling, and the network derived through a shortest path analysis, we could generate the ch <dig> cell-specific signaling axis responsible for driving g <dig> arrest . further, we could also distinguish the individual stages based on the sequential steps of initiation, propagation, and integration of intracellular signal transduction cascades . the step of signal initiation is considered to represent the early events that occur upon receptor engagement, and this early upstream process regulates the downstream targets both qualitatively and quantitatively.

a mathematical model helps to define key regulators of system homeostasis and lyn activation
although we could successfully prove the role of p <dig> in regulation of lyn by acting on shp- <dig>  it did not address the issue of cell type specificity in determining cell fate decisions. it has been reported that levels of phospho-lyn and other intermediates are significantly higher in immature b cell compared to the mature counterpart cells  <cit> . we also observed this feature in our present study, when compared with our earlier studies involving mature b cells  <cit> . since we had sufficient information on both mature and immature counterparts regarding their basal status and the way they respond to the antigen we sought to build a mathematical model representing the fundamental differences in both of these cell types, in terms of the initiation of bcr signaling.

for this we built a model based on a system of ordinary differential equations to analyze lyn activation and it's down stream effect on syk activation. here, while the extent of bcr-dependent lyn activation by phosphorylation was treated as a measure of the strength of initial signal generated, the magnitude of syk activation would then define the efficiency of its transduction to the downstream intermediates  <cit> . the aim here was to identify the key parameter that might lead to weak activation of bcr-dependent signals in immature b cells, as opposed to that in mature b cells. more specifically, we wanted to determine whether the higher levels of basally active lyn in immature b cells could account for this difference. in our model, we also incorporated the role of shp- <dig> as a negative regulator of bcr signaling. it is now widely accepted that receptor-associated phosphatases function as key negative regulators that keep the system in steady state in the absence of an activating ligand. following engagement of the receptor, however, there is a transient decrease in the negative regulatory activity of this phosphatase, after which it again returns to its initial value  <cit> . thus, if lp denotes the concentration of activated lyn molecule; sm that of the syk molecule susceptible to activation by phosphorylation; and sp denotes the concentration of activated syk, the model - with the meaning of each parameter - can be written as follows:

  dlpdt=k1+k2lp−d1glp,dsmdt=a−k3smlp,dspdt=k3smlp−d2sp 

with initial conditions lp  ≥  <dig>  sm ≥  <dig>  sp ≥  <dig>  a is the total amount of syk molecule present in the cell susceptible to activation; k <dig> is the membrane associated lyn at basal level; k <dig> represents the rate at which activation of lyn take place after the binding of agonist to the membrane receptor; k <dig> is the rate at which syk is activated by the lyn; d <dig> and d <dig> represents the amount of negative regulator on the active forms of lyn and syk respectively at their ground state.

to take into account the particular nature of the negative regulator as discussed above we assumed,

 g=1−αsin2πtω 

here α is the forcing term representing the strength of the stimulation. at ground state α =  <dig> 

in unstimulated cells, there is an equilibrium maintained between the active and inactive state of the signaling molecules such as lyn and syk. however, it must be emphasized here that there are indeed multiple states of signaling intermediates  present in the real system due to multiple phosphorylation sites. but our focus here was to analyze the balance between the active and inactive forms of the species and their differential response to varying basal activity. therefore in the considered scenario, mathematically, at ground state i.e., α =  <dig>  we define the basal value of active-lyn  denoted by lp* as the value where,

 dlpdt= <dig> 

using the definition of lp* if we solve the equation  we get the value of lp* as given below ,

 lp*=k1d1−k <dig> 

thus our mathematical result suggests that, at ground state, the basal value is inversely related to the magnitude of the negative regulator acting on the activated lyn molecule.

we next simulated our model system   and the results for lyn and syk activation are shown in figure 7a and 7b. here, we calculated the value of lp* from the derived relation. we found that the influence of the negative regulator on lyn and syk activity produced two different basal states for them before the trigger point, which denotes bcr-dependent stimulation. but the interesting prediction from the model was that the sensitivity of either lyn or syk response to bcr-engagement was significantly higher when the basal activity of lyn was lower. this finding would be consistent with the experimental results obtained in the present study. to further delineate the effect of basal activity on receptor-induced signaling, we plotted different peak values with respect to different basal values for lyn and syk by varying the parameter for negative regulator. figure 7c shows the result of the simulation where an inverse relation between basal level of lyn activity, and the extent of its activation after bcr stimulation is clearly evident. to observe the effect of other parameters especially those acting on the active syk species we performed a similar analysis on syk. a similar qualitative behaviour with different slope values was again obtained . the results of our modeling analysis thus further substantiated our experimental results by highlighting the role played by the negative regulators of signal initiation, such as shp- <dig>  in determining the cell fate decision.

discussion
b-lymphocytes represent a good model system to study plasticity in receptor-activated signaling processes, and the consequent influence on the cellular phenotypic response. depending on their state of maturation, antigen encounter by the b-lymphocytes can lead to varied outcomes that range from activation and/or proliferation to anergy, or also to activation induced cell death  through apoptotic mechanisms  <cit> . in general, mature b-lymphocytes undergo activation followed by proliferation upon induction of bcr-dependent signaling by an antigen  <cit> . in contrast, engagement of the bcr induces aicd - preceded by an arrest of the cell cycle - in immature and transitional stage immature b cells  <cit> . this latter process serves to eliminate self-reactive b cells during its different stages of development  <cit> . various cell lines such as wehi- <dig>  ch <dig>  and b <dig> among others have been employed as models systems for the study of bcr signaling in immature b cells. in all of these cases, cell stimulation with a suitable surrogate antigen leads first to g <dig> cell cycle arrest, which is then followed by apoptosis  <cit> .

both the results presented here as well as those described in earlier studies confirm that ch <dig> cells represent yet another good model system for recapitulating bcr-driven responses in immature b cells. first, similar to immature and transition stage immature b cells, ch <dig> cells also express high levels of the igm class of the bcr, with little or no expression of those belonging to the igd class  <cit> . in immature b cells, bcr-activated cells fail to enter into the s phase and this effect can be reversed by treatment with il <dig>  <cit> . as we have previously shown, ch <dig> cells also exhibit similar properties  <cit> . bcr activation shows contrasting effects on p <dig> expression in mature versus immature b cells. mature b cells express high levels of p <dig>  which is then downregulated by antigenic stimulation  <cit> . the situation is reversed in the case of immature b cells where, while the basal levels of this protein are low, bcr engagement leads to rapid upregulation  <cit> . as shown in this study, ch <dig> cells also accurately recapitulate this latter situation. in transitional immature b cells, antigenic stimulation leads to a transient activation of the downstream signaling components including that of akt/pkb and those belonging to the map kinase pathway  <cit> . this feature was also evident in our present examination of bcr signaling in ch <dig> cells. finally, the greater extent of erk phosphorylation relative to that of jnk and p <dig> observed here was yet another property that is characteristic of antigen-stimulated immature b cells  <cit> . thus these comparisons collectively confirm the suitability of ch <dig> cells as a model for studying mechanisms regulating bcr-induced cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis in immature, transitional stage, b-lymphocytes.

an important aspect of our present study was the systems approach that we adopted, which integrated extensive experimentation with graph theoretical analysis and mathematical modeling. it was the synthesis of these diverse methodologies that enabled us to eventually obtain a comprehensive view on both the quantitative and qualitative features of the bcr-dependent signaling network. in addition it also facilitated a description of the consequent changes in the transcription regulatory machinery, and the downstream effects on changes in expression levels of those genes that eventually contributed towards enforcing a g <dig> phase-specific arrest of the cell cycle. of particular note here was our finding that the cellular response was, in all likelihood, a direct consequence of the selective and transient activation of the bcr signaling network. thus, of the twenty molecules examined, we were only able to observe bcr-dependent phosphorylation for fourteen, with no significant effects being evident for the remaining six molecules. this latter group included the adaptor molecules shc and blnk, the anti-apoptotic protein bcl <dig>  the nf-kb activating kinase ikka, and the cellular kinases pyk <dig> and pdpk <dig>  while the absence of phosphorylation of bcl <dig> and ikka may not be surprising in view of the pro-apoptotic response induced by anti-igm, that the adaptor molecules shc and blnk were also not phosphorylated was - however - particularly intriguing. at least in mature b cells, both of these scaffolding proteins play a key role in the assembly of bcr-dependent signaling complexes on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, and are important for fine-tuning bcr signaling to direct appropriate cell fates  <cit> . even in instances where the extent of anti-igm-induced phosphorylation was more significant, this was only transient in most cases with levels of the respective phospho-protein progressively declining after reaching their peak value. the weak perturbation of the transcription regulatory network, leading to a biased expression of those early response genes that were involved in the cell death pathways, was presumably a direct outcome of the sparse nature of the bcr signaling network in these cells.

we believe that successful extraction of the core bcr-dependent regulatory network that enforced cell cycle arrest in ch <dig> cells represents a key highlight of our study. its significance lies in the fact that this network encompasses pathways emanating from the bcr to the key signaling intermediates, and then also those extending from these intermediates to the tfs that were critical for inducing expression of the pro-apoptotic genes. this could be achieved by employing an in silico based network approach that combined the data on bcr-activated signaling events, with that on modulation of tf activities. further, this approach also enabled us to integrate the dor motif that linked these tfs to the effector genes. importantly here, the effector genes responsible for causing g <dig> arrest could first be identified through a comparison of the early gene expression profile between ch <dig> and mature b cells, and then functionally verified in experiments involving their selective depletion by sirna.

having delineated the core bcr-dependent molecular network that specified the g <dig> arrest, we could then test the effects of specific perturbations so as to identify the key signaling intermediates involved in driving this response. by using a panel of pharmacological inhibitors against different kinases, we localized p <dig> and camkii as the likely targets. such an inference could be derived from our observations that, of the inhibitors tested, only those specific for either of these kinases were capable of at least partially reversing anti-igm-induced g <dig> arrest of the cells. a subsequent examination of the expression profile of the effector gene subset revealed that p <dig> inhibition was more effective at inhibiting induction of these genes, thus identifying p <dig> as the central regulator of the anti-igm induced cell cycle arrest response.

CONCLUSIONS
interestingly, the mechanism by which p <dig> exerted such a prominent effect involved a novel feedback loop that controlled signal amplification at a level that was immediately proximal to the bcr. as we showed, p <dig> directly regulated activity of the bcr-associated phosphatase shp- <dig>  which in turn influenced the activity of lyn, the earliest intermediate involved in bcr signaling. thus, p <dig> mediated attenuation of shp- <dig> activity led to increased basal levels of lyn phosphorylation, thereby rendering it less sensitive to bcr activation. the selective and transient activation of the signaling network then was direct consequence of the dampening of the initiating signal from the bcr. this aspect could be further elaborated by the simple mathematical model that we developed to analyze the parameters involved in defining the strength of the initial signal generated. our model revealed a strong influence of the receptor proximal negative regulator , which generally balances against positive signals to ensure system homeostasis  <cit> . by using this model we could confirm that as the basal activation of lyn increased, due to reduced activity of shp- <dig>  the sensitivity of this kinase to the bcr also diminished. as a result, transmission of signal to the downstream intermediates was also negatively affected at least when measured at the level of syk activation.

at one level these latter findings served to rationalize the sparse character of the bcr signaling network in ch <dig> cells and, by extension, immature b-lymphocytes. in addition to this however, we believe that our revelation of the importance of the basal state of the signaling machinery in defining sensitivity, and thereby the cellular response, to the activation of cell surface also has important bearings from a broader point of view. thus, differences in the basal phosphorylation state of at least the early signaling intermediates could well explain how variations in the response to the same external stimulus are generated from cells that differ either at the level of tissue type, or activation state  <cit> .
