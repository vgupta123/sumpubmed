BACKGROUND
the number of publications reporting the mapping of qtls  in plants has exponentially increased since the eighties, reaching a total of about  <dig>  papers in  <dig> . for a few species only, this huge amount of qtl data has been recorded in databases that enable quick comparison of qtl mapping results from independent experiments . but for most species, qtl data accumulates in bibliography until the coming out of hot-spot genomic regions that become targets for introgression into breeding material or for cloning. to get a comprehensive understanding of the genetic control of a polygenic trait and to optimize its use in breeding, it is needed to get a complete view of the genetic architecture of the trait with the distribution of the involved loci along the genome. this synthesis can be greatly facilitated by achieving a qtl meta-analysis.

the general principle of a meta-analysis is to pool the results of several studies that address the same issue to improve the estimate of targeted parameters. meta-analysis was first used in social and medical sciences, like epidemiology. more recently, it was applied in plant genetics to combine on a single map the genetic marker data and the qtl characteristics  from independent qtl mapping experiments to finally estimate the optimal set of distinct consensus qtls, called meta-qtls. the positions of those meta-qtls are estimated with a higher accuracy as compared to the individual qtls in the original experiments  <cit> . to date, qtl meta-analyses have been achieved for traits related to plant development and plant response to environment  in maize, wheat, rice, rapeseed, cotton, soybean, cocoa and apricot  <cit> .

statistical methods have been proposed for the meta-analysis of qtls from several experiments. the method proposed by goffinet and gerber  was implemented in the biomercator software  <cit> . it compiles the qtls that have been projected on an existing reference map and uses the transformed akaike classification criterion to determine the best model between one qtl, two qtls, three qtls etc. until the maximum number of qtls mapped in the same region. this method was first used by chardon et al.  and by most authors until recently  <cit> . then veyrieras et al.  have extended the statistical method and implemented the new algorithms in the metaqtl software  <cit> . metaqtl notably uses a weighted least squares strategy to build the consensus map from the maps of individual studies and offers a new clustering approach based on a gaussian mixture model to define the optimal number of qtl clusters or meta-qtls on each chromosome that best explain the observed distribution of the individual projected qtls. the gaussian mixture model has shown to be flexible and robust to the non-independence of the experiments  <cit> . moreover, simulations demonstrated that the number of meta-qtls selected by the akaike criterion is lower than the expected number with random distributions of qtls and that it has a very low probability to happen by chance  <cit> . the metaqtl software has successfully been used in wheat, maize, rice and apricot  <cit> .

potato  late blight resistance is typically a trait for which meta-analysis can be applied. from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> studies have been published on qtl mapping in different crosses and with different related species, generating a significant amount of qtl data. all these publications reflect the interest of the potato scientific community towards polygenic partial resistance to late blight. late blight, caused by the oomycete phytophthora infestans, is one of the most serious diseases in potato, which is the third most important food crop in the world after rice and wheat. almost all rpi-genes  deployed in the potato fields have been rapidly overcome, while polygenic resistance appears to be a fairly efficient and durable alternative. however, it has been observed that this kind of resistance in potato is often associated with plant maturity, as most resistant plants are also the ones that mature the latest. this is a handicap for breeders and growers who aim to get early maturing plants to shorten the time of tuber production.

attempts to get a synthetic view of the loci controlling polygenic late blight resistance in potato with comparison of their positions with maturity qtls have already been published  <cit> . however, because of a lack of common markers, the comparison of qtls was achieved at a half-chromosome scale, which made the compilation imprecise. consequently, to enhance the comparison of qtl positions coming from different mapping studies and also to refine the localization of hot-spot genomic regions, the mapping of common markers between maps is crucial.

reference dense maps constructed with transferable markers are privileged sources of common markers. a uhd potato map containing  <dig>  aflp markers has been designed to become a reference map  <cit> . however, the anchorage of aflp markers is restricted to closely-related species. in addition, as the comparison is based on the comigration of the marker bands on the gel, aflp gels are required, which does not make the comparison easy to achieve  <cit> . other reference maps containing ssr and rflp markers have been developed in potato . these markers are well defined by specific primers or a probe sequence, which makes them easily transferable from one cross to another, even between distantly related species; they are thus handy tools for map comparison.

a functional map for pathogen resistance, enriched with rga  and drl  sequences, snps and indels tightly linked or located within nbs-lrr-like genes, has been developed on the basis of two potato populations . this functional map also contains caps, ssr and rflp literature-derived markers, which enables the comparison with other qtl maps. however, it remains difficult to infer precisely functional locus information to qtl mapping results as qtls often have large confidence intervals.

qtl meta-analysis thus appears here to be an adequate tool i) to narrow-down the confidence intervals of hot-spot loci where congruent late blight resistance qtls of multiple origins map, and ii) to investigate colocalization of these loci with rpi-genes, rgas, drls and maturity qtls as well. in this paper, we present a three-step meta-analysis process achieved with the metaqtl software. first, we built a consensus potato map by compiling  <dig> qtl maps and eight reference maps. this consensus map includes common markers and specific markers tagging rpi-genes, as well as rga and drl markers. second, individual qtls for late blight resistance and maturity were projected onto the consensus map. third, for each trait, qtls were clustered into meta-qtls on the basis of the distribution of their projected positions on the consensus potato map.

RESULTS
bibliographic review of qtl mapping studies
the initial map set comprised a total of  <dig> maps divided into i)  <dig> qtl maps from  <dig> publications related to qtl detection of late blight resistance and maturity type, and ii) eight independent reference maps  . reference maps were included because they provided numerous pivotal markers, which improved connections between maps. because of a lack of shared markers, the initial  <dig> qtl map set was refined to a core subset of  <dig> "connected" qtl maps coming from  <dig> publications that were included in the meta-analysis .

† table  <dig> lists all the concerned publications.

†† only qtl maps that had a minimum of two common markers with at least a chromosome of another map were included into the meta-analysis.

†††  <dig> reference potato maps without qtls  were added to meta-analysis to increase connections between maps through common markers and to improve consensus map accuracy.

the  <dig> "connected" qtl maps were representative of the diversity of assessments for late blight resistance and maturity, the qtl detection methods and the sources of resistance . resistance tests were based on disease spread on foliage in the field  or in the greenhouse , sporulation or necrosis spots on in vitro detached leaflets or leaf discs , necrosis progression on stems  and disease damage on tuber slices  or whole tubers  in controlled conditions. maturity type was evaluated by the number of days before flowering or senescence , plant height  and plant vigour . qtls were detected with different statistical detection methods according to the number of available markers, the size of the progeny and the frequency distribution profile of the raw or transformed data . most of the p. infestans isolates used for late blight resistance assessments were of a <dig> mating type and virulent towards the  <dig> s. demissum rpi-genes. however, it was difficult to say whether some of the isolates used in the different studies were the same or not. as wild tuber-bearing relatives of potato have proven to be high-potential sources of resistance, most mapping populations derived from a cross between a dihaploid s. tuberosum clone  and a clone derived from a diploid relative . two mapping populations even derived from crosses between two potato relatives . the parental pedigrees were sometimes quite complex. nevertheless, the marker order in all maps was well conserved and aligned with the s. tuberosum map  <cit> . if all known species of the parent pedigrees are taken into account, a total of  <dig> potato-related species were involved in the meta-analysis.

consensus potato map
common markers between the  <dig> "connected" qtl maps and eight reference maps  made it possible the construction of a consensus map for the  <dig> potato chromosomes. the number of maps used to construct each consensus chromosome varied between  <dig> and  <dig> . the consensus potato map had a total length of  <dig>  cm  and contained a total of  <dig>  markers . among them,  <dig> markers were shared by at least two different maps. there were between  <dig> and  <dig> common markers per chromosome, corresponding to 16% up to 29% of the total number of markers per chromosome. the name, map position and occurrence of each marker are given in additional file  <dig> and on the sgn database  <cit> .

qtl dataset for meta-analysis
on the basis of the  <dig> publications of qtl studies, a total of  <dig> late blight resistance qtls and  <dig> maturity qtls were collected . however, some qtl intervals did not include the minimum of two anchor markers, which were required for their projection onto the consensus map. thus, the qtl dataset for meta-analysis was reduced down to  <dig> late blight resistance qtls and  <dig> maturity qtls, coming from  <dig> publications. the excluded qtls, which harboured a single common marker with the consensus map, were referred to "anchored qtls" and indicated at this marker position in additional file  <dig> but their orientation and projected confidence interval could not be determined.

as far as the qtls included in the meta-analysis are considered, late blight and maturity qtls spread on the  <dig> potato chromosomes. the number of qtls per chromosome ranged between six and  <dig> for late blight resistance, and between one and eight for maturity.

for late blight resistance, r² values were available for  <dig> qtls out of the  <dig> input qtls and ranged between 4%  and 63% . 75% of the late blight qtls had relatively small effects, ranging between 4% and 15%; 7% of the qtls had large effects, ranging between 30% and 63%. confidence intervals ranged between  <dig> cm  and  <dig> cm , with a mean of  <dig> cm.

for maturity, r² values were available for  <dig> qtls out of the  <dig> input qtls and ranged between 4%  and 71% . 75% of the maturity qtls had r² values ranging between 4% and 15%; 10% of the qtls explained more than 30% of the phenotypic variation . confidence intervals ranged between  <dig> cm  and  <dig> cm , with a mean of  <dig> cm.

meta-analysis
we determined the number of meta-qtls per chromosome by using the modified akaike information criterion  and by taking into account the consistency with the different criteria provided by the metaqtl software . our analysis yielded a total of  <dig> meta-qtls. each meta-qtl corresponded to clusters of individual qtls coming from different experiments. meta-qtls were composed of a maximum of  <dig> individual qtls for late blight resistance  and eight individual qtls for maturity . the qtl meta-analysis on the whole potato genome reduced by six-fold the initial number of late blight qtls by passing from  <dig> qtls to  <dig> meta-qtls and by ca. five-fold the number of maturity qtls by passing from  <dig> qtls to eight meta-qtls. figure  <dig> presents an example of the meta-analysis steps for chromosome iv, from qtl projection on the consensus map to qtl clustering into meta-qtls.

a graphical overview of the late blight and maturity meta-qtls is presented on figure  <dig>  late blight meta-qtls spread on the  <dig> chromosomes, with one to three meta-qtls per chromosome. maturity meta-qtls spread on only six chromosomes, with one or two meta-qtls per chromosome. other maturity qtls were reported in literature on the other six chromosomes, but they were single in their region and no meta-qtl could be computed. single qtls for late blight resistance and for maturity that were excluded from the clustering step are shown in additional file  <dig>  with the other excluded qtls which were anchored by a single marker to the consensus map.

the confidence intervals of late blight meta-qtls ranged between  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , with a mean of  <dig>  cm . the confidence intervals of maturity meta-qtls ranged between  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , with a mean of  <dig>  cm . with respect to the length reduction of the mean confidence interval from the published qtls to the meta-qtls, confidence intervals were reduced by  <dig> -fold for late blight resistance and by  <dig> -fold for maturity .

maturity meta-qtls overlapped late blight meta-qtls on chromosomes vi and xi, while there was no overlap on chromosomes iv, v, vii and viii. however, by running meta-analysis on late blight resistance qtls and maturity qtls altogether under a single "super-trait", we observed that for all  <dig> chromosomes, maturity qtls were always clustered together with late blight resistance qtls in a "super meta-qtl" . on the other way round, we observed at least one "super meta-qtl" free of maturity qtls for  <dig> chromosomes; for chromosome xi only, both "super meta-qtls" included at least one maturity qtl.

the three most consistent late blight meta-qtls were located on chromosomes iv, v and x . these meta-qtls were composed of the highest number of qtls  with the largest effects . in addition, they corresponded to individual qtls identified in different potato-related species or in plant material with complex pedigree. this result suggests that these regions could correspond to conserved resistance qtls retrieved from several tuber-bearing solanum species.

candidate gene analysis
literature reported the map positions of several rpi-genes determining late blight resistance . however, only a few flanking markers were supplied , which hampered the accurate location of rpi-genes on the consensus map . due to their rough positions, it was thus not possible to say definitely whether they were included or not in the late blight meta-qtls. out of the  <dig> rpi-genes positioned on our consensus potato map,  <dig> were included in the confidence intervals of late blight meta-qtls . one example of overlap was on chromosome iv, where the tg370-tg <dig> marker interval  containing a large nbs-lrr rpi-gene cluster  largely overlapped the meta-qtl mqtl_1_late_blight  <cit> . on chromosome vi, the ct <dig> marker tagging the rpi-blb <dig> r-gene was included in mqtl_1_late_blight. on chromosome x, the tg <dig> and tg <dig> markers flanking the rpi-ber <dig> gene were included in mqtl_2_late_blight. however, on chromosome xi, the lack of anchor markers hindered the accurate location of the  <dig> rpi-genes . according to the flanking markers , only rpi-stirling might be included in mqtl_2_late_blight.

*  <dig> qtls, **  <dig> qtls, ***  <dig> qtls, in bradshaw et al.  <cit> .

conversely, a few rpi-genes clearly did not belong to any late blight meta-qtls. this was the case for rpi <dig> on chromosome vii and for the rpi-vnt <dig>  rpi-phu <dig> and rpi-mcq1/moc <dig> loci of chromosome ix. in three additional cases, the distinction between rpi-genes and late blight meta-qtls was doubtful. on chromosome v, r <dig> gene  was located less than  <dig> cm far below the lower bound of mqtl_1_late_blight. on chromosome viii, the rb cluster  was located  <dig> cm far up to the upper bound of mqtl_2_late_blight  <cit> . on chromosome x, the rber/rpi-ber <dig> locus was located between both meta-qtls of this chromosome, in a 3-cm interval .

in total,  <dig> rgas and  <dig> drls were reported on our consensus map, mainly from the pomamo functional map  <cit> . fourteen rgas and  <dig> drls belonged to late blight meta-qtls that covered about 20% of the consensus map . comparatively,  <dig> rgas and nine drls belonged to maturity meta-qtls that covered about 7% of the consensus map . independency chi- <dig> tests indicate that the number of rgas and rpi-genes are under expectation in late blight meta-qtls  and over expectation in maturity meta-qtls . the heterogeneous distribution of rgas and rpi-genes corroborate the fact that they are often clustered or alleles. conversely, the distribution of drls was independent on the distribution of both late blight meta-qtls  and maturity meta-qtls .

discussion
a dense consensus reference potato map for map comparisons
twenty-nine published potato maps were merged together into a single consensus map. from the information available in the publications of the genetic maps, at least three maps come from the cultivated potato species  and  <dig> maps from crosses between s. tuberosum and potato wild relatives . sixteen maps are already consensus maps of both parents, with generally one being a s. tuberosum clone and the other one a resistant wild potato species. this ability to compile genetic map information of s. tuberosum and its wild relatives indicates a high level of conservation of the marker order, and thus, of genomic sequences all over the genome. this stresses the very close genetic relationships of those genetic backgrounds and gives evidence of the validity to compile their deriving published qtl data produced with their maps. the genetic relationships between the cultivated potato and its wild relatives have been described in details by spooner et al.   <cit> .

composed of  <dig>  markers, the consensus map constructed in our study constitutes a new valuable dense reference map of potato. marker positions are available on the sgn database, enabling map comparisons  <cit> . this map can be used either as a source of markers for regions of interest or as an anchor reference map. however, for regions with a high density of markers, precise marker order has to be taken with care as the marker positions were calculated according to the positions of common markers from different maps and not based on recombination fractions. thus, precise marker positions have to be checked by mapping in a large population.

one feature of this consensus map is that markers are not regularly spread along the chromosomes and tend to concentrate in the medium regions. for example, on chromosome viii,  <dig> markers are spread on the top  <dig> cm while  <dig> markers are spread on the next  <dig> cm. this phenomenon is indeed observed on the published maps where dense regions are often assimilated to centromeric regions characterized by a small number of recombinations and consequently compressed maps. we also assume that genomic regions known to be involved in late blight resistance mostly gather in medium regions, which had been enriched with markers. another explanation would be that distal markers generally originate from a single published map and their positions could be due to genotyping errors or skewed segregations.

a clear picture of the structural organization of late blight resistance loci on the potato genome
the synthetic potato map with meta-qtls offers a refined overview of the structural organization of the loci of polygenic resistance to late blight in terms of number of qtls and lengths of confidence intervals. by reducing the number of resistance loci by a factor of six , meta-analysis highlights the well-known resistance gene clusters on chromosomes iv and v, and also points out loci which had not appeared as notable in individual experiments like the loci on chromosomes i, iii, vii, and xii. twenty-four meta-qtls summarized about 96% of the individual qtls included in the analysis, which illustrates the power of qtl meta-analysis to combine qtls from various studies.

one may question the validity of such qtl meta-analysis compiling information of as different species as the cultivated potato  and its wild relatives . however, as we explained earlier, this meta-analysis could only be performed thanks to the presence of common molecular markers mapped in a conserved order across maps of different related species. this structural tight genetic relationships of the different backgrounds sets up the hypothesis that the same genes are present in the same order in the genome across species, and that the genetic variation, if any, would take place at the allele level. the fact that the potato genome sequencing consortium is currently exploiting the high genomic similarity between s. tuberosum and s. phureja to reduce the complexity in assembly supports this hypothesis  <cit> . a high level of sequence conservation was also observed at the nucleotide level of the coding sequence among six solanaceae genera   <cit> . because the number of sequence matches among different solanaceae est libraries was inversely correlated with the phylogenetic distance, we assume that the tuber-bearing species are also very similar at the level of expressed genes. these hypotheses have been already proposed in other genera where meta-analysis was conducted across relatives . in potato, resistance qtls from one population frequently mapped, as far as resolution allows, in close proximity to those described in other populations. at the gene level, high sequence homology of rpi genes were described between potato relatives. functional homologues of the r <dig> resistance gene to p. infestans located on potato chromosome iv were cloned by an allele mining approach in three related species, and recognized the same effector protein of p. infestans  <cit> . rpi genes and their general functions are overall well conserved across potato related species, variation being in fact limited to differences at the base pair and allele function levels  <cit> . at last, in a recent published study, meta-analysis was performed on populations involving different species related to bread wheat to narrow-down the interval of a qtl controlling the nitrogen use efficiency  <cit> . the functional underlying gene has been identified and showed to be conserved at orthologous positions in wheat species and in much further related cereals species such as rice, sorghum and maize. these different elements demonstrate that the analysis of the genetic factors controlling a trait across genomes of different related species and even of different genera of a plant family can be very powerful to perform a map-based dissection of a conserved gene that controls the same trait in several species.

in our study, the locus confidence intervals have been reduced by  <dig> -fold in average. locus accuracy has especially increased for the loci for which colocalizing qtls are numerous, like on chromosome v where  <dig> colocalizing qtls with an averaged confidence interval of  <dig> cm were clustered into a single meta-qtl of only  <dig> cm. in this way, meta-analysis refines the genomic regions of interest frequently described. this enables the determination of a set of markers for selection and a reasonable list of candidate genes when the genetic map is anchored to the annotated genome sequence. the closest flanking markers of the locus are also provided for subsequent fine-mapping in a real large population for map-based gene cloning.

however, confidence intervals of meta-qtls have to be taken with caution, as they are the result of two successive statistical transformations , based themselves on the individual qtl confidence intervals. this stresses the importance of the accuracy of the initial mapping data. for our analysis, we took into account the individual qtl confidence intervals as described in the original publication when available . otherwise, the confidence interval estimate was calculated with the empirical formula of darvasi and soller  whose accuracy depends on the population size and the qtl effect  <cit> . to reduce the risk of giving artificially too much weight to a locus, we made a quite strict selection of the individual qtls to be included in the meta-analysis by removing all possible redundancy . in our study, five meta-qtls displayed confidence intervals lower than  <dig> cm , while the confidence interval of individual qtls varied greatly. in these regions, the consensus map appeared condensed in comparison with the original maps; therefore, the projected confidence intervals of individual qtls were very tight. löffler et al.  have also found in wheat a very tight meta-qtl of  <dig>  cm that encompassed six qtls only  <cit> . these over-reduced confidence intervals underline the necessity to validate the marker-trait association, either by association mapping or by transcriptomics when possible as performed by norton et al.   <cit> .

the meta-analysis implemented by the meta-qtl software assumes that qtl experiments are independent from each other. therefore, it could not take into account common features to several studies, such as the relatedness between mapping populations or between phytophthora isolates that would have increased the power of the analysis. nevertheless, by projecting qtls on the same consensus map, meta-analysis still makes it possible to rapidly compare qtl mapping results of linked studies and highlights qtls conferring isolate-specific resistance  or with tissue-specificity effect . another limit of the meta-analysis implemented in metaqtl is that it does not provide the direction of the allelic effects, meaning that qtls composing a meta-qtl can have opposite direction alleles. consequently, we have to come back to the individual qtl data to be able to select the origin of the target favourable allele.

polygenic late blight resistance and maturity relationships
late blight meta-qtls overlapped maturity meta-qtls on chromosomes vi and xi. in addition, if we consider individual maturity qtls excluded from the meta-analysis but anchored with a single common marker, other overlaps were presumed with late blight meta-qtls on chromosome i, ii, v, and xii, and reciprocally individual late blight qtls overlapped maturity meta-qtls on chromosomes iv, v, vi, vii, and xi . in these cases, either pleiotropic genes might control both traits, or the resolution is not accurate enough to distinguish two closely linked genes.

the most famous association between qtls for late blight resistance and for maturity is located on the upper part of chromosome v  <cit> . here, meta-analysis results show that the maturity meta-qtl mqtl_1_maturity consisting in eight maturity qtls reported for this chromosome was very close but distinct from the most consistent late blight meta-qtl mqtl_1_late_blight consisting in  <dig> individual qtls. this result goes rather in favour of the hypothesis that each trait would be controlled by independent genes but very closely linked. nevertheless, this result has to be taken with care as two individual maturity qtls that were not included in the meta-analysis were anchored to markers of the confidence interval of mqtl_1_late_blight. also, another individual late blight qtl was anchored to a marker of the mqtl_1_maturity's confidence interval .

cases of clearly distinct maturity and late blight meta-qtls were found on chromosomes iv, vii and viii; the hypothesis of a pleiotropic gene would then be excluded for these regions. in addition, anchored individual maturity qtls did not coincide with late blight meta-qtls on chromosomes iii and x, corroborating the independence of late blight and maturity loci in these regions as suggested in previous studies  <cit> . the clearest cases of physical independency between maturity and late blight resistance qtls could be preferential targets for introgression into elite cultivars for late blight resistance breeding.

candidate genes for late blight resistance qtls
most frequent hypotheses about resistance qtls were either defeated r-genes with residual effects or defence genes. the confidence intervals of the late blight meta-qtls of chromosomes iv, vi, x and xi include r-genes of the nbs-lrr class . the late blight resistance locus of chromosome iv was particularly well documented with the stirling cultivar and s. microdontum cases of study  <cit> . the detection of the same locus as an r-gene or a qtl can be accounted for several factors such as the allelic form of the gene , the composition of the pathogen isolate, the way of scoring the disease or the genetic background. bhaskar et al.  demonstrated that the resistance level conferred by the rb gene was dependent on the quantity of proteins encoded by the essential cell cycle regulator sgt <dig> gene. this showed the importance of the genetic background in the efficiency of r-gene-triggered disease resistance  <cit> . a parallel can be made with the fact that quantitative resistance is often controlled by a few large-effect qtls in association with several minor-effect qtls which can interact with the major qtls to modulate the expression of the given trait .

by analysing colocalizations between the  <dig> late blight meta-qtls and the  <dig> rpi-genes,  <dig> rgas and  <dig> drls, we observed that 25% of late blight meta-qtls included rgas , and 50% included drls. it also appeared that the frequency of rgas was not significantly greater inside late blight meta-qtl confidence intervals than outside, and that drls were neither significantly associated with late blight meta-qtls, nor with maturity meta-qtls. even if our analysis was biased by the limited number of candidate genes and qtls, our results do not favour one particular hypothesis for molecular basis of resistance qtls rather than another, corroborating ballini et al.'s conclusions  <cit> . however, the meta-analysis presents the advantage to reduce qtl confidence intervals, which contributes to increase the resolution in selecting relevant candidate genes. as an example, the staos <dig> gene encoding the potato allene oxide synthase  <dig> was located within the mqtl_2_late_blight's confidence interval. pajerowska-mukhtar et al.  showed that the natural variation of this gene was associated with a late blight resistance qtl identified by oberhagemann et al.   <cit> . such congruency between meta-analysis and fine mapping results was also reported for the vgt <dig> qtl in maize  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, we produced the first consensus map and performed the first meta-analysis dealing with both development trait and resistance to a biotic stress in potato. through this study, we demonstrated that, as soon as a large amount of qtl data is collected from different studies and connected by common genetic markers, meta-analysis becomes a powerful tool to highlight chromosomal regions to focus further researches on and to use in breeding. to narrow-down the target loci confidence intervals, it is thus worth systematically integrating all new qtls into meta-analysis on a regular basis. the anchorage of the new annotated potato genome sequence to meta-qtls will especially provide interesting targets for candidate gene approach and for marker-assisted breeding  <cit> . meta-analysis could also be useful for comparative qtl mapping across widely related crops of the same family, as achieved between rice and maize  <cit> . this opens a new type of analysis that would integrate gene evolution and functional conservation.

to improve meta-analysis, it would be necessary to integrate the relationships between parental clones across experiments, along with their pedigree, to be able to determine the donors of resistant alleles. in addition, adding information on p. infestans isolates used for resistance assessments would enlighten on the resistance spectrum mediated by meta-qtls, which is one of the predictors of the durability of resistance to pathogens. we assume that broad-spectrum meta-qtls probably target essential functions of the pathogen and that meta-qtls supported by qtls detected from several genitors or related species probably provide a selective advantage. consequently, we presume that meta-qtls with a broad-spectrum and retrieved from different genitors correspond to constrained genes, and could therefore be preferential targets to increase the durability of the resistance.
