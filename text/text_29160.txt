BACKGROUND
in ruminant placenta, various kinds of functional molecules such as steroid hormones, peptides, and prostanoids are expressed. these molecules contribute to a successful pregnancy and to the establishment of placenta. it is known that placental lactogen   <cit> , pregnancy-associated glycoproteins   <cit> , and interferon-τ   <cit>  specifically appear in both caprine  and bovine trophoblast. prolactin-related protein  has been known as a placental-specific molecule that specifically expresses in trophoblastic binucleate cells in cattle. prp is a gene of a non-classical member of the prolactin /growth hormone  family  <cit> . at least thirteen members are known to occur in cattle, and their nucleotide sequences are significantly analogous to prl and pl in bovine species  <cit> . in rodents, diversity of the prl family has been reported as well as the fact that they take on regulatory roles in pregnancy  <cit> . the placental prl families in mouse and rat may play similar roles because of the evolutionary role of these genes in establishing pregnancy  <cit> . in the ruminants, bovines have some prps  <cit> ; however there is no report on this in caprine species. we investigated the prps mrna in caprine placenta. this paper introduces two novel types of cprp genes that emerged from the cloning of a complete sequence of full-length cdna and its expression. we named these sequences caprine prolactin-related protein- <dig>  and caprine prolactin-related protein- <dig> , based on their similarity to bovine prps.

RESULTS
sequences of cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> cdna and deduced amino acids
sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides were isolated from caprine placentome and cloned as candidates of cprp <dig> and cprp <dig>  the predicted protein sequence regions  were composed of  <dig> nucleotides in cprp <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in cprp <dig>  the amino acid sequences deduced from full-length cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> cdna are  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids . the cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> sequences were submitted to the dna data bank of japan , and the ddbj/genbank/embl accession numbers are ab <dig> and ab <dig>  a homology search can determine intermolecular similarity. it is also possible to learn the stage of the molecular evolution with the speed from the branching and distance in a phylogenetic analysis. we analyzed the evolutionary interrelationships using predicted amino acids  sequences between the cprps and bprps . the cprp <dig> aa sequence was ~74% homologous to bprp <dig> , so it was named cprp <dig>  in contrast, the sequence homology of cprp <dig> is closer to a cluster of bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  bprp <dig> and bprp <dig> . this aa sequence was ~72% homologous to bprp <dig>  61% homologous to bprp <dig>  72% homologous to bprp <dig>  76% homologous to bprp <dig>  and 71% homologous to bprp <dig> . the predicted cprp <dig> sequence was closest to bprp <dig>  but it was located outside of the bprp <dig> cluster according to the phylogenetic tree analysis. cprp <dig> changed in the an earlier stage which was earlier than the bprp <dig> cluster when, the amino acid evolution was decided from the phylogenetic analysis. therefore, this novel caprine sequence was named cprp <dig>  the predicted 3d structures of cprp <dig>  bprp <dig>  cprp <dig> and bprp <dig> mature regions are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the structural differences in the n-glycosylation site, the disulfide bond , and each atomic configuration were confirmed.

localized and quantitative mrna expression
rt-pcr analysis confirmed cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> expression in placenta such as bprp <dig> and bprp <dig> in bovine. no amplification was found in other caprine tissue, i.e. heart, liver, lung, kidney, spleen or endometrium .

the mrna localization was determined by in situ hybridization in the caprine or bovine placenta on day  <dig>  or  <dig>  of gestation . anti-sense rna probes specifically detected mrna transcripts in the placenta. all prps signals appeared in binucleate cells in the cotyledonary villous . no significant signals were detected with sense probes in any genes .

quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis showed that the cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> expression intensities increased from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and then remained constant to day  <dig> and thereafter decreased until day  <dig> in placentome ; see fig. 6). in the caprine intercotyledon ), the cprp <dig> expression intensity held steady from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and thereafter decreased until day  <dig>  although the intensity was low compared to that in ptm. the cprp <dig> expression intensity increased from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and thereafter decreased until day  <dig> in ptm, but rather low expressions were found in icot. the profile of cprp <dig> was weaker than bprp <dig> through the pregnancy. especially bprp <dig> intensively expressed in placentomal and interplacentomal tissues.

translation of cprp <dig> and cprp6
cloning sequences of cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> were effectively translated in an hek <dig> cell system, like bovine prps . two different sizes of protein were translated of ~ <dig> and  <dig> kda with a flag-tag in cprp <dig>  those translated-protein sizes were close to those in bprp <dig> . however, translated cprp <dig> was larger than bprp <dig>  at ~ <dig> kda and  <dig> kda. there was a difference of > <dig> kda between the bovine and caprine values. from the sequence analysis, there were no differences between them in predicted size . these prps were migrated to ~ <dig> kda by n-deglycosylation treatment .

discussion
the diversity of the prl gene family has been shown in mouse, rat and cattle; however, there exists only limited functional information except for prl, pl and some rodents plps  <cit> . in particular, ruminants commonly have various genes of this family, but there is no information regarding goats, even though anatomical evidence shows a similarity to the placenta in ruminants. in cattle, thirteen varieties of prp paralogs have been reported. in the present study, we identified novel prps in caprine and compared the properties of goat and cattle.

novel prp <dig> and prp <dig> genes were detected and cloned from caprine placenta and their deduced amino acid sequences were determined to have some specific properties. phylogenetic analysis suggests that cprp <dig> separated from bovine prp <dig> cluster in an early evolutionary stage . in contrast, cprp <dig> and bprp <dig> molecules were phylogenetically adjacent . this indicates that a primitive prp <dig> molecule existed before it evolved into caprine and bovine.

the n-terminal regions of the bprp <dig> and bprp <dig> proteins were rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues, which is characteristic of the signal peptide  <cit> . the signal peptide sequence of cprp <dig> and cprp <dig>  composed of  <dig> amino acids, is well conserved in bprp <dig> and bprp <dig>  this information suggests that the signal cleavage site  of cprps is the same as that of bprps .

the bprp <dig> mature protein is predicted to have three s-s bonds with six cysteines  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the numbers and positions for these in the predicted cprp <dig> exactly coincide with those of bprp <dig>  the 3d structure of cprp <dig> was also similar to that of the mature bprp <dig> protein . bprp <dig> is predicted to have three s-s bonds with six cysteines  in the sequence. however, cprp <dig> mature protein is predicted to have eight cys, with six cys in aa positions at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> corresponding with those in bprp <dig> and an extra two in positions  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . however, these two last cys were present in most other bprps, including bprp <dig> . therefore prp <dig> may have a highly homologous sequence in caprine and bovine, with a slight difference in 3d structure.

cprp <dig> has two consensus sequences for potential n-glycosylation sites  at positions 70– <dig> and 92– <dig> , and an atypical n-glycosylation site, asn-x-cys was found at position 95– <dig>  typically, bprp <dig> had three potential n-glycosylation sites at positions 70– <dig>  92– <dig> and 159– <dig>   <cit> . so, the potential n-glycosylation sites are different in bovine and caprine, but the number of sites is the same, so they may translate a similar molecular size. this expectation was supported by the result of hek  <dig> cell translation at  <dig> kda .

cprp <dig> had three consensus sequences for n-glycosylation at positions  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  with the atypical n-glycosylation site  at position 95– <dig> as in cprp <dig>  however, bovine prp <dig> had only one consensus sequence for a typical potential n-glycosylation, at position 60– <dig>    <cit> . this is a unique n-glycosylation position in caprine and bovine, which is not present in the cprp <dig> and bprp <dig> cluster genes  . n-glycosylation positions of 92– <dig> were confirmed in all prp aa sequences except for caprine and bovine prp <dig>  in comparing the n-glycosylation sites in cprp <dig> and bprp <dig>  the caprine may have four sites and bprp, one site. western blot analysis of an hek <dig> cell system showed that cprp <dig> migrated to  <dig> kda and bprp <dig> migrated to  <dig> kda . both n-degrycosylated proteins were migrated to ~ <dig> kda . the difference in the size of the proteins is related to the sugar-chain status.

primary mrna expression of cprp <dig> and cprp <dig> was observed in trophoblast binucleate cells , and hek <dig> cells translated these mrna to each protein individually. both cprps' mrna were expressed in the extra-embryonic membrane after the implantation period . in the bovine, bprp <dig> and bprp <dig> expression were found in the trophoblast binucleate cells  and their expressions were kept from the implantation to late pregnancy in the placentomal villi . the trophoblast binucleate cells are also primary expression cells for the bprps  <cit>  and may have specific roles for the implantation and placentation of the fetomaternal interface  <cit> . the two caprine prps may also be related to implantation or placentation, like the bovine prps, since the localization and stage of expression of both caprine prp <dig> and prp <dig> were similar to those of bovine prps. the functional roles may not coincide between cprp <dig> and bprp <dig> , since the prp <dig> and prp <dig> expression profiles are different from those for bovine . the bovine placental weight increases from the early to late stage of gestation  <cit> . in contrast, small ruminant placental weight increases to the middle stage of gestation  and decreases to the late stage of gestation  <cit> . the change of the placental weight correlates with the placentation. the bprps expression appears to relate to the placentation in bovine icot. in contrast, the placentation decrease in the goat after the mid-pregnancy may be related to the low cprps expression in the icot.

it is important to confirm the caprine prps in order to understand the mechanism of implantation and placentation in small ruminant. until now, the placental hormone in a small ruminant has been considered without prp  <cit> . we suggest that prp is also related to the placental-specific endocrine activity in a small ruminant.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have found two prps in caprine placenta. these prp sequences had a high homology with the sequence of bovine prps. these prps were expressed in trophoblast binucleate cells as are bovine prps. they expressed from after the implantation period to late in gestation. these genes could independently produce mature recombinant proteins in a mammalian cell-expression system. we were able to specify the prp genes, which was alike between the ruminants. finally, we suggest that the caprine may have many more prps, recalling that thirteen prps or sixteen plps have been discovered in bovine or rodents.
