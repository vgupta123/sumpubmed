BACKGROUND
mads-box genes are a family of transcription factors found in animals, fungi, and plants and all contain a conserved dna-binding domain  <cit> . mads-box transcription factors play fundamental roles in plant development, as floral organ and meristems identity determination and transition from vegetative to reproductive growth regulation  <cit> . animal, fungal and plant mads proteins are classified into two main groups: type i and type ii  <cit> . in plants, the first has been subdivided into mα, mβ and mγ types based on the phylogenetic relationships among mads-box domains  <cit> .

type ii mads-box proteins bind to dna as dimers or higher order complexes and are also referred to as the mikc-type due to their common structure of four domains: m domain, i region, k domain and c region. m represents the mads domain involved in the dna binding, is approximately  <dig> amino acids long, and contains an α-helix followed by a β-strand. the k domain is a coiled-coil structure that participates in protein-protein interaction  <cit> , and is subdivided into three α-helix structures, k <dig>  k <dig>  and k <dig>  the variable i region, consisting of about  <dig> amino acids, links the m and k domains. and finally, the c-terminal region continues the helix structure of the k <dig> subdomain and is the most variable region among family members. the c region functions in transcriptional activation of other factors and the formation of multimeric mads-box protein complexes  <cit> . the mikc-type genes can be further subdivided in two types based on intron-exon structure  <cit> : the mikcc and the mikc*, also named mδ in parenicova et al.  <cit> .

extensive gene duplication and subsequent modification in various mads-box family lineages has resulted in diversified protein functions  <cit> . mads-box transcription factors, besides being involved in floral organ specification, are also involved in several pathways of plant growth and development, such as fruit ripening, embryonic development, and vegetative development of root and leaves  <cit> . studies of the evolution of mads-box genes that act in non-floral aspects of plant development could yield general insights into the mechanisms behind functional diversification of developmental gene families  <cit> .

one approach to examining the evolution of these gene families is to test for molecular signatures of natural selection. the ratio of nonsynonymous  to synonymous  substitution rates  provides a sensitive test of natural selection. a statistically significant dn/ds ratio lower than, equal to, or greater than  <dig>  can indicate purifying selection, neutral evolution and positive selection, respectively. analysis of mikc-type genes in arabidopsis demonstrated periods of both positive selection and purifying selection  <cit> . changes in coding sequences represented by these periods of selection, in both dna-binding and non-dna-binding regions of mads transcriptions factors, seem to play important roles during phenotypic evolution of plants.

besides ppag <dig>  <cit> , a ful-like and a shp-like  <cit> , an ap1-like and a pi-like  <cit> , and three sep-like genes  <cit> , six other mikc-type genes have been described in peach . these genes, named dormancy associated mads-box , are candidates for the regulation of growth cessation and terminal bud formation in peach  <cit> . the dam genes are not expressed in the peach dormancy-incapable mutant evergrowing  <cit> . to study the divergence patterns and processes of these genes, identify the most closely related populus sp. genes for homology studies, and test for redundancy resulting from recent shared duplication history, we performed phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of the dam genes as members of the mikc-type lineage of the mads-box gene family. we found that the ppdam genes are svp/stmads11-like , and were derived by tandem duplications. in addition, we identified significant patterns of sequence constraint in the ppdam genes, suggesting a history of natural selection that removes amino acid-changing mutations in these genes.

RESULTS
phylogeny of arabidopsis, peach and poplar mikcc-type mads-box gene
we compared the arabidopsis  <cit>  and poplar  <cit>  mikcc-type mads-box genes with the peach dam genes to determine the phylogenetic relationship between these genes. a maximum likelihood tree was estimated using the m, i and k domains . twelve major lineages could be resolved and were named according to the arabidopsis gene conventions and the abc-model classification  <cit> . all twelve lineages pi/ap <dig> , bs, agl15/agl <dig>  anr <dig>  svp/stmads <dig>  ag , agl <dig>  soc <dig>  sep , agl6/agl <dig>  ap <dig>  and flc clades, were defined with bootstrap values of at least  <dig> or higher.

the six ppdam genes could be unambiguously classified within the svp/stmads <dig> group, together with  <dig> arabidopsis  and  <dig> poplar  mads-box genes . the peach homologs formed a monophyletic group in this clade that was most closely related to the two poplar homologs, ptmads <dig> and ptmads <dig>  however, the other poplar homologs grouped into sister clades or as orthologs to the arabidopsis gene agl22/svp. therefore, the estimated tree suggests a single common ancestor for all six peach dam genes.

a bayesian tree estimated using the same data showed a similar topology with higher resolution due to high support values in most of the nodes , and a maximum parsimony tree showed similar topology and support . thus, in three different analyses, the peach dam genes formed a monophyletic group within the svp/stmads <dig> clade.

ppdam sequence characterization
the alignment of the complete ppdam protein sequence revealed high amino acid sequence conservation among the peach mads genes . the intron-exon structure is also conserved in all domains , with the exception of the c domain of ppdam <dig>  which contains a deletion of similar size to that present in ptmads <dig>  the modular domain organization of mikc proteins is reflected in a conserved intron-exon structure  <cit> .

by contrast with the exons, intron sequence similarity was low. sequence length in most of the introns among the ppdam genes was highly variable . this variability precluded meaningful intron sequence alignments, so we could not use the intron sequence to establish relationships among dam genes.

phylogeny of ppdam genes
to further resolve the phylogenetic relationships of the ppdam genes, a maximum likelihood and bayesian tree was estimated using the aligned m, i, k and c domains . the variable c domain was added into the analysis to increase the number of informative characters and therefore improve the resolution of the ppdam tree. the best fit estimated phylogenetic tree suggested that the ppdam genes were derived from serial duplication events in the following order: ppdam <dig>  ppdam <dig>  ppdam <dig>  ppdam <dig>  ppdam <dig>  and finally ppdam <dig>  separate maximum parsimony tree  generated the same topology as obtained by maximum likelihood and bayesian trees. however, confidence levels differed: bayesian posterior probabilities showed high support in all nodes, whereas bootstrap values of maximum likelihood and parsimony trees were low between ppdam <dig> and ppdam <dig>  and also between ppdam <dig> and ppdam <dig> 

evolutionary analysis of arabidopsis, peach and poplar mikcc-type mads-box genes
models of the molecular evolution of the entire mikcc-type group from arabidopsis, poplar, and peach were statistically tested using the same alignment and the inferred best fit phylogenetic tree estimated using maximum likelihood .

to test for statistically different rates of sequence evolution among branches or sites, data were analyzed using algorithms implemented in paml  <dig>  a codon substitution free-ratio model  that allows different dn/ds rate ratios among branches fit the data better than the model that assumed a homogeneous mean dn/ds rate ratio for all lineages . to examine how dn/ds rate ratios differed among codon positions, we compared models m <dig> and m <dig>  which allows  <dig> different rates among sites, and found it to produce a significantly better fit . purifying selection  was found. however, no positive selection was found at any site. to test if positive selection promoted divergence between genes, the codon substitution models that allow positive selection  and that assumed nearly neutral selection  were compared . in both cases, we found no significant evidence of positive selection.

because positive selection often occurs only during short stretches of evolutionary history, detection of statistically significant patterns consistent with past positive selection events can be difficult when considering average measures of selection among lineages. the free-ratio model  indicated that selection was not homogeneous among branches. several branches of the svp/stmads <dig> clade showed a considerable number of changes that could be related to differential selection pressure. thus, variation in selection pressure was evaluated for the branches that lead to svp/stmads <dig> and dam clade genes by comparing models that allow positive selection and different rates among sites with nearly neutral models . significant positive selection  was found in the basal branch of svp/stmads <dig> clade . three significant positive selected sites were also found in this ancestor: one in the m and two in the k domain. however, no significant detectable positive selection was observed in the basal branch of dam clade .

evolutionary analysis of ppdam group
models of molecular evolution within the ppdam genes were tested for best fit using the alignment and maximum likelihood tree . similar results were obtained by two programs: mega  <dig> and paml <dig>  estimation of pairwise dn and ds rates using mega  <dig> showed significant purifying selection and no significant positive selection for each of the six sequences .

a codon substitution free-ratio model  that allows different dn/ds rate ratios among branches did not fit the data better than the model that assumed a mean dn/ds rate ratio for all the lineages . to evaluate whether there was dn/ds rate ratio variation among codon positions, models m <dig> and m <dig> were compared. as with the entire mikcc-type tree, the model m <dig>  which allows three different rates among sites, was a significantly better fitting model  within the ppdam clade. approximately one-half of the sites had patterns consistent with purifying selection, and half were more consistent with neutral sequence evolution . three percent of sites showed patterns with statistically significant positive selection . to test if a positive selection model could explain the divergence between ppdam genes, the codon substitution models that allow positive selection  and that assumed nearly neutral selection  were compared . in the first case , no amino acid showed significant evidence of positive selection. however, when a β distribution of ratios was applied , the pattern suggesting positive selection was statistically significant  although the percentage of sites contributing to this significant deviation from neutrality was very low . the overall analysis of ppdam genes showed that most sites were either highly conserved with a dn/ds rate ratio close to  <dig> or nearly neutral.

ancestral reconstruction of a positively selected region in ppdam
the naïve empirical bayes of m <dig> and m <dig> models suggested one potential site under significant positive selection : a serine-aspartate change of the c-terminal region . a maximum likelihood-based estimated reconstruction of ancestral sequences around this site is shown in figure  <dig>  identical changes  at amino acid  <dig> are present in ppdam <dig> and ppdam <dig>  in this section of the alignment, ancestral sequences of ppdam genes shared the same nucleotides with a probability higher than  <dig> , except near ppdam <dig> and ppdam <dig> genes at the potential positively selected site. however, ancestral sequences of ppdam genes did not shared the same nucleotides  in the non-positive selected positions  <dig> and  <dig> around this site .

discussion
phylogenetic analyses were used to test alternative models of sequence evolution in the peach dam genes, members of the mads-box family. expression of the dam genes is lost in the evergrowing peach mutant, which does not form terminal vegetative buds in response to dormancy inducing conditions. disruption of gene function for one or more of these genes may be responsible for the non-dormant phenotype of the mutant  <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships among mikcc-type genes of arabidopsis and poplar were similar to those obtained previously in other studies  <cit> . mikcc-type genes were resolved in  <dig> subfamilies although the order of divergence among them was unclear. nevertheless, the peach dam genes were unambiguously recognized as svp/stmads11-like genes.

the svp/stmads <dig> group appears to have expanded in the few perennials for which we have comprehensive data: poplar  and grapevine  carry an increased number of svp/stmads <dig> genes relative to arabidopsis  and other annual models such as tomato  and rice   <cit> . the six dam genes found in the peach follow the trend of increased svp/stmads <dig> genes in perennial species. this expansion in three phylogeneticaly distinct species could indicate that perennials use svp/stmads <dig> genes for functions that are no longer required or needed in annual models. these traits could include the formation of floral and vegetative bud structures, regulation of endodormancy cycling, or regulation of the juvenile to mature transition. the svp/stmads <dig> genes, together with other expanded genes from anr <dig>  soc <dig> and agl <dig> families, are interesting targets for investigating the functional requirements for the evolution of perenniality  <cit> .

several svp/stmads11-like genes have been associated with the vegetative to reproductive meristem transition. in arabidopsis, the agl22/svp gene acts as flowering repressor  <cit> , whereas its close homolog agl <dig> has an opposite function  <cit> . in rice, osmads <dig>  osmads <dig> and osmads <dig> act as negative regulators of brassinosteroid responses and modulators of meristem identity  <cit> . however, in tomato, the gene jointless is involved in leaf and abscission zone development, in addition to the flowering time regulation  <cit> .

in perennial species where svp/stmads <dig> genes have been found, the genes are expressed in most vegetative tissues and often in bud tissues. in potato, stmads <dig> and stmads <dig> are preferentially expressed in vegetative tissues  <cit> . similarly, ibmads <dig> and ibmads <dig> genes of sweet potato are preferentially expressed in root tissue  <cit> . in paulownia kawakamii, pkmads <dig> can act as regulator of shoot morphogenesis  <cit> . in poplar, at least one of the svp/stmads11-like genes is expressed in cambium tissue  <cit> . the five grapevine svp/stmads11-like genes are preferentially expressed in bud tissue, although two of them are also detected in vegetative organs  <cit> . a raspberry gene putatively encoding an svp/stmads11-like transcription factor  <cit> , a japanese apricot svp/stmads11-like  <cit>  and the peach dam genes  <cit>  are all expressed in bud tissues. the vegetative and/or bud localization of expression of these genes would support the hypothesis that a perennial habit of growth would require an increased sophistication of the regulatory pathways devoted to controlling dormancy and growth cycles of dormant buds, influencing architecture and survival of unfavourable growing conditions.

our phylogenetic analyses suggest that the peach dam genes were derived from serial duplications of a common ancestor. duplicated genes can be produced either by genome, segmental or tandem gene duplication. gene duplications are especially prevalent in plants  <cit> , and so the relative proportions for each of these fates is of significant interest. in poplar, the presence of several gene regions with fewer than three genes in each gene cluster  <cit>  suggest that the expansion of the svp/stmads11-like genes was a consequence of combined whole-genome  <cit>  or segmental duplication with tandem gene duplications  <cit> . by contrast, the six peach dam genes are clustered in one locus of the linkage group  <dig>  of the general prunus genetic map  <cit>  and form a monophyletic clade in our analyses. monophyly strongly suggests that expansion of the peach dam gene family occurred by repeated rounds of tandem duplication. thus, the duplications in both poplar and peach provide examples of two different pathways leading to the origin and maintenance of an elevated number of duplicated genes. the plant groups in which these expansions have occurred suggests that svp/stmads11-like genes could play roles in perennial state or bud development.

duplicated genes can have several alternative long-term fates: nonfunctionalization, subfunctionalization or the much rarer neofunctionalization  <cit> . overall, the mikcc-type genes sampled in this study have substitution patterns consistent with purifying selection. however, several branches of the mikcc-type gene tree, including the branch leading to the svp/stmads11-like genes, appear to be under strong positive selection. we found three potential positively-selected sites that could have modified the dna binding and protein interaction properties of the svp/stmads11-like genes. by contrast, the evolution of the ppdam genes has involved strong purifying selection, suggesting important functions in peach trees that rely upon the retention of specific sequences. the arabidopsis type ii mads-box genes may have been affected by sporadic positive selection at the origin of new functions followed by strong functional constraint  <cit> , and our observations in peach and poplar are consistent with a similar model for evolution in the svp/stmads <dig> clade. indeed, since the dn/ds rate ratio among branches of the ppdam clade tree was not significantly different, the selection intensity and direction appears to have been constant in all ppdam genes. the patterns of strong purifying selection observed in all six ppdam genes could also suggest a lack of functional redundancy among the genes, despite similarity in coding sequence. four different seasonally dependent expression patterns among the ppdam genes  <cit>  are consistent with independent roles for these gene groups in growth and development. therefore subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization likely contribute to the maintenance of this paralogous set of genes, although overlapping redundancy may also occur.

purifying selection appears to be strongest in the mik region. the relaxation of functional constraint in the c-terminal region is consistent with previous studies that suggest the c-terminus tends to be more divergent than the mik region  <cit> . within the c-terminal region of the dam genes we identified a potential positively-selected site. this position had a posterior possibility higher than  <dig>  and could be related to the suspected functions of the c-terminal region: stabilization of the interactions mediated by the k domain, formation of dna-binding homodimers, activation of transcription, or contribution to multimer or higher-order complex formation  <cit> . functional studies of motifs and particular amino acids have been performed in the c-terminal domain of b-family proteins  <cit> , but similar information is not available for the svp/stmads <dig> family.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that the peach dam genes diverged sequentially by tandem duplications from a common ancestor related to the two poplar genes, ptmads <dig> and ptmads <dig>  which are more closely related to the peach dam genes than are other svp/stmads <dig> family genes. in addition, the nucleotide substitution patterns and rates of evolution in dam homologs suggest strong functional constraints.
