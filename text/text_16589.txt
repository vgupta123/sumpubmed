BACKGROUND
in recent years, the kinase field has developed the practice of monitoring inhibitor selectivity through profiling on panels of biochemical assays  <cit> , and other fields are following this example  <cit> . such profiling means that scientists are faced with increasing amounts of data that need to be distilled into human sense. it would be powerful to have a good single selectivity value for quantitatively steering the drug discovery process, for measuring progress of series within a program, for computational drug design  <cit> , and for establishing when a compound is sufficiently selective. however, in contrast to, for instance, lipophilicity and potency, where values such as logp or binding constant  are guiding, quantitative measures for selectivity are still under debate. often graphic methods are used to give insight, for example dotting a kinome tree  <cit> , heat maps  <cit> , or a radius plot, but such methods only allow qualitative comparison of a limited set of compounds at a time.

to make quantitative selectivity comparisons, three notable methods have been proposed . the first is the 'selectivity score'  <cit> , which simply divides the number of kinases hit at an arbitrary kd or ic <dig> value  by the number of kinases tested , figure 1a). a related score is s, which divides the number of kinases hit at  <dig> times the kd of the target by the number of kinases tested  <cit> . the disadvantage of both methods is that  <dig> μm, or the factor  <dig>  is an arbitrary cut-off value. for example, take two inhibitors, one that binds to two kinases with kds of  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm, and another with kds of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm. both are ranked equally specific by both s and s, whereas the first compound is clearly more specific.

a less arbitrary parameter for selectivity is the gini score  <cit> . this uses %-inhibition data at a single inhibitor concentration. these data are rank-ordered, summed and normalized  to arrive at a cumulative fraction inhibition plot, after which the score is calculated by the relative area outside the curve . though this solves the problem with the selectivity score, it leaves other disadvantages. one is that the gini score has no conceptual or thermodynamic meaning such as a kd value has. another is that it performs suboptimally with smaller profiling panels  <cit> . in addition, the use of %-inhibition data makes the value more dependent on experimental conditions than a kd-based score  <cit> . for instance, profiling with  <dig> μm inhibitor concentration results in higher percentages inhibition than using  <dig>  μm of inhibitor. the  <dig> μm test therefore yields a more promiscuous gini value, requiring the arbitrary  <dig> μm to be mentioned when calculating gini scores. the same goes for concentrations of atp or other co-factors. this is confusing and limits comparisons across profiles.

a recently proposed method is the partition index  <cit> . this selects a reference kinase , and calculates the fraction of inhibitor molecules that would bind this kinase, in an imaginary pool of all panel kinases . the partition index  is a kd-based score with a thermodynamical underpinning, and performs well when test panels are smaller  <cit> . however, this score is still not ideal, since it doesn't characterize the complete inhibitor distribution in the imaginary kinase mixture, but just the fraction bound to the reference enzyme. consider two inhibitors: a binds to  <dig> kinases, one with a kd of  <dig> nm and ten others at  <dig> nm. inhibitor b binds to  <dig> kinases, both with kds of  <dig> nm. the partition index would score both inhibitors as equally specific , whereas the second is intuitively more specific. another downside is the necessary choice of a reference kinase. if an inhibitor is relevant in two projects, it can have two different pmax values. moreover, because the score is relative to a particular kinase, the error on the kd of this reference kinase dominates the error in the partition index. ideally, in panel profiling, the errors on all kds are equally weighted.

here we propose a novel selectivity metric without these disadvantages. our method is based on the principle that, when confronted with multiple kinases, inhibitor molecules will assume a boltzmann distribution over the various targets . the broadness of this distribution can be assessed through a theoretical entropy calculation . we show the advantages of this method and some applications. because it can be used with any activity profiling dataset, it is a universal parameter for expressing selectivity.

RESULTS
theory
imagine a theoretical mixture of all protein targets on which selectivity was assessed. no competing factors are present such as atp. to this mixture we add a small amount of inhibitor, in such a way that approximately all inhibitor molecules are bound by targets, and no particular binding site gets saturated. a selective inhibitor will bind to one target almost exclusively and have a narrow distribution . a promiscuous inhibitor will bind to many targets and have a broad distribution . the broadness of the inhibitor distribution on the target mixture reflects the selectivity of the compound.

the binding of one inhibitor molecule to a particular protein can be seen as a thermodynamical state with an energy level determined by kd . for simplicity we use the term kd to represent both kd and ki. the distribution of molecules over these energy states is given by the boltzmann law. as the broadness of a boltzmann distribution is measured by entropy, the selectivity implied in the distributions of figure 1d can be captured in an entropy.

a similar insight is given by information theory. it is well-established that information can be quantified using entropy  <cit> . a selective kinase inhibitor can be seen as containing more information about which active site to bind than a promiscuous inhibitor. the selectivity difference between the inhibitors can therefore be quantified by information entropy.

the distribution of a compound across energy states is given by the boltzmann formula  <cit> :   

where ϕ <dig> is the fraction of molecules occupying state  <dig>  and Δg <dig> is the free energy of occupying state  <dig> when the inhibitor comes from solution. in order to arrive at a fraction, the denominator in equation  contains the summation of occupancies of all states, which are labelled i, with free energies Δgi.

in general, entropy can be calculated from fractions of all l states using the gibbs formula  <cit> :   

ssel is shorthand for selectivity entropy. compared to the original gibbs formulation, equation  contains a minus sign on the right hand to ensure that ssel is a positive value. now, we need to evaluate equation  from a set of measurements. for this we need   

where ka,i is the association constant of the inhibitor to target  i, which is the inverse of the binding constant kd,i . in short: ka,i = 1/kd,i. if we express the free energy in units of 'per molecule' rather than 'per mole', equation  becomes   

and equation  can be rewritten as   

using this result in equation  gives   

simplifying notation gives   

equation  defines how a selectivity entropy can be calculated from a collection of association constants ka. here Σk is the sum of all association constants.

it is most simple to apply equation  to directly measured binding constants or inhibition constants. also ic50s can be used, but this is only really meaningful if they are related to kd. fortunately, for kinases it is standard to measure ic <dig> values at  = km,atp. ideally, such ic50s equal  <dig> times kd, according to the cheng-prusoff equation  <cit> . the factor  <dig> will drop out in equation , and we therefore can use data of the format ic50-at-km, atp directly as if they were kd.

protocol for calculating a selectivity entropy
from the above, it follows that a selectivity entropy can be quickly calculated from a set of profiling data with the following protocol:

 <dig>  generate ka values by taking 1/kd or 1/ic50

 <dig>  add all ka values to obtain Σk

 <dig>  for every ka, calculate ka/Σk

 <dig>  for every ka, evaluate  ln 

 <dig>  sum all terms and multiply by -1

this process can be easily automated for use with large datasets  <cit>  or internal databases.

examples

the selectivity entropy is based on calculating the entropy of the hypothetical inhibitor distribution in a protein mixture. to give more insights into the properties of this metric, some examples are useful.

an inhibitor that only binds to a single kinase with a kd of  <dig> nm  has ka/Σka =  <dig>  then ssel = -=  <dig>  which is the lowest possibly entropy.

an inhibitor that binds to two kinases  with a kd of  <dig> nm has kx/Σka = ky/Σka =  <dig>  and a selectivity entropy of - =  <dig> . thus lower selectivity results in higher entropy.

if we modify the compound such that it still inhibits kinase x with a kd of  <dig> nm, but inhibits less strongly kinase y with a kd of  <dig> μm, then the new inhibitor is more specific. now kx/Σka = 109/ and ky/Σka = 106/, resulting in ssel = - =  <dig> . this is less than  <dig> . this shows that the selectivity entropy can distinguish in the case where the selectivity scores s and s cannot .

a less selective inhibitor that binds three targets with kds of  <dig> nm, has ssel = -3· =  <dig> , and an even more promiscuous inhibitor that binds  <dig> targets, of which  <dig> at  <dig> nm, and  <dig> at  <dig> μm, has Σk = 3·109+ 2· <dig> =  <dig> · <dig> and ssel = -3· + 2· =  <dig> . thus ssel gradually increases when more targets are more potently hit.

if we take the inhibitors a and b that were mentioned earlier, then a , has Σk = 1·109+ 10· <dig> = 2· <dig> and ssel = -  + 10· =  <dig> . this is a more aselective value than inhibitor b with an inhibition profile of twice  <dig> nm, which has ssel =  <dig>  . thus the selectivity entropy can distinguish in a case where the partition coefficient pmax cannot.

comparison to other methods
having defined the entropy, we next investigated its performance relative to the most widely-used methods, on a public profiling dataset of  <dig> inhibitors on  <dig> non-mutant kinases  <cit>  . the values for gini score, s, s and partition coefficient, were taken from earlier work  <cit> . to this we added a ka-gini value and the selectivity entropy. the ka-gini is a gini score directly calculated on kas, without reverting to %-inhibition values . from each of these scores we determined an inhibitor selectivity ranking, and a rank order difference compared to the entropy method . in addition, to get an overview of the profiling raw data  <cit> , we appended an activity-based heat map .

values for various selectivity metrics. in the additional file  <dig>  this table is extended with compound rank ordering and rank differences, and colour coded for clarity.

from the rankings it is apparent that each of the earlier methods such as the classic gini score, s and s generate considerable ranking differences compared to all other methods. this was observed earlier  <cit> . for the gini score, this is related to the conversion from ic <dig> to %-inhibition, because the ka-gini gives more consistent rankings. for the s and the s, the use of a cut-off is likely too coarse an approach. for instance in the case of s, there are six inhibitors with a score of  <dig>  making it impossible to distinguish between those highly specific compounds.

the newer methods such as pmax, ka-gini, and the selectivity entropy, give a more consistent ranking between them. for example, all three methods have pi- <dig>  ci- <dig>  gw <dig>  vx- <dig> and gefitinib in their selectivity top five. there are differences however, most strikingly illustrated by the inhibitor sb- <dig>  this is ranked by pmax as 31st most selective, but by ka-gini and the selectivity entropy as 15th and 14th . also s ranks this alk <dig> inhibitor  <cit>  as selective. however, sb- <dig> hits four kinases with very similar ic50s between 100- <dig> nm, which leads to a broad partitioning over these kinases, resulting in a very promiscuous pmax of  <dig> . the partition coefficient therefore ranks sb- <dig> as almost equally selective to sunitinib . nevertheless, sunitinib inhibits  <dig> kinases below  <dig> μm, and sb- <dig> only  <dig>  therefore we think that ka-gini and the selectivity entropy are a better 'general' measure of selectivity in this case.

another inhibitor scored differently is mln- <dig>  <cit> , which ranks 26st by pmax, but 14th and 15th by ka-gini and the selectivity entropy . again, these differences arise because this inhibitor hits  <dig> kinases with roughly equal potencies between 2- <dig> nm, leading to a promiscuous pmax . however, mln- <dig> only hits  <dig> kinases below  <dig> μm, making it intuitively more selective than e.g. zd- <dig>  <cit>  , which hits  <dig> kinases below  <dig> μm. these cases illustrate the earlier point that pmax underscores inhibitors that only hit a few kinases at comparable potencies. the gini score and selectivity entropy assign a higher selectivity to these cases.

finally, any selectivity score should be in line with the visual ranking from a heat map. the additional file  <dig> shows that, generally, compounds with a higher entropy indeed have a busier heat map. a few exceptions stand out, which by eye appear more promiscuous than their entropy ranking indicates, for instance su- <dig>  sunitinib and staurosporin. however, these compounds have extreme low kds on selected targets . therefore they are relatively selective over activities in the 1- <dig> nm range, whereas these activities still fall within the highlighted ranges in uitdehaag_s <dig>  in a sense, the large dynamic range of the data limits visual assessment through a heat map.

consistency across profiling methods
as a next step we selected  <dig> compounds from the public profile   <cit> , and measured activity data on these using a different profiling service . the  <dig> compounds represent a diversity of molecular scaffolds, promiscuity and target classes . also for these new data, we calculated the selectivity metrics . in the ideal case, the selectivity values are similar irrespective of profiling technology . the data of both methods are plotted in figure  <dig> 

all metrics except the entropy and pmax tend to be quite unevenly distributed. for instance all ka-gini scores fall between  <dig>  and  <dig> , where they can theoretically range from  <dig> to  <dig>  if we nevertheless calculate the correlation statistics between both datasets, the r-square from linear regression and the correlation indicate that the selectivity entropy, s and ka-gini are the most robust methods .

it would be ideal if the absolute value of the metrics could also be compared between datasets. this means that a specificity of e.g.  <dig>  in the first profile, would also score  <dig>  in the second profile. to get insight in this, we calculated the best fit to a 1: <dig> correlation , using normalized data. the ka-gini score was rescaled to its useful range of  <dig> - <dig>  , and then fitted. the s and the selectivity entropy have the best fit. the fact that here the ka-gini performs poorer is probably caused by the use of cumulative inhibition values , which leads to the accumulation of errors .

in all fits, the pmax and s scores show worse fits and more scatter, indicating that these methods generate more error in their final value. for s and for pmax, this is because both methods make use of a reference value, usually the most potent ic <dig>  and errors in this reference value propagate more than errors in other ic50s. ideally, for s and pmax, the reference value specifically would have to be more accurately established.

if all analyses are taken together, the selectivity entropy avoids many pitfalls of the other methods , shows consistent compound ranking , and is among the most robust methods across profiling datasets . for this reason, we propose the entropy method as the best metric for general selectivity.

defining average selectivity
quantification of selectivity helps to define when a compound is selective or promiscuous. because of its consistency, the entropy method is ideally suited for benchmarking selectivity values. in the 290-kinase profiling dataset, the entropies are monomodally distributed, with an average of  <dig>   and a standard deviation  of  <dig>  . based on the correlation in figure  <dig>  it is expected that these statistics will be conserved in other profiling sets. therefore, in general, a kinase compound with an entropy less than about  <dig> can be called selective, and more than  <dig> promiscuous. this provides a first quantitative definition of kinase selectivity.

selectivity of allosteric inhibitors
it is generally thought that allosteric kinase inhibitors  are more selective  <cit> . the selectivity entropy now allows quantitative testing of this idea. we identified, from literature, which inhibitors in the profiling datasets are type ii and iii, based on x-ray structures. sorafenib induces the kinase dfg-out conformation in b-raf  <cit> , nilotinib and gleevec in abl  <cit> , gw- <dig> in fms  <cit>  and birb- <dig> in p38α  <cit> . lapatinib induces a c-helix shift in egfr  <cit> . pd- <dig>  <cit>  and azd- <dig> induce a c-helix shift in mek <dig>  <cit> . all other kinase inhibitors in the profile were labelled type i. comparing the entropy distributions in both samples shows that type ii/iii inhibitors have significantly lower entropies . although other factors, such as the time at which a compound was developed, could influence the entropy differences, the correlation between low entropy and allostery strongly supports the focus on allostery for developing specific inhibitors  <cit> .

among the specific inhibitors in the type i category, 3d-structures of pi- <dig>  ci- <dig> and vx- <dig> bound to their targets have not been determined. therefore, potentially, these inhibitors could also derive their specificity from a form of undiscovered induced fit. indeed, vx-745-related compounds induce a peptide flip near met109/gly <dig> in p38α  <cit> . of the five most selective compounds in table  <dig>  only gefitinib so far is undoubtedly a type i inhibitor  <cit> , making this egfr inhibitor an interesting model for the structural biology of non-allosteric specificity.

use of selectivity measures in nuclear receptor profiling
selectivity profiling is most advanced in the kinase field, but is emerging in other fields. to illustrate that selectivity metrics such as the entropy can also be used with other target families, we investigated a long-standing question in the nuclear receptor field: are non-steroidal ligands more selective than steroidals?  <cit> . for this, we calculated the entropies of a published profile of  <dig> antagonists on a panel of  <dig> steroid receptors  <cit>  . this shows that there are no statistically significant selectivity differences between steroidals and non-steroidals . a more important determinant for selectivity could be, in parallel to kinase inhibitors, if a ligand induces a conformational change. indeed, many nuclear receptor agonists are known to induce a transformation from a flexible receptor to a rigid agonistic form  <cit> , or a heterodimer form  <cit> . in contrast, antagonists are know to displace helix  <dig> specifically from the agonistic form  <cit> . thus, the large role of induced fit in ligand binding to nuclear receptors might explain the relative high selectivity of these ligands  <cit> .

use in hit prioritization
aside from solving questions in the structure-function area, the selectivity entropy can be used during drug discovery. previously it has been shown that selectivity metrics can be used in lead optimization projects to classify compounds, set targets, and rationalize improvement  <cit> . in addition, metrics such as the entropy are useful in evaluating screening data, especially now screening larger compound collections in parallel assays is increasingly popular.

we downloaded pubchem data of  <dig> compounds tested in a panel of four assays for regulators of g protein signalling   <cit> . these data were selected because they were publicly available and were neither a kinase nor a nuclear receptor panel. in addition the data were dose-response, were all in a similar assay format, and were ran in the same lab with the same compound set.

we calculated the compound entropies across the rgs panel, and used them for ranking, which immediately distinguishes the scaffolds that are specific . the best are id  <dig>  a pyrazole-phenoxy derivative, and id  <dig>  a bicyclo-octane derivative, which are likely to be better lead optimization starting points than more promiscuous scaffolds. triaging compounds by entropy is a far more time-efficient and unbiased way than manual evaluation of four parallel columns of data. indeed, listing of the selectivity entropy in public databases of screening data would provide users with immediate information on scaffold promiscuity.

selectivity and clinical outcome
finally, the selectivity entropy can be used to study clinical success. selective compounds are generated because they are thought to be less toxic and therefore better doseable to effective ranges  <cit> . to test the hypothesis that clinically approved inhibitors are more selective, we binned the compounds in the public kinase profile  <cit>  according to their clinical history, and calculated their average entropies . compared to the average discontinued compound, the average marketed kinase inhibitor is not more selective, and the average phase iii compound is even significantly more aselective. to exclude therapy area effects, we also performed the analysis for compounds in the oncology area, which is the only therapeutic area with a statistically significant amount of projects. this leads to a similar conclusion . to exclude effects of time from this analysis , we repeated the analysis for compounds that entered clinical phase i before  <dig>  this shows even more clearly that more succesful compounds are, if anything, more broadly selective .

behind such statistics lies the success of, for instance, the spectrum selective drugs dasatinib, sorafenib and sunitinib , and the failure of the highly selective mek-targeted drugs pd- <dig> and ci- <dig> . because 66-100% of the analysed compounds in each clinical bin are  developed for oncology, our conclusion is primarily valid for oncology, until more kinase inhibitors enter the clinic for other indications. nevertheless, the finding that a selective kinase inhibitor has fewer chances of surviving early clinical trials fuels the notion that polypharmacology is sometimes required to achieve effect   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in order to quantify compound selectivity as a single value, based on data from profiling in parallel assays, we have presented a selectivity entropy method, and compared this to other existing methods. the best method should avoid artifacts that obscure compound ranking, and show consistent values across profiling methods. based on these criteria, the selectivity entropy is the best method.

a few cautionary notes are in order. first, the method is labelled an entropy in the sense of information theory  <cit> , which is different to entropy in the sense of vibrational modes in enzyme active sites. whereas these vibrations can form a physical basis for selectivity  <cit> , our method is a computational metric to condense large datasets.

secondly, any selectivity metric that produces a general value does not take into account the specific importance of individual targets. therefore, the entropy is useful for generally characterizing tool compounds and drug candidates, but if particular targets need to be hit, or avoided, the kds on these individual targets need to be monitored. it is possible to calculate an entropy on any particular panel of all-important targets, or to assign a weighing factor to every kinase, as suggested for pmax  <cit>  and calculate a weighted entropy. however, the practicality of this needs to be assessed.

next, it is good custom to perform profiling in biochemical assays at  = km-atp, because this generates ic50s that are directly related to the atp-independent kd value. however, in a cellular environment, there is a constant high  atp concentration and therefore a biochemically selective inhibitor will act with different specificity in a cell. if the inhibitor has a specificity for a target with a km,atp above the panel average, then that inhibitor will act even more specifically in a cell and vice versa . selectivity inside the cell is also determined by factors such as cellular penetration, compartimentalization and metabolic activity  <cit> . therefore, selectivity from biochemical panel profiling is only a first step in developing selective inhibitors.

another point is that any selectivity metric is always associated with the assay panel used, and the entropy value will change if an inhibited protein is added to the panel. adding a protein that does not bind inhibitor will not affect the entropy value. in this way the discovery of new inhibitor targets by e.g. pulldown experiments, can change the idea of inhibitor selectivity, and also the entropy value. a good example is pi- <dig>  the most selective inhibitor in table  <dig>  which in the literature is known as a dual pi3-kinase/mtor inhibitor  <cit> , and which appears specific in table  <dig> because pi3-kinase is not incorporated in the profiling panel.

in addition, an inhibitor that hits  <dig> kinases at  <dig> nm from a panel of  <dig> has the same selectivity entropy as an inhibitor that inhibits  <dig> kinases at  <dig> nm in a panel of  <dig>  however, intuitively, the second inhibitor is more specific . this illustrates that it is important to compare entropy scores on similar panels. at the same time, when results from different panels are weighed, as in the example, it should not be assumed for the first inhibitor, that it is inactive against all  <dig> other kinases in the second panel. it would be better to assign an average kd where measurements are missing. in that case the first inhibitor would score a more promiscuous entropy compared to the second inhibitor.

finally it must be stressed that the selectivity entropy could be applied in many more fields. it could, for instance, be a useful metric in the computational studies that attempt to link compound in vitro safety profiles to compound characteristics  <cit> . currently, that field uses various forms of 'promiscuity scores' which bear similarity to the selectivity score. a more robust and non-arbitrary metric such as the selectivity entropy could be of help in building more detailed pharmacological models of compound activity-selectivity relationships  <cit> .

in summary, the selectivity entropy is a very useful tool for making sense of large arrays of profiling data. we have demonstrated its use in characterizing tool compounds and drug candidates. many more applications are imaginable in fields where an array of data is available and the selectivity of a response needs to be assessed. in that sense, the selectivity entropy is a general aid in the study of selectivity.
