BACKGROUND
insulin stimulates glucose transport into fat and muscle by regulating translocation of the facilitative glucose transporter glut <dig> from an intracellular store to the plasma membrane   <cit> . in the absence of insulin, ~95% of cellular glut <dig> is sequestered within intracellular compartment, including specialised glut <dig> storage vesicles  <cit> . upon insulin stimulation, gsvs traffic to the pm, resulting in a 10- to 20-fold increase in pm glut <dig> levels  <cit> . this is achieved by an increase in the rate of exocytosis and an inhibition of endocytosis  <cit> .

glut <dig> is transported between various intracellular membrane-bound compartments by vesicular transport. membrane traffic in all eukaryotic cells is controlled by specific snare complexes  <cit> . members of the t- family of snare proteins mark specific organelles. the formation of complexes between t-snares and their cognate v- snare localised to the appropriate donor membrane is sufficient to catalyse bilayer fusion  <cit> , thus snares have been proposed to impart specificity to membrane traffic  <cit> . the t-snare complex consisting of syntaxin <dig> and snap- <dig>  controls fusion of glut4-containing vesicles with the pm, resulting in the final delivery of the transporter to the pm in response to insulin  <cit> . the predominant v-snare involved in this step is vamp <dig>  <cit> .

all snare complexes are subject to strict regulation to ensure that the trafficking steps they catalyse take place within the correct spatial and temporal coordinates. the sec1/munc <dig>  family of proteins are key regulators of syntaxin function  <cit> . the sm protein that binds to sx <dig> is munc18c  <cit> . adipocytes derived from mefs from munc18c knockout mice show enhanced glut <dig> translocation, suggesting that munc18c inhibits insulin-stimulated externalization of glut <dig>  this suggests that disruption of interaction between sx <dig> and munc18c might result in enhancement of insulin-stimulated glut <dig> translocation  <cit> . consistent with this, over-expression of munc18c was found to inhibit insulin-stimulated glut <dig> translocation in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes, as did peptides designed to inhibit the binding of munc18c to sx <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, munc18c was found to inhibit the fusion of artificial liposomes mediated by sx4/s- <dig> and vamp <dig> in vitro  <cit> , further supporting the notion of munc18c inhibiting fusion of glut <dig> vesicles with the pm.

how may negative regulation of sx <dig> by munc18c be alleviated upon insulin treatment? like many syntaxins, sx <dig> adopts two distinct conformations, a closed conformer with the habc domain folded back onto the snare domain  and an open conformation with the habc domain moved away from the snare domain. sm proteins have been shown to bind both of these conformations  <cit> : in mode  <dig>  the central cavity of arch-shaped sm proteins cradle their cognate syntaxin in a closed conformation; in mode  <dig> the open conformation of syntaxin generates a free n-terminus which inserts into a hydrophobic pocket on the opposite face of the sm protein. furthermore, it is now established that sm proteins can bind to their cognate snare ternary complex via a distinct mode , and it has been suggested that this mode of interaction between sm proteins and the snare machinery is of considerable importance  <cit> . using an in vitro assay of fusion, the interaction of the sm protein munc18a with its cognate snare complex accelerates fusion, with the sm protein making contact with both the t- and v-snares  <cit> . by contrast, in the same kind of assay, munc18c appears to act as an inhibitor of fusion  <cit> . such data suggest the possibility that insulin may modulate one these binding modes between sx <dig> and munc18c to modulate fusion, but how this may be achieved is unknown.

munc18c is known to become tyrosine phosphorylated  upon insulin stimulation of 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes  <cit> , but whether munc18c is a direct target of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase or whether another kinase is responsible is unknown. studies in β-cell lines have suggested phosphorylation of munc18c may be a crucial trigger for insulin granule fusion with the pm  <cit> . stimulation of 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes with insulin or platelet-derived growth factor  promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c, a modification that occurs concomitant with an observed dissociation of the sx-4/munc18c complex  <cit> . expression of a mutant form of munc18c  was found to inhibit pdgf-stimulated glut <dig> translocation, suggesting that the tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c may impact the trafficking machinery involved in glut <dig> mobilisation. however, the effect of the y521a mutant on insulin-stimulated glut <dig> trafficking remains unclear, since over-expression of both wild-type or mutant forms of munc18c both inhibited glut <dig> translocation  <cit> . although this latter study reveals that the sx4/munc18c complex is dissociated concomitant with tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c, whether this is a direct effect of tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c was not addressed, and little is known regarding the consequences of tyrosine phosphorylation on the ability of munc18c to bind sx <dig>  to address this, we have used an in vitro approach to study the consequence of munc18c phosphorylation on its binding to sx <dig>  we show that munc18c is directly phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, and that this phosphorylation occurs only on residue  <dig>  once phosphorylated, munc18c is no longer able to bind monomeric sx <dig> by either mode  <dig> or mode  <dig>  similarly, a phospho-mimetic mutant of munc18c, y521e, is unable to bind to either sx <dig> or vamp <dig>  these data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c in response to insulin may trigger dissociation of munc18c from sx <dig>  thus facilitating the formation of a snare complex for vesicle fusion.

RESULTS
munc18c is directly phosphorylated by the insulin receptor in vitro
a proteomics based screen of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes revealed that munc18c exhibits a >10-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation on residue  <dig>  <cit> . as this screen did not inform on the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of any identified target nor reveal whether the kinase response was the insulin receptor itself, we sought to determine whether the insulin receptor can directly phosphorylate munc18c and if so, to what extent. to address this, we employed a recombinant protein corresponding to residues 941- <dig> of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor, the region containing the tyrosine kinase domain   <cit> . this protein, when expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected sf <dig> cells, mimics at least some of the reactions catalysed by the insulin receptor itself  <cit> . using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that cirk phosphorylates recombinant munc18c in a time- and dose-dependent manner, such that by  <dig> minutes ~30% of the munc18c in the reaction was phosphorylated . we next determined which residue of munc18c are phosphorylated by cirk in vitro by subjecting the samples to mass spectrometry . this revealed that the only residue of munc18c phosphorylated by cirk was tyrosine- <dig> , unequivocally demonstrating that, at least in vitro, munc18c is a direct target of the insulin receptor.

phosphorylation of munc18c abrogates binding to syntaxin  <dig> and vamp2
munc18c binds both the open and closed conformations of sx <dig>  as well as to the v-snare, vamp <dig>  <cit> . we therefore sought to determine whether phosphorylation of munc18c modulates these interactions. four different gst-tagged sx <dig> constructs immobilised on glutathione-sepharose were employed  <cit> : wild-type sx <dig>  sx4-open , sx <dig> lacking the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids  and a double mutant . these were incubated with munc18c pre-incubated with or without cirk . after incubation, the amount of munc18c associated with the sx4-proteins was determined by immunoblotting. figure 2a shows that munc18c was readily detected in complex with the wild-type gst-sx <dig> and the 'open' mutant, but was dramatically reduced for the n36Δ and double mutants, in agreement with previous studies  <cit> . following pre-incubation with cirk, a reduction in the amount of munc18c in complex with the sx <dig> species was evident .

in order to ascertain whether this reduction is a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of munc18c, we performed immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies . this revealed that none of the tyrosine phosphorylated munc18c was in association with any of the gst-sx <dig> species examined. under the conditions employed, cirk treatment resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of ~30% of the input munc18c. given that tyrosine phosphorylated munc18c cannot bind sx <dig>  this explains why the levels of munc18c in association with sx <dig>  detected by anti-munc18c, are reduced upon cirk treatment by ~30%, a figure in close agreement with the extent of munc18c phosphorylation observed under these conditions .

we have previously reported that munc18c binds the v-snare vamp <dig>  <cit> . we therefore examined whether this interaction is modulated by munc18c tyrosine phosphorylation . although munc18c readily bound gst-vamp <dig>  none of the pulled-down protein was immuno-reactive with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. collectively, our data suggest that munc18c is unable to interact with either its cognate syntaxin  or vamp <dig> when phosphorylated on y <dig> 

a phosphomimetic mutant of munc18c is unable to bind syntaxin  <dig> or vamp2
to substantiate these findings, we made a mutant of munc18c with y <dig> replaced by the  bulky negative residue glutamate ; although not aromatic, the side chain of glutamate is the biggest of the negatively charged amino acids and thus we hoped would function as a phosphomimetic. the characteristics of this protein were examined. the mutant was recognised by anti-munc18c and exhibited the expected molecular weight . the wild-type and mutant proteins exhibited similar far uv circular dichroism spectra, suggesting that munc18c-y521e exhibited little change in overall secondary structure compared to the wild-type protein, a conclusion further supported by the similar intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the two proteins . we therefore repeated the binding studies of figure  <dig>  this time using munc18c-y521e or wild-type munc18c. as shown in figure  <dig>  we were unable to detect any binding of munc18c-y521e to sx <dig> . in experiments not shown, we were unable to detect any interaction between munc18c-y521e and sx <dig> even with a ~50-fold excess of munc18c over sx <dig> , or when recombinant munc18c-y521e was immobilised to ni-agarose and incubated with recombinant sx <dig> 

these data support the notion that phosphorylation of munc18c on y <dig> may represent an insulin-controlled regulatory mechanism. although the structure of munc18c has been largely solved  <cit> , y <dig> is in an unstructured area, probably a flexible domain, located near the surface of the molecule. the structure reveals that y <dig> is close to the hydrophobic pocket into which the n-terminus of sx <dig> inserts in mode  <dig> binding  <cit> . however, this would not explain why cirk-phosphorylated munc18c or munc18c-y521e do not bind either closed sx <dig> or vamp <dig>  it is possible that the phosphorylation of y <dig> may cause a more significant structure change in munc18c, abrogating all binding modes, but cd and fluorescence analysis of the mutant suggests this is unlikely. regardless, our data suggest that y <dig> phosphorylation of munc18c abrogates binding to monomeric sx <dig> and vamp <dig>  and perhaps plays a role in insulin-stimulated snare-mediated delivery of glut <dig> to the pm. studies in which this mutant of munc18c is expressed in adipocytes at levels similar to wild-type protein in the absence of the endogenous munc18c will be important. at present, such studies are proving technically challenging, as over-expression of even wild-type munc18c significantly impairs glut <dig> translocation  <cit> . given our incomplete understanding of the functional role played by the different modes of munc <dig> binding, a future assessment of the consequences of munc18c phosphorylation on mode  <dig> binding to its cognate snare ternary complex will be informative.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented support the hypothesis that y <dig> phosphorylation of munc18c by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase abrogates binding to monomeric sx <dig> and vamp <dig>  suggesting that this event may play a role in insulin-stimulated snare-mediated delivery of glut <dig> to the pm.
