BACKGROUND
plant steroidal hormones, brassinosteroids , are central to supporting the proper growth and development of plants. as a result, br biosynthetic and response mutants exhibit phenotypes characterized by severe growth deficiencies. mutants of various species, including arabidopsis, pea, tomato, rice, barley, and morning glory, have been found and shown to display similar phenotypes of growth deficiency  <cit> .

brassinolide , the most active br and an end product of the br biosynthetic pathway in arabidopsis, is synthesized from sterols, including campesterol or cholesterol  <cit> . of the enzymes involved in br biosynthesis, the c22-Î±-hydroxylase dwarf <dig>  mediates a rate-determining step  <cit> . after going through this step, intermediates possess dramatically increased bioactivities  <cit> . as such, the enzymatic steps could be classified as enzymes active before and after dwf <dig>  the enzymes dwarf1/dim1/cbb <dig>  <cit> , dwarf <dig>  <cit> , dwarf <dig>  <cit> , and de-etiolated <dig>  <cit>  act before dwf <dig>  whereas constitutive photomorphogenesis and dwarfism   <cit> , rotundafolia <dig>   <cit> , cytochrome p <dig>   <cit>  and br6-oxidase   <cit>  are active after dwf <dig>  depending on the species and especially in rice, br biosynthetic pathways culminate at castasterone  which serves as the primary bioactive br, rather than bl  <cit> . the two bioactive brs in arabidopsis, cs and bl, are perceived by a plasma membrane-localized receptor complex composed of bri <dig> and bak <dig>  <cit> . upon phosphorylation and activation by brs, the receptor complex dissociates a negative regulator bri <dig> kinase inhibitor <dig>   <cit> . bri <dig> suppressor <dig> , which is a protein phosphatase with a kelch-repeat domain, is bound by activated bsk <dig>  <cit>  to deactivate the negative regulator brassinosteroid-insensitive <dig>   <cit> , diminishing its negative regulatory effects  <cit> .

the transcription of br-dependent genes is regulated by a plant-specific family of transcription factors including brassinazol-resistant <dig>   <cit>  and bri1-ems-suppressor <dig>   <cit>  in arabidopsis. although bes <dig> and bzr <dig> share 88% identity at their amino acid sequences, the two transcription factors regulate their target genes differently; bes <dig> is involved in transcriptional activation  <cit> , and bzr <dig> both activates and represses transcription  <cit> . as such, constitutive br phenotypes are seen in the bes1-d mutant  <cit> , whereas the semi-dwarf phenotype is a characteristic of the light-grown bzr1-d mutant due to the repression of its target gene, dwf <dig>  <cit> .

as compared with the roles that brs play in cell elongation, their effects on cell division have not received as much focus in studies to date. earlier research suggested that brs stimulate cell division  <cit> , which was based on observations of the effects of brs on cultures of suspension cells or protoplasts. at the molecular level, it was found that the stimulation of cell division in the br biosynthetic mutant de-etiolated <dig> results from the activation of the cycd <dig> gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . in addition to the callus or protoplast system, clearer evidence was provided by a recent paper showing that br-deficient mutants exhibit fewer numbers of cells in the provascular ring of inflorescences, resulting in a reduced number of vascular bundles in these mutants  <cit> .

using arabidopsis mutants that are defective in br biosynthesis, dwf7- <dig>  we investigated the role of brs in cell division. we examined the differences in the establishment of mutant-derived calli, shoot regeneration from calli or directly from root explants. in addition, we employed flow cytometric analyses to look at cell cycle progression. finally, the transcript levels of the genes involved in cell division and cell differentiation were tested in wild type and br mutants. our results provide evidence that brs actively regulate cell division in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
a br biosynthetic mutant displays differences in callus induction rate
the exogenous application of brassinosteroids was previously shown to simulate cell division during callus culture. to test whether the endogenous alteration of the br levels affects the callus induction and cell division rates, a mutant defective in br biosynthesis, dwf7- <dig>  was subjected to callus induction. figure 1a illustrates the seedling phenotypes of the ws- <dig> wild type and dwf7- <dig>  as compared with the wild type, dwf7- <dig> exhibited more severe dwarfism due to defects in br biosynthesis. when calli were induced from root explants, br mutants successfully established visually discernable calli after  <dig> days. figure 1b displays the morphology of the representative calli grown for  <dig> days after the induction from root explants. noticeably, the size of calli from dwf7- <dig> is smaller relative to the wild type .

the slower growth of the mutant could be due to either slower cell division or slower cell growth or both, but in any case, it is obvious that brs are important to this process.

the br biosynthetic gene dwarf <dig> is actively expressed in calli
to examine whether brs are required during callus establishment, we checked the expression level of the dwf <dig> promoter-gus reporter gene  <cit> . as part of an important rate-determining step, dwf <dig> expression was proposed to represent tissues with enriched br levels  <cit> .

first, in vivo gus assays revealed that dwf <dig> is strongly expressed in both wild-type and dwf7- <dig> calli  <cit> . this in vivo gus assay was further visualized by gus histochemical staining . the dark blue staining, signifying gus activity, was prominent in both the wild type and dwf7- <dig> relative to the control calli that were not stained with gus . because we previously found that exogenously supplied auxin resulted in dwf <dig> induction, we examined another set of calli after washing off the auxin that had been added to the callus induction medium .the washed calli also displayed a similar pattern . both the results from the gus histochemical assay and the in vivo gus activity tests imply that brs are required to maintain the calli status  <cit> .

the ratios of cells at g2/m vs. g <dig> phases are low in dwf7-1
because we observed that br mutants display different rates of callus induction, we tested whether this is associated with a difference in cell division rates. to do this, we measured the dna content in the nuclei of each callus using flow cytometry. figure  <dig> illustrates the results with a 100% stacked column chart. the percentage of cells in the three phases of the cell cycle--g <dig>  s, and g2/m--were evaluated by the partec software.

when cell division indices  were compared, the portion of wild-type cells in g <dig> phase gradually decreased with time, whereas the portion in s and g2/m phases increased. this suggests that wild-type cells are synthesizing dna and dividing until the 9th day after transfer to fresh medium. in dwf7- <dig> cells, both phases remained relatively stable; g2/m at their 30s and g <dig> at 50s percentage.

the ratios of g2/m vs. g <dig> were then compared. wild type increased from  <dig>  at day  <dig> to  <dig>  at day  <dig>  however, the ratios were relatively stable in dwf7- <dig> cells, holding at  <dig> - <dig>  regardless of time, suggesting that it takes longer for dwf7- <dig> callus cells to finish one round of cell division.

a br mutant displays differential level of shoot induction from calli
we next aimed to test whether a br deficiency affects the shoot induction rate. two different routes were taken; shoots were induced from calli and directly from root explants.

first, the calli established from each genotype were subject to shoot regeneration in shoot induction medium  with different combinations of auxin and cytokinin concentrations; auxin concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mg/l and cytokinin concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mg/l. on each medium of the  <dig> combinatorial sims, three to nine calli were grown for  <dig> weeks to establish shoots. one representative was chosen for illustration in the figure 4a. overall, wild-type calli produced shoots at broad ranges of auxin and cytokinin concentrations. as visible evidence of shoot induction, the calli turned green and produced elongated inflorescences with leaf structures. dwf7- <dig> calli displayed only marginal signs of shoot induction; parts of calli turned green, but almost no shoots were produced .

to present the results more quantitatively, we transformed the degree of shoot induction into arbitrary numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and displayed them using three dimensional charts . we assigned the numbers  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to calli having no shoots, greening only, and visible shoots, respectively; thus, a number close to  <dig> meant that most of the calli tested at the specific combination of auxin and cytokinin produced visible shoots, whereas a number closer to  <dig> indicated that none of the calli formed visible shoots. of the  <dig> different concentration combinations, the wild type produced shoots at the broadest ranges . however, shoot induction was noticeably low in dwf7- <dig> calli.

shoots were also directly induced from root explants. figure 4c summarizes the results. wild type displayed vigorous shoot induction; explants produced visibly elongated inflorescences with leaves. in contrast, dwf7- <dig> calli barely displayed shoot induction; developed calli turned green but made only primordial leaves. the lower rates of shoot induction observed in the mutant suggests that brs are central to controlling cell differentiation as well as division.

populations of dividing cells are smaller in the roots of dwf7- <dig> relative to wild-type cells
to examine cell division in the roots of intact plants, the percentage of cells in the three phases of the cell cycle--g <dig>  s, and g2/m--were evaluated with the partec software. the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  when ws- <dig> wild-type and dwf7- <dig> cells were compared, the ratios of cells in the three phases clearly showed differences; the percentage of cells undergoing dna synthesis and mitosis greatly decreased from  <dig> to 13% for s phase and from  <dig> to 19% for g2/m phase. this coincided with an increase in the proportion of g <dig> cells by about 15%. the dramatically decreased ratios observed in the mutant as compared with their parental wild types suggest that cell division is delayed due to decreased br activities in this mutant.

genes of br biosynthesis and cell division show differential expression patterns
to understand the differences in cell division at the molecular level, we examined the steady state levels of transcripts for the genes involved in br biosynthesis and cell division. as a control, we included rna from whole plants grown for  <dig> days in the light. figure  <dig> shows the results. the expression levels of the two br biosynthetic genes, dwf <dig> and br6ox <dig>  increased in the calli of both dwf7- <dig> and wild type . this demonstrates that the br biosynthetic activity is generally upregulated in the callus stage. in contrast, the steady state levels of rbr <dig>  pcna <dig>  and cyclin d3; <dig>  in the two calli stayed unchanged relative to the seedling control.

previously, it was shown that two genes, esr <dig> and arabidopsis response regulator <dig> , are regulated in opposite ways during shoot induction; esr <dig> increases but arr <dig> decreases  <cit> . we found that esr <dig> levels noticeably decreased in dwf7- <dig> relative to whole seedlings and wild type, whereas arr <dig> level stayed high in dwf7- <dig>  furthermore, a gene that is putatively involved in somatic embryogenesis, somatic embryogenesis related kinase  <dig> , slightly increased in the wild-type callus. in contrast, the level of pcna <dig> transcripts representing the status of an active replication of nuclei dna was significantly low in dwf7- <dig>  the lower levels of both pcna <dig> and esr <dig> observed in dwf7- <dig> imply that brs are required to induce both the two genes, and this might be associated with the lower rate of cell division and shoot induction in the dwf7- <dig> mutant, as shown in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that dwf <dig> is strongly expressed in dividing callus cells . previously, we reported that dwf <dig> was rarely expressed in the limited tissues of intact plants  <cit>  and that its expression led to increased levels of bioactive brs. the expression of dwf <dig> in calli suggests that brs play important roles in supporting the dividing callus cells. in addition, we found that the portion for the number of dividing cells was smaller in the roots of the br mutant relative to wild type, which clearly indicates that brs are positive regulators of cell division. furthermore, we showed that shoot induction rates, which depend on the coordination of cell differentiation processes, were lower in the br deficient mutant, dwf7- <dig>  because the expression levels of the esr <dig> gene were also lower in dwf7- <dig> mutant, it is likely that brs take part in controlling shoot induction via regulation of the esr <dig> gene. taken all together, it is evident that brs control both cell division and differentiation. future research should work toward developing a detailed mechanism of br control over sets of genes that are involved in cell division.
