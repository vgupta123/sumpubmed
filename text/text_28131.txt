BACKGROUND
promoters are well-characterized transcriptional cis-regulatory sequences in complex genomes  <cit> . they generally locate immediately upstream of a transcription start site  and have a variety of sequence motifs that participate in gene regulation  <cit> . the key elements include transcription factor binding sites , short tandem repeat , g-quadruplex , and cpg island , which are frequently co-localized and otherwise integrated into combined motifs. given these cis-regulatory dna sequences contain tfbss and/or other regulatory modules that play a critical role in transcription, mutations that either alter affinity of tfbss or disrupt spacing between existing tfbss have the potential to affect cis-regulatory activity  <cit> . throughout the last decade, empirical data have accumulated suggesting that mutations in regulatory elements could be a major cause of phenotypic divergence .

recent studies have shown that eukaryotic promoters are rich in repetitive sequences — approximately 25% of yeast  genes contain at least one str in their regulatory elements  <cit> . in humans, the short tandem repeats in regulatory regions table  has shown that  <dig>  strs are present in the upstream regulatory region of  <dig>  genes  <cit> . recently, genes driven by repeat-containing promoters are reported to have significantly higher rates of transcriptional divergence than those without repeat elements, as corroborated by in vitro experiments showing that the gain or loss of str units within promoters yields quantitative differences in gene expression  <cit> . for example, the ews/fli protein, which belongs to est-type transcription factor , directly binds to ggaa-motifs in the glutathione s-transferase m <dig> promoter, and transcriptional activity is highly dependent upon the number of repeats . these facts, together with a higher conservation rate of strs in regions proximal to tsss than that in distal regions  <cit> , strongly support a significant role for tandem repeats in differential transcriptional regulation.

other dna sequence motifs that affect chromatin structure have the potential to impact on gene expression by changing the accessibility of transcription and regulatory proteins to the dna. g <dig> is one such sequence motif that has a four-stranded dna structure held together by four or more tandem guanine tracts  <cit> . recent work has shown that ~60% of the genes in warm-blooded animals represented by human, mouse, and chicken have at least one potential g-quadruplex sequence  within the 5 kb region upstream of tss  <cit> . some of the g <dig> sequences so far examined appear to act as silencer elements in the promoter regions  <cit> . the clearest evidence for a role of g <dig> structure in transcriptional regulation comes from empirical study of the onco-gene c-myc  <cit> . disruption of g <dig> motifs in the c-myc promoter resulted in increased gene expression, whereas stabilization of the g <dig> decreased transcription, raising the strong possibility that g <dig> formation affects the deposition of regulatory proteins and histones on double-stranded dna  <cit> .

cpg islands are cg-rich stretches that have been found in approximately half of mammalian promoters at or near the tss  <cit> . in vertebrates, promoters with cgi are characterized by the presence of many tss and high transcriptional activity in multiple tissues, whereas promoters without cgis are defined by a single tss and show tightly regulated expression in specific tissues  <cit> . correlations between gene ontologies  and cgi length hint at the important role of cgi in higher-order chromatin structures via methylation  <cit> . most of the cgis in chicken promoters remain hypomethylated, contributing to nucleosome-free regions over the promoter  <cit> . open cgi/cg-rich promoters would naturally lack nucleosome scaffolds that are required to adopt an open conformation, and different histone modification patterns have been observed between genes with or without cgi promoters  <cit> .

stochastic and spatial data on the aforementioned sequence motifs that may modify chromatin structure and affect transcription are essential for understanding the nature of regulatory complexity in higher organisms. in this study we investigate the enrichment and arrangement of several sequence motifs within chicken  promoters to shed light on compositional structure in avian promoter sequences and their association with gene functions. birds are hypothesized to have diverged from a common ancestor with mammals around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . thus, it is of interest to investigate whether previous findings on the distribution and abundance of sequence motifs in mammalian promoters would be consistent with those derived from chicken promoters, given the significant divergence times and very different evolutionary trajectories these lineages have followed.

RESULTS
gc content and cpg island density
chicken promoter sequences had considerable variation in their gc contents, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, and their overall average was  <dig> % . the average g + c ratio increased gradually as it approached the tss . a sharp decline detected in the core promoter region  was presumably attributed to the presence of a tata box. the newcpgreport software identified  <dig>  cgis in promoter regions, and the number of cgis-containing genes reached to  <dig>  . this was almost the same with that reported elsewhere  <cit> , even though search conditions were not exactly the same. the distribution of cpg observed/expected  ratio was slightly lower  as compared with the previous report  <cit>  . this might be due to the fact that some of cgis identified in this study were truncated at tss. we referred to the chicken promoters harboring long cgis  as “long cgi”  promoters, because they occupied the top10% of the genes in terms of cgi length. “no cgi”  promoter was hereafter used to refer to promoters without cgi.figure  <dig>

abundance of short tandem repeats and g-quadruplexes in chicken promoters
table  <dig> summarizes the frequencies of str motifs in chicken and other mammalian promoters as well as those identified in the entire chicken genome. the total number of strs observed in chicken promoters was almost equivalent to that observed in both duck and zebra finch promoters. in all avian species, approximately 10% of genes had at least  <dig> perfect repeat units of 2– <dig> nucleotide str in 2 kb upstream region from tss, whereas mouse and human promoters contained a much larger number of strs in the same regions. the number of str motifs counted per human promoter sequence was more than double that of chicken promoter. a rank correlation analysis showed that the str motif frequency in chicken promoter shares a significant level of similarity with all the promoter sets examined here . however, the comparison of str motif frequencies between chicken promoter and the entire chicken genome exhibited the lowest similarity values in all statistical parameters , confirming the paucity of strs previously described for this genome  <cit> . several str motifs also showed taxon-specific differences in their distribution. for example, avian promoters were distinguishable from those of mammals on the basis of a lower frequency of ag/ct motifs. the duck promoter contained an extremely low number of gc-rich str motifs such as cg and ccg.table  <dig>

chicken strs were not equally distributed, but rather varied over the region of promoters . a total of  <dig> pqss were identified in the chicken promoters but unlike strs, pqss were especially accumulated in the core promoter region. the number of pqs identified in this study was much fewer than that previously reported in transcriptional regulatory region of chicken genome  <cit> . this was probably due to differences in the stringency of pqs screening as well as in length of target promoter region.

heterogeneity in the pattern of str expansion between avian and mammalian promoters
the pattern of str unit expansion was quite different between avian and mammalian promoters. all avian promoters examined here exhibited a similar trend of str expansion with significantly larger number of str units in tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide  repeats against dinucleotide repeats . while human and mouse promoters were characterized with much longer dinucleotide repeats as compared with the tetranucleotide repeats . the number of dinucleotide repeat units was significantly lower in chicken promoters than that of human , but the reverse was true for tetranucleotide repeats, which are prevalent in chicken versus human .figure  <dig>

distribution of sequence motifs in conjunction with cpg islands
some chicken promoters contained multiple sequence motifs, which either co-existed with or were integrated with cgis. the maximum number of cgi, str, and pqs identified in a single promoter was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the relative abundance of strs did not change the rate of multiple cgis, and vice versa. however, the co-existence of pqss significantly affected the cgi number in promoter regions ; p < <dig> ; additional file 3). the number of strs that overlapped with cgi motifs was significantly different between di- and trinucleotide repeats . most of dinucleotide strs were located upstream of cgis, whereas a higher proportion of trinucleotide repeats was found to be overlapped with cgis. we anticipated that almost all of pqss would be found to overlap with cgis, but actually  <dig> % of pqss located in up- or down-stream of the cgi.figure  <dig>

low repeat number and positional bias of trinucleotide repeats in chicken promoter
the average number of trinucleotide repeat units were the smallest both in avian and mammalian promoters in all str periods. all chicken trinucleotide repeats were divided into four groups that had different numbers of guanine or cytosine bases in each repeat unit . figure 3b shows different pattern of trinucleotide str distribution between 100%gc and low gc group . the motifs with 100%gc distributed mostly in the proximal and core regions, while 33% and 0%gc motifs were predominantly found in the distal part of promoter.

conserved motifs identified in the chicken promoter
the meme suite  <cit>  was used to detect conserved motifs that might affect gene regulation. the most and second most common blocks in the chicken promoter were poly-a and poly-g prevalent in promoter regions . both polypurine repeats were relatively constant in the motif frequencies through the distal promoter , but gradually increased through the proximal region . both motifs were characterized by a steep increase in the core promoter region . the other motif cgcg also appeared in the distal promoter, but was seldom seen either in proximal or in core regions. this motif was compared to known motifs in jaspar vertebrates  <cit>  and uniprobe mouse database  <cit>  by tomtom  <cit>  ver  <dig> . <dig>  as a result, the following  <dig> tf motifs were detected with significant level of similarities ; zfp <dig>  tfap <dig>  zic <dig>  nhlh <dig>  zbtb <dig>  zic <dig>  zeb <dig>  osr <dig>  tcf <dig>  and gfi1b. approximately 10% of chicken promoters contained a tata box in their core region and the number and location of tata boxes in the chicken promoters were comparable to those reported in the genome-wide analysis of mammalian promoters, showing - <dig> and - <dig> from tss as the preferred sites  <cit> .figure  <dig>

gene functions associated with sequence motifs
for functional annotation analysis using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery  program  <cit> , chicken promoters were grouped into four sets of genes depending on the presence or absence of sequence motifs . the heat map shown in figure  <dig> clearly illustrates a bias in biological processes that exhibit significant probabilities. pqss were predominantly detected in the genes associated with development and morphogenesis, while genes with strs were less correlated with the particular go terms. lcgi promoters were strongly associated with gene functions related to regulation of transcription and gene expression, whereas ncgi promoters associated with other gene functions such as immune response and cognition. a full list of go categories found to be correlated with the sequence motifs is presented in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, we show that chicken promoter sequences share some, but not all features with the human and mouse promoters. although the frequency and variety of str motif were highly conserved even between avian and mammalian promoters, chicken promoters had the least similarity with the entire chicken genome in terms of str motif frequency. this finding is partly supported by previous data that showed the predominant str motifs found in promoter region  were quite distinct from those detected in the other part of genes , coding, intron, and 3′ utr) both in human and mouse  <cit> . the ac/gt was the most common motif in all the promoter sequences examined in this study, but ag/ct motifs were predominantly found in human 5′ utr and coding regions  <cit> . the inconsistency of predominant str motifs between promoter and adjacent non-promoter regions seems to support the previous suggestion that str motifs in promoters can alter gene expression as they expand or contract, with particular attention to secondary structures  <cit> . considering that n dinucleotide repeats have a propensity to form z-dna and occasionally block the movement of rna polymerase when it occurs downstream of the tss  <cit> , repeat expansion or contraction of this motif might be constrained by the conformation of other sequence motifs that participate in transcriptional regulation. hence, the ac/gt motif may be regarded as the most frequently used “tuning knob”, as demonstrated by bayele et al.  <cit> , and this role appears to be evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates.

however, there are some points of difference in the str motif frequencies and their expansion between avian and mammalian promoters. in mammalian promoters, the number of tetranucleotide str units was significantly lower than those of avian promoters. one possible explanation of this pattern is that the expansion of tetranucleotide repeats might have been subjected to purifying selection to preserve some functions in human promoters. such a scenario is also consistent with the frequently reported associations between tetranucleotide expansion and human diseases  <cit> . for instance, alteration in array length of taaa affected the level of nada transcription through modulation of the binding of the transcription factor ihf  <cit> . another study on human prostate cancer also suggested an involvement of taaa tandem repeats as mediators of the expression of pca <dig> gene  <cit> . further investigation is needed to elucidate any lineage-specific preference for str expansion in vertebrate promoters.

another important finding is that the density of strs in the chicken promoter region is much lower than that estimated for human promoter. taking into account that avian genomes contain much less strs than mammals  <cit> , it may simply reflect the difference in the occurrence rate of slippage-like indels across organisms, as suggested by kruglyak et al.  <cit> . in this case the higher gc contents observed in chicken promoters  <cit>  as well as relatively small genome size  <cit>  are plausible reasons for the lower occurrence rate of slippage events.

several previous works have shown cis-regulatory motifs to be constrained in a position- and/or distance-specific manner  <cit> . strs are among the most plausible factors contributing to the changing spaces between functional elements in promoters. our data clearly showed that the distribution and expansion of str in chicken promoters are largely different among repeat unit classes. dinucleotide tandem repeats were mainly found in non-cpg sites, whereas a higher rate of trinucleotide repeats were overlapped with cgi, with fewer repeats. therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the expansion of trinucleotide strs in chicken promoter is constrained either by a position and distance limitation or by direct targeting of tf. furthermore, trinucleotide repeats showed skewed distribution between high and low ratio of guanine/cytosine in the repeat unit . this finding is of great interest since the previous study on str abundance in the chicken genome demonstrated that the rate of str polymorphisms increases in high gc group , exclusively in trinucleotide tandem repeats  <cit> . this discrepancy may be explained by the significant role of the trinucleotide tandem repeats as an enhancer/modulator of transcription in the core promoter region  <cit> . a previous in vitro experiment also supports the significance of 100% gc trinucleotide repeats as a key modulator of transcription, indicating that the insertion of  <dig> into the cyc1- lacz promoter increased gene expression about 10-fold, even other trinucleotide repeats of  <dig> and  <dig> had little effect  <cit> . all these facts imply that trinucleotide motifs with high guanine or cytosine contents, especially those found in the proximal and core promoter regions may have a pivotal role in the maintenance of an open chromatin structure, which will constrain str expansion. indeed, several studies clearly illustrated that gc-rich trinucleotide repeats are highly flexibility and possess a greater propensity to bend towards the major groove  <cit> .

motif identification using the meme software revealed several conserved motifs either in all or in particular part of chicken promoters. the poly-a was the most ubiquitous motif among them. previous studies indicated that polypurine motifs are the most common strs in the human genome and are particularly enriched in promoter regions  <cit> . it was suggested that poly-a might act to alter the stability or dynamics of nucleosomes, somehow enhancing the ability of gene activator proteins to bind nearby dna target sites  <cit> . this hypothesis is well supported by our observation that poly-a are especially abundant in the core promoter region where maintenance of open chromatin structure is necessary. in contrast, the abundance of poly-g in core promoter is likely to provide potential binding sites for sp <dig>  which is a crucial tf for the expression of some genes. for example, the human vascular endothelial growth factor  promoter contains a 39-bp poly-g sequence, located - <dig> to -50 bp relative to the tss, including three potential sp <dig> binding sites  <cit> . these independent studies give strong indications that sequence motifs - tfbs associations within the core promoter region may hold the key to deciphering the complexity of gene expression. in chicken promoters, we also detected another conserved motif, cgcg in the distal promoter. cooper et al. reported that negative elements to human promoter activity were identified - <dig> to -500 bp upstream of the tss by their deletion analyses  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the conserved motifs that are unique to the distal part of the promoter may have some role as negative regulators of promoter activity.

cgis are deeply involved in gene regulatory processes  <cit> . in particular, the length of cgis is a pivotal factor in determining the number of rna polymerase ii binding sites in mammalian promoters  <cit> . in this study, lcgi promoters were strongly associated with the biological processes such as “regulation of transcription”  and “transcription” , whereas ncgi promoters were significantly involved in gene function that linked with “neurological system process”  and “defence response” . in addition, some of go categories related with development and morphogenesis were moderately associated with lcgi promoters. these findings are analogous to the results obtained in mammalian promoters  <cit> , indicating that an association between cgi lengths and particular gene functions is conserved, at least within warm-blooded vertebrates. in other words, we find that both the pattern of tissue-specific gene expression  <cit>  and the motif-specific expression patterns are evolutionary conserved across the warm-blooded vertebrates. another intriguing finding is that chicken promoters with pqs motifs are generally correlated with go categories related to development and morphogenesis. it is notable that some specific biological processes such as  ear morphogenesis and heart development were not significantly correlated with lcgi but with pqs mediated promoters. this observation suggests that some pqss that are non-overlapping with cgi might play a decisive role in gene expression through the fine-tuning of transcriptional activity. this, together with the recent finding that cell proliferation/cell-cycle could be regulated by presence of pqs - tfbs combinations in mammalian promoters  <cit>  hint at the importance of positional context of sequence motifs. the case-by-case approach should be employed to reveal the underlying role of pqss as transcriptional regulators in chicken promoters.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper has provided novel findings from the investigation of sequence motifs in chicken promoter. the str motif frequency in chicken promoters is similar with both those of other avian and mammalian promoters, but relatively divergent from that of the rest of the chicken genome. we have also revealed that the pattern of str unit expansion is largely different between avian and mammalian promoters. these findings indicate that str sequence motifs in promoter regions are strongly conserved and may play roles in transcription regulation, but that lineage specific pressures on motif expansion may exist. although gc content in chicken promoter is higher than in mammals, the same pattern of correlations between biological processes and cgi lengths can be found in this study. moreover, we have shown that pqss are exclusively recognized in a set of genes involved in development and morphogenesis. searching for lineage-specific patterns of various sequence motifs in promoter regions will certainly extend our understanding of the relationship between structural complexity of promoters and functional consequences.
