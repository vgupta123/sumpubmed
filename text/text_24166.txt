BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  are multipotent adult stem cells with a high capacity for self-renewal and capable of differentiating into a variety of cell types, including adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes and neurons  <cit> . currently, mscs have been widely used in regenerative medicine  <cit> . the most common source of mscs is bone marrow mscs   <cit> . previous studies have shown that bmmsc transplantation has the potential to reduce infarct size and improve cardiac function in animal models of heart failure  <cit> . bmmscs are usually induced in vitro with special reagents for directional differentiation before transplantation. transforming growth factor beta  is one of the most commonly used biological reagents for inducing cardiomyocyte differentiation of mscs  <cit> .

senescence would result in a permanent cell cycle arrest and make mscs lose their self-renewal potential  <cit> . the high proliferative capacity and regenerative potential are main phenotypes of mscs  <cit> . loss of regenerative potential would limit their application in transplantation medicine. tgf-β <dig> has been demonstrated to induce senescence in tumor cells and other cell lines  <cit> . tgf-β <dig> has also been shown to increase production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species  in some cell lineages  <cit> . mtros production involves aging and cell senescence  <cit> . however, whether tgf-β affects senescence of bmmscs has still not been elucidated. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of tgf-β <dig> on senescence of bmmscs and its relation to mtros generation.

adipogenic differentiation culture
bmmscs were plated in 24-well plates with round coverslips and cultured in the induction medium  for 3 days. subsequently, the cells were cultured in the maintenance medium  for 3 weeks. the maintenance medium was changed every other day. the adipogenic differentiation was analyzed by oil red o staining.

immunofluorescence staining
bmmscs were plated in 24-well plates with 10 mm round coverslips. after 24-hour culture, the cells were fixed with 4% buffered formaldehyde for 15 min and treated with  <dig> % triton x- <dig> for 10 min at room temperature. and then, the cells were incubated with 1% bsa/10% goat serum for 30 min, and subsequently incubated with pe-conjugated goat anti-mouse cd <dig> antibody for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. after washing thrice with pbs, the cells were incubated with fitc-conjugated goat anti-mouse cd <dig> antibody for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. after washing with pbs and deionized water, the cells were mounted on slides using prolongh gold antifade reagent with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole , and imaged with a fluorescence microscope.

western-blotting assay
proteins were extracted from the treated bmmscs and separated by 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to pvdf membranes. the membranes were blocked with 5% bsa in tris-buffered saline with tween- <dig> , and then incubated with rabbit anti-mouse 4-hne, p <dig>  id <dig> and β-actin primary antibodies at 4°c overnight. then, the blots were washed thrice with tbs-t, and subsequently incubated with hrp-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. the immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence.

statistical analysis

RESULTS
identification of bmmscs
immunofluorescence staining showed that bmmscs were positive for cd <dig> and cd <dig>  which are msc specific markers  <cit> . it is known that bmmscs have the potential to differentiate to osteoblasts and apidocytes. high alkaline phosphatase  activity is an indication of successful differentiation of mscs to osteoblasts  <cit> . immunochemistry staining showed that most of bmmscs positively expressed alp after exposure to osteogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks . intracellular lipid vesicles are typically observed in adipocytes, which can be stained with oil red o. our data showed that lipid droplets were accumulated in a part of bmmscs after exposure to adipogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks .

tgf-β <dig> induces senescence of bmmscs
β-galactosidase activity at ph  <dig> is present only in senescent cells and viewed as a special marker for cellular senescence  <cit> . in this study, the senescence of bmmscs was analyzed using a senescence-β-galactosidase staining kit. as shown in figure  <dig>  senescence-associated-galactosidase  activity was significantly increased in bmmscs in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to  <dig>   <dig> and 10 ng/ml tgf-β <dig> for 24 hours. sa-gal activity was also increased in bmmscs in a time-dependent manner as the cells were exposed to 5 ng/ml tgf-β <dig> .

expression of aging markers in bmmscs after exposure to tgf-β1
4-hydroxynonenal  is a highly reactive aldehyde generated by the exposure of polyunsaturated fatty acids to peroxides and ros. 4-hne plays a key role in signal transduction and numerous cell cycle events. the expression of 4-hne subunits has also been involved in the senescence-associated ros production and viewed as a marker of aging  <cit> . our result showed that expression of 4-hne subunits was markedly increased in bmmscs as the cells were exposed to  <dig>   <dig> and 10 ng/ml tgf-β <dig> for 24 hours . p <dig> and id <dig> are also important markers of aging  <cit> . our western blot data showed that p <dig> expression was markedly increased, but id <dig> expression was decreased in bmmscs as the cells were exposed to  <dig>   <dig> and 10 ng/ml tgf-β <dig> for 24 hours .

tgf-β <dig> increases mtros production in bmmscs
it is known that mtros involve cellular aging  <cit> . in this study, mtros were measured using a mitosox red indicator kit. as shown in figure 5a and b, mtros were markedly increased in bmmscs after exposure to  <dig>   <dig> and 10 ng/ml tgf-β <dig> for 24 hours. superoxide dismutase  <dig>  is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that protects mitochondria against oxidative radicals  <cit> . previous studies have shown that deletion and downregulation of sod <dig> both cause cellular senescence through increasing mtros production  <cit> . our results showed that sod <dig> expression was significantly decreased in bmmscs after exposure to  <dig>   <dig> and 10 ng/ml tgf-β <dig> for 24 hours .

alcar inhibits tgf-β1-induced mtros production and bmmsc senescence
acetyl-l-carnitine  is a specific inhibitor of mtros  <cit> . our results showed that alcar  significantly inhibited tgf-β1-induced mtros generation and sa-gal activity in bmmscs . in addition, alcar also markedly inhibited tgf-β1-induced 4-hne subunits expression, and promoted id <dig> expression .

discussion
in the present study, we investigated the effect of tgf-β <dig> on senescence of bmmscs. our results showed that treatments with tgf-β <dig>  increased sa-gal activity and mtros production in bmmscs in a dose dependent manner. the aging promoter p <dig> and oxidative stress inducer 4-hne were markedly increased; however, their opponents id <dig> and sod <dig> were significantly decreased in bmmscs after exposure to tgf-β <dig>  application of mtros inhibitor acetyl-l-carnitine significantly inhibited tgf-β1-induced mtros production and bmmsc senescence. these findings demonstrate that tgf-β <dig> can cause senescence of bmmscs, which involves mtros production.

bmmscs are the most promising sources of stem cells and have been widely applied to treat cardiac diseases  <cit> . transplantation of bmmscs has the potential to reduce infarct size and improve ventricular compliance after myocardial infarction  <cit> . bmmscs are usually pre-treated with some biological reagents and chemicals, such as 5-azacytidine, tgf-β, angiotensin ii, hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig> alpha  and slingshot-1 l  for cardiomyocyte differentiation, prior to transplantation  <cit> . among these reagents, tgf-β is the most commonly used one. previous studies have shown that tgf-β <dig> and -β <dig> have the potential to induce senescence of tumor cells and other kinds of normal tissue cells  <cit> . our results showed that treatments with tgf-β <dig> markedly increased sa-gal activity in bmmscs, which showed that these cells were undergoing senescence. senescence would lead to phenotype changes and low proliferation of bmmscs, which reduces the efficiency of bmmsc-based transplantation  <cit> .

our results showed that tgf-β <dig> induced expression of 4-hne subunits. 4-hne, a major lipid peroxidation  product, plays key roles in signal transduction pathways, and participates in cell cycle events. while lower levels of intracellular 4-hne are beneficial to cells, possibly promoting cellular proliferation; however, higher levels cause toxic responses in cells, including cell senescence and apoptosis. expression of 4-hne has been proved to induce cell senescence and organ aging  <cit> . we found that p <dig>  an important regulator of aging, was markedly upregulated in the tgf-β1-treated bmmscs; however, id <dig>  a negative regulator of p <dig>  was markedly downregulated in these cells. these data were consistent with previous reports from other groups, which showed that p <dig> protein was highly expressed, but id <dig> protein was downregulated in the senescent cells and aged tissues  <cit> .

more interestingly, mtros production was also markedly increased in bmmscs after exposure to tgf-β <dig>  this data is also consistent with expression of 4-hne that has been widely accepted as an inducer of cellular oxidative stress  <cit> . previous studies have shown that tgf-β <dig> can increase mtros production in tumor cells  <cit> . mtros has also been known as key inducer of aging  <cit> . we also observed that sod <dig> was significantly downregulated in bmmscs after exposure to tgf-β <dig>  sod <dig> is known to be a key enzyme that protects mitochondria from ros insult  <cit> .

to further elucidate the role of mtros in tgf-β1-induced bmmsc senescence, we treated bmmscs with mtros specific inhibitor acetyl-l-carnitine  when the cells were exposed to 5 ng/ml tgf-β <dig>  our results showed that alcar  significantly inhibited tgf-β1-induced mtros production and increase of sa-gal activity. these data show that tgf-β1-induced senescence of bmmscs at least partially depends on mtros production.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that tgf-β <dig>  one of the most commonly used reagents for inducing cardiac differentiation of mscs, causes senescence of bmmscs. the action of tgf-β <dig> on bmmsc senescence depends on mtros production, because blockade of mtros production markedly inhibits tgf-β1-induced senescence of bmmscs.
