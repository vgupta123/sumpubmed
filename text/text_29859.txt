BACKGROUND
the genus rhynchosporium  consists of haploid fungi that are pathogenic to grass species  including cereal crops. in an early review article  <cit> , only two species were described, r. secalis and r. orthosporum, differing both in the shape of their two-celled conidia and in their host specificities. the name of the fungal genus originates from the beak  carried by one of the spore cells of r. secalis. in contrast, r. orthosporum produces cylindrical spores . r. secalis was first isolated from rye . nevertheless, the major host worldwide is barley , on which the fungus causes the economically important disease leaf blotch or scald. r. orthosporum is a pathogen of orchard grass .

it is usually assumed that plant pathogens originated on direct ancestors of their modern crop hosts and coevolved with them during domestication  <cit> . therefore the center of origin of a pathogen is usually also the center of genetic diversity  <cit> . gene diversity analysis of rhynchosporium suggests, however, that the fungus did not originate from the fertile crescent  <cit> , where its host plants barley and rye were domesticated about  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . instead, the genetic history of the fungus as it was reconstructed using the nucleotide sequence variation of the effector gene nip <dig>  <cit>  along with sequences from neutral rflp loci  <cit>  and microsatellite markers  <cit>  suggests that rhynchosporium emerged in northern europe following a host switch from a wild grass onto cultivated barley and rye after arrival of these plants about 5000–3000 years ago. from there the fungus spread globally most likely due to anthropogenic dispersal of infected host material , reaching regions such as south africa, california, australia and new zealand only during the last few hundred years  <cit> .

the occurrence of host-specialized ‘races’ of r. secalis was reported early on  <cit> . nevertheless, for a long time there were conflicting reports about the host range of rhynchosporium isolates  <cit> . recently, multigene-sequencing and phylogenetic analysis  demonstrated that r. secalis was actually a complex of at least three closely related host-specialized species  <cit> . given that the fungus was initially described on rye, the name r. secalis was retained for the species infecting rye and triticale . the species colonizing cultivated barley and other hordeum spp. as well as brome grass  was named r. commune, whereas r. agropyri is pathogenic to couch grass . finally, fungal isolates from perennial ryegrass  were found to represent yet another species, r. lolii  <cit> . the cylindrical shape of the spores as well as phylogenetic analysis based on nucleic acid sequences position the latter species closer to r. orthosporum  than to the other three species . due to its economic importance the majority of studies has been carried out on the barley-infecting fungal species, r. commune .

phylogenetic concordance analyses based on the sequences of four housekeeping genes  and neutral rflp loci using several hundred fungal isolates suggested that the ccg and the bcg branches separated  <dig> – <dig>  years ago, hence long before the advent of agriculture, with r. lolii diverging from r. orthoporum 4300–7200 years ago  <cit> . in contrast, r. commune, r. secalis and r. agropyri originated from a common ancestor only 1200–3600 years ago  <cit> . furthermore, reconstructions of demographic growth indicate that populations of the three bcg species evolved in parallel. after the host shift, which was soon followed by the split of the three fungal lineages, they experienced a bottleneck due to their reproductive isolation. specific adaptation to their modern hosts  <cit>  led to the recovery of the sizes of all  <dig> populations in particular during the last 250 years  <cit> . thus, worldwide dissemination and population increase of the pathogen coincide with intensification and global expansion of cereal production  <cit> .

in evolutionary terms, the rhynchosporium bcg species are very young and closely related. thus it can be expected that their genomes did not diverge substantially yet, except for those genes that are involved in adaptation to the different hosts and/or environments. hence, they represent an excellent basis to address the question of host specialization by comparative genomics. genes under diversifying selection may be uncovered through a fully unbiased approach by scanning the genomes of several isolates from the different species. alternatively, crucial processes associated with host adaption of a pathogen and epitomized in the concept of  virulence may be defined a priori. this would allow the identification of patterns of adaptive evolution such as species-specifically occurring genes or of gene family expansion.

what are the factors that contribute to fungal virulence? rhynchosporium development in planta starts with germination of conidia on the surface of host leaves and the penetration of fungal hyphae through the cuticle, frequently without forming obvious appressoria  <cit> . then, a long latent period of a few days up to several months  <cit>  without any visible disease symptoms follows. during this stage fungal mycelia are established between the cuticle and the outer wall of epidermis cells. finally, after formation of a dense subcuticular fungal stroma necrotic lesions occur. new spores are formed both during the latent period and in the lesion areas. penetration as well as subcuticular proliferation in the host tissue require the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes to degrade the cuticle and cell wall structures and to release carbohydrate nutrients form the plant cell wall polysaccharides. in addition, the physiology of the host needs to be redirected towards tolerating and accommodating the pathogen. for this purpose  fungal pathogens secrete small molecules  as well as effector proteins. therefore, the genes coding for cell wall-degrading enzymes, key secondary biosynthetic enzymes or protein effectors are prime targets of diversification/diversifying selection during adaptive evolution.

finally, at the base of any considerations regarding evolutionary processes is the mating system of an organism. for rhynchosporium, no teleomorph has been identified to date despite the presence of mating-type  genes  <cit> . nevertheless, ‘the signature of sex’  <cit> , i.e., mating type equilibrium in most populations at least of the bcg species and evidence for mat gene expression  <cit> , high genotype diversity, gametic equilibrium among neutral markers and low levels of clonality, was found in fungal populations worldwide  <cit> . these results suggest that sexual recombination occurs cryptically but regularly.

this paper presents a comparative analysis of the genomes of isolates from four of the five rhynchosporium species described to date. the intra-genus evolution and the broader phylogenetic relationship to other fungal species are re-analyzed. furthermore, the possibility of sexual recombination is assessed using a genomics approach by screening for the presence of sex-related genes known to be involved in meiosis and recombination in other organisms. finally, genes that may be involved in controlling host specificity, including those coding for key enzymes of fungal secondary metabolism or effector proteins are identified.

RESULTS
genome statistics
three isolates of r. commune and one isolate each of r. secalis, r. agropyri, r. lolii and r. orthosporum were sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun strategy  <cit>  with the roche  <dig> gs flx and the illumina gaiix platforms. de novo assembly resulted in a total sequence length of 52–58 mb. overall sequencing and assembly statistics are presented in table  <dig>  the assembled genome of r. commune, isolate uk <dig>  consisting of only  <dig> scaffolds was established as the reference genome. gene models for r. commune, isolate uk <dig>  r. secalis and r. agropyri were generated by three de novo prediction programs with different matrices. completeness of genomic predictions was assessed by blastp comparison to a set of  <dig> highly conserved fungal single-copy protein-coding homologs  and to a set of  <dig> core genes from the core eukaryotic genes mapping approach . the predicted coding sequences comprise about 30–33% of the genomic sequences, the estimated gene numbers range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with about 50% coding for proteins of unknown function. repetitive dna elements were identified and categorized. the total coverage of repetitive sequences is relatively high as compared to other fungi reaching 31% in r. commune, but lower than in the close relative marssonina brunnea f.sp. ‘multigermtubi’ .table  <dig> genome sequencing and assembly

phylogenetic relationship
phylogenetic analysis using multilocus dna sequence data  identified r. secalis as the closest sister species to r. commune, whereas the ccg species r. orthosporum is more distantly related  <cit> . this relationship was supported in the present study by comparing the rhynchosporium rdna gene structures . the genes of r. commune and r. secalis are highly similar lacking any introns, whereas an intron is present in the 28s gene of r. agropyri. the ccg species r. orthosporum and the recently described r. lolii  <cit>  carry two introns of the same size in the 18s gene and single introns differing in length by one nucleotide in the 28s gene. the latter are homologous to the 28s intron of r. agropyri and located at the same site, but their sequences are 99 bp and 87 bp shorter at the 5′ and the 3′ side, respectively. in contrast to these results, phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated sequences of  <dig> core mitochondrial genes resulted in r. agropyri and r. secalis as being most closely related  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
rhynchosporium rdna structures. the sequences of the rdna regions of all rhynchosporium species were obtained by sanger sequencing. 18s,  <dig> s and 28s genes are separated by its <dig> and its <dig>  respectively . the introns  in the 18s and 28s genes of r. lolii and r. orthosporum are identical except for  <dig> additional nucleotide in the r. lolii 28s intron. the 28s intron of r. agropyri is highly similar to those of the ccg species  except for 5′- and 3′-terminal extensions of  <dig> and 87 bp, respectively




to better resolve the rhynchosporium phylogeny a two-step analysis was carried out in the present study. the first step aimed at confirming the general position of the rhynchosporium genus in the leotiomycetes class of ascomycota  <cit> . to this end, the sequences of three protein-coding genes  and of almost complete rdna regions  from  <dig> members of the leotiomycetes class were used in lack of complete genome sequences of these fungi other than botryotinia fuckeliana  <cit> . the resulting phylogeny shows the rhynchosporium bcg branch with r. commune and r. agropyri as the closest sister species alongside the ccg branch . in a second step, to resolve the bcg evolution in more detail, single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified after aligning the genomes of bcg species and isolates . the phylogenetic tree inferred from the concatenated snps again confirms that r. agropyri branched off “shortly” before r. commune and r. secalis diverged. according to the published evolutionary time scale the former occurred 1200–3600 years ago  <cit> , the latter about 500 years later. in contrast, the age of the  <dig> r. commune isolates is probably around 100 years or less.fig.  <dig>

using the amino acid sequences of the three proteins ef1-α, rpb <dig> and rpb <dig> the relationship of rhynchosporium to more distantly related plant-interacting fungal species was established . the closest relative of rhynchosporium spp., the poplar pathogen m. brunnea f.sp. ‘multigermtubi’  <cit> , belongs to the dermataceae, a family of one of the most diverse ascomycete orders, the helotiales. this confirms a previous its-based phylogenetic analysis, which located r. commune and r. orthosporum between the dermataceae species tapesia yallundae  and pyrenopeziza brassicae, pathogens of grasses and oil seed rape , respectively  <cit> .fig.  <dig> integration of the genus rhynchosporium into the fungal systematics. the concatenated amino acid sequences of elongation factor ef1-a and of the polymerase ii subunits rpb <dig> and rpb <dig> from  <dig> taxa were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. numerals on the nodes represent the percentages from  <dig> bootstraps. scale: number of substitutions per nucleotide




all host species of rhynchosporium belong to the pooideae subfamily of poaceae  <cit> . however, while the fungal bcg species, r. commune, r. secalis and r. agropyri, infect closely related grass species from genera of the subtribe hordeinae , the ccg members, r. lolii and r. orthosporum, are pathogenic to species from the more distantly related subtribes loliinae and dactylidinae . nevertheless there are exceptions to this rule. firstly, from bromus diandrus, a grass species belonging to the bromeae tribe of the triticodae supertribe, a few isolates were collected that grouped into the r. commune lineage  <cit> . interestingly, in an early report isolates from brome grass were unable to infect other grass species tested including barley  <cit> . secondly, triticale became susceptible to rhynchosporium about 30 years after its introduction as a crop  <cit> . this cereal species originated from hybridizing the non-host species wheat and the host species rye and was assigned to the triticinae subtribe of the hordeae tribe . rhynchosporium isolates collected from triticale grouped into the r. secalis lineage  <cit> . lastly, two strains of r. commune were isolated from italian ryegrass  that were also pathogenic to barley  <cit>  and, thus, able to colonize hosts from both triticodae and poodae supertribes. despite these exceptions, however, the relationship found between the rhynchosporium species corresponds largely to host systematics.fig.  <dig>

genes related to sexual reproduction
work since the 1930s has failed to demonstrate a sexual cycle in any rhynchosporium species. availability of the rhynchosporium genomes allows now a genomic interrogation to assess whether the genetic machinery required for sexual reproduction is present or not. such insights into the pathogen life cycle are important as this impacts on the possibility for recombination and evolution of the pathogen  <cit> . despite the apparent absence of a teleomorph r. commune isolates have been shown to possess the mating type loci mat1- <dig> or mat1- <dig>  which are typical for heterothallic ascomycetes  <cit> . mat1- <dig> is characterized by genes coding for proteins with two different dna-binding domains, an α-box motif in mat1-1- <dig> and a high-mobility group  dna-binding motif in mat1-1- <dig>  both loci were also found in the other bcg species, r. secalis and r. agropyri, whereas the ccg species r. orthosporum and r. lolii lack mat1- <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, only the r. agropyri isolate had the mat1- <dig> genotype, whereas all others carried the mat1- <dig> locus. closer inspection of the mat1- <dig> locus revealed the presence of an additional orf coding for a protein with about 30% similarity to the mat1-1- <dig> protein from b. cinerea and several sclerotinia species . an additional orf with homology to a hypothetical gene from the poplar pathogen m. brunnea f.sp. ‘multigermtubi’ was detected at the mat1- <dig> locus. however, this orf codes for a protein with no homology to a functional protein from other organisms. sequence comparison of the mat loci demonstrated that the idiomorphic region comprises most of the mat1-1- <dig> gene and the genes mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-1- <dig> in the mat1- <dig> locus . in mat1- <dig> it spans from the truncated mat1-1- <dig> gene to the 3′ end of the mat1-2- <dig> gene . both mat loci are flanked by the genes sla <dig> and apn <dig> coding for a cytoskeletal protein and a dna lyase, respectively. the positions of these genes are highly conserved across pezizomycotina species .fig.  <dig>

meiosis is “at the heart of sexual reproduction” of eukaryotes  <cit> . therefore, searching for genes involved in meiosis and sexual reproduction can identify the capacity for cryptic sexuality. to this end, the rhynchosporium genomes were screened using a “meiosis detection tool kit”  <cit> , which comprises a set of genes defining a “core meiotic recombination machinery”   <cit> . the products of these genes are involved in generating meiotic double-strand breaks, crossing over and cohesion of sister chromatids and homologous chromosomes. bidirectional blastp analysis detected  <dig> out of the  <dig> core meiotic genes in the rhynchosporium  genomes with sequence similarities mostly exceeding 50%. for two additional proteins, hop <dig> and mnd <dig>  the similarity to rhynchosporium proteins is low , although the functional domains were identified. many genes required for meiosis also have a role in mitosis. however, nine meiosis-specific genes are regarded to reliably predict the capacity of a sexual cycle  <cit> . three of these genes that code for elements of the synaptonemal complex, hop <dig>  hop <dig> and mnd <dig>  are missing in rhynchosporium  or their products show only low similarity with rhynchosporium proteins . nevertheless this does not argue against sexual reproduction, because these genes are also absent from the genomes of several fungi with known sexuality  and of other sexual organisms such as drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . hence, meiosis appears to be possible without these gene products. transcripts for all but two  of the  <dig> core meiotic genes have been identified in germinated conidia and/or cdna libraries from infected barley leaves . this confirms that the core meiotic genes are not only present in the rhynchosporium genomes but are actively transcribed.table  <dig> core meiotic genes




of an additional set of  <dig> genes involved in different aspects of meiosis and recombination in n. crassa, saccharomyces cerevisiae and podospora anserina,  <dig> were found to be maintained in the genomes of r. commune, r. agropyri and r. orthosporum . two genes, kex <dig> and ram <dig>  were missing only from the genome of r. secalis. transcripts for  <dig> of these genes, including those coding for meiotic recombination protein rec <dig> and all pheromone proteins essential for mating, have been identified in germinated conidia and/or cdna libraries from infected barley leaves. finally,  <dig> genes known to be involved in different aspects of sexual reproduction in the aspergilli such as sensing of environmental signals that control sexual cycle induction, intracellular signal transduction, transcription control and ascospore production were examined . outside the mat genes and the genes coding for pheromones and their receptors, only  <dig> genes were not found in the rhynchosporium genomes, whereas for  <dig> gene products a relatively weak similarity with the a. nidulans proteins  was observed. transcripts for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, including mat <dig> and esdc, have been identified in germinated conidia and/or cdna libraries from infected barley leaves. taken together these results provide strong additional evidence for the presence and expression of the genetic machinery required for sexual reproduction to occur in the rhynchosporium life cycle.

enzymes involved in cell wall degradation
plant cell walls are built up of polysaccharides ,  proteins and aromatic polymers . phytopathogenic fungi need to degrade this barrier to penetrate and colonize host tissues as well as to release nutrients for colony growth. to this end, they produce many carbohydrate-active enzymes  that cleave or modify oligo- and polysaccharides as well as other glycoconjugates. a recent genome comparison comprising  <dig> fungal species from different classes revealed a great diversity in the cell wall-degrading capacity  <cit> . in phytopathogens, cazyme numbers correlate by and large with the fungal life style. in both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi large numbers of cazymes are found, whereas obligately biotrophic fungi such as blumeria graminis have smaller numbers. furthermore, polygalacturonases of the gh <dig> family have been found to be less abundant in monocot- as compared to dicot-infecting fungi. when the cazy database  <cit>  was used to annotate the rhynchosporium bcg genomes, r. commune, r. secalis and r. agropyri had cazyme numbers characteristic for monocot-infecting hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi  <cit>  .

to reach their substrates, the cell wall-degrading enzymes  need to be secreted to the apoplast. in addition to the classical signal peptide-based secretion pathway through the er/golgi system, mechanisms independent of this system exist in eukaryotes for unconventional secretion of proteins lacking a signal peptide  <cit> . a sequence-based prediction method, secretomep, has been developed that is capable of identifying proteins secreted through the latter pathway  <cit> . therefore, the rhynchosporium cazymes were tested for the presence of a classical n-terminal secretion signal and for the likelihood of unconventional secretion. furthermore, enzyme numbers were corrected for modular enzymes, which are characterized by more than one annotation. in most cases , an enzyme domain was combined with one or more carbohydrate binding domains . as a result, about  <dig> cwdes were identified for each rhynchosporium species . they group into glycoside hydrolases , carbohydrate esterases , polysaccharide lyases , and auxiliary redox enzymes involved in lignocellulose breakdown .table  <dig> cell wall degrading enzymes

in addition to enzymes, proteins possessing one or more carbohydrate-binding modules but lacking domains for enzyme activity were found . among these the lysm motif  has attracted most attention  <cit> . this module has general n-acetylglucosamine binding properties and is therefore able to bind to chitin or chitin-like carbohydrates  <cit> . in fungi, lysm domains are predominantly found in secreted lysm effector proteins and in subgroup c chitinases. in the rhynchosporium genomes seven proteins are encoded that contain one or more lysm domains . in addition, two genes code for enzymes that contain lysm domain pairs , a subgroup c chitinase , which also possesses a different chitin-binding motif , and a putative peptidoglycan lytic transglycosidase . four of the lysm proteins are secreted through the classical pathway, whereas three of the proteins, lysm <dig>  lysm <dig> and lysm <dig> and the gh <dig> enzyme may be secreted via the unconventional pathway. a central transmembrane domain predicted for lysm <dig> may cause this protein to reside in the plasma membrane with the lysm domain oriented outwards. interestingly, in m. brunnea a family of  <dig> genes was identified that code for effector proteins of 142– <dig> aa with  <dig> or  <dig> lysm motifs  <cit> . this family is completely missing in rhynchosporium. two representative members of this gene family were shown to weaken the chitin-induced defense response when expressed in arabidopsis thaliana. as proposed for the effector proteins ecp <dig> from cladosporium fulvum  <cit> , mg3lysm from mycosphaerella graminicola  and slp <dig> from magnaporthe oryzae  <cit> , this effect is probably due to the sequestration of chitin oligosaccharides that occur as breakdown products of fungal cell walls during invasion and that are able to trigger host immunity. other lysm effectors including avr <dig> from c. fulvum  <cit> , mg1lysm and spl <dig> prevented hyphal lysis by plant chitinases  <cit> .

when the rhynchosporium cwdes were assigned to their putative substrates , about 21% were found to act or are likely to act on the fungal cell wall, whereas c. 64% presumably target the host cell wall . for about 11% of the enzymes their substrate is unknown or ambiguous. fourteen enzymes  are putative cutinases. these enzymes, albeit no proper cwdes, are required at a very early stage of pathogenesis to allow or facilitate the fungal penetration of the plant surface.

the physiological role of the cazymes targeting the fungal cell wall is thought to be in cell wall remodeling during fungal morphogenesis . the cell walls of filamentous fungi are mainly built up of β- <dig> -glucan , glycoproteins  and chitin . accordingly, glucan-degrading enzymes constitute the biggest group of hydrolytic enzymes encoded in the rhynchosporium genomes with at least  <dig> members . eight enzymes presumably target glycoproteins . in addition,  <dig> chitinolytic enzymes were identified . eight of the  <dig> chitinases  belong to subgroup a . the biggest of these chitinases is predicted for unconventional secretion. one member of this subgroup was found to lack a signal peptide and, hence, to be located intracellularly . three chitinases belong to subgroup b , but two additional enzymes may fall into this group despite their high molecular mass . subgroup c chitinases were defined to have a high molecular mass  and to carry a chitin-binding domain  and lysm motifs. these criteria are fulfilled by one rhynchosporium enzyme of almost 150 kda. this enzyme may not be fully released into the apoplast, but rather tethered to the outside of the plasma membrane as suggested by a predicted c-terminal transmembrane helix.

in trichoderma atroviride the gene coding for subgroup c chitinase tac <dig> is located next to the gene encoding the tal <dig> protein, which contains  <dig> lysm motifs and was considered to inhibit spore germination  <cit> . tac <dig> appears to be inactivated by a deletion in the catalytic domain and hence to be a chitin-binding protein. interestingly, a tac <dig> deletion mutant was reported to grow faster than the wild type, suggesting a growth decelerating function of the protein and thus a function in the regulation of fungal development. similar to t. atroviride, the subgroup c chitinase-encoding gene of r. commune is located next to a gene coding for a protein with  <dig> lysm motifs, lysm <dig>  furthermore, chitinase-lysm gene pairs are also found for both high molecular mass subgroup b chitinases. their genes are located next to the genes coding for lysm <dig> and for a protein that lacks a lysm domain but has high similarity to a lysm protein from zymoseptoria brevis  <cit> , respectively. this chitinase-lysm gene arrangement may therefore point to the participation of lysm proteins in a more wide-spread mechanism to control fungal growth in planta.

regrouping of the plant cwdes according to the different types of cell wall substrates suggested that c. 32% are involved in hemicellulose degradation and about 19% target cellulose . the enzymes acting on pectin  and lignin  constitute smaller groups, thus reflecting the low content of these materials in the cell walls of grasses. due to their large number and the functional redundancy of enzyme activities involved in cell wall degradation, the likelihood is generally presumed to be small that any one of these enzymes is responsible for host specificity. recently, however, a combination of comparative genomics and transcriptomics revealed that members of cwde families from z. tritici are differentially transcribed during pathogenesis  <cit> . this suggested the specific occurrence of at least some cwdes during relevant stages of the fungal life cycle rather than their general functional redundancy. in addition, selection analysis yielded evidence that a few cutinases, cellulases and hemicellulases may be involved in host adaptation or evasion of host recognition.

based on the genome sequences, a very coarse intra-genus comparison was done for the rhynchosporium cazymes, which considered the presence or absence of genes in a family. in several of the cazy families  single members are missing from one of the three bcg species. it remains to be shown however whether these differences reflect differences in the composition of the targeted cell walls and, thus, adaptations to the host.

secondary metabolism
generally, secondary metabolites can be regarded as tools that play a role in the interaction of the producing organism with its environment. fungal secondary products are not only notorious toxins, but also mediators of chemical communication with other microbes and the environment or defense agents  <cit> . hence, they also play a more or less prominent role in the interaction of phytopathogenic fungi with their host plants. most fungal secondary metabolites belong to one of four structural classes, polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, cyclic terpenes or tryptophan-derived indole alkaloids  <cit> . among the fungal compounds with known effect in plant-pathogen interactions are several of the host-specific toxins of the dothideomycetes . t-toxin from cochliobolus heterostrophus and pm-toxin from mycosphaerella zeae-maydis are linear polyketides. victorin from cochliobolus victoriae, am-toxin from alternaria alternata and hc-toxin from cochliobolus carbonum are cyclic non-ribosomal peptides, whereas hs-toxin from bipolaris sacchari is a sesquiterpene galactoside. several fungi produce perylenequinone toxins . these are cyclic polyketides with non-host-specific activity. some secondary metabolites have a less pronounced effect in the interaction with host plants. examples are the polyketide botcinic acid and the sesquiterpene botrydial, which play a redundant role in the virulence of botrytis cinerea on bean leaves  <cit> . finally, many secondary products have an impact on human and livestock health; these include the ergot indole alkaloids with their tryptophan-derived lysergic acid moiety  <cit>  or the sesquiterpenoid trichothecenes  <cit> .

the only secondary metabolite described to date from a rhynchosporium species is orthosporin, a polyketide from r. orthosporum  <cit> . this isocoumarin was also isolated from drechslera siccans, a pathogen of oats , perennial ryegrass  and italian ryegrass . it is phytotoxic causing necrosis on leaves of several plants, but not on perennial ryegrass  <cit> , and it has an inhibitory effect on root growth of the host plant, orchard grass  and lettuce .

the four major fungal secondary metabolite classes are synthesized via four characteristic key enzymes  <cit> , polyketide synthases , non-ribosomal peptide synthetases , terpene cyclases  or dimethylallyl tryptophane synthases . in addition, several hybrid compounds are known, which are either synthesized by pks-nrps hybrid enzymes or by two separate enzymes that are encoded in a single gene cluster. the rhynchosporium genomes were screened for the presence of these key enzyme genes to find clues for their possible involvement in determining host specificity. in almost all isolates/species three dmats genes and one tc gene were identified, whereas dmats <dig> was missing only in r. orthosporum, suggesting that a host-specific role of these enzymes is unlikely.


pks genes constitute the largest group of key enzyme genes of secondary metabolism. pks catalyze the synthesis of a large and structurally diverse group of chemical substances from acyl-coa precursors. fungal pks are usually multidomain enzymes that elongate and modify their products iteratively . three domains are essential for polyketide synthesis, ketoacyl coa synthase , acyltransferase  and a phosphopantetheine attachment site . several other enzymatic motifs such as the three β-keto processing domains ketoreductase , dehydratase  and enoyl reductase  and a methyl transferase domain  are not found in all pks. lack of all or some of the reducing domains yields non-reducing or partially reducing pks. the polyketide product is usually released from the enzyme through thioreductase , thioesterase  or transferase activities. twelve pks genes  including  <dig> pks-nrps genes  occur in all bcg species . in contrast, pks <dig> was not found outside r. commune isolates and appears to be species-specific, whereas an additional gene, pks <dig>  was present only in the genome of r. commune isolate au <dig>  orthologs of eight of the pks genes were also identified in r. orthosporum along with four unique genes including two pks-nrps hybrid genes . in the closely related m. brunnea, orthologs of only  <dig> rhynchosporium genes were identified along with two unique pks genes. as the conclusion, the specific occurrence of several of the genes may suggest their involvement in the biosynthesis of polyketides with a role in interaction specificity at the species and isolate level.table  <dig> polyketide synthases




the phylogeny of type i pks from ascomycetes and bacteria as inferred from ks domain relationship revealed three main clades comprising fungal reducing pkss, fungal non-reducing  pkss and bacterial pkss  <cit> . the fungal clades are further subdivided into four reducing subclades , three nr subclades  and a subclade basal to nr subclades i and ii . in addition, the bacterial pks clade contains two subclades of fungal pks. this phylogeny was first reconstructed based on the ks domain sequences from  <dig> ascomycete pks , ten bacterial pks and two animal fatty acid synthetases. subsequently, it was complemented with the ks domain sequences of the  <dig> rhynchosporium pks , which were predicted by blastp analysis  <cit>  and comparison to the pfam  <dig>  database . the archetypal pks domain architecture ks-at-dh-mt-er-kr-pp  <cit>  was found in only three rhynchosporium pks, rcpks <dig>  rcpks <dig> and ropks <dig> , which are members of reducing subclades i and iv, respectively. both subclades contain additional rhynchosporium pks lacking the mt domain . most rhynchosporium pks were in reducing subclade ii, which lacks the er domain and contains all pks-nrps hybrid enzymes. notably, r. commune-specific pks <dig> appears to be closely related to lovb, one of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lovastatin  <cit>  in aspergillus terreus , suggesting that both enzymes catalyze similar reactions. lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase, which catalyzes a crucial step in the biosynthetic pathway leading to ergosterol  or cholesterol . two rhynchosporium enzymes, pks <dig> and pks <dig>  occur in the non-reducing clades ii and iii, respectively. like all other rhynchosporium pks, however, the latter contain the dh reduction domain and therefore should be called partially reducing pkss. finally, pks <dig> groups with c. heterostrophus pks <dig> in the bacterial pks clade, both being nrps-pks hybrids  and suspected of being horizontally transmitted from bacteria to fungi  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pks phylogenetic tree. the amino acid sequence of the ks domains from  <dig> fungal and bacterial pks were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. numerals on the nodes represent the percentages from  <dig> bootstraps. numerals < <dig> were omitted. scale: number of substitutions per nucleotide. colored backgrounds indicate enzyme groups: blue, reducing pks clades i-iv; orange, non-reducing pks clades nri-iii and nr bi + ii  <cit> ; grey, bacterial pks; green, fatty acid synthases 




among the key genes of secondary biosynthesis in rhynchosporium those coding for nrps and nrps-like proteins represent the second largest group. these enzymes typically consist of one or more modules comprising an amino acid-adenylation domain , a thiolation domain  and a condensation domain . mono-modular nrps <dig>  tri-modular nrps <dig> and tetra-modular nrps <dig> were present in all species, whereas hexa-modular nrps <dig> was missing in r. orthosporum . remarkably, r. commune isolate au <dig> was again unique by carrying a specific gene coding for the most complex enzyme, the octa-modular nrps <dig>  orthologs of the eight genes coding for nrps-like  proteins were found in all rhynchosporium species with the exception of npls <dig>  which was missing in r. orthosporum. in comparison to rhynchosporium, closely related m. brunnea had orthologs of only six of the nrps and npsl genes. only one nrps gene shows isolate-specific occurrence indicating a possible role of its product in host specificity at the isolate level. in addition, several genes may be involved in bcg specificity.table  <dig> nonribosomal peptide synthetases




neither structures nor functions of the nrps products in rhynchosporium spp. are known. therefore, the domain structures and, in particular, the a domains of the rhynchosporium nrps and nrps-like proteins were compared to those of other fungi and bacteria. in a previous phylogenomic analysis of fungal nrps and nrps-like  proteins  <cit>  two main enzyme groups had been identified, one group containing seven subfamilies of primarily mono- and bi-modular fungal enzymes along with the bacterial clade , the other group containing two subfamilies of primarily multi-modular and exclusively fungal  enzymes. members of the latter are presumed to be of more recent origin, most of them having less conserved structures suggesting the biosynthesis of products with more specific functions in niche adaptation including virulence. in contrast, members of the former group are presumably of more ancient origin, exhibiting more conserved domain architectures suggestive of more basic functions.fig.  <dig> nrps phylogenetic tree  <dig>  the amino acid sequences of the a domain from  <dig> mostly mono-modular fungal and bacterial nrps were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. numerals at the nodes represent the percentages from  <dig> bootstraps. numeral < <dig> were omitted. scale: number of substitutions per nucleotide. colored backgrounds indicate enzyme groups: sid, siderophore synthetases; nps11/nps <dig>  nps11/12-like nrps and etp toxin synthetases; cyclo, cyclosporine synthetases; mbc, major bacterial clade; aar, α-amino-adipate reductases; nps <dig>  nrps 10-like nrps; pks-nps, hybrid enzymes. orange-framed boxes mark members of outgroups


fig.  <dig> nrps phylogenetic tree  <dig>  the amino acid sequences of the a domain from  <dig> mostly oligo-modular specifically fungal nrps were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. numerals at the nodes represent the percentages from  <dig> bootstraps. numerals < <dig> were omitted. colored backgrounds indicate enzyme groups: blue, nps8-like; pink, nps6-like, orange, ergot alkaloid synthetases, green, peptaibol synthetase tex1; grey, am-toxin synthetase. red and blue dots mark the modules of hc-toxin and peramine synthetase, respectively. coloured boxes indicate modules of the  <dig> rhynchosporium nrps




following the previous analysis  <cit> , the a domains of nrps from rhynchosporium were compared to those of other fungi including the closely related species m. brunnea and bacteria. most nrps subfamilies contain at least one member from the rhynchosporium genus. two proteins, tri-modular rcnrps <dig> and mono-modular rcnrps <dig>  are predicted to be involved in the biosynthesis of two types of fe3+-chelating hydroxamate-type siderophores required for iron uptake and storage. rcnrps <dig> and its m. brunnea ortholog  group with type-iv siderophore synthetases  <cit>  . each of its three a domains joins a sub-branch with one of the a domains of c. heterostrophus nps <dig>  a ferrichrome synthetase. ferrichromes, which are involved in intracellular iron storage, are typically cyclic hexapeptides built up of three n
5-acetyl-n
5-hydroxy-l-ornithines  and three small amino acids, an obligatory gly and one to two ser, gly or ala  <cit> . rcnrps <dig> and its m. brunnea ortholog share the domain architecture with c. heterostrophus nps <dig> including the c-terminal c-pp-c-pp module, which is predicted to function in ring closure of the nascent peptide  <cit> . in addition, the amino acid residues suggested to determine the substrate specificity of the a domains are almost identical in both enzymes and very similar to those of the a domains of c. heterostrophus nps <dig> . the nrps <dig> product, ferricrocin, is an intracellular siderophore involved in iron storage, oxidative stress resistance, germination and sexual development in a. nidulans and other fungi  <cit> . this molecule is made up of two glycines and one serine in addition to the three aho  <cit> . according to the 10-aa code for amino acid binding, the a <dig> domain of the nrps from the three fungi binds glycine and the a <dig> domain binds serine  <cit> . in the a <dig> domains of rcnrps <dig> and its m. brunnea ortholog an l239 → m exchange has occurred compared to the a <dig> domain of c. heterostrophus nps <dig>  nevertheless, the domain appears to be responsible for aho binding . therefore, despite the presence of the second presumably glycine-binding domain a <dig> in c. heterostrophus nps <dig>  the siderophore product of rcnrps <dig> and its m. brunnea ortholog is predicted to be identical with the nps <dig> product, ferricrocin.table  <dig> amino acid code of siderophore synthases




rcnrps <dig> was in the most conserved clade of the eas group exemplified by c. heterostrophus nps <dig>  <cit>  coding for a different type of siderophore synthetases . no m. brunnea homolog was identified. rcnrps <dig> has the typical domain structure of this enzyme group, a single a-pp-c module followed by a module with a degenerate a domain . nps <dig> of c. heterostrophus was shown to be responsible for the synthesis of extracellular siderophores of the coprogen family  <cit> . deletion of the nps <dig> gene and its orthologs in different plant pathogenic fungi resulted in reduced virulence and hypersensitivity to h2o <dig> 

mono-modular rcnpsl <dig> and its m. brunnea ortholog belong to the nps <dig> subfamily, which also has a conserved domain structure. the a-pp domain is followed by a thioester reductase -like domain and a dehydrogenase domain. rcnpsl <dig> has a single a-pp-tr module and groups together with mono-modular enzymes from a. nidulans  and a. fumigatus  with the cyclosporin synthetases.

rcnpsl <dig> is in a clade with high bootstrap support that comprises α-aminoadipate reductases  such as lys <dig> from s. cerevisiae and lys1+ from s. pombe. aar are evolutionary related to but not identical with nrps and catalyze a step in the fungi-specific biosynthesis of lysine  <cit> . neither rcnpsl <dig> nor b. cinerea protein bc1g_ <dig> fits into one of the clades described. both proteins have the same domain architecture. the a and pp domains are followed by a domain that makes up the c-terminal half of the protein, is predicted to contain three pairs of transmembrane domains  and is exclusively found in nrps.

rcnpsl <dig> is in the same clade as c. heterostrophus nps <dig> and alternaria brassicicola tmpl . these proteins lack thiolation  and condensation  domains and, hence, are no true nrps proteins. instead, they are characterized by an a domain and a c-terminal fad/nad-binding domain, which are separated by putative tmds. the number of tmds is predicted to be between  <dig> and  <dig> . therefore, membrane orientation of these proteins needs to be verified experimentally. tmpl was shown to be involved in virulence through regulation of intracellular ros concentrations and tolerance to external ros  <cit> . the biochemical function of the tmpl-like proteins is not known, but they are suggested to possess an enzymatic function involving fad/nad binding like other flavoenzymes such as enzymes from the ferric reductase group.

the basic architecture of npsl1- <dig> is very similar with a- and pp-domains followed by a tr domain. however, the a domains of rcnpsl <dig>  rcnpsl <dig> and rcnpl <dig> are structurally similar to the a domains of rcnrps1- <dig> , but deviate from those of rcnpsl <dig> , rcnpsl <dig>  and rcnpsl <dig> . as a consequence, the latter along with rcpks <dig>  form a phylogeny outgroup. other outgroup a domains comprise the rhynchosporium ortholog of cps <dig>  a protein consisting of two a domains , which was shown to be a virulence factor of c. heterostrophus and gibberella zeae on maize and of c. victoriae on oats  <cit> . furthermore, a domains from bacterial proteins, b. subtilis  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoate-amp ligase  and p. aeruginosa pyoverdine synthetase , as well as an a. nidulans npsl protein, cbf <dig> , were used as outgroup.

in the mostly multi-modular eas group , little information can be deduced from the phylogenetic position of the a domains regarding the function of nrps products. however, occurrence of the a domains of tri-modular am-toxin synthetase from a. alternata or  <dig> of the  <dig> modules of peptaibol synthetase tex <dig> from trichoderma virens in a single subclade with high bootstrap support is suggestive of an evolutionary origin of the enzymes by duplication events. a similar mechanism may have played a role in the evolution of rhynchosporium nrps enzymes. three of the a domains of hexa-modular rcnrps <dig> occur in one subclade, two in another subclade and one in a third subclade. similarly, the a domains of octa-modular rcnrps <dig> are in three subclades with four, three and one members, respectively. in contrast, the a domains of tetra-modular rcnrps <dig> and its m. brunnea ortholog are spread over four different subclades indicating a recombination-type mode of molecular evolution.

finally, the four pks-nrps  from rhynchosporium and the pks <dig> ortholog from m. brunnea, which all belong to  reducing pks clade ii , are found in the pks-nrps subfamily of the phylogenetic tree . they all have the same domain architecture except for rcpks <dig>  which lacks the c-terminal pp domain .

the basic structures formed by the key secondary biosynthesis enzymes are usually modified by decorating enzymes such as oxidoreductases, glycosyl or prenyl transferases. their genes are frequently found in contiguous clusters, i.e., most or all genes of a biosynthetic pathway, possibly along with genes responsible for regulation and transport, are co-localized and co-regulated  <cit> . for instance, the cluster for the biosynthetic pathway of the polyketide asperfuranone in a. nidulans comprises genes coding for two fungal pkss, five additional enzymes and a transcriptional activator  <cit> . similarly, putative pks gene clusters were detected in the rhynchosporium bcg genomes . two clusters contain genes coding for the key biosynthetic enzymes of two different secondary metabolite classes: the pks <dig> cluster includes the dmats <dig> gene  and the nrps <dig> cluster harbors the pks <dig> gene. dmats <dig> might be a transferase required for the prenylation of a pks4-derived polyketide. alternatively, the gene pairs might be involved in the biosynthesis of mixed compounds through separate assembly lines.fig.  <dig>

small secreted proteins: necrosis-inducing proteins
secreted effector molecules have been recognized as crucial for host colonization and pathogenicity  <cit> . in both pathogens and mutualists they function by deregulating the host immune response. in addition, they have a role in self-defense and competition with other microbes  <cit> . furthermore, they influence the physiology of the host in favor of the pathogen’s needs, thus enhancing virulence  <cit> . finally, they contribute to host adaptation and to establishing host specificity, thereby driving microbial speciation  <cit> .

in r. commune, the genes nip <dig>  nip <dig> and nip <dig> code for effector proteins that contribute quantitatively to the virulence of r. commune depending on the host cultivar  <cit> . therefore, the sequenced genomes of all rhynchosporium species were screened for the presence of orthologous genes using the nip gene sequences from r. commune isolate uk <dig> as probes. in this context, only those r. lolii genes that have homologs in r. orthosporum could be included. nip <dig> and nip <dig> occur as single genes in the genomes. nip <dig> orthologs coding for highly similar proteins are present in the three bcg species, whereas nip <dig> orthologs are found in r. commune, albeit not in all isolates , and in the ccg species r. orthosporum . nip <dig> is also a single gene in the two ccg species. in contrast, nip <dig> families of 7- <dig> members are present in the bcg species .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of nips. the amino acid sequences of  <dig> mature nips were aligned using the muscle algorithm. for clarity reasons and due to their high similarity only one nip <dig> protein from the  <dig> r. commune isolates was taken into consideration. the tree is drawn to scale. numerals on the nodes represent the percentages from  <dig> bootstraps. asterisks mark the ccg species. scale: number of substitutions per nucleotide




comparison of the deduced nip <dig> amino acid sequences using multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation  revealed three conserved protein motifs, a 40-amino acid stretch spanning the n-terminal half of the protein, followed by a 15-amino acid domain around an absolutely conserved crs motif, and near the c-terminus of about 50% of the proteins another 15-amino acid sequence. in addition, blastp analysis identified genes coding for proteins with similarity to nip <dig> in the bcg genomes. these nip2-like proteins  differ from nip <dig> by a smaller degree of domain conservation, but most strikingly by the absence of the crs motif, which is absolutely conserved in nip <dig> . all nip <dig> and nlp carry six cysteine residues at homologous positions. interestingly, all proteins except nip <dig>  have a cysteine at the c-terminus. this structural feature was also found in nip <dig>  the phylogenetic tree of the mature nip <dig> proteins demonstrates that the different isoforms are more similar between fungal species than they are to each other. this implies that duplication of the nip <dig> gene occurred in a common ancestor before the three bcg species diverged, possibly to allow or facilitate host jump and colonization of new cereal crop species.fig.  <dig> sequence comparison of nip <dig> and nip2-like proteins . for clarity reasons the amino acid sequences of the mature proteins  from r. commune uk <dig> were aligned with the sequences only available in other isolates/species. arrows indicate the domains identified by meme. the crs domain in position 61- <dig>  differentiates the two protein groups




to date no biochemical function could be assigned to nip <dig>  in contrast, nip <dig> and nip <dig> both stimulate the host plant plasma membrane h+-atpase  <cit> . this enzyme generates a cellular membrane potential, which may affect nutrient accumulation and fungal membrane transport processes. in addition, acidification of the apoplast may create more convenient growth conditions for the fungus  <cit> . the originally reported induction of necrosis by the purified proteins  <cit>  may therefore be a consequence of over-stimulation of the h+-atpase due to severe overloading of the host leaf tissue  <cit> . an amino acid sequence comparison of nip <dig> and nip <dig> revealed that a stretch of six amino acids, -g45eggng50-, which is present in exposed loop iii near the c-terminus of rcnip <dig>  <cit> , but absent from ronip <dig> , is almost identically found near the c-terminus of nip <dig> as -g82eggeg87-. remarkably, g <dig> is essential for nip <dig> activity  <cit> , which suggests that this amino acid motif could be critical for the common function of nip <dig> and nip <dig> 

nip <dig> from r. commune is targeted by the barley resistance gene rrs <dig>  <cit> , thereby triggering defense reactions in the host  <cit> . to be able to infect rrs1-barley the fungus therefore evolved two strategies to prevent recognition of nip <dig>  namely introduction of mutations into the nip <dig> gene and its complete deletion  <cit> . as the consequence, nip <dig> was only found in about half of the r. commune isolates analyzed and inactive nip <dig> isoforms were identified  <cit> . nevertheless, the importance of nip <dig> as a virulence factor of r. commune was shown in a recent study on the quantitative virulence of  <dig> fungal isolates from each of nine global field populations worldwide. as the result, “on average isolates carrying a functional nip <dig> protein had significantly higher virulence than isolates where the protein was missing or non-functional”  <cit> . in contrast to nip <dig>  nip <dig> was found in almost all r. commune isolates studied  <cit>  as well as in r. secalis and r. agropyri. hence, at least one of the h+-atpase stimulators, nip <dig> or nip <dig>  appears to be present in a given fungal species/isolate.

to give a résumé, nip <dig> and nip <dig> appear to be specific for r. commune and the bcg species, respectively. the presence of an – albeit possibly “inactive” – nip <dig> in r. orthosporum indicates that the gene may have been lost in the other species. in contrast, each of the five rhynchosporium species harbors at least one nip <dig> gene. however, evolution of the nip <dig> gene family by gene duplication and sequence diversification  <cit>  suggests an involvement of this protein in the adaptation of the bcg species to their hosts.

small secreted proteins: specific occurrence of effector candidates in r. commune
the nip effectors had been identified originally through their necrosis-inducing activity  <cit> . with the genome sequences available, additional candidate effector genes were obtained through an in silico approach. to this end, several general criteria based on existing knowledge about protein effectors from other fungal pathogens were established that ought to be fulfilled by candidate effector proteins . effectors are secreted, i.e. most of them carry a signal peptide while lacking an additional transmembrane domain. furthermore, they are usually of small size and cysteine-rich. in addition, they should be specific for the genus rhynchosporium and expressed during pathogenesis, probably during the stage of fungal establishment in planta. of particular interest are those effector genes that are present exclusively in the genome of a single species and, hence, may be involved in determining host specificity of this fungal species.

the genome of r. commune, isolate uk <dig>  was screened for candidate genes coding for proteins that match the general criteria . the subgroup containing ≥2% cysteine residues contained  <dig> proteins. the occurrence of these genes was probed  in the genomes of the other rhynchosporium species  to identify candidates, which may be crucial for host specificity. in r. commune, seven gene models  were found to be specifically present, among them the nip <dig>  paralog . when the orthomcl algorithm  <cit>  was applied to the rhynchosporium genomes,  <dig> r. commune proteins were found to lack orthologs in the other species. blastn analysis identified the seven rcsp genes and two additional genes in the <2%-cysteine fraction . no candidate proteins were identified in the 201– <dig> amino acid size fraction.fig.  <dig> flow chart for the identification of candidate effector genes in the r. commune genome . rcsp <dig> and rcsp <dig> did not match the ≥ 2% cys criterion. rcsp <dig> , rcsp <dig>  and rcsp <dig>  were not submitted to functional analysis




the gene models as predicted by the annotation algorithms were verified using est libraries from r. commune isolate uk <dig> grown in liquid culture , from germinated conidia of british r. commune isolate  <dig> and from epidermal strips of barley leaves  <dig> dpi with british r. commune isolate 2la . in addition, rt-pcr was carried out using gene-specific primers and rna from ex planta grown r. commune isolate uk <dig> as a template. sanger sequencing of the amplification products confirmed the structures of seven of the r. commune genes . in contrast, rcsp <dig> had been annotated incorrectly, while rcsp <dig> was not expressed. more detailed blastn and orthomcl analysis detected paralogs of rcsp <dig>  rcsp <dig>  rcsp <dig> and rcsp <dig> in r. commune and homologs in other rhynchosporium species . the original genes were renamed accordingly. table  <dig>

expression of the seven r. commune candidate effector genes during pathogenesis was quantified using rna extracted from inoculated leaves of susceptible barley cultivar ‘ingrid’ at different time-points post inoculation with r. commune isolate uk <dig>  <cit> . transcript amounts of the target genes were determined relative to the transcript amounts of a constitutively expressed fungal gene, gpd, by qrt-pcr  <cit> . as observed for the nip effector genes  <cit> , the rcsp genes were all transiently expressed early during fungal infection of susceptible host leaves. between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, when disease symptom occur, rcsp mrnas virtually can no longer be detected . rcsp <dig> , rcsp <dig> and rcsp <dig> showed a maximum transcript abundance at  <dig> dpi, whereas rcsp <dig>  and rcsp <dig>  mrna levels reached a maximum at  <dig> dpi. however, rcsp <dig>  mrna abundance accounted for only about 4% of that of rcsp <dig> . rcsp <dig> and rcsp <dig> mrna levels were even lower, peaking at 3– <dig> dpi. when the infection process of the hemibiotroph colletotrichum higgensianum on arabidopsis thaliana was studied successive waves of effector gene expression could be observed during the consecutive developmental stages from unpenetrated spores through penetrated biotrophic hyphae to the biotrophy to necrotrophy switch  <cit> . the different stages of rhynchosporium development cannot be discerned as clearly as in c. higgensianum. nevertheless, maximum transcript levels for some genes  occur at 1- <dig> dpi, for others  at  <dig> dpi suggesting a similar sequence of gene expression waves.fig.  <dig> expression of rcsp genes during pathogenesis. relative rna abundance was measured by qrt-pcr during growth of fungal isolate uk <dig> on barley cv. ‚ingrid’. dotted line indicates the development of fungal biomass




to assess the role of the r. commune-specific effector genes during pathogenesis, deletion mutants were generated. using split-marker recombination  <cit>  single deletion mutants were obtained for rcsp <dig>  and rcsp <dig>  two independent mutants for rcsp <dig>  and three for rcsp <dig> , rcsp <dig>  and rcsp <dig>  after inoculation of susceptible barley cultivar ‘ingrid’ none of the deletion mutants caused a phenotype deviating substantially from that caused by wild type isolate uk <dig> at  <dig> dpi . however, when fungal biomass in planta was quantified by qpcr  <dig> of the  <dig> individual rcsp deletion mutants had grown to a significantly greater amount  than the wild type uk <dig> , whereas deviations from wild type did not occur during fungal growth on agar plates . their overlapping 95% confidence intervals allowed to combine the data of the independent deletion mutants of single rcsp genes . the weakest growth response occurred with the Δrcsp <dig> mutant, whereas the largest confidence interval was found with the Δrcsp <dig> mutant. the latter finding may be due to the fact that rcsp <dig> is identical with nip <dig> , which is part of a gene family with seven additional members in r. commune isolate uk <dig>  the observed growth increase of the deletion mutants is in contrast to the nip gene deletion mutants, which did not differ from wild type  or grew substantially slower  than the wild type on highly susceptible cultivar ‘ingrid’. . when growth of the three rcsp <dig> deletion mutants and that of wild type were compared in more detail during pathogenesis, mutant biomasses deviated significantly from that of isolate uk <dig> from about  <dig> dpi on . in addition, close inspection of disease phenotype development revealed that the first symptoms became visible already at 8– <dig> dpi with the deletion mutants, whereas wild type symptoms did not occur before  <dig> dpi . at  <dig> dpi the mutant phenotype appeared more severe than the wild type phenotype; almost the entire upper blade of the mutant-inoculated leaves was necrotic, whereas green tissue remained between the lesions of wild type-infected leaves.fig.  <dig> growth acceleration of deletion mutants. relative biomass of fungal deletion mutants and wild-type isolate uk <dig> was determined by qpcr at  <dig> dpi on barley cv. ‘ingrid’. results from independent mutants are combined . bars represent the 95% confidence intervals. n-values are given at the base of the bars

in summary, significant quantitative effects on fungal growth and symptom development became apparent upon deletion of the six r. commune-specific genes. notably, the deletion-caused growth acceleration suggested that the fungus is not adapted for the most rapid development in planta. this is similar to mutants of the grass endophyte epichloë festucae, which had switched from mutualistic to pathogenic growth including a dramatically increased fungal biomass on perennial ryegrass. different types of non-effector proteins were inactivated in the mutants; a map kinase , an nadph oxidase , which is regulated by noxr  <cit>  through interaction with small gtp binding protein raca  <cit> , and a siderophore-synthesizing nrps . therefore, it was postulated that functional stress signaling, regulated ros synthesis and siderophore-mediated iron homeostasis are crucial for restricting fungal growth as prerequisite for maintaining the mutualistic interaction with the host. it is tempting to speculate that the r. commune rcsps fulfil an analogous role in affecting hyphal growth, probably by interacting with plant compounds, thereby establishing an endophyte-like growth in host leaves during the early symptomless period of pathogenesis.

it remains to be shown whether the effects caused by the rcsps contribute to host specialization. however, the occurrence of specific effector genes in the genome of one rhynchosporium species and their absence from others species represents the simplest model to explain host specificity. alternatively, effector genes, albeit present in several rhynchosporium genomes, may be specifically expressed only in the interaction of one of them with its host plant and not in the specific interactions of other species. finally, host specificity may originate from structural differences of effector proteins rather than from presence or expression of specific genes. in addition, small molecules such as host-specific toxins originating from fungal secondary metabolism may play a role in colonizing a particular host species.

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the rhynchosporium genus belongs to the leotiomycetes clade of fungal systematics, most likely to the dermataceae family, the bcg and ccg species clearly forming separate branches of the rhynchosporium genus. genome-wide snp analysis along with the structure of the rdna regions suggested that during bcg evolution r. agropyri branched off shortly before r. commune and r. secalis diverged. at least in the bcg species, complete mating type loci exist. in addition, core meiotic genes are present and expressed along with most genes required for meiosis and sexual recombination in other  fungi, providing molecular evidence for the existence of a cryptic sexual cycle.

bioinformatic analysis revealed a large number and types of cwdes, which are characteristic for hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic fungi infecting monocotyledonous hosts, but failed to provide evidence for their involvement in host specialization. in contrast, the occurrence of genus-, species- and isolate-specific pks and nrps genes suggests a possible role in host adaptation in particular of those genes, which are missing from the genome of the closest sequenced relative, the poplar pathogen m. brunnea. the most important finding was, however, that six r. commune-specific effector proteins contribute to decelerating fungal development in planta. host adaptation of this hemibiotrophic fungus therefore appears to aim at stabilizing the biotrophic growth stage in favor of the necrotrophic destructive stage. unlike haustoria-forming fungi, apoplastic fungi like r. commune colonize the intercellular matrix of their hosts relatively slowly, usually without triggering a fast hypersensitive cell death response. the long biotrophic stage of rhynchosporium development resembles endophytic fungal growth, rendering this fungus a possible object for studying the mutualism-parasitism transition.
