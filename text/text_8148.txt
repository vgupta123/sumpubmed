BACKGROUND
the nuclear receptors  constitute a class of transcriptional regulators that are conserved throughout the animal kingdom, where they function in a wide variety of physiological and developmental roles, including metabolic regulation, xenobiotic defense, and development  <cit> . archetypal nrs have a dna-binding domain , which contains two c <dig> zinc fingers and mediates binding to specific dna sequences and receptor dimerization, and a more c-terminal ligand-binding domain , which may bind a lipophilic ligand and functions in dimerization, nuclear localization, and transcriptional trans-activation. across the animal kingdom, amino acid sequence similarity is strongly conserved in the dbd, and more weakly conserved in the lbd. the majority of nrs that have been identified on the basis of phylogenetic sequence relationship have no known ligand, despite having a recognizable lbd and are sometimes referred to as “orphan receptors”  <cit> .

the nr superfamily has proliferated and diverged to a striking degree in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans: while the c. elegans genome boasts  <dig> predicted nrs, the human genome has only  <dig> and the drosophila melanogaster genome only  <dig>  <cit> . only 15–20 c. elegans nrs are clearly orthologous to nrs that are broadly conserved among animal phyla  <cit> . the remaining  c. elegans predicted nrs appear to have evolved from an hnf <dig> ancestor and do not have clear orthologs in non-nematodes or distantly-related nematodes, suggesting that these genes have proliferated within the nematode phylum  <cit> . nematode species that are closely related to c. elegans display a similar expansion of the nr gene family. caenorhabditis briggsae and caenorhabditis remanei, two species that are separated from c. elegans by about  <dig> million years and are morphologically indistinguishable from c. elegans, contain  <dig> and  <dig> nr genes, respectively  <cit> . furthermore, only about half of c. elegans nrs are conserved in both c. briggsae and c. remanei as three-way orthologs, while an additional 10% are present as two-way orthologs  <cit> . thus, the rapid expansion of the nr family appears to have begun before the separation of c. elegansc. briggsae and c. remanei, and continued separately in all three species. the more distantly related nematode pristionchus pacificus also has an expanded complement of  <dig> nuclear receptors  <cit> , . the driving evolutionary explanation for this proliferation is unclear, but it could reflect adaptation to the complex chemical and xenobiotic environment of soil life  <cit> . in contrast, this expansion is not present in the genome of the nematode brugia malayi, a human parasite: it contains only  <dig> nr genes, most of which are conserved across animal phyla  <cit> . therefore, evolution of nrs is unexpectedly dynamic among free-living nematodes, suggesting that proliferation and divergence in the nr family may play a major role in nematode speciation. this possibility elevates the importance of understanding nr evolution and function in nematodes.

one explanation for the wide variety of caenorhabditis nrs and the radiating divergence of lbd sequences is a lack of hormone-responsiveness. nrs that are known to bind ligands in other invertebrates, such as the ecdysone receptor, are absent in caenorhabditis <cit> . however, a bona fide ligand has been identified for the c. elegans nr daf- <dig>  <cit> , and most c. elegans nrs have a recognizable lbd, raising the possibility that other c. elegans nrs may also bind as yet unknown ligands. even if some caenorhabditis nrs are not hormone-responsive, the lbd may be retained for its other functions, such as transcriptional modulation, receptor dimerization, and/or nuclear localization. in any of these cases, the wide variety of caenorhabditis lbd sequences could reflect a wider diversity of inputs or outputs, or a relaxation of selection on lbd primary sequences.

the nuclear receptors have been grouped into phylogenetically conserved families on the basis of amino acid sequence relationship  <cit> . members of the nr2e group include tailless  and unfulfilled  in drosophilatlx and pnr in vertebrates, and nhr- <dig> and fax- <dig> in c. elegans. these nrs have been systematically defined as nr2e <dig> through nr2e <dig>  another family member, designated nr2e <dig>  has been identified in insects  <cit> . the nr2e nuclear receptors that have been functionally characterized have a common theme of function in nervous system development. while mutations in the tll gene of drosophila were first identified based on their disruption of anterior-posterior patterning, subsequent analysis demonstrated functions in embryonic cns and larval eye development  <cit> . the mouse tlx gene functions in limbic system and eye development, but is not required for overall patterning of the embryo  <cit> . c. elegans fax- <dig>  its vertebrate homolog pnr, and drosophila homolog unf all play key roles in regulating neuron development  <cit> . the nr2e class is of particular importance from an evolutionary perspective as well; it includes members from the cnidaria to vertebrates, indicating that it is of ancient evolutionary ancestry  <cit> . dna-binding studies suggest that dbd properties of fax- <dig> and nhr- <dig> are at least partially evolutionarily-conserved  <cit> . however, like other c. elegans lbds, the nr2e class lbds are more highly-diverged from each other and from orthologous lbds.

we have studied the conserved nr2e class of nrs in c. elegans to examine how the low level of lbd sequence conservation affects function using an in vivo functional assay. our analysis of c. elegans nr2e-related sequences identified one unstudied “satellite” nuclear receptor, nhr- <dig>  which is related to fax- <dig>  but is not present in any other genome sequenced to date, and another nr, nhr- <dig>  which is a member of new, relatively uncharacterized clade of conserved nrs found in non-vertebrate animals that includes insect hr <dig>  using an in vivo functional assay, we tested whether lbd function was required for fax- <dig> and if lbd functions of other nr2e genes could be substituted for the fax- <dig> lbd function.

RESULTS
nr2e family receptors can be grouped into three major conserved clades
systematic classifications of nrs have grouped vertebrate tlx-like genes into an nr2e <dig> subgroup, insect tll-like genes into an nr2e <dig> subgroup, vertebrate pnr-like genes into an nr2e <dig> subgroup, and c. elegans fax- <dig> as an nr2e <dig> subgroup  <cit> . additional genes were designated nr2e <dig> and nr2e <dig>  but these appear to be absent from both nematodes and vertebrates and are not considered further in this analysis. nr2e <dig> and nr2e <dig> subfamily members have very similar dbds and dna-binding activities, as do nr2e <dig> and nr2e <dig> subfamily members  <cit> . ecdysozoans have an nr2e <dig>  but not an nr2e <dig>  and vice versa for vertebrates. the simplest explanation for this relationship is the existence of a single common ancestral gene for nr2e1/nr2e <dig>  a similar scenario is likely for the nr2e3/nr2e <dig> group.

the c. elegans genome project identified the nr2e-like nuclear receptor nhr- <dig> after the publication of a broad phylogenetic analysis to resolve evolution of the nr superfamily  <cit> . in order to determine the phylogenetic relationship of nhr- <dig> to other nematode and non-nematode nuclear receptors, we performed clustal w multiple sequence alignment and constructed trees using maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods with the predicted c. elegans nhr- <dig> protein sequence. in addition to trees based on aligned dbd and lbd sequences , we also evaluated trees using the dbd alone, since substitution rates in caenorhabditis lbds are much higher than in other species, which would lead to artificially inflated branch lengths for full-length caenorhabditis nrs. we included nuclear receptors from complete or nearly complete genome projects, including ecdysozoans , vertebrates , a hemichordate , an echinoderm , and a cnidarian . maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining computational methods produced similar results. c. elegans nhr- <dig> was organized into a diverged nr2e-like clade that includes relatively unstudied nuclear receptors from invertebrates, including the drosophila nuclear receptor hr <dig> . because this group includes genes from deuterostomes , we infer that the nhr-239/hr <dig> clade derives from a gene that was present in the urbilaterian ancestor, but has subsequently been lost from vertebrate lineages.

phylogenetic trees with full-length nr2e sequences also identified a highly-supported pnr/fax- <dig> clade, with ecdysozoan clade members on one branch and deuterostome clade members on a separate branch . as observed in earlier phylogenetics analyses  <cit> , a single tlx/tll clade was not supported, with ecdysozoan, hemichordate, and vertebrate clade members occupying separate unresolved branches. analysis of the dbd alone, however, organized vertebrate tlx and ecdysozoan tll members into a single clade . the c. elegans fax- <dig> dbd very closely resembled those of d. melanogaster unf  and h. sapiens pnr , but it was much less similar to the d. melanogaster hr <dig> dbd . in contrast, the c. elegans nhr- <dig> dbd was more similar to d. melanogaster hr <dig> than to dmunf . taken together, we interpret these data to define three major conserved clades of nr2e nrs: a tlx/tll clade, a pnr/fax- <dig> clade, and an nhr-239/hr <dig> clade.

amino acid sequences were aligned by clustalw and evaluated using mega  <dig>  software  <cit> . figures shown are the percent identical at each amino acid position in pairwise comparison, with unaligned regions deleted. species abbreviations are given in figure  <dig> 

previous analysis and annotation of nr2e nrs did not benefit from complete data sets and were not focused on the nr2e group in particular. two phylogenetic analyses of nrs that did not include nhr- <dig> grouped c. elegans fax- <dig> with drosophila hr <dig>  <cit> . these analyses were performed with phyletically-broad datasets using full-length nrs. when c. elegans nrs are included, the relatively high divergence of the lbd tends to pull c. elegans branches out of clades, leading to the possibility for long-branch attraction to weakly assemble c. elegans nrs into clades to which they do not belong  <cit> . this has led to an annotation problem where some members of the nhr-239/hr <dig> clade, including hr <dig> itself, have been designated “fax1” and received an nr2e <dig> systematic designation . the inclusion of our larger set of nhr-239/hr <dig> data argues that this annotation is misleading and should be revised.

analysis of aligned dbd sequences also revealed amino acids at certain positions that were diagnostic for each of three clades . analysis of the pnr/fax- <dig> clade identifies six amino acid positions in the dbd that are identical among all members of this clade, including asn- <dig>  which plays a key role in dna-binding specificity  <cit> , and gln- <dig>  which is predicted to mediate protein dimerization contacts  <cit> . the tlx/tll and nhr-239/hr <dig> clades have a conserved asp- <dig>  suggesting some possible overlap in dna-binding specificity. the tlx/tll group has seven clade-specific positions, including the potentially important lys- <dig>  <cit> . all three nematode tlx/tll clade members  have a d box that is expanded by an insertion of four amino acids  as compared to a single d box amino acid insertion for tlx and tll proteins from non-nematodes . this suggests that dimerization properties of nematode nrs may have diverged from other clade members. finally, the nhr-239/hr <dig> group has five clade-specific positions, including ile- <dig> and trp- <dig> , both of which are positions predicted to be involved in dna-binding and dimerization . the coordinated conservation of these residues may reveal functionally-significant positions that help determine specificity, and supports the organization of these clades as representing distinct evolutionary origins.

as expected, the  caenorhabditis  nr2e lbds aligned more poorly than the dbds with insect and vertebrate orthologs . ka/ks ratios for lbd regions  at branches that lead to nematode nrs were high , in comparison to branches that lead to insect or vertebrate nrs . in contrast, ka/ks ratios for dbd regions  were relatively low at nematode and non-nematode branches . these data suggest strong purifying selection on the dbd across phyletic groups and very weak purifying selection on nematode lbds. furthermore, some key positions in the lbd signature domain and other regions that are conserved in insects and vertebrates have diverged in caenorhabditis . the brugia malayi orthologs of fax- <dig> and nhr- <dig> seem to have followed different evolutionary histories. while the lbd of brugia fax- <dig> looks similar to drosophila unf  and human pnr , the lbd of b. malayi nhr- <dig> looks more similar to c. elegans nhr- <dig>  than to d. melanogaster . therefore, the b. malayi fax- <dig> lbd appears to have followed an insect-like path, while the b. malayi nhr- <dig> lbd appears to have followed a free-living nematode-like path. the nhr-239/hr <dig> clade lbds are considerably more diverged from each other and the lbds of other clades . this was particularly true for c. elegans and c. briggsae nhr- <dig>  which align very poorly in the lbd signature region with other nr2e lbds and are apparently truncated . this observation suggests that caenorhabditis nhr- <dig> may lack a bona fide lbd, like c. elegans odr- <dig> and drosophila knirps  <cit> .

analysis of nr2e nuclear receptors of the nematode pristionchus pacificus suggested extensive sequence divergence of lbds in this species. while the predicted p. pacificus fax- <dig> ortholog aligned well with pnr/fax- <dig> clade dbds , the predicted lbd aligned very poorly . in particular, key features of the lbd signature domain that were present in other nematode lbds were not found in the p. pacificus fax- <dig> lbd. analysis of p. pacificus genomic sequence also identified candidate nhr- <dig> and nhr- <dig> orthologs by conservation of dbd sequences , but failed to identify coding sequences or gene assembly models with similarity to tlx/tll and nhr-239/hr <dig> clade lbds . the p. pacificus genomic sequence is mostly complete  <cit> , however gene assembly and confirmation by cdna analysis is not yet comprehensive. nonetheless, the absence of lbd sequences with a clear relationship to caenorhabditis or brugia nr2e lbds suggests that lbd divergence of p. pacificus nr2e lbds may be much greater than that observed in caenorhabditis. this conclusion contrasts with the relatively strong conservation of lbd sequences reported for p. pacificus rxr  and ecdysone  receptors  <cit> .

the c. elegans genome project also identified another potential nr2e gene family member, nhr- <dig>  no clear ortholog of nhr- <dig> has been identified in any other species, including the fully-sequenced and closely-related c. briggsae and c. brenneri nematodes. the nhr- <dig> sequence is included in the pnr/fax- <dig> clade when full-length proteins are considered , but is not included when the dbd alone is considered . alignment of the nhr- <dig> dbd revealed divergence of the nhr- <dig> dbd from other nr2e family members at multiple positions . however, the nhr- <dig> dbd was still more similar to nr2e dbds than to the dbds of other nematode nrs . inclusion of nhr- <dig> in the full-length nr2e clade occurred due to extensive similarity between the nhr- <dig> lbd and fax- <dig> lbd . from these observations, we propose that the nhr- <dig> gene arose from a relatively recent duplication of the fax- <dig> gene in the c. elegans evolutionary lineage, followed by extensive divergence of the dbd.

the novel nhr- <dig> and nhr- <dig> nrs are expressed genes
while fax- <dig> and nhr- <dig> have been studied in some detail, the nhr- <dig> and nhr- <dig> genes have not been characterized. therefore, we considered the possibility that nhr- <dig> or nhr- <dig> could represent pseudogenes. while cdna clones have been identified for nhr- <dig>  spliced nhr- <dig> products have only been identified by deep sequencing , suggesting that the latter transcript may be very rare. we used nested pcr to identify a partial nhr- <dig> cdna from the 3’ end of the gene, which confirms a portion of the predicted and deep-sequencing reported exon-intron structure . we used real-time qrt-pcr to examine the temporal dynamics of nhr- <dig> and nhr- <dig> expression . nhr- <dig> transcripts were detected at modest levels in embryos, but decreased progressively during larval development. nhr- <dig> transcripts were identified at very low levels  and displayed a more complicated pattern, increasing somewhat from embryos to l <dig>  before declining progressively during later larval development.

in order to examine cell-specific expression of both genes in living nematodes, we constructed nhr-111::gfp and nhr-239::gfp transgenes . the nhr-111::gfp reporter was consistently expressed in at least eight pairs of neurons in the head, the sensory pvd neurons of the posterior lateral body wall, the pharynx, intestine , the dorsal peri-vulva region of adults , and the somatic gonad precursor cells . among the head neurons was one prominent pair of sensory neurons just posterior to the nerve ring and at least one pair of neurons or support cells that appear to be inner or outer labial sensory cells. we also observed weak and variable expression in a subset of ventral nerve cord motorneurons. the temporal dynamics of nhr-111::gfp were consistent with nhr- <dig> qrt-pcr results: expression was very bright in the z <dig> and z <dig> somatic gonad precursor cells in embryos and early l <dig>  but decreased in the developing gonad at later stages and was relatively faint in other cells. therefore, despite its relatively recent evolutionary origin, the nhr- <dig> gene is fairly broadly expressed.

the nhr-239::gfp reporter was weakly expressed in three to four pairs of neurons in the head and a pharyngeal neuron in late stage embryos and all larval and adult stages . one pair of dorsal neurons express nhr-239::gfp very consistently and appear to be sensory, as do one pair of pharyngeal cells that appear to be the mc, nsm or m <dig> neurons. we observed faint fluorescence in the pharynx , but did not observe nhr- <dig> expression in other cells at any stage. as expected from the modest expression levels observed in qrt-pcr experiments, fluorescence from the nhr-239::gfp transgene was very faint. while it is possible that our translational fusion did not recapitulate the entire nhr- <dig> expression pattern, this result suggests that nhr- <dig> is expressed only in a very limited subset of neurons. taken together, these data demonstrate that both genes are expressed, and that both may play roles in neuron development like other nr2e family members.

fax- <dig>  nhr- <dig>  and nhr- <dig> have predicted lbd structures that are similar to defined vertebrate lbds
like most c. elegans nrs, fax- <dig>  nhr- <dig>  and nhr- <dig> proteins have extended c-terminal regions after the dbd that have some features of canonical nr lbds . however, the greater divergence at the level of primary sequence makes diagnosis of a probable lbd more difficult in c. elegans than in drosophila and other animals. in the case of nhr- <dig>  the c-terminal region is truncated and much more highly diverged in both c. elegans and c. briggsae, suggesting that this nr has dispensed with a bona fide lbd. lipophilic ligands generally bind internally to lbds, raising the possibility that for nr lbds, structure may be a more important consideration than primary sequence  <cit> . to examine the structural capacity for c. elegans nr2e c-terminal regions to encode lbds, we used psipred and the threading utility pgenthreader. this application compares predicted secondary structures derived from primary protein sequence to a database of solved tertiary structures to predict likelihood of structural match  <cit> . the c. elegans fax- <dig>  c. briggsae fax- <dig>  and c. elegans nhr- <dig> and nhr- <dig> lbds all returned top matches to known vertebrate nr <dig> lbds, with varying degrees of confidence . the fax- <dig> lbd was most similar to the nr2f <dig> coup lbd, albeit with modest significance. the related nhr- <dig> lbd also matched nr2f <dig>  with much higher significance. the nhr- <dig> lbd returned a very significant match to the nr2c <dig> testicular receptor  <dig> . in contrast, the nhr- <dig> sequences did not return significant matches to any structures in the database. therefore, despite relatively weak sequence conservation between caenorhabditis lbds and vertebrate lbds, most nr2e caenorhabditis lbds retain a predicted structural framework that is similar to defined lbds.

the c. elegans fax- <dig> lbd is not required for some functions in vivo 
the higher substitution rate of caenorhabditis lbds raised the possibility that nematode lbds have broadly diverse functions—that diversifying selection has led to the evolution of highly-specific lbds. in order to test this possibility, we used well-characterized fax- <dig> mutants and rescuing plasmids to serve as a basis for testing the functional requirements of the fax- <dig> lbd  <cit> . a null mutation in the fax- <dig> gene causes a distinctive movement defect. c. elegans normally moves with a smooth sine wave, but fax- <dig> mutants are unable to generate coordinated muscle contractions in their posterior half, leading to severely compromised forward movement. backing movement is more rapid, but inevitably leads to “coiling”—animals back into a circle on themselves instead of progressing straight backward. these defects may be due to underlying defects in the differentiation of the command interneurons that coordinate forward and backward motility  <cit> . fax- <dig> mutations affect multiple interneuron types. in the avk interneuron pair, fax- <dig> mutations cause a high-penetrance defect in axon pathfinding: instead of the avkr and avkl axons extending on the respective left and right sides of the ventral nerve cord, the axons are misrouted to the dorsal nerve cord, a lateral nerve bundle, or extend as a pair along the right ventral nerve cord  <cit> . the anatomy of the avk neurons can be easily evaluated using anti-fmrfamide antisera  <cit> . fax- <dig> function in avk development is presumably a separate function from the fax- <dig> function in movement, since the avk neurons are not known to be required for movement coordination.

to test lbd function, we created a family of dna constructs that would produce fusion proteins that contained the fax- <dig> dbd fused to another nr2e lbd, and a protein that would contain only the fax- <dig> dbd without any lbd. plasmids were based on a 9 kb genomic fragment that fully-rescued the fax- <dig> movement and avk axon phenotypes  <cit> . for each construct, the genomic region between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> was replaced by a cdna containing a positive control fax- <dig> cdna sequence , a negative control fax- <dig> cdna sequence in inverted orientation , a deleted version of the fax- <dig> lbd  or a cdna sequence from the c. briggsae fax- <dig>  nhr- <dig>  or nhr- <dig> lbd . this strategy created plasmids that would produce fax- <dig> dbd::heterologous lbd translational fusion proteins in which the region coding for the fax- <dig> dbd was linked to an lbd-coding segment that began in the "hinge region" that separates dbd and lbd, and which replaced the fax- <dig> lbd. the encoded fusion genes and deletion construct were under the transcriptional regulation of the fax- <dig> promoter in order to ensure expression of the fusion or deleted protein at the correct time and in the correct cells for fax- <dig> function.

in order to test the ability of the fusion and deletion constructs to provide in vivo fax- <dig> function, we injected each plasmid into fax- <dig> lin- <dig> c. elegans hermaphrodites, along with a co-transforming plasmid that provides wild-type lin- <dig> function. for each transgenic line, we evaluated fax- <dig> function by measuring forward movement rates . while wild-type worms had a forward movement rate of  <dig>   μm/sec, fax- <dig> mutants, fax- <dig> mutants transformed with the lin-15- rescuing plasmid alone, and fax- <dig> mutants transformed with the fax-1::inv fax- <dig> negative control had forward movement rates of  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   μm/sec, respectively . the fax-1::fax- <dig> positive control provided a significantly rescued  forward movement of  <dig>   μm/sec. when the fax- <dig> dbd region was fused to another caenorhabditis lbd, we obtained significant rescue  of the fax- <dig> movement phenotype: forward movement rates ranged from  <dig>   μm/sec  to  <dig>   μm/sec . likewise, the fax-1::Δ lbd construct, which contains no lbd at all, was able to provide a robust forward movement rate of  <dig>   μm/sec. differences between c. elegans fax- <dig>  c. briggsae fax- <dig>  and nhr- <dig> fusion pairs were not statistically significant , but the increased rescue with the nhr- <dig> lbd or Δ lbd constructs as compared to other lbds was significant . the reason for the improved rescue by the nhr- <dig> lbd and Δ lbd constructs is not clear. it may reflect a larger number of copies in the transgene, array-specific variation in transcription levels, or structural differences at the level of protein fusion. therefore, despite a conserved lbd structure and ligand-binding signature region, the fax- <dig> lbd is not required for fax- <dig> function in the development of neurons that control movement.

we also examined rescue of the fax- <dig> phenotype at the level of avk axonal anatomy  <cit>  by the heterologous and deletion lbd constructs. negative controls displayed a high rate of avk pathfinding defects in which the avkr axon was absent from the right ventral nerve cord bundle, while transgenic animals bearing lbd fusions displayed rescue of the avk pathfinding defect consistent with rescue of the movement defect . in the lin- <dig> background, 97% of fax- <dig> displayed the avkr axonal defect, an increase from the 78% of fax- <dig> mutants that showed this defect. lin- <dig> functions in vulval development, and this enhancement may reflect the role of vulval precursor cells in organizing the normal bundling arrangement of the ventral nerve cord  <cit> . the presence of ectopic developing vulvae along the ventral mid-line of lin- <dig> mutant animals may increase the severity of the avkr axonal defect by contributing post-outgrowth bundling defects during larval development. the fax-1::inv fax- <dig> negative control displayed no rescue of the avkr axon defect, but lbd fusion constructs with c elegans fax- <dig>  c. briggsae fax- <dig>  nhr- <dig>  and nhr- <dig> all displayed significant rescue of the avkr axon defect, reducing the penetrance of the defect to between 33% and 61% . as was the case for the movement defect, rescue with fax-1::nhr- <dig> was not as strong as with other caenorhabditis lbds. therefore, at the level of axonal anatomy, different caenorhabditis lbds and a deletion of the lbd were able to provide fax- <dig> function.

the percentage of the avkr axon crossover defect  <cit>  is shown for each strain. n = number of avkr axons examined. p = chi square p values relative to  fax- <dig> lin- <dig>  strain without any transgene.

we confirmed expression and subcellular localization of our fusion and deletion products by immunofluorescence staining. a mouse anti-fax- <dig> antiserum raised to full-length fax- <dig> protein detected a strong signal in  fax- <dig> lin- <dig>  embryos that carried a fax- <dig> dbd-contained transgene . because fax- <dig> mutants produce no detectable fax- <dig> protein  <cit> , the protein detected by the antiserum must reflect expression of the fax- <dig> dbd that is common to all fusion and deletion construct transgenes. we detected strong expression by all four fusion transgenes  and the fax-1::Δ lbd transgene in a spatial and temporal pattern that was nearly identical to the fax- <dig> expression pattern in wild-type embryos  <cit> , indicating that our constructs produced stable protein at the correct time and place . the fax-1::Δ lbd, fax-1::fax- <dig>  fax-1::cbfax- <dig> and fax-1::nhr- <dig> constructs also showed excellent nuclear localization, suggesting that the lbd is not required for import of fax- <dig> protein to the nucleus. the fax-1::nhr- <dig> construct was expressed at very high levels, but many embryos showed significant accumulation of protein in the cytoplasm . it is unclear whether this reflects an artefact of high expression levels or a “dominant” effect of the nhr- <dig> lbd that inhibits nuclear localization of the fax-1::nhr- <dig> fusion protein. despite the nuclear localization issue, the fax-1::nhr- <dig> construct still provided functional rescue, although it is possible that the somewhat weaker rescue by this construct may be accounted for by the compromised nuclear localization.

discussion
analysis of lbd function in the c. elegans nr2e subfamily demonstrates the functional independence of some fax- <dig> functions on the presence or sequence of the lbd. the simplest interpretation of this result is that the key fax- <dig> functions that we have assayed require only binding of the dbd moiety to its cognate recognition site. this is consistent with our previous finding that the fax- <dig> dbd alone possesses both sequence specificity and homodimerization function  <cit> . furthermore, the dbd also appears to possess sufficient transcription regulation activity to confer normal function. in addition, the dbd expressed in vivo without an lbd appears to be efficiently localized to the nucleus, indicating that the lbd is not required for efficient localization. finally, the absence of a requirement for the fax- <dig> lbd demonstrates that it is not ligand-dependent—at least for the functions we have tested. the lbd of the drosophila ortholog of fax- <dig>  unf, has been shown to bind heme  <cit> , although there is no known developmental or physiological requirement for heme-binding. if the fax- <dig> lbd can also bind heme-related ligands, our results suggest that this binding is not essential for key fax- <dig> functions in c. elegans.

the independence of fax- <dig> functions from the presence or identity of an lbd suggests that the relatively high level of primary sequence divergence of caenorhabditis lbds may not reflect diversifying selective pressure toward highly specific functional roles. instead, the relatively high sequence divergence may result from a release of positive selection on the primary sequence, with sequence differences reflecting drift. nonetheless, protein sequence threading suggests that some general aspects of secondary and tertiary lbd structure may be maintained in caenorhabditis. changes in selective pressure on nematode lbds may have allowed a greater degree of tolerance for substitution within the context of conserved structure.

analysis of c. elegans lbds and the caenorhabditis genomes has cast doubt on the hypothesis that c. elegans nrs mediate transcription using the same components as vertebrate systems. for example, the lbd of several vertebrate nuclear receptors have been shown to bind a common set of coactivators and corepressors, which in turn mediate the effect of the nuclear receptor on transcription  <cit> . however, an af <dig> domain, which is contained within the many vertebrate lbds and responsible for interaction with p <dig> coactivators, is absent from most caenorhabditis nrs, including the fax- <dig> and nhr- <dig> orthologs in this study, and most of the known vertebrate nr coactivator and corepressor genes were absent from a survey of predicted genes in c. elegans <cit> . therefore, significant differences between vertebrates and caenorhabditis in the mechanisms of transcriptional control may account for the apparent differences in lbd function in c. elegans.

the lack of a requirement for lbd function for fax-1rescue in our assay does not necessarily indicate that the fax- <dig> lbd provides no function or that c. elegans nr2e proteins in general are ligand-independent. on the contrary, the structural conservation of the c. elegans lbds , weak purifying selection on lbd sequences , and the general absence of truncated lbds among conserved nrs in the c. elegans genome , combine to argue that lbds have been retained because they provide function. it is possible that the fax- <dig> lbd is required for subtle aspects of developmental control that are not revealed by our rescue assay. alternatively, the developmental functions that we have tested could be entirely lbd-independent, but other functions are lbd-dependent. this might be the case if fax- <dig> provides an unknown physiological, ecological, or behavioural function during larval and/or adult stages. a precedent for both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent functions exists for vertebrate steroid nrs  <cit> . it is worth noting that all the c. elegans nr2e genes in this study are expressed in larval and adult cells . this observation raises the possibility that nhr- <dig> may partner with other transcription factors in a highly-redundant and overlapping manner to fine-tune gene regulation in many cells. the observation that nhr- <dig> is a major node in the c. elegans interactome map of predicted protein interactions, partnering with itself  and  <dig> other proteins  <cit> , many of which are potential transcription factors, provides some support for this hypothesis.

finally, our phylogenetic analysis using a larger set of nr2e sequences from many species argues for three significant evolutionarily-conserved clades: tll/tlx, fax-1/pnr, and nhr-239/hr <dig>  our data call into question the hypothesis that fax- <dig> and pnr represent different genes in the urbilateralian ancestor followed by subsequent loss of pnr in nematodes and loss of fax- <dig> in vertebrates  <cit> . not only do our phylogenetic data support an orthologous evolutionary origin for fax- <dig> and pnr, direct examination of dbd alignments identify consistent conserved loci within each clade, a situation that is less likely to exist due to convergent evolution. a more parsimonious interpretation is a single urbilateralian ancestor for both pnr and fax- <dig>  to date, we know of no genome that includes a pnr ortholog, a fax- <dig> ortholog and an nhr-239/hr <dig> ortholog. instead most animal genomes boast a single pnr-like gene or a single fax-1-like gene, with a single nhr-239/hr <dig> clade member and a single tll/tlx clade member. our interpretations of the relationship of nr2e receptors call into question the utility of the systematic nomenclature system for nrs  <cit>  when applied to divergent c. elegans receptors. in this case, a version of long-branch attraction or similar artefact has resulted in a confusing situation in which c. elegans fax- <dig> and insect hr <dig> both have been assigned nr2e <dig> even though fax- <dig> is clearly more similar to insect nr2e <dig> and c. elegans nhr- <dig> is more similar to hr <dig>  this change in the evolutionary assumptions of the nr2e subfamily does not change predictions of the original number of nrs as described by bertrand et al.,  <cit> , since the “new” nhr-239/hr <dig> clade effectively replaces the “lost” fax- <dig> clade that results from fusing fax- <dig> and pnr into a single clade. in this case, a larger data set was important for drawing the clearest evolutionary inferences. therefore, complex evolutionary patterns in large gene families may benefit substantially from large-scale sequencing projects that examine closely-related species, such as the current  <dig> nematode genomes project .

CONCLUSIONS
we define three conserved clades of nr2e receptors, only two of which are represented in vertebrates. this observation suggests that there were three ancestral nr2e genes in the urbilateria. additional genes have spawned from descendants of these three ancestral genes, including nhr- <dig>  which is a broadly-expressed paralog that appears to have arisen within the caenorhabditis evolutionary lineage. lbd function is not required for at least some important developmental functions of one nr2e family member. this result suggests that the relatively high level of sequence divergence for caenorhabditis lbds reflects relaxed selection on the primary sequence, rather than highly diversifying positive selection.
