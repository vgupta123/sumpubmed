BACKGROUND
phylogenetic group b <dig>  sequence type   <dig> escherichia coli has been a worldwide dominant human extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli  since the beginning of the 2000s, and is among those resistant to fluoroquinolones and/or producing the extended-spectrum β-lactamase  ctx-m- <dig>  <cit> . its dominance was shown to be driven by the expansion of a subclone harboring type  <dig> fimbriae-encoding fimh allele  <dig> , comprised of mostly strains resistant to fluoroquinolones   <cit> . within this subclone, a subgroup called h30-rx, mostly comprising strains resistant to fluoroquinolones and producing ctx-m- <dig>  has quickly emerged and disseminated  <cit> . the evolutionary history of clone st <dig> revealed that before the emergence and dissemination of subclone h <dig> , the st <dig> population consisted of mostly two subclones called h <dig>  and h <dig> , with subclone h <dig> comprised of mostly fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates . it also revealed that subclone h <dig> was the precursor of subclone h <dig> and that separate f-type plasmids have shaped the evolution of subclone h <dig>  <cit> . the most recent st <dig> e. coli phylogenetic reconstruction carried out by ben zakour et al. using  <dig> non-recombinant single nucleotide polymorphisms  found in the high quality genomes of  <dig> clade b and c strains, identified five b subclades, for which the independent evolutionary trajectories are characterized by successive insertions and a recombination from ancestral h <dig>   <cit> . subclade b <dig> is characterized by a flag- <dig> locus insertion, subclade b <dig> by a flag- <dig> locus insertion and par-c <dig> recombination, subclade b <dig> by flag- <dig> locus and gi-phev insertions, and subclade b <dig> by flag- <dig> locus and phi <dig> insertions. other insertions, notably that of gi-phev, recombination events, and mutations in gyra and parc occurred within strains of subclade b <dig>  resulting in their evolution to clade c and subclades c <dig>  and c <dig> . epidemiologically, the  <dig> isolates consisted of mostly those from north america obtained between  <dig> and  <dig>  with most collected between  <dig> and  <dig>  irrespective of the clade and subclade types. since the first description of the fimh lineage in  <dig>  <cit> , the fimh type has been found in several epidemiological studies published on expec or fecal st <dig> isolates . however, these have mostly concerned fluoroquinolone-resistant and /or esbl-producing isolates. in  <dig>  we retrieved non-esbl-producing st <dig> e. coli isolates, susceptible or resistant to fluoroquinolones, from the intestinal microbiota of 7% of healthy subjects living in the paris area  <cit> . the fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates accounted for a subdominant e. coli population in four independent healthy subjects, whereas those susceptible to fluoroquinolones accounted for the dominant e. coli population in three other independent subjects. the latter finding strongly suggests that st <dig> e. coli is part of the normal intestinal microbiota of humans. in the present study, we aimed to determine whether these isolates belong to different h subclones, based on their fluoroquinolone-susceptibility pattern. the dominant fluoroquinolone-susceptible st <dig> e. coli populations belonged to subclone h <dig>  assembled and annotated genomes of h <dig> strains were not available when we performed the present study. thus, we first sequenced the whole genome of one of our commensal h <dig> strains  and compared it to the genome of two reference st <dig> strains: the expec h30-rx strain jj <dig> and the commensal h <dig> strain se <dig>  this genome comparison focused on virulence factor -encoding genes and those encoding processes or structures  known to be involved in the adaptation of the bacteria to different environments including human intestine. the four fluoroquinolone-resistant fecal st <dig> isolates were h30-r strains. thus, we compared them to the three fecal h <dig> strains considering the genomic differences identified between h <dig> strain s <dig> and h30-rx strain jj <dig>  and analyzed the phenotypic impact of some of these differences.

methods
bacterial strains
the seven fecal st <dig> isolates  obtained from the intestinal microbiota of seven healthy subjects living in the paris area in  <dig> were included in the study. they display serotype o25:h <dig>  do not produce esbl, and are either susceptible  or resistant  to fluoroquinolones  <cit> . the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were retrieved by plating the feces of healthy subjects on nalidixic acid-containing plates. the fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains accounted for the dominant e. coli population of three subjects. we previously assessed the virulence potential of strain s <dig> in the caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish models and analyzed its genome by optical mapping. this strain had a level of virulence similar to that of the multidrug resistant st <dig> isolates, with which it shared 86% genome similarity  <cit> . we also included the e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> reference strain in the study as a control in the experiments assessing the use of gluconate as the sole source of carbon.

fimh type

fimh typing was based on the internal 489-nucleotide  sequence of the fimh gene as previously described  <cit> .

antibiotic susceptibility
antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the agar diffusion method and interpreted following the  <dig> eucast recommendations . the following antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, cotrimoxazole and fosfomycin.

molecular analysis of resistance mechanisms
the genes encoding resistance to amoxicillin  were identified by pcr and sequencing methods as previously described  <cit> . the qnr genes encoding plasmid-mediated resistance to fluoroquinolones were tested and the quinolone resistance determining region  of the genes gyra, gyrb, parc and pare amplified and sequenced using methods previously described . the qrdrs of our strains were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone-susceptible reference strain e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig>  and the allelic gyra and parc profiles were compared with those previously described for st <dig> isolates  <cit> .

sequencing and analysis of the whole genome of h <dig> strain s250
the complete genomic sequence was determined for h <dig> strain s <dig>  total dna was extracted using the qiagen blood & cell culture dna mini kit . libraries were constructed using nextera technology and sequenced on an illumina hiseq- <dig> using a 2 ×  <dig> nucleotides  paired-end strategy. all reads were processed to remove low quality or artefactual nucleotides, using sequentially sickle , alientrimmer  <cit>  and fqduplicate . read pairs were assembled using clc_assembler from the clc genomics workbench analysis package . all contigs of ≥500 nt were reordered and reoriented, using the genomic sequence of strain e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> as a reference, with mauve contig mover  <cit> . the reordered contigs were analyzed. the genome of h <dig> strain s <dig> was compared to that of two reference st <dig> strains, jj <dig>   and se <dig>  , focusing on vf-encoding genes and genes involved in sugar metabolism, biofilm formation, and methylation. we downloaded vfs  available from the virulence factor database  and searched the three genomes for their presence using prodigal v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and clustered them at 90% identity using cd-hit v <dig>   <cit> . we extracted the sequences of the genes involved in biofilm formation in strain e. coli k <dig> bw <dig>  <cit>  from its genome  and clustered them at 90% identity with cd-hit. we assessed the percentage identity between the genes from e. coli k <dig> bw <dig> and the three studied genomes. using the nbci basic local alignment search tool , we blasted genes from e. coli k <dig> mg <dig> against the s <dig>  jj <dig>  and se <dig> genomes to verify the possible absence of any genes involved in biofilm formation. we then searched the genomes of st <dig> strains s <dig>  jj <dig>  and se <dig> for genes involved in sugar metabolism as defined by maltby et al.  <cit>  in commensal strains e. coli hs  and e. coli nissle  <dig>  using blast. moreover, we also searched for all the genes involved in gluconate metabolism  which plays a role in the two pathways; the entner-doudoroff pathway: edd and eda; additional genes involved in other pathways: kdgt, kdgk, gnd, tkra, ghrb, kdud, dkga and dkgb)  <cit> , as well as the  <dig> base pairs  upstream of the start codon of each, in the genome of strains s <dig> and jj <dig>  the nucleotide sequence of the 100 bp-upstream regions and the sequences of the deduced proteins for each gene of the strains s <dig> and jj <dig> were compared. we also searched for genes encoding methyltransferases in st <dig> strain ec <dig>   <cit>  in the genome of st <dig> strains s <dig>  jj <dig>  and se <dig> using blast.

subclade b and clade c typing
according to the work of ben zakour et al.  <cit> , we determined the subclade b type of h <dig> strain s <dig> and the clade c type of strain jj <dig> by direct blasting of the genes of the flag- <dig> locus , phi <dig> , and gi-phev  against the genome of strains s <dig> and jji <dig>  we then determined the type of subclade b displayed by strain s <dig> and the two other fecal h <dig> strains by pcr using primers specific for the flag- <dig> locus, phi <dig>  and gi-phev  and our h30-r fecal strains as a positive control.

plasmid content
the plasmid content of h <dig> strain s <dig> was determined using the plasmidfinder system  <cit>  and the fii, fia, and fib formula of the detected incf plasmid by pcr-based replicon typing . the latter method was also applied to the two remaining fecal h <dig> strains and the four fecal h30-r strains.

expec status and virotype
according to the study of johnson and adam, expec status is defined by the presence of ≥ <dig> vf genes among the following genes: pap, sfa/focde, afa/drabc, iuta, and kpsmt ii  <cit> . as the latter gene is not included in the vfdb, we searched for it by blasting the kpsmt ii genes  against the s <dig>  jj <dig>  and se <dig> genomes. based on the study of blanco et al., the major virotypes of e.coli st <dig> are defined using four genes as follows: virotype a = afafm955459+

ibea

sat
+/−, virotype b = afafm955459−

sat
+/−  <cit> . as afafm <dig> is not included in the vfdb, we searched for it by blasting the afafm <dig> operon  against the s <dig>  jj <dig>  and se <dig> genomes  <cit> . then, classic multiplex pcr was used to search for genes encoding expec-associated vfs   <cit>  in the seven fecal strains to confirm the results provided by the direct genome analysis of strain s <dig> and to determine the vf profile, virotype, and expec status of the six remaining fecal strains.

fimh structure
according to the study of sokurenko et al., the amino acid variations observed within the sequence of the adhesin, fimh, of type  <dig> fimbriae, result in different levels of binding to mono-mannose  structures, whereas they have no impact on the normal high level of binding to tri-mannose  structures  <cit> . by measuring the ratio of m1/m <dig> binding in different experimental models, they defined low m1-binding  and high m1-binding  fimh phenotypes and showed that they are related to specific fimh sequences  <cit> . therefore, the deduced protein sequence of fimh of h <dig> strain s <dig> was compared with that of h30-rx st <dig> strain jj <dig> , h <dig> st <dig> strain se <dig> , phylogroup a e. coli strain mg <dig> , and two other phylogroup b <dig> strains: st <dig> strain cft <dig>  and st <dig> uk_p <dig> . the deduced protein sequence of fimh was then characterized for the six remaining fecal strains by using primers for which the sequences have been previously published  <cit> .

amplification and sequencing of the idnk  and ghrb genes of the seven fecal strains and growth with gluconate as the sole carbon source
the idnk  gene, encoding a thermosensitive d-gluconate kinase, and the ghrb gene, encoding a gluconate reductase, were amplified with primers indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig>  additional primers were used to sequence the ghrb gene . we evaluated the ability of the seven strains to grow in the presence of gluconate as the sole carbon source, as previously described  <cit> . experiments were conducted three times independently and all incubations were performed overnight at 37 °c with shaking . briefly, bacteria were first cultured in mueller hinton broth before washing twice in minimal media m <dig> . we inoculated 5 ml of m <dig> supplemented with  <dig> % glucose  with 10 μl of the washed bacteria. one ml of this culture was washed twice in m <dig>  we transferred 10 μl of this washed culture into 5 ml of m <dig> with  <dig> % gluconate . the cultures were then adjusted to  <dig>  at od <dig> in 30 ml fresh m <dig> with  <dig> % gluconate and incubated at 37 °c with shaking . we estimated the bacterial growth after 48 h by measuring the od <dig>  <cit> . tukey’s test was used for intergroup comparisons and r software for statistical analyses. p values < <dig>  were considered to be statistically significant.

amplification and sequencing of the fimb gene and kinetics of biofilm formation in the seven fecal strains
the fimb gene was amplified and sequenced with the primers indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the kinetics of early biofilm formation was assessed using the biofilm ring test® , as described  <cit> . briefly, standardized bacterial cultures were incubated at 37 °c in a 96-well microtiter plate in the presence of magnetic beads. at various time points, the plates were placed onto a magnetic test block and put in the reader. the images of each well before and after magnetic attraction were analyzed using biofilm control software that gives a biofilm index . the bfi was converted into the proportion of immobilized beads relative to a reference condition  using the formula: % rbi = √ × <dig>  where bfiassay is the bfi of the tested strain, bficontrol is the bfi of the control, corresponding to the maximum bfi, and bfimin is the minimal observed bfi when all the beads are blocked. the more rbi approaches a value of  <dig>  the more the biofilm is fully formed . three experiments were performed in duplicated per strain and per incubation time. the kinetics of biofilm formation were compared using a two-way anova followed by dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.

RESULTS
fimh type, antibiotic susceptibility, molecular analysis of resistance mechanisms, and allelic profiles of the gyra and parc genes
the three fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains  were of the fimh <dig> type. all but one were susceptible to all of the antibiotics tested . h <dig> strain  <dig> was resistant to both amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. the four fluoroquinolone-resistant strains , which were all resistant to amoxicillin but susceptible to the other antibiotics tested, were of the fimh <dig> type  . qrdr nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the three h <dig> strains displayed gyra1a and parc <dig> alleles, whereas the four h30-r strains displayed the gyra1ab allele, encoding amino acid substitutions s83 l and d87n, and the parc1aab allele, encoding amino acid substitutions s80i and e84v . we found the substitution i529l in pare in the seven fecal strains . none of these strains harbored plasmid-mediated qnr genes. h <dig>  <dig> and the four h30-r strains that were resistant to amoxicillin harbored a tem-1-encoding gene .table  <dig> characterization of the seven fecal strains of e. coli st131

genomic and phenotypic characterization
we assembled the whole genome sequence of the fecal h <dig> strain s <dig> into  <dig> contigs and analyzed and compared it with those of the expec h30-rx strain jj <dig> and the commensal h <dig> strain se <dig> 

subclade b and c type
we were unable to find the genes composing the flag- <dig> locus in the genome of h <dig> strain s <dig> using blast. we only found a fragment of approximately 1700 bp which was very similar to the end of the first gene, ifha, and another of 769 bp similar to the end to the last gene, lafu, of the flag- <dig> locus . we found neither phi <dig> nor gi-phev in the genome of h22strain s <dig>  whereas we found them, as well as the flag- <dig> locus, in the genome of jj <dig>  the use of specific primers allowed us to confirm the absence of these genetic elements in h <dig> strain  <dig> and to detect the flag- <dig> locus in h <dig> strains  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as gi-phev in h <dig> strain  <dig>  these three genetic elements were amplified from our four h-30r strains .

vf-encoding genes
using a gene identity level of ≥90%, a total of  <dig> genes among the  <dig> escherichia sp. vf-encoding genes of the vfdb was identified in the genomes of the three st <dig> strains studied. h <dig> strain s <dig>  h30-rx strain jj <dig>  and h <dig> strain se <dig> had  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> vf-encoding genes, respectively. the three st <dig> genomes shared  <dig> virulence genes . nine genes were found specifically in h <dig> strain s250: the five irobcden genes that encode proteins related to a catecholate siderophore, the three pixcdh genes encoding pix pilus adhesion, and the ibea gene involved in invasion of brain endothelium . ten genes were specifically found in h30-rx strain jj1886: the four iucabcd and iuta genes encoding proteins involved in the binding and transport of iron, the pap <dig> and papx genes encoding pap operon regulatory proteins, the sat gene encoding a toxin, the flu gene encoding autotransporter protein ag43a, and the iha gene encoding the adhesion-siderophore receptor. three genes, including the fimb gene, were present in strains h <dig> s <dig> and h <dig> se <dig>  but not h30-rx strain jj <dig> . the ecp_ <dig> gene, encoding a val-gly repeats-related protein, was present in h <dig> strain se <dig> and h30-rx strain jj <dig> fig.  <dig> list of genes found in the genomes of h <dig> strain s <dig>  h30-rx strain jj <dig> and, h <dig> strain se <dig>  each strain is represented by a circle and each gene commonly found in the genome of two strains or in the genome of the three strains is indicated in the corresponding intersecting regions, whereas genes specific for each strain are indicated in the section of the circle not shared with another circle. the  <dig> genes present in the three strains are listed at the bottom of the figure




virotype and expec status
the vf genes identified in the vfdb would suggest virotype d  for strain s <dig> and virotype c  for strain jj <dig>  these virotypes were confirmed by the absence of the afafm <dig> operon in the genome of strains s <dig> and jj <dig>  shown using blast. we were unable to determine a virotype for strain se <dig>  as none of the four genes were detected in the genome of this strain. combining vfdb-based and blast analysis of the kpsmt ii gene, we found that strains s <dig> and se <dig> did not display an expec status, as they harbored only one  of the genes used to define this status. multiplex pcr classically used to search for genes encoding expec-associated vf  to the seven fecal strains showed that the two remaining fecal h <dig> strains displayed virotype d, as strain s <dig>  and the four fecal h30-r strains virotype c, as strain jj <dig> . it also showed that only virotype c h30-r strain  <dig> displayed an expec status related to the presence of the iuta and kpsmt ii genes. we found  <dig> of the amplified vf genes  in all but one  strain, five  in only h30-r strains, and four  in only h <dig> strains. the number of amplified vf-encoding genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig> in h30-r strains and  <dig> to  <dig> in h <dig> strains.table  <dig> virulence factor-encoding genes, virotype, and expec status of human fecal st <dig> escherichia coli h <dig> and h <dig> subclones

deduced protein fimh
as indicated in fig.  <dig>  the deduced protein sequence of adhesin fimh of representatives of h30-rx st <dig> e. coli , h <dig> st <dig> e. coli , h <dig> st <dig> e. coli , upec , and e. coli k <dig>  displayed amino acid differences at the positions previously shown to characterize different m1/m <dig> ratio phenotypes, contributing to different levels of colonization of different niches  <cit> . thus, we identified the sequence -a <dig>  n <dig> and s <dig> or n <dig> and s <dig>  v <dig>  and r166- corresponding to the lower m1/m <dig> ratio  in the study of sokurenko et al. in strain se <dig>  we found the substitutions a27v and v163a, that are each related to a ten-fold increase in the m1/m <dig> ratio in the sokurenko et al., study in strain mg <dig> and strain cft <dig>  respectively. we also found the substitution r166h related to a m1/m <dig> ratio of  <dig>  in the same study in h30-rx strains jj <dig> and uk_p <dig>  h <dig> strain s <dig> displayed a sequence not published in the sokurenko et al. study as residue n was present at both positions  <dig> and  <dig>  however, we found none of the substitutions known to induce an increase in the m1/m <dig> ratio in the fimh sequence of strain s <dig>  we found the same feature in the two other fecal h <dig> strains, whereas the fimh sequence of our four h30-r strains was identical to that of h30-rx strains jj <dig> and uk_ p <dig> .fig.  <dig> alignment of fimh sequence from various escherichia coli strains. phylogroup b <dig> e. coli: st <dig> strain cft <dig>  h <dig> st <dig> jj <dig>  h <dig> st <dig> uk_p <dig>  h <dig> st <dig> s <dig> and h <dig> st <dig> se15; phylogroup a: mg <dig>  “1” indicates the start of the fimh protein. amino acid positions involved in binding to mono-mannose and tri-mannose structures are indicated in grey





genes involved in sugar metabolism and growth with gluconate as the sole carbon source
all genes involved in sugar metabolism in commensal e. coli strains hs and nissle were detected in the genome of h <dig> strain se <dig>  whereas one, the d-gluconate kinase-encoding idnk  gene, was not detected in either strain h30-rx jj <dig> or h <dig> s <dig> . its absence in our six remaining strains was revealed by the pcr-sequencing assay. therefore, we assessed the ability of our strains to grow with gluconate as the sole carbon source in the absence of the idnk  gene and the presence of the gntk gene, which both transform d-gluconate to 6p-gluconate. after 48 h of growth, the biomass of our h30-r strains was significantly lower than that for our h <dig> strains  . this unexpected difference led us to compare the genomes of strains h <dig> s <dig> and h30-rx jj <dig> focusing on all the genes, other than the idnk  gene, involved in gluconate metabolism, as well as the 100 bp upstream of the start codon of the operons or genes. all were present in the genome of strains s <dig> and jj <dig>  the 100 bp upstream of the start codon and the sequence of the deduced proteins showed 100% identity  between these two strains, except for the coding region of the ghrb gene, which showed a t968c substitution, resulting in amino acid substitution v323a in strain jj <dig>  this substitution was confirmed in our four fecal h30-r strains, whereas v <dig> was identified in the two remaining h <dig> fecal strains.table  <dig> distribution of the genes involved in sugar metabolism in commensal escherichia coli strains hs and nissle  <cit>  in the genomes of representative h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> subclones of escherichia coli st131

biofilm genotype and phenotype
the expression of a wide panel of genes can influence biofilm formation  <cit> . we specifically searched for these genes in the genome of strains jj <dig>  s <dig>  and se <dig> . two genes of the biofilm gene panel, flic and flid, were missing from the three tested genomes. we aligned the flic and flid genes from e. coli strain mg <dig> onto the three genomes  to verify their absence and found deletions within flic and the absence of flid in the three strains. an intact version of the fimb gene was present in strains h <dig> s <dig> and h <dig> se <dig>  but it was disrupted in h30-rx jj <dig> due to the insertion of is3-like, as previously described in various h <dig> strains  <cit> . the difference in the structure of the fimb gene in strains h30-rx jj <dig> and h <dig>  <dig> led us to sequence the fimb gene of the remaining fecal strains. we found that the fimb nucleotide sequence in the four h30-r strains was identical to that of h30-rx strain jj <dig>  whereas that of the two remaining h <dig> strains was identical to that of strain s <dig>  niba et al. previously reported that the deletion of flic and/or flid induces a substantial decrease in biofilm formation, whereas deletion of fimb results in in its near complete absence . we thus tested whether this fimb polymorphism affects biofilm formation. kinetic measurements of early biofilm formation showed that the three h <dig> strains formed biofilms significantly earlier  than the four h30-r strains . of note, h30-r strain  <dig>  which was the single fecal strain with an expec status, showed significantly  slower biofilm production  than the other h30-r strains.fig.  <dig> early biofilm formation by human fecal subclone h <dig> and subclone h <dig> strains of st <dig> escherichia coli. biofilm control® image analysis software was used and results are expressed as the proportion of immobilized beads relative to reference conditions  according to incubation time. bars represent the standard deviation obtained from three independent experiments performed in duplicate. the biofilm is more fully formed  as rbi approaches a value of  <dig>  significant differences between h <dig> and h <dig> using dunnett’s test are indicated by * , **  and *** 




genes encoding methyltransferases
we found all but one of the ten methyltransferases, previously identified in the genome of h <dig> st131strain ec <dig>  <cit> , in the genome of h30-rx strain jj <dig> . we found six in the genome of h <dig> strain se <dig> and only three in the genome of h <dig> strain s <dig> .table  <dig> distribution of the  <dig> methyltransferases previously described in h <dig> strain ec <dig>   <cit>  in the genomes of representative h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> subclones of escherichia coli st131

plasmid content
we detected an incfii plasmid in contig  <dig> and an incfib element in contig  <dig> of the s <dig> genome using plasmidfinder. using ncbi blast and the plasmid mslt typing system, we identified the replicon alleles f <dig> and b <dig> in the whole genome of strain s <dig>  we confirmed this result for strain s <dig> by pcr-sequencing, and also obtained the following results for the six remaining fecal strains: f1:a2:b <dig> for the four h30-r strains, no incf plasmid for h <dig> strain  <dig>  and f24:b <dig> for h <dig> strain  <dig> .

discussion
ctx-m- <dig> producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant st <dig> e. coli, which has been shown to be a worldwide human expec since the beginning of the 2000s, has also been shown to colonize the human digestive tract  <cit> . in  <dig>  we found healthy subjects with a subdominant intestinal population of fluoroquinolone-resistant st <dig> e. coli, as well as those with a dominant intestinal population of st <dig> e. coli susceptible to fluoroquinolones  <cit> . the latter finding suggests that st <dig> e. coli may be a human intestinal commensal. here, we first showed that our three antibiotic-susceptible fecal st <dig> e. coli strains displayed fimh <dig>  whereas the four resistant to fluoroquinolones displayed fimh <dig> . we thus centered our study on the comparison between these two groups of strains focusing on processes and structures involved in environmental adaptation, considering that subclone h <dig> is the precursor of subclone h <dig>  which emerged at the end of 1990s  <cit> . we first sequenced the whole genome of one of our fecal h <dig> strains, strain s <dig>  as there were no assembled and annotated genomes of h <dig> strains when we started our work. in contrast, there were sequenced whole genomes of representative multidrug resistant h <dig> expecs, such as h30-rx strain jj <dig> and a commensal st <dig> e. coli, strain se <dig>  belonging to another st <dig> subclone, characterized by the allele fimh <dig>  comparison of the genomes of h <dig> strain s <dig>  h30-rx strain jj <dig>  and h <dig> strain se <dig> showed high similarity in terms of the number and types of vf genes from the vfdb. this may explain the similar level of virulence that we found previously between h <dig> strain s <dig> and an h30-rx strain in the c. elegans model  <cit> . nevertheless, strains s <dig> and jj <dig> displayed two different virotypes: d for strain s <dig> and c for strain jj <dig>  moreover, strain s <dig> did not display the vf genes required for expec status, whereas strain jj <dig> did  <cit> . there was also high similarity between the genes involved in biofilm formation in the three genomes  <cit> , except for the fimb gene, which was disrupted in the h30-rx strain jj <dig> and intact in both h <dig> strain s <dig> and h <dig> strain se <dig>  as the intact fimb gene was also absent from our fecal h30-r strains and present in our remaining fecal h <dig> strains, we analyzed the kinetics of early biofilm formation in our seven fecal strains. biofilm formation was significantly delayed in the h30-r strains. this is the first study to compare the formation of biofilms by h <dig> and non-esbl-producing h30-r strains . further studies are required to verify the involvement of the fimb gene in the two different biofilm phenotypes. comparison of the genes of the three genomes involved in the metabolism of various sugars showed the absence of one of the two genes encoding gluconate kinases in strains s <dig> and jj <dig>  although this gene was absent in both our fecal h <dig> and h30-r strains, we found that h <dig> strains had a higher capacity to grow in medium with gluconate as the sole carbon source. thus, gluconate consumption may confer an advantage to h <dig> strains for residing in the human intestine, as gluconate is a component of intestinal mucus  <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that e. coli laboratory mutants with impaired growth on gluconate are less able to colonize the large intestine of mice  <cit> . comparison of all genes, and their promoter regions, involved in the different pathways of gluconate metabolism showed one difference between strains s <dig> and jj <dig>  namely a mutation leading to an amino acid substitution in the 2-keto-d-gluconate reductase ghrb in strain jj <dig>  although this genetic difference was found between the fecal h <dig> and h30-r strains, further studies are required to clarify the role of this mutation for the difference in the growth of the two strains when gluconate is the sole carbon source. another difference we identified between strain s <dig> and strain jj <dig> concerned the sequence of the type  <dig> fimbriae fimh adhesin, shown by sokurenko et al. to be involved in variations of the m1/m <dig> ratio associated with tissue tropism and the shift of bacterial adaptation from a commensal to pathological habitat  <cit> . the fimh sequence of strain jj <dig>  which was also present in our h30-r fecal strains, corresponded to that identified by sokurenko et al. in strains with a m1/m <dig> ratio =  <dig> . this sequence and m1/m <dig> ratio are commonly observed in uropathogenic strains  <cit> . the fimh sequence identified in strain s <dig> and the other fecal h <dig> strains was not found in the strains studied by sokurenko et al. and was only found at a low frequency in those studied by chen et al.  <cit> . this sequence showed none of the amino acid substitutions involved in the increase of the m1/m <dig> ratio. thus it is likely to be associated with the lowest m1/m <dig> ratio shown by sokurenko et al., which was associated with strong adhesion to intestinal cells  <cit> . altogether, although the h <dig> and h30-r strains investigated in this work were all isolated from the digestive tract of healthy subjects, only h <dig> strains displayed properties previously shown to be associated with human intestinal commensalism, including competition for nutrients in the intestine  and a high intestinal adhesiveness  <cit> .

we sought to confirm the genetic differences identified here between the lineages h <dig> and h <dig> with the whole genome sequences of st <dig> isolates recently deposited on ncbi databases . as expected, we retrieved all but one of these genetic differences in this wider h <dig> and h <dig> strain collection. indeed, the gluconate reductase-encoding ghrb gene in two h <dig> clinical isolates  displayed the same sequence as in all h <dig> strains and not that found in the other h <dig> strains. of note, these two strains possessed phi <dig> and the par-c1a variant, the two evolutionary markers present in the h <dig> “intermediate” strain group b0/c <dig> described by ben zakour et al.  <cit> . the intermediate status was based on the snp pattern of h <dig> strains which progressively acquired clade c-defining point mutations.

the last comparison made between the s <dig>  jj <dig> and se <dig> genomes concerned the genes encoding the  <dig> methyltransferases previously identified in the genome of h30-rx st131strain ec <dig>  <cit> . we found nine of these genes in strain jj <dig>  six in strain se <dig>  and only three in strain s <dig>  forde et al. showed that six of the  <dig> genes detected in strain ec <dig> are components of defined mobile genetic elements  that we showed to be absent from the genome of h <dig> strain s <dig>  indeed, we showed that this strain belongs to subclade b <dig>  meaning tothe ancestor of subclone h <dig> from which evolved the four other b subclades and subclone h <dig> with its subclades c <dig> and c <dig>  subclone h <dig> arose by acquiring, among others, mges near which the methyltransferase-encoding genes are located in h30-rx strain ec <dig>  the three genes identified in strain s <dig> encode orphan methyltransferases known to be involved in regulation and not methyltransferases involved in restriction modification systems known to inhibit the uptake of non-self dna and restrict horizontal gene transfer.

we also showed that strain s <dig> had a gyra <dig> allele. this allele was not found in the subclade b <dig> strains studied by ben zakour et al., whereas it was found in some of their strains belonging to subclades b <dig> and b <dig>  <cit> . concerning our two other fecal h <dig> strains that harbored the gyra1a allele, we showed that one belonged to subclade b <dig> and the other to subclade b <dig>  plasmid content also varied within our h <dig> strains: no incf plasmid in one strain and incf plasmids with different replicons, f24:b <dig> and f89:b <dig>  in the two remaining h <dig> strains, with allele b <dig> identified here  for the first time. johnson et al. also found plasmids with fii and fib replicons in most of their h <dig> strains. however, the two fii and fib allelic patterns identified by johnson et al. were different from ours  <cit> . in contrast, our h30-r strains were all of the same subclade with the same plasmid content: subclade c <dig> and the incf plasmid with the replicon f1:a2:b20-. this replicon was previously identified in france in ctx-m-27-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant h <dig> strains isolated from stool of children attending different day-care centers in  <dig>  <cit> . it was also very recently shown by johnson et al. to be the dominant incf plasmid replicon type among the fluoroquinolone-resistant h <dig> strains  from different sources whereas replicon f2:a <dig> was shown to be dominant in those h <dig> strains producing ctx-m- <dig>   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows, for the first time, that the o25b:h <dig> st <dig> e. coli isolates that were carried in the intestinal microbiota of healthy subjects living in the paris area in  <dig> consisted of strains belonging to both the ancient dominant subclone h <dig> and the current dominant subclone h <dig>  the genotypic and phenotypic differences identified in this study between these two subclones affect their ability to adapt to the environment. the fecal h <dig> strains displayed traits increasing their ability to colonize human gut, whereas the fecal h30-r strains displayed traits allowing extra-intestinal adaptation. thus, resistance to antibiotics may not be the sole advantage of subclone h30-r over its precursor subclone h <dig> in causing worldwide infections.
