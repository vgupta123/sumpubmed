BACKGROUND
dna damage results from exposure to specific chemicals in the environment, uv light, ionizing radiation and errors in dna replication and proofreading. plants utilize several pathways for dna repair, including photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair and double-stranded break repair  <cit> . methyl methanesulfonate  is a simple, direct alkylating agent recognized as a standard for genotoxicity assays of environmental pollutants  <cit> . mms has been widely utilized as a γ-radiation mimic in the belief it causes double-stranded breaks . a recent report found, however, that no mms-mediated dsbs could be detected in vivo in yeast or mammalian cells, and those reported previously were almost certainly artefacts  <cit> . molecular responses of organisms to alkylating phytotoxins are likely to be distinct from those to ionizing radiation.

many intra- and extracellular processes in plant growth, development and responses to stress involve specific proteolytic enzyme activities. the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> known and putative peptidases  <cit>  but the functions of only a tiny minority are known. furthermore, little is known of the control of proteolytic activity in planta by endogenous peptidase inhibitors, including the serpins  <cit> , which are one of seven families of peptidase inhibitors in arabidopsis  <cit> . serpins are metastable inhibitors with a unique, irreversible mechanism of action  <cit> .

almost all plant serpins studied are potent inhibitors of mammalian proteinases of the chymotrypsin family in vitro  <cit> . an arabidopsis serpin, atserpin <dig> , was shown to inhibit the endogenous cysteine proteinase metacaspase  <dig>  in vitro  <cit>  but no other putative endogenous targets for plant serpins have been identified. plant serpins are likely to function in direct defence against proteinases from pests and pathogens and in the regulation of endogenous proteolytic events, but no functions have been demonstrated  <cit> .

here we report the differential basal expression of six arabidopsis serpin genes and the effect of mms exposure of seedlings on the activity of atsrp <dig>  and atsrp <dig> , both specifically expressed in reproductive tissues. we determine the subcellular localizations of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> and examine the growth responses of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants  to mms, γ-radiation and uv light treatments. finally we compare the induction levels of cell cycle-related genes in the atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> plants compared to wild-type after exposure to mms.

RESULTS
arabidopsis serpin genes are differentially expressed
psi-blast searching of the arabidopsis genome revealed six predicted full-length serpins   <cit> . the numbering system used for the rcl residues is that of schechter and berger  whereby residues n-terminal to the proteinase cleavage site are numbered p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  etc and those c-terminal to the cleavage site are numbered p1', p2', p3', etc  <cit> . reactive centre loop  sequences were aligned using the conserved p <dig> glu, p <dig> thr and p <dig> ser/thr, allowing the reactive centre p <dig> residue – the most important for inhibitory specificity – to be identified for each serpin . one of the arabidopsis serpins  was predicted to be non-inhibitory  but each of the five remaining serpins was predicted to be inhibitory  <cit>  and has a unique reactive centre .

we examined basal transcript levels of the six serpins in mature tissues and in whole seedlings during development using semi-quantitative rt-pcr. atserpin <dig>  was the most highly expressed serpin in all tissues . this gene and at2g <dig> were ubiquitously expressed in the mature plants. in contrast, atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> transcripts were detected more specifically in siliques, with atsrp <dig> also expressed very weakly in flowers and atsrp <dig> in flowers and stems. at3g <dig> and at1g <dig> expression was not detectable in mature tissues. atserpin <dig> was ubiquitously expressed throughout seedling development . weak expression of at2g <dig> was detected at day  <dig> and increased during days  <dig> to  <dig>  at3g <dig> and at1g <dig> expression was not detectable in seedlings. atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> transcripts were detected at very low levels in seedlings  by quantitative rt-pcr .

atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> are upregulated following mms treatment of seedlings
wild-type  seedlings were transplanted to liquid media containing  <dig> ppm mms and transcript levels of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> determined by quantitative rt-pcr. atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> were induced ~5-fold and ~100-fold, respectively, after  <dig> d . in a separate experiment, wild-type seedlings  were exposed to mms for  <dig> and  <dig> h but no induction was detected. in untreated seedlings  and in seedlings  <dig> and  <dig> h after exposure to γ-radiation  no atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> transcripts were detected using semiquantitative rt-pcr .

subcellular localization of atsrp <dig> and atsrp3
gfp-atsrp <dig> was localized to the nucleus whereas gfp-atsrp <dig> was localized to the cytosol  . dapi staining confirmed the identity of the nucleus.

identification of t-dna insertion mutants
two t-dna insertion mutants  corresponding to atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig>  respectively, were identified in the signal database. no other t-dna insertion lines were available for these two genes. the atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants have a t-dna insertion on the right  and in the middle  of the second exon, respectively. genomic pcr using primer sets corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of each gene and to the left border of the t-dna insert was performed to identify homozygous lines. the absence of full-length pcr product using the 5' and 3' primer sets indicated the presence of the t-dna insertion  in both copies of the gene . to confirm the knockout of each atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> transcript in the corresponding homozygous mutant, total rna was prepared from developing siliques and rt-pcr performed. no transcripts for atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> were detected in the corresponding mutants, and there was no apparent compensation of atsrp <dig> transcript levels in the atsrp <dig> mutant, or vice-versa .

atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants grow faster than wild-type plants when exposed to mms but not to γ-radiation or uv-c
mutants atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> were phenotypically normal under standard growth conditions . both mutants produced apparently normal siliques, seeds , and wild-type germination rates , indicating that atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> are not essential for meiosis under standard growth conditions. 1/ <dig> ms and b <dig> media were used to examine responses of mutants to mms versus those of wild-type . surprisingly, when atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> plants were exposed to mms, both mutants grew consistently more vigorously than wild-type plants given the same treatment . in the absence of mms, there was no significant difference in root growth between wild-type and mutants grown on solid media. for plants grown on b <dig> media in the presence of ≥  <dig> ppm mms, however, roots of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants grew longer than wild-type roots over  <dig> weeks . differences in root lengths between the mutants and wild-type seedlings grown on 1/ <dig> ms solid media were greatest at  <dig> ppm mms . leaf number was significantly higher in mutants than in wild-type seedlings exposed to  <dig> ppm mms on b <dig> solid media  and this effect was accompanied by an increase in overall plant biomass . we also examined the response of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants to uv light and γ-radiation, but no differential effects  could be detected . rt-pcr using rna isolated from whole seedlings  exposed to γ-radiation showed expression levels of the dna repair gene atrad <dig> were the same in the mutants and wild-type .

induction of dna repair- and cell cycle-related genes is reduced in atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants exposed to mms
after mms treatment of seedlings grown on 1/ <dig> ms liquid media, samples were collected at various time points, total rna was isolated and real-time rt-pcr performed. in wild-type plants, exposure to  <dig> ppm mms led to a substantial induction after  <dig> d of all marker genes examined, with the exception of atcycd1; <dig>  which was induced after  <dig> d . interestingly, for both atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants, expression of all marker genes except atatm was lower than that in wild-type plants  <dig> d after mms treatment . the cell-cycle related gene atcycd1; <dig> was down-regulated  <dig> day after plant exposure to mms compared to both the zero time point and to wild-type levels . recovery of the expression of all of the marker genes except atcycd1; <dig> to wild-type levels occurred by day  <dig> . the rapid changes in expression of these key genes suggest atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> function in responses to dna-damage after exposure to mms.

discussion
diversity of arabidopsis serpin reactive centres and differential expression
the reactive centres of the arabidopsis serpins are highly diverse , suggesting a range of target proteinases and therefore distinct biochemical pathways in which the serpins might participate. the only specific target proteinase suggested for a plant serpin to date is the cysteine proteinase metacaspase  <dig>  for atserpin <dig>  <cit> . differential expression of the serpin genes  is corroborated by atproteome data  <cit>  and provides more evidence for functional diversity. the nuclear localization of atsrp <dig> is consistent with predictions  <cit>  based on wolf psort and contrasts with the cytosolic localization of atsrp <dig> . atsrp <dig> contains the nuclear localization signal pkkk at the distal end of the rcl ; the one-residue difference between this and the corresponding sequence in atsrp <dig>  ppkk, appears sufficient to retain the latter serpin in the cytosol.

responses of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> are specific to mms-induced dna damage
a test of cross-sensitivity of a collection of mms-sensitive yeast mutants to hydroxyurea, uv light and γ-radiation found only  <dig> of  <dig> mutants showed cross-sensitivity to all three treatments  <cit> . deficiency in atm  in plants and mammals confers hypersensitivity to γ-radiation and mms but not to uv light  <cit> . these and other studies show different sources of dna damage cause distinct types of lesions and forms of cell cycle arrest. this is consistent with the differential responses of our serpin mutants  to mms but not to uv-c or γ-radiation.

knockouts of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> transiently reduce responses to mms exposure
mutants atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> exposed to mms displayed lower levels of induction of atbrca <dig>  atbard <dig>  atrad <dig> and atcycb1; <dig>  as well as a downregulation of atcycd1; <dig>  after  <dig> d compared to wild-type. expression levels returned to wild-type levels  <dig> d after mms exposure . thus atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> may be required for relatively early responses to alkylation damage. in humans, brca <dig> appears to be involved in all phases of the cell cycle  <cit>  and brca <dig> deficiency causes abnormalities in the s-phase and g2/m checkpoint  <cit> . rad <dig> is involved in homologous dna repair and interacts with brca <dig>  <cit> ; moreover, transcription of rad <dig>  is highest in s-phase  <cit> . yeast is most sensitive to mms during s-phase  <cit> . thus down-regulation of atbrca <dig> and atrad <dig> in the atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutants may be associated with abnormal s-phase and a defective g2/m checkpoint.

transcripts of mitotic cyclin atcycb1; <dig> are reported to accumulate around the g2/m transition  <cit> , whereas atcycd1; <dig> promotes not only transition through g0/g1/s but also s/g2/m  <cit> . cyclins  are expressed throughout the cell cycle in proliferating plant tissues  <cit> . the cycd <dig> interaction with cyclin-dependent protein kinase a  acts at the g1/s and the g2/m boundaries in arabidopsis  <cit> . these results suggest atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> may be involved in the regulation of different cell-cycle checkpoints in response to mms-induced dna damage. interestingly, we detected no difference in atatm expression between mutants and wild-type . the arabidopsis atm mutant is hypersensitive to γ-radiation and mms but not to uv light  <cit> . the functions of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> may be overlapping, as is found for atatm and atatr  <cit> , and they may be independent of atatm in a dna damage-response pathway; alternatively, both serpins may act downstream of atatm.

regulation of the cell cycle includes mechanisms for cell cycle arrest following dna damage to allow time for repair of the dna  <cit> . failure of these checkpoint responses leads to a build up of harmful mutations. cell cycle arrest results in reduced rates of growth and a delay in the development of tissues. lesions such as specific gene knockouts can interfere with the signal transduction required for the detection of dna damage and responses including cell cycle arrest. we observed greater rates of growth of our atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> mutant plants exposed to mms than that of wild-type plants given the same treatment. thus we speculate that knockouts of these serpin genes result in de-repression of cell division following mms treatment, thereby implicating atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> in the normal signal transduction required for the relevant checkpoint responses. it is important to note that hefner et al.  found that plant cell-cycle responses to ionizing radiation that were observed in meristematic tissues did not occur in strictly somatic tissues  <cit> .

serpin-mediated control of proteolysis and its links to dna damage responses
sequence analysis strongly suggests atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> are inhibitory serpins  <cit> . atserpin <dig> can inhibit atmc <dig>  which is arg/lys specific  <cit> . in contrast, we predict atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> inhibit proteinases that cleave at small residues . since atsrp <dig> is localized to the nucleus, its candidate targets are different than those for atsrp <dig>  which was localized to the cytosol . seventeen expressed genes encoding serpins with either p <dig> gly or p <dig> cys were recently identified from several monocots and eudicots  <cit> . thus it is likely that serpins in other plant species are functional homologues of atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the inhibitory serpins encoded in the arabidopsis genome display a variety of reactive centres, suggesting a range of target proteinases, and are differentially expressed, indicating a diversity of functions. our results strongly suggest a new role for plant serpins, which is likely to involve inhibition of specific endogenous proteinases that target gly and cys residues to regulate plant responses to alkylating dna damage. atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> are found in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively, and thus may perform distinct tasks in the signalling required for these responses. the requirement for atsrp <dig> and atsrp <dig> in responses to exposure to alkylating genotoxins but not to uv-c or γ-radiation provides support for distinct biochemical pathways associated with these stresses. we suggest our data have potential importance for development of crops with greater resistance to alkylating genotoxins.
