BACKGROUND
the human t cell antigen receptors  of αβ and γδ t lymphocytes are believed to assemble in a similar fashion  <cit> . first, variable αβ or γδ heterodimers bind to invariant cd3δε heterodimers, then to cd3γε heterodimers and finally to cd <dig>  homodimers, resulting in surface tcr complexes with equal amounts of the two different, albeit highly homologous, cd <dig> heterodimers. in contrast, mouse αβ and γδ tcr differ drastically in their stoichiometry, since the γδ tcr does not incorporate any cd3δε dimers but, rather, two cd3γε dimers  <cit> . this finding begs the question as to whether the human variable αβ and γδ chains show identical affinity for both cd <dig> heterodimers.

we reasoned that, if both the αβ and the γδ tcr isotypes use identical amounts of cd3γε and cd3δε, then decreased availability of cd3γ or cd3δ proteins, as observed in heterozygous carriers of mutations in cd <dig> genes  <cit> , would be expected to have a similar impact on the assembly and surface expression of both αβ and γδ tcr isotypes. to test this hypothesis, we compared tcr surface levels of primary αβ and γδ t cells from healthy haploinsufficient donors carrying null or leaky mutations in cd3g  or cd3d . the results did not support the hypothesis of a similar impact on both tcr isotypes, but rather suggested a differential cd3γε and cd3δε usage scheme for each tcr isotype.

RESULTS
reduced surface αβ and γδ tcr expression in cd3γ+/−, cd3δ+/− or cd3δ+/leaky human t lymphocytes
cd3g  or cd3d  haploinsufficient donors were uniformly healthy and showed abundant peripheral blood t lymphocytes with an essentially normal phenotype . however, total t cell numbers were consistently lower than controls  which correlated with a partial impairment of lymphocyte function .

amean ± sd of the indicated number of different subjects. when available, multiple values from single donors were included as single means in the calculations. data obtained from several sources, including published material  <cit> .

bpercentage proliferation  referred to the maximum response of a healthy control in each experiment.

we have previously observed in γ−/− individuals that cd <dig> expression levels are overestimated when t cells are defined using antibodies against tcr-associated epitopes  <cit> , such as bma <dig>  or immu <dig> . to avoid a similar bias in haploinsufficient donors, tcr-independent electronic gates were first defined in order to identify αβ or γδ t cell subsets . the results indicated that cd3+ cells within cd4+ or cd8bright lymphocytes were >98% αβ t cells, whereas cd3+ double negative  lymphocytes were 78 ± 6% γδ t cells. accordingly, αβ and γδ t cells were gated as cd4+/cd8bright and dn cells, respectively, for further analyses. using several cd3-specific antibodies, analysis of surface tcr expression consistently showed reduced antibody binding in γ+/− and δ+/− t lymphocytes as compared to normal controls . these results were confirmed in family members of two newly reported patients with a leaky mutation in cd3d   <cit> . consistent with their relatively higher cd3δ content as compared to δ+/− donors, δ+/leaky donors showed a milder, but nevertheless clear decrease in surface tcr expression . in order to establish if these results were associated with reduced availability of each cd <dig> chain, we measured intracellular cd3γ  or cd3δ  by flow cytometry in haploinsufficient γ+/− and δ+/leaky donors. the results showed that this was indeed the case , confirming previous reports of decreased cd3γ protein in haploinsufficient donors  <cit> .

serial dilutions of cd <dig> mab further confirmed the findings above , since the reduced binding to γ+/− t cells persisted in saturation conditions, but it was gradually lost near the endpoint, supporting the existence of less cd <dig> binding sites  <cit> .

from these results we conclude that human cd3g or d haploinsufficient donors show reduced binding of cd3-specific mab to the tcr of their γδ and αβ t cells.

discordant reduction of surface αβ and γδ tcr expression in cd3γ+/− but not cd3δ+/− or cd3δ+/leaky human t lymphocytes
analysis of cd <dig> mab surface binding to αβ and γδ t cells with the different cd3g and cd3d genotypes, relative to normal controls, revealed that binding of cd <dig> mab to γ+/− γδ t cells was unexpectedly poor  as compared with γ+/− αβ t cells . this discordant reduction was specific for γ+/− donors, as it was not observed in δ+/− or δ+/leaky donors. further support for this discordant reduction was provided by the γδ versus αβ cd <dig> expression ratio, which is normally  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit>  but becomes significantly less in γ+/− donors only . taken together, these results indicate that normal surface γδ tcr expression in humans is more critically dependent on the relative availability of cd3γ, but not cd3δ, than that of the αβ tcr.

discussion
human and mouse tcr complexes are assembled into octamers following common cues provided by transmembrane ionizable aminoacids in each dimer, with cd3γε and cd3δε ectodomains contributing additional extracellular interactions for their ordered incorporation into the complex  <cit> . the extracellular interactions are quite specific, as the mouse γδ tcr does not incorporate otherwise available cd3δε dimers, but rather two copies of the highly homologous cd3γε dimer. in sharp contrast, the human γδ tcr incorporates both  <cit> . mammalian cd3γ, but not cd3δ, has a uniquely kinked ectodomain which fits into an asymmetrical loop in tcrβ for optimal αβ tcr assembly and expression, and cannot be easily replaced by cd3δ due to steric hindrance, with functional consequences  <cit> . this likely leads to the conserved structural asymmetry shared by the human and mouse αβ tcr. in contrast, tcrγ lacks the asymmetrical loop of its tcrβ homologue and seems to allow a less stringent  cd <dig> dimer usage in the γδ tcr, which may explain its disparate stoichiometry in the two species.

the present study suggests that there must be differential structural constraints for the building and stable expression of αβ and γδ tcr complexes, as revealed by their discordant behaviour in cell surface expression when confronted with reduced availability of cd3γ, but not of cd3δ . our findings are in agreement with available information about the assembly of human surface αβ and γδ tcr  <cit> , as explained above and as proposed in figure  <dig>  in the model, cd3δε dimers show a similar affinity for the human tcrα and tcrδ chains , thus reduced cd3δ expression has a similar impact on both. in contrast, when cd3γ is limiting, lack of a cd3γε-fitting structure in tcrγ, as opposed to tcrβ  <cit> , may result in a lower affinity of the former relative to the latter for cd3γε. this may favour the incorporation of competing cd3δε dimers to nascent γδ tcr complexes , and would ultimately lead to γδ tcr receptors devoid of the required stability for optimal surface expression. moreover, human tcrδ  can stably recruit not only cd3δε but also cd3γε  <cit>  during step <dig>  which may reduce further the availability of cd3γε dimers for step <dig> when cd3γ is limiting .

further studies are required to demonstrate a direct link between cd3γ or δ availability and tcr assembly and surface expression. however, the paucity of cd <dig> haploinsufficient individuals might hamper these studies in humans. a flow cytometry-based approach as illustrated in figure 2b could help to identify such individuals.

lastly, since carriers of cd3g or cd3d mutations showed affected tcr expression  and t-cell selection , which seemed in turn to impair to some extent t-cell function   <cit>  the question of whether they also have increased risk of immunological dysfunction deserves further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the results indicate that the dimer assembly scheme of the human tcr complex is different in αβ versus γδ t cells, as revealed by their discordant behaviour when confronted with limiting amounts of cd3γ, but not of the homologous cd3δ chain. the novel data allow proposing a modified version of the prevailing tcr assembly model.
