BACKGROUND
the presence of glutaminyl-trna synthetase  in bacteria is not universal, occurring only in a subset of extant bacteria  <cit> . many bacteria that do not contain glnrs possess a non-canonical copy of glutamyl-trna synthetase , called glurs <dig>  in addition to the canonical glurs   <cit> . glurs <dig> catalyzes the formation of gln-trnagln through an indirect route utilizing glutamyl-trnagln amidotransferase   <cit> . the third and the major group of extant bacteria possess neither glnrs nor glurs <dig>  these bacteria synthesize gln-trnagln utilizing the canonical glurs and the heterotrimeric amidotransferase gatcab via the indirect route  <cit> . the existence of three extant bacterial groups, characterized by the mutually exclusive presence of glnrs or glurs <dig>  or, the absence of both, reflects the complex nature of evolutionary history of bacterial glxrs  .

although extant glurs  is a two-domain protein consisting of a n-terminal catalytic domain and a c-terminal anticodon-binding domain, the c-terminal anticodon-binding domain was added to the catalytic domain only after bacteria and eukaryotes diverged  <cit> . this is reflected in the fact that the anticodon-binding domains of bacterial and eukaryotic glurs, although functionally similar, are structurally very different   <cit> . glurs is also considered to be more ancient than glnrs. glnrs appeared first in eukaryotes, by gene duplication of glurs followed by selective amino acid modifications. this is supported by the observation that eukaryotic glurs and glnrs in eukaryotes are structurally very similar  <cit> . however, the same is not true for bacterial glnrs and glurs. the anticodon-binding domain of bacterial glnrs is structurally homologous to eukaryotic glnrs rather than to bacterial glurs. based on this, it has been hypothesized that bacteria acquired glnrs from eukaryotes by hgt  <cit> . the evolutionary origin of bacterial glurs <dig> is not so clear with suggestions that it evolved either from the canonical glurs/glurs <dig> by gene duplication  <cit>  or it appeared in bacteria by hgt  <cit> .

the currently accepted evolutionary history of bacterial glxrs family, as summarized in figure  <dig>  is based on insights drawn about two decades ago  <cit> , with later additions  <cit> . although quite robust in a broad sense, the model needs refinement and re-examination because it is based on glxrs sequences from only a limited number of bacteria. the weakest point of the model is the poor understanding about the evolutionary origin of glurs <dig>  towards this goal, we have compiled and comprehensively analyzed a database consisting of a large number of bacterial whole genomes, taking care to include as many bacterial phyla as possible. access to whole genomes allowed us not only to analyze sequences of glurs, glnrs, gatcab or trnaglx, but also to annotate each bacterium and classify them according to the mutual presence or absence of these molecules. analyses of the resulting annotated whole genome database have yielded new insights about the evolutionary history of bacterial glxrs. major findings of the current study can be summarized as: i) glurs <dig> is not a gene-duplicated version of glurs <dig> but possibly a chimera of evolutionarily distant catalytic and anticodon-binding domains, ii) glnrs appeared in eubacteria not only by hgt from eukarya but also by intra-bacterial hgt, iii) glnrs and glurs <dig> can coexist in bacterial genomes, iv) identification of a glnrs pseudo-gene providing direct evidence for the loss of hgt-acquired glnrs in some bacteria, and v) the importance of nucleotides 32- <dig> in glnrs-trnagln coevolution. our results will help understand the subtleties of a complex molecular coevolution and the database can be used for more insights using complementary techniques.

RESULTS
bacterial whole genomes classified according to the co-occurrence of glurs, glnrs and gatcab
the availability of a large number of bacterial whole genomes prompted us to revisit the evolutionary history of bacterial glxrs family. towards this goal, we constructed a database of bacterial whole genomes, carefully removing redundancies with an attempt to include the widest range of taxonomic lineages . this resulted in  <dig> complete bacterial genomes from  <dig> distinct phyla .

a prerequisite for the analysis of sequences present in the database is the classification of bacteria into groups that share a common set of enzymes  for synthesizing gln-trnagln. although glurs is present in all bacteria, some possess two copies of the enzyme   <cit> . on the other hand, not all bacteria possess glnrs or gatcab. in the light of the above, the database was classified into five groups  according to the presence  or absence  of glnrs and gatcab, and, the number of copies  of glurs in the genome  — i) 〈1|-|+〉: glurs present , glnrs absent and gatcab present, ii) 〈2|-|+〉: glurs present , glnrs absent and gatcab present, iii) 〈2|+|+〉: glurs present , glnrs present and gatcab present, iv) 〈1|+|+〉: glurs present , glnrs present and gatcab present, and, v) 〈1|+|-〉: glurs present , glnrs present and gatcab absent.

distribution of trnaglx-specificity of glurs among bacterial phyla
the presence of glurs is mandatory in all bacteria, whether as a single or as a double copy. in genomes with a single copy of glurs, the enzyme can be of two functional types, trnagln-discriminatory  and trnagln-non-discriminatory . absence of glnrs in the genome that contains a single copy of glurs  indicates nd-glurs. presence of glnrs and the concomitant absence of gatcab in the genome  indicates d-glurs which we term as d-glurs where  indicating the absence of gatcab. although the trnaglx-specificity prediction of glurs for these two groups is robust, the same is not true for the other groups. for example, the concomitant presence of glnrs as well as gatcab in the genome  is not enough information to definitely predict if the glurs is discriminatory or not. two glurss in 〈1|+|+〉-group  were experimentally shown to be trnagln-discriminatory  <cit> . by extrapolation, we designate glurss appearing in the 〈1|+|+〉-group as nominally discriminatory. however, to emphasize that the nomenclature may not be strictly correct, we annotate them as d-glurs. since genomes with two copies of glurs also contain gatcab, a confident guess about the trnagln-specificity of glurs in these bacteria  is nearly impossible, unless experimentally verified. earlier, in two such proteobacterial species , the corresponding trnaglx-specificities of glurs  were experimentally determined  <cit> . we term the two enzymes as glurs <dig>  and glurs <dig> . it should be reiterated that although the trnaglx-specificities of bacterial glurs, assigned here, are mere predictions, the trnaglx-specificities of nd-glurs and d-glurs must match with experimental data due to the absence of co-partners in their respective genomes -glurs and glnrs/glurs <dig> in case of nd-glurs); the presence of these co-partners could have made other routes of glutamylation possible.

table  <dig>  shows the distribution of the five functional types of glurs among different bacterial phyla. nd-glurs is absent in deinococcus-thermus, verrucomicrobia, bacteroidetes , δ-proteobacteria , ϵ-, β- and γ-proteobacteria. on the other hand, nd-glurs is the only kind of glurs present in cyanobacteria, fusobacteria and chlamydiae. the cyanobacterial result matches with that of a previous study  <cit> . d-glurs is present in tenericutes, bacteriodetes , a few firmicutes and little more than half of all γ-proteobacteria in our database. the single copy of glurs in all other glnrs-containing bacteria is d-glurs since their genomes also lack gatcab. the presence of glurs <dig> is restricted to three bacterial phyla — proteobacteria, hyperthermophilic bacteria  and acidobacteria . within the proteobacterial phylum, the presence of glurs <dig> is mostly restricted to two classes: ϵ-  and α- , while the occurrence of glurs <dig> in other proteobacterial classes is rare, if not absent: γ- , δ-  and β- . overall, glurs functional types are distributed across all phyla with a clear phylum-specific preference.

phylogeny of bacterial glurs
the phylogenetic tree of representative bacterial glurs sequences  is shown in figure  <dig>  the tree was constructed from all five functional flavors of glurs described above. except glurs <dig>  majority of proteobacterial glurss appear as a separate cluster and is farthest from the root . non-proteobacterial glurs also show phylum-specific clustering and the overall branching is compatible with bacterial phylogeny  <cit> . however, phylum-specific clustering of glurs is not obeyed by some bacterial species. two subgroups of γ- and α-proteobacterial glurs sequences, marked as γ* and α* in figure  <dig> and listed in additional file  <dig>  exhibit non-canonical behavior. these glurs sequences appear in the non-proteobacterial cluster, as sister clades of chlamydiae, fusobacteria and deinococcous-thermus. unlike the canonical proteobacterial glurs , glurs belonging to the γ*-/α*-group seem to have appeared through some alternate evolutionary route, probably via hgt, as has been noted earlier  <cit> . interestingly, in gatb phylogeny  the gatb sequences of the γ*-/α*-group are not outliers, indicating that only glurs and not gatb appeared by hgt in these bacteria. few δ-proteobacterial glurs  also appear in the non-proteobacterial clades. however, unlike the γ*-/α*-group, gatb sequences of the outlier δ-proteobacteria  are also outliers in gatb phylogeny . this behavior could be a result of the atypical genome organizations of δ-proteobacterial species, resulting from their diverse ecologies, metabolic strategies and adaptations, which can facilitate unforeseen hgt events leading to the acquisition of both glurs and gatb from evolutionarily distant bacterial phyla, or atypical proteins in these bacteria could have resulted from atypical evolutionary pressure  <cit> . two non-proteobacterial glurs, from hyperthermophilic bacteria , appear in the δ-proteobacterial clade. in addition, there are examples where a non-proteobacterial glurs appears with other non-proteobacterial glurs but not within the parent cluster. overall, although glurs phylogeny and the whole bacterial phylogeny are more or less consistent, figure  <dig> also shows inconsistencies that could be interpreted as the result of systematic  or occasional hgt among distant eubacteria.

correlation between trnaglx-specificity of glurs and branching of glurs/gatb phylogeny
we also probed the evolutionary divergence of the different functional types of glurs within a given phylum. as shown in figure  <dig>  d-glurs and nd-glurs appear in distinct sister clades in α-proteobacteria -glurs versus nd-glurs), firmicutes/tenericutes -glurs versus nd-glurs) and bacteroidetes -glurs versus nd-glurs). similarly, d-glurs and d-glurs of γ-proteobacteria and bacteroidetes appear in sister clades. the clade-specific appearance of functionally distinct glurs within a phylum reflects the function-specific evolutionary pressures they experienced to cope with the presence/absence of other genomic components like glnrs  and/or gatcab - and d- glurs). we also looked for corresponding function-specific branching of gatb in gatb-phylogenetic tree . the phylogeny shows that gatb sequences of a given phylum, but belonging to different groups defined in table  <dig>  also appear as sister clade . this demonstrates how glurs and gatb coevolved according to their functional requirement of facilitating the indirect route of gln-trnagln synthesis in some bacteria.

glurs <dig> did not evolve by gene duplication
among the five different functional types of bacterial glurs -glurs, d-glurs, glurs <dig> and glurs2), glurs <dig> stands out from the rest in terms of its trnaglx-specificity. it is the only glurs that is known to be trnaglu-discriminatory  <cit> . like glnrs, glurs <dig> exclusively charges trnagln <cit> . however, the final products are different for the two enzymes — glu-trnagln for glurs <dig> and gln-trnagln for glnrs  <cit> . the intimate functional relationship between the two enzymes prompted the proposal that glurs <dig> is only a few steps away from evolving into glnrs  <cit> . however, it is unclear how and under what circumstances glurs <dig> appeared in some bacterial genomes. in this context at least two models have been proposed. hendrickson et al. proposed that glurs <dig> was acquired by gene duplication  <cit>  while nureki et al. proposed that the enzyme was acquired through hgt from another bacterial phylum  <cit> .

the phylogenetic placement of glurs <dig> in figure  <dig> allowed us to address this issue in the context of all other functional types of glurs. if glurs <dig> indeed appeared by gene duplication of glurs, giving rise to glurs <dig> and glurs <dig>  it is expected that glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> would appear as sister clades in figure  <dig> <cit> . however, for all double glurs-containing phyla, glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> appear in clades that are separated from each other by multiple branching. for example, all glurs <dig> in α- and γ-proteobacteria appear within the canonical proteobacterial glurs branch, while the corresponding glurs <dig> appear in non-proteobacterial branches. the only exception is the γ-proteobacterium thioalkalivibrio sp.  for which glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> appear in sister branches within the γ-proteobacterial glurs <dig> cluster. glurs <dig> of ϵ-proteobacteria branch out from the canonical glurs/glurs <dig> cluster of α-proteobacteria. similarly, while glurs <dig> of acidobacteria and hyperthermophilic bacteria branch out from firmicutes/tenericutes, the corresponding glurs <dig> are evolutionarily distant. taken together, this indicates that glurs <dig> appeared in bacteria by gene acquisition from some foreign host by hgt and not by gene duplication.

phylogeny of catalytic and anticodon-binding domains of glurs
it is thought that the primordial glurs consisted of only the n-terminal catalytic domain ). later, during the course of evolution, the c-terminal domain ) was appended to it  <cit> . as a consequence, the two domains may not display identical branching patterns in phylogenetic trees constructed independently from the two isolated domains. indeed, a comparison of glurs and glurs phylogenies  showed that except for the canonical proteobacterial glurs group , the glurs- and glurs-derived cladograms are not strictly mirror images of each other. one reason for this observation could be that glurs was appended after the phylum-specific divergence of glurs in bacteria. however, according to this model different bacterial phyla acquired different glurs independently, which is a very unlikely event. a more realistic model is where glurs was appended to glurs before bacterial phylum-divergence but because the acquired glurs was non-functional, it was lost and regained several times, probably via intra-bacterial hgt, before becoming functionally compatible with glurs in a synchronous way  <cit> . this model is compatible with figure  <dig>  in other words, glurs is more mobile than glurs and is prone to frequent intra-bacterial hgt. figure  <dig> also suggests that glurs is the core functional domain of glurs, since the branching topology of glurs phylogeny , but not glurs phylogeny , is compatible with the overall bacterial phylogeny  <cit> .

is glurs <dig> a chimera?
the mobility of glurs leads to two possible scenarios concerning the origin of bacterial glurs that were acquired by hgt – the γ*/α*-group and glurs <dig>  glurs belonging to these groups could have been acquired either as a full length glurs or they appeared by independent acquisition of glurs and glurs. if the full-length glurs was acquired then the corresponding glurs and glurs are expected to form sister clades with identical glurs groups in glurs and glurs phylogenies . on the other hand, if glurs and glurs, in glurs and glurs phylogenies , were acquired independently then the sister clades of the acquired glurs and glurs would be evolutionarily distant and non-identical. for glurs belonging to the γ*/α*-group, glurs forms sister clade with the chlamydiae/fusobacteria/deinococcus-thermus/non-green sulphur bacterial group in glurs phylogeny . in glurs phylogeny , glurs of γ*-group forms a sister clade with glurs from chlamydiae where as glurs of α*-group forms a sister clade with glurs from non-green sulphur bacteria. this suggests that glurs sequences belonging to the γ*/α*-group were acquired as full-length glurs.

however, this is not the case with glurs <dig>  in glurs phylogeny, γ- and α-proteobacterial glurs <dig> appear as sister clade of actinobacterial glurs, ϵ-proteobacterial glurs <dig> appear as sister clade of firmicutes/tenericutes glurs, acidobacterial glurs <dig> appear as sister clade of hyperthermophilic bacterial glurs, while hyperthermophilic bacterial glurs <dig> forms a sister clade with hyperthermophilic bacterial glurs/glurs <dig>  the wide distribution of glurs <dig> in glurs phylogeny is in stark contrast to the distribution of glurs <dig> in glurs phylogeny. for proteobacterial and acidobacterial glurs <dig> sequences appear together as an outgroup clade. this strongly suggests that glurs <dig> sequences were not acquired as full-length glurs but glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> were acquired independently. in other words, glurs <dig> is a chimera. this model is not inconceivable since the occurrence of isolated n-terminal domain of glurs, termed as yadb or glu-q-rs, is rampant in bacteria  <cit> . also, there are other examples of functional proteins that are chimeras  <cit> , as has been proposed here for bacterial glurs <dig>  in fact, it has been argued that sharing of domains is a widespread lineage-specific event among a number of aminoacyl-trna synthetases like metrs, glyrs, prors, hisrs, valrs and thrrs  <cit> . sometimes domains may even be recruited from non-aminoacyl-trna synthetases, like the case of prors  <cit> .

separate phylogenies of glurs and glurs also revealed that the evolutionary history of hyperthermophilic bacterial glurs <dig> is distinct from other bacterial glurs <dig>  unlike glurs <dig> of other phyla, hyperthermophilic bacterial glurs <dig> seems to be a gene-duplicated version of glurs <dig> since glurs1/glurs2/glurs are monophyletic in glurs phylogeny. however, in glurs phylogeny the hyperthermophilic bacterial glurs1/glurs2/glurs are widely dispersed. this suggests that while glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> were independently acquired by most phyla, glurs <dig> in hyperthermophilic bacteria appeared by a gene duplication event while glurs <dig> was probably acquired independently by hgt.

independent evidence supporting gene duplication of glurs <dig> as the origin of glurs <dig> of hyperthermophilic bacteria, but not for the case of glurs <dig> of other bacterial phyla, came from the analysis of the ‘high’ sequence motif, a highly conserved motif present in the n-terminal catalytic domain  of class-i aminoacyl-trna synthetases  <cit> . the signature motif is highly conserved in bacterial glurs sequences  as hϕgx . for majority  of glurs sequences used in figure  <dig>  the motif is hϕgg. this motif is strictly present in glurs <dig> of α-/ϵ-/γ-proteobacteria and acidobacteria. the corresponding motif in glurs <dig> of α-/ϵ-/γ-proteobacteria and acidobacteria is hϕgn, suggesting that glurs <dig> did not appear by gene duplication in these phyla. the ‘high’ motif of α*-/γ*-group of glurs sequences, hϕgt, is also different from hϕgg, the ‘high’ motif of canonical α-/γ-proteobacterial glurs. this is consistent with hgt as the origin of α*-/γ*-group of glurs sequences. in contrast, both glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> of hyperthermophilic bacteria share a common ‘high’ motif, hϕgg. this supports the hypothesis that glurs <dig> is a gene-duplicated version of glurs <dig> in hyperthermophilic bacteria but not in α-/ϵ-/γ-proteobacteria and acidobacteria.

two functionally and evolutionarily distinct types of glurs2
in order to further probe the evolutionary relationship between glurs <dig> and glurs <dig>  a phylogenetic tree was constructed, exclusively with glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> sequences . the glurs1/glurs <dig> phylogeny  shows a clear division between glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> sequences with α-proteobacterial glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> farthest from each other; the ϵ-proteobacterial glurs <dig> appears evolutionary far from the rest. interestingly, glurs1/glurs <dig> of hyperthermophilic bacteria appear at the border of glurs1/glurs <dig> separation.

since the trnaglx-specificities of a number of glurs1/ <dig> sequences are experimentally known, these are projected onto figure  <dig> for further insights. glurs <dig> of ϵ-proteobacteria h. pylori is trnaglu-specific; it does not glutamylate the sole trnagln isoacceptor ) present in the genome. in a complementary fashion, the corresponding glurs <dig> of h. pylori glutamylates trnagln and not trnaglu <cit> . the trnagln-specificity of glurs <dig> of γ-proteobacteria a. ferrooxidans is isoacceptor-specific – it does not glutamylate trnagln but is capable of glutamylating trnagln. the corresponding glurs <dig> glutamylates both isoacceptors, trnagln and trnagln, but none of the two trnaglu isoacceptors  <cit> . the experimental data can be interpreted to indicate that members of the γ-/ϵ-proteobacterial glurs1-clusters are trnaglu-specific ) while those in the γ-/ϵ-proteobacterial glurs2-cluster are trnagln-specific ). in contrast, the trnaglx-specificities of gene-duplicated glurs1/ <dig> of hyperthermophilic bacteria are non-canonical. the glurs <dig> of hyperthermophilic bacterium t. maritima is experimentally known to be non-specific  while the corresponding glurs <dig> is inactive   <cit> . one could generalize this observation as: glurs <dig> are inactive while glurs <dig> are trnaglx-non-specific .

the functional annotation can be used to predict the trnaglx-specificity of glurs <dig> and glurs <dig> of acidobacteria  and for the rest, for which no experimental data are available . since acidobacterial glurs <dig> appears with glurs <dig> of t. maritima in figure  <dig>  taken at face value, acidobacterial glurs <dig> should also be inactive. it is interesting to note that glurs <dig> of acidobacteria and glurs <dig> of hyperthermophilic bacteria appear as sister clades in the master glurs phylogeny as well . if acidobacterial glurs <dig> are indeed inactive, then the corresponding glurs <dig> must be trnagln-non-discriminatory . since the acidobacterial genomes in our database contain both trnagln isoacceptors / <dig> for koribacter versatilis and 7699874/ <dig> for acidobacterium capsulatum), and the corresponding glurs <dig> sequences appear close to the proteobacterial glurs1-cluster , by extrapolation, we predict that acidobacterial glurs <dig> is capable of glutamylating trnagln but not trnagln . this analysis shows that glurs <dig> comes in two distinct flavors, both in terms of evolution and function. the first type of glurs <dig>  appearing by gene-duplication of the n-terminal catalytic domain and later recruitment of an anticodon-binding domain is non-functional . the second type of glurs <dig>  a chimera of n-terminal catalytic domain and c-terminal anticodon-binding domain, both acquired by hgt is functional and can only glutamylate trnagln.

distribution of glnrs among bacterial phyla
it is generally accepted that glnrs is present mostly in proteobacteria, a phylum of recent divergence. among non-proteobacteria, some members of deinococcous-thermus  <cit> , firmicutes  <cit>  and bacteroidetes  <cit>  have been reported to possess glnrs. a survey of our database  shows that all members of β- and δ-proteobacteria  contain glnrs. except for seven species , all γ-proteobacteria also contain glnrs. on the other hand, only six  α-proteobacteria, four  without and two  with glurs <dig> in their genomes contain glnrs. all ten ϵ-proteobacteria in our database contains glurs <dig>  among which six  also contain glnrs. among non-proteobacterial phyla, glnrs is present in deinococcus-thermus , bacteroidetes , planctomycetes , verrrucomicrobia , tenericutes  and firmicutes . glnrs is strictly absent in three non-proteobacterial phyla  while the remaining non-proteobacterial phyla contain only a single species whose genome contains glnrs . thus, glnrs is widely distributed among bacterial phyla, more than what is currently believed. however, it is mostly present in proteobacteria and a selected group of non-proteobacterial phyla.

molecular phylogeny of bacterial glnrs
to gain insight about the origin of glnrs in eubacteria, a phylogenetic tree was constructed and rooted using the sequences from firmicutes and tenericutes, as out-groups . bacterial phyla with dominant presence of glnrs  cluster in a phylum-specific manner and their branching pattern in the tree is compatible with the overall bacterial phylogeny  <cit> . this group of glnrs could have appeared from eukaryotic source by two different routes: i) a single hgt event, or, ii) phylum-specific multiple hgt events. while the second route cannot be ruled out, the overall compatibility of glnrs phylogeny and bacterial phylogeny suggests that there was a single, and not multiple hgt events, that resulted in the acquisition of eukaryotic glnrs by bacterium. subsequently, as bacteria diverged, so did glnrs, but it could be retained only by some bacterial phyla. factors that may have played a role in the retention of glnrs are discussed later.

however, this model cannot fully justify the phylogenetic tree of figure  <dig>  the placement of a number of glnrs sequences in the phylogenetic tree is not compatible with the overall bacterial phylogeny. glnrs from ϵ-proteobacteria, α-proteobacteria and a number of δ-proteobacteria , do not form sister clades with the canonical proteobacterial glnrs cluster. glnrs from ϵ-proteobacteria appear as a sister clade with deinococcus-thermus, while glnrs from α-proteobacteria appear as a sister clade with a group of isolated non-proteobacteria and δ-proteobacteria. similarly, non-proteobacterial glnrs, other than those in firmicutes/tenericutes, bacteroidetes and deinococcus-thermus, are dispersed among proteo- and non-proteobacterial clades . glnrs from one bacteroidetes  is also an outlier. the isolated appearance of glnrs, distributed across phylum-specific clades, and the appearance of ϵ-, α- and δ-proteobacterial glnrs, as sister clades of non-proteobacterial glnrs, suggest intra-bacterial hgt as the origin of these glnrs, after the initial acquisition of eukaryotic glnrs in the eubacterial branch.

co-occurrence of glurs <dig> and glnrs in the genome
till date there are no reports of any bacterium possessing both glnrs and glurs <dig>  in this context, a remarkable finding is the case of two α- and some ϵ-proteobacteria whose genomes contain both glurs <dig> and glnrs . all ten ϵ-proteobacteria in our database contain glurs <dig> , out of which six also contain glnrs in their genomes. among the  <dig> α-proteobacteria whose genomes contain glurs <dig> , only two  also contain glnrs. the ϵ-proteobacterial glnrs and deinococcus-thermus glnrs appear as sister clades in glnrs phylogeny  indicating that ϵ-proteobacteria probably acquired their glnrs by hgt from deinococcus-thermus . the two glnrs from mesorhizobium appear with four other α-proteobacterial glnrs , as a sister clade with a heterogeneous group of non-proteobacteria and δ-proteobacteria . because majority of α-proteobacteria do not possess glnrs, it appears that these six are exceptional cases where glnrs was acquired by hgt. in an earlier section we had observed that intra-bacterial glnrs transfer is a common event. this section shows that the event does not depend on whether or not the receiving species already possesses a specialized enzyme for exclusively aminoacylating trnagln . the co-occurrence of glurs <dig> and glnrs also indicates that their evolutionary histories are independent and that glnrs did not evolve from glurs <dig> as has been suggested elsewhere  <cit> .

bacterial glnrs with its c-terminal appended with yqey paralog appeared in deinococcus-thermus phylum
glnrs from three bacteria, deinococcus radiodurans and deinococcus geothermalis from the deinococcus-thermus phylum and s. ruber from the bacteroidetes phylum, have been reported to have an extra domain appended at their c-termini  <cit> . this c-terminal extension is actually a paralog of yqey protein present in the c-terminal end of the gatb subunit of gatcab  <cit> . in d. radiodurans the yeqy paralog enhances trnagln-affinity of glnrs  <cit> . using multiple sequence alignment, we searched for the presence of the appended yqey domain in  <dig> glnrs sequences in our database. all glnrs sequences, belonging to deinococcus-thermus phylum in our database, were found to be c-terminal appended with the yqey paralog . except for s. ruber, no other glnrs from bacteroidetes contained the additional domain . in addition, glnrs from all ϵ- and two δ-proteobacteria also contained the yqey paralog . although the glnrs phylogenetic tree  was constructed without the c-terminal appended yqey paralog, the yqey paralog was found to be appended in all glnrs sequences that formed sister clades with the deinococcus-thermus clade. this suggests that the yqey domain was first appended to glnrs in deinococcus-thermus and later the yqey-appended glnrs gene was transferred to some ϵ-proteobacteria, two δ-proteobacteria  and one bacteroidete .

functional status of extant glnrs in bacteria
extant glnrs may or may not be functional  <cit> . one way to annotate their functional status is to look for gatcab genes in the genome. absence of gatcab gene indicates a defunct indirect glutaminylation pathway, implying that the genomic glnrs is functional, and more importantly essential. based on the absence gatcab in the genome , glnrs from all tenericutes and bacteroidetes  were found to be functional. in addition, more than half of all γ-proteobacterial glnrs  were also found to be functional. all but three glnrs-containing firmicutes contained gatcab, implying that glnrs in these three species  must also be functional. of course, the presence of gatcab does not necessarily mean that the genomic glnrs is non-functional, as is the case with three bacteria possessing gatcab . the glurs in these three bacteria were experimentally shown to be trnagln-discriminatory, implying that the indirect glutaminylation pathway is defunct and that the glnrs is functional. by extrapolation, we predict that glnrs of γ-proteobacteria and deinococcous-thermus are functional.

the presence of glnrs in ϵ-proteobacteria, all possessing glurs <dig>  is special. the occurrence of glnrs in these bacteria was found to be random based on the observation that bacteria of the same genus sometimes contained  and sometimes did not contain  glnrs. the random occurrence of glnrs, most probably acquired by intra-bacterial hgt, along with the obligatory presence of glurs <dig>  possibly indicates that glnrs in ϵ-proteobacteria are non-functional. similarly, glnrs present in lone members non-proteobacterial phyla , like acidimicrobidae bacterium , ignavibacterium album , anaerolinea thermophila  or n. defluvii  may not be functional. overall, this analysis shows that extant bacterial glnrs are very diverse and some may not actually be functional. the database compiled in this paper would be useful to identify some borderline and idiosyncratic glnrs, whose functional status could be the target of future experimental studies.

glnrs changed in a phylum-specific manner when adjusting its trnaglx-specificity
is the functionally meaningful glnrs-trnagln coevolution divergent or convergent? meaning, does the bacterial kingdom use a universal strategy to optimize glnrs-trnagln interaction? this is an important question since experimentally determined identity nucleotides in trnaglx are often projected as universal across the bacterial kingdom  <cit> . to address this issue we considered the experimentally determined identity elements of e. coli trnagln, a set of nucleotides required for the efficient glutaminylation by glnrs  <cit> . the identity determinants of the acceptor stem  and the d-stem  are absolutely conserved in trnagln of glnrs-containing genomes .

however, the conservation of the anticodon stem-loop nucleotide  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  is irregular. as shown in figure  <dig>  γ-and β-proteobacterial trnagln sequences are always associated with u32-u <dig>  signature, while the combination is nearly absent  among the rest of bacterial trnagln . identity of the 32- <dig> nucleotide pair is known to influence the anticodon loop conformation through unusual bifurcated hydrogen bond formation with functional implications  <cit> . specifically it was shown that the u32-u <dig> combination is not isosteric with any other combination of nucleotides at 32- <dig> and that this can induce an unusual conformation of the anticodon loop  <cit> .

despite the differences at 32- <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide positions in trnagln, representative glnrs from bacterial groups, one with u32-u <dig> and a <dig>   <cit>  and the other with c32-a <dig> and g <dig>   <cit> , are experimentally known to be functional. since glnrs from e. coli and t. thermophilus are distant in the phylogenetic tree by multiple branching, one can conclude that glnrs-trnagln coevolved differently in the two bacteria. in other words, coevolution of bacterial glnrs-trnagln is phylum-specific or divergent, and, the experimentally determined trnagln identity elements for a bacterium in one phylum  may not strictly hold true for another bacterium belonging to a different phylum . such phylum-specific trends have been observed experimentally for glurs-trnagln interaction – a d-glurs-specific residue  in thermus thermophilus glurs led to a relaxed trnagln-discrimination  <cit>  but when the same residue was mutated in h. pylori , no such effect was observed  <cit> . similarly, for glurs-trnaglu interaction, it was found that a proteobacteria-specific arg residue  was absolutely essential for glutamylation efficiency of glurs but the arg is replaced by mostly leu in non-proteobacterial glurs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
by constructing and analyzing a large database of bacterial whole genomes, we have probed the evolution of gln-trnagln synthesizing molecular machinery. our approach is unique because of the large database employed and the functional annotation we used, taking advantage of whole genome information. in addition to supporting the broad picture of the currently accepted model for glxrs evolution , our results bring out some new findings — the most important being the evolutionary origin of glurs <dig>  we showed that bacterial glurs <dig> comes in two flavors, both in terms of evolution and function. the first kind, found in hyperthermophilic bacteria, appeared by gene duplication of the n-terminal catalytic domain and is non-functional. on the other hand, functional glurs <dig>  found in some proteobacterial classes , did not appear due to gene duplication. rather, these are chimeras of catalytic and anticodon-binding domains, acquired independently by hgt. acidobacterial glurs <dig> is predicted to be functionally similar to hyperthermophilic glurs <dig>  we could identify extant bacteria that contain both glnrs and glurs <dig>  pointing out that their evolutionary histories are independent. in addition, a glnrs pseudo-gene  was identified that provided direct evidence of loss of hgt acquired glnrs. another important finding is the correlation of nucleotides at 32- <dig> position of trnagln and the phylogenetic placement of glnrs, pointing towards glnrs-trnagln coevolution and the importance of 32- <dig> nucleotides in glnrs-trnagln interaction. we showed that bacterial glnrs are of two types, one acquired from eukaryotes by hgt and the other appearing later by intra-phyla hgt, as exemplified by the yqey-appended glnrs in ϵ- and δ-proteobacteria, acquired from deinococcus-thermus. the results presented here highlight many subtleties of evolution of bacterial glxrs and may be a general feature of some other bacterial proteins as well. the functional status of some borderline and idiosyncratic glnrs, pointed out in this work, could be the target of future experimental studies. the annotated database could also be analyzed further for idiosyncratic features of bacterial glxrs evolution not identified here.
