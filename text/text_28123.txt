BACKGROUND
fatty alknes, which can be produced by plants, insects, birds, green algae, and cyanobacteria, are the main components of conventional fuels, and have been considered as the ideal replacement for fossil-based fuels . it has been accepted that a two-step pathway for fatty alkne biosynthesis exists, involving reduction of fatty acyl-acp or -coa into corresponding aldehyde by acyl-acp reductase and conversion of fatty aldehyde into alkne by aldehyde decarbonylase. in  <dig>  schirmer et al. identified two genes involved in fatty alkne biosynthesis in cyanobacteria: acyl-acp reductase and aldehyde decarbonylase   <cit> . since then cado  has attracted particular interest due to the difficult and unusual reaction it catalyses  <cit> .

the crystal structures of cado revealed that cado belongs to the non-heme dinuclear iron oxygenase family of enzymes exemplified by methane monoxygenase, type i ribonucleotide reductase, and ferritin. the di-iron center is contained within an antiparallel four-α-helix bundle, where two histidines and four carboxylates  supply the protein ligands to the metal ions . the c1-derived co-product of the cado-catalyzed reaction is formate   <cit> . oxygen is needed, and one o-atom is incorporated into formate  <cit> . the auxiliary reducing system  providing four electrons is required, and the endogenous electron transfer system worked more effectively than the heterologous and chemical ones in supporting cado activity . self-sufficient cados fused to homogenous ferredoxin and ferredoxin-nadp+ reductase could efficiently catalyze the conversion of aldehydes into alknes  <cit> . it has been found that cado also produces n- <dig> aldehydes and alcohols in addition to alkne  <cit> . mechanistic studies have demonstrated that a radical intermediate is involved in the cado-catalyzed reaction, and a possible catalytic process has been proposed based on the crystal structures of cado from synechococcus elongates strain pcc <dig> . moreover, cado was engineered to improve specificity for short- to medium-chain aldehydes  <cit> . recently, hayashi et al. investigated the role of three cysteine residues of cado in the structure, stability and alkne production  <cit> .fig.  <dig> cado-catalyzed reaction 




however, cado showed extreme low activity with the k
cat value below 1 min− <dig>  which would present a major barrier to its application in biofuel production . in order to address this issue, protein engineering of cado for improved activity including rational design and/or directed evolution is urgently needed. the knowledge about structure-function relationship of cados is the prerequisite for rational protein engineering. until now, no detailed studies towards structure-function relationship of cados have been carried out. some crystal structures of cados from p. marinus strain mit <dig> and synechococcus elongates strain pcc <dig> have been resolved, which have provided a base for identification of the residues important for cado activity  <cit> .

in the current study, some amino acids which might affect cado activity were identified through analysis of the cado crystal structures and sequence alignment of some cados. the corresponding enzyme variants were made and characterized. we have found some essential residues for the cado-catalyzed reaction, which will lay the foundation for improvement of cado activity through protein engineering.

RESULTS
identification of the target residues for mutagenesis
the following residues were identified and investigated in the current study. since the variants including mutations of the residues involved in coordinating the di-iron center negatively affected cado activity, they were not included in the current study  <cit> .

residues whose conformations have changed in the absence of the di-iron center
based on the structures of  <dig>   and sll <dig>  , the overall structures are similar with or without the di-iron center, except the conformation change of the helix h <dig> in the structure of metal-free cado  <cit> . the switch of the helix h <dig> from helix to loop resulted in conformational changes of a number of amino acids , including the two iron-coordinating residues glu <dig> and his <dig>  the observation suggests that the residues involved in the oligopeptide may impact cado activity. the residues  comprising of that oligopeptide are conservable among cados    <cit> . for example, glu <dig> and his <dig> , two ligands of the di-iron center, are completely conserved. tyr <dig> is highly conserved, and is ser/ala in several cados , and is also involved in a hydrogen bond with asn <dig> . residue  <dig> is variable, and is leu/thr/ser/glu, etc. residue  <dig> is leu among more than around  <dig> cados, and is arg in  <dig> cados. residue asn <dig> is highly conservable, and is asp/lys in a few cados. tyr <dig> shows high conservativeness among ~ <dig> cados, and is phe in ~ <dig> cados. as mentioned above, the ligands of the di-iron center such as glu <dig> and his <dig> were not investigated. the residues leu <dig>  asn <dig> and phe <dig> of  <dig>  and thr <dig>  leu <dig> and tyr <dig> of sll <dig>  which might have some influence on cado activity due to the different properties of their side chains, were chosen for mutagenesis .fig.  <dig> identified residues based on the crystal structure of ado from synechococcuselongatus pcc <dig> . the identified residues include those close to the di-iron center , the protein surface , and involved in the hydrogen-bonding network  and the oligopeptide whose conformation changed  in the absence of the diiron center

residues involved in two hydrogen bonds
according to the crystal structures of sll <dig> and pmt <dig>  , it was observed that residues tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> which are equivalent to tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> of pmt <dig> respectively were involved in two hydrogen bonds  . however, there is only one hydrogen bond between asn <dig> and tyr <dig> in  <dig>  and the corresponding residues forming the other hydrogen bond in sll <dig> and pmt <dig> are gln <dig> and phe <dig> in  <dig> . residue  <dig> is variable, and is gln/asn/his/asp/ser/glu, etc., all containing the polar side chains . residue asn <dig> is conservable among ~ <dig> cados, and is his in  <dig> cados. considering that these three cados showed different activities against n-hexadecanal , these two hydrogen bonds may have some effects on cado activity. the residues gln <dig>  asn <dig> of  <dig> and asp <dig>  asn <dig> of sll <dig> were investigated.fig.  <dig> two hydrogen bonds in sll <dig>  the hydrogen-bond lengths between asn <dig> and tyr <dig> and between tyr <dig> and asp <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å respectively




residues close to the di-iron center
the residues around the di-iron center provide conformational constraints that control the geometry of the di-iron center. according to the structure of  <dig>  residues tyr <dig>  arg <dig>  gln <dig>  tyr <dig> and asp <dig> are close to the di-iron center, which might interact with the nearby residues including the ligands of di-iron: tyr <dig> with glu <dig> , his <dig> , gln <dig> and ser111; arg <dig> with his <dig>  and asp143; gln <dig> with glu <dig> , asn <dig> and tyr39; tyr <dig> with glu <dig> , glu <dig>  and val <dig> ; asp <dig> with arg <dig> and his <dig> . residue tyr <dig> is highly conserved, and is phe in  <dig> cados . arg <dig>  gln <dig>  tyr <dig> and asp <dig> show high conservativeness among ~ <dig> cado. likewise, the residues coordinating the di-iron center like glu <dig>  glu <dig>  glu <dig>  glu <dig>  glu <dig> and his <dig> were excluded in this study. residues tyr <dig>  arg <dig>  gln <dig>  tyr <dig> and asp <dig> of  <dig> were selected for investigation.

residues located on the protein surface
based on sequence alignment of  <dig> cados, trp <dig> of  <dig> is highly conserved among ~ <dig> cados, and is arg/lys in ~ <dig> cados. the side-chains of trp and arg/lys exhibited completely different properties: hydrophobicity versus hydrophilicity. moreover, according to the crystal structure of  <dig>  trp <dig> is positioned at helix  <dig> and exposed to the protein surface . these facts prompted us to presume that hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of this residue might have some influence on cado activity. therefore, this residue was studied.

site-directed mutagenesis, overexpression and purification
we have observed that  <dig> is more active than sll <dig> against n-hexadecanal, so thr <dig>  leu <dig> and tyr <dig> of sll <dig> were respectively mutated into the counterparts of  <dig> - leu, arg and phe . for comparison, leu <dig> and phe <dig> of  <dig> were also mutated into the corresponding ones of sll <dig> - thr and tyr respectively. since pmt <dig> is more active than sll <dig> towards n-hexadecanal under our assay conditions , asp <dig> and asn <dig> of sll <dig> were mutated into the corresponding residues of pmt <dig> - his and his respectively . in order to investigate the effects of the polar side chains of some residues on cado activity, the single site-directed mutants y39f, r62a, q110l, y122f, d143a and n149a were constructed for  <dig>  in addition, n123h and w178r of  <dig> were made based on the conservativeness.

enzymatic activities of wild-type cados and variants

n-hexadecanal and n-heptanal were used as the substrates to investigate the effects of mutations on enzymatic activities of  <dig> and sll <dig>  when n-hexadecanal was used as a substrate, the yields of n-pentadecane were quantified. while n-heptanal was used as a substrate, the apparent k
cat values were measured.

compared with wt   <dig>  the apparent k
cat values of 1593w178r, 1593q49h/n123h/f150y, 1593l146t, 1593f150y and 1593q49h/f150y were enhanced by  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, and 60 ± 5% respectively . 1593r62a exhibited significantly reduced k

cat values .

the kinetic parameters towards n-heptanal were also determined for some variants showing higher activity than wt. the variants l148r and d49h/n123h of sll <dig>  and w178r, q49h/n123h/f150y, l146t and q49h/f150y of  <dig> showed higher k
cat values than wt and comparable k
m values to wt, indicating that these mutations had significant effects on activity, but no big impact on substrate binding . the observation that the k
cat value of f150y was higher than that of wt  <dig> and its k
m value was much lower than that of wt  <dig> suggested that replacement of phenylalanine  <dig> with tyrosine not only affected activity but also substrate binding .table  <dig> kinetic parameters of wt  <dig>  wt sll <dig> and some variants

cat value than wt  <dig>  and exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency  among all variants,  <dig> -fold higher than wt .

discussion
although the conditions of the cado-catalyzed reaction have been optimized through different attempts, the turnover numbers are still below ~1 min− <dig> . therefore, the sluggish kinetics of cado has become a bottle-neck for biofuel production in cyanobacteria, and to identify the activity related key residues for cado is definitely required. since it was observed that cado- <dig> showed the highest activity under our assay conditions among cados tested , it was selected as the test sequence for blast. in the current paper, we have identified some amino acid residues which impact the enzyme activity of cado through structure and sequence analysis of some cados.

firstly, the results of 1593l146t, 1593f150y, sll0208t146l and sll0208l148r have clearly demonstrated that the side chains of the residues consisting of the oligopeptide  whose conformation changed in the absence of the di-iron center had important effects on cado activity. crystal structures reveal that these polar residues form important hydrogen bond interactions with residues from other helices, which may contribute to the local structural stability of the oligopeptide. in addition, the polar side chains of these residues might interact with the nearby residues, for example, in  <dig>  arg <dig> with asn <dig> and glu <dig>  asn <dig> with arg <dig> and glu152; in sll <dig>  thr <dig> with asp <dig> and asn <dig>  asn <dig> with thr <dig> and glu <dig>  tyr <dig> with gln49; in pmt <dig>  thr <dig> with asp <dig> and asn <dig>  asn <dig> with thr <dig> and glu <dig>  tyr <dig> with his <dig>  which are equivalent to the residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> and sll <dig> respectively. thr <dig> of pmt <dig> and the equivalent one  of sll <dig> are also involved in the hydrogen-bonding network close to the di-iron center. replacement of the residues containing the polar side chains with ones containing the nonpolar side chains led to removal of the possible interaction with nearby residues, which might have severe influence on protein folding, stability, even activity. in contrast, substitution of amino acids with the nonpolar side chains by ones with the polar side chains gave the reverse impact, as observed for 1593l146t, sll0208l148r and 1593f150y. the enhanced activities of these three variants are presumably due to local stabilization caused by newly established interaction of three residues with the nearby amino acids.

secondly, based on the structures of sll <dig> and pmt <dig>  a hydrogen bond is possibly established between tyr <dig> and gln <dig> in  <dig> while phe <dig> of  <dig> was substituted by tyr. activities of both f150y and q49h/f150y of  <dig> were enhanced, suggesting that the hydrogen bond between these two residues is important for  <dig>  the triple mutant 1593q49h/f150y/n123h showed higher activity than wt  <dig>  1593q49h/f150y and 1593f150y, and the double mutant sll0208d49h/n123h exhibited improved activity than wt sll <dig>  sll0208d49h and sll0208n123h. thus, some synergistic effects were observed for 1593q49h/f150y/n123h and sll0208d49h/n123h, implying that these two hydrogen bonds are beneficial for cado activity and the co-existence of two his in both hydrogen bonds is more important than the presence of only one his. unexpectedly, the y150f substitution of sll <dig>  in which the hydrogen bond between tyr <dig> and asp <dig> is removed, had negligible effect on the catalytic activity.

thirdly, replacement of the residues arg <dig>  gln <dig> and, tyr <dig> of  <dig> having the polar side chains by those containing the nonpolar ones resulted in significantly decreased activity, which could be possibly due to removal of the interaction with the nearby residues. these results confirmed that the residues close to the di-iron center impacted cado activity and their polar side chains are important for cado.

finally, when the highly conserved residue trp <dig> of  <dig> was mutated into arg, the w178rvariant showed the highest cado activity by far. trp <dig> of  <dig> and the equivalent one  of pmt <dig> are rightly located on the protein surface according to the crystal structures of cados . the enhanced activity of w178r could be possibly due to increased protein stability resulting from mutation of exposed hydrophobic amino acids into hydrophilic ones such as arginine or the change of hydrophobicity into hydrophilicity of trp <dig> exposed to the solvent at the protein surface contributes to cado activity  <cit> . moreover, according to the crystal structure of the mutant l194a of pmt <dig>  the substrate might enter the protein at leu <dig>  this mode of substrate binding is different from previously determined cado structures with long-chain fatty acids bound  <cit> . in this structure, the side-chain of arg <dig>  equivalent to trp <dig> of  <dig>  points away from the substrate, which may be beneficial for substrate entry . however, according to the structure of  <dig> , the side-chain of trp <dig> points towards the substrate, which might interfere with substrate entry . thus, mutation of trp <dig> into arg might contribute to substrate entry and binding, leading to enhanced activity observed for w178r.fig.  <dig> structural superimposition of l194a of pmt <dig>  and  <dig> . arg <dig> of pmt <dig>  trp <dig> of  <dig> and two substrate-binding modes were shown




CONCLUSIONS
some amino acids which could affect cado activity were identified based on the crystal structures and sequence alignment of cados. the residues close to the di-iron center, the protein surface, and those involved in the hydrogen-bonding network and the oligopeptide whose conformation changed, exerted great influence on cado activity. several mutations led to significantly decreased activity. some enzyme variants showed improved activity than the wild type, and the k
cat values of several of them close to or above 1 min− <dig> were achieved for the first time in particular. we identified some important residues for the catalytic activity of cado. the study would be helpful for establishing an efficient cell factory of biofuel production in cyanobacteria.
