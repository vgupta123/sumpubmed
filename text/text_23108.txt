BACKGROUND
members of the candida genus are the principal etiological agents of nosocomial fungal infections, with c. albicans being the most common species  <cit> . the overall mortality rate for patients with candidemia is greater than 40%  <cit> . catheters are considered to be a likely point of entry of c. albicans into the vascular system  <cit> . in support of this evaluation, a particularly high risk of invasive candidiasis is associated with the use of urinary and vascular catheters, and ventricular assist devices  <cit> . the chances of acquiring a bsi resulting from colonization of an intravascular catheter by candida species has been ranked high among pathogens involved in biomaterial centered infections, second only to staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . c. albicans colonizes various biomaterials and readily forms dense, complex biofilms under a variety of in vitro conditions  <cit> . c. albicans biofilms exhibiting similar architectural and morphological features form in vivo  <cit> . the implication is that dissemination from c. albicans biofilms colonizing biomaterials is frequently a major factor predisposing susceptible patients to life threatening bsi.

despite the evidence that dispersal of cells from c. albicans biofilms may be a critical step in biomaterial related cases of candidemia, few studies have characterized c. albicans biofilm detachment behavior. daughter cells that are released from c. albicans biofilms cultured on cellulose acetate filters or cellulose fibers perfused with a continuous flow of medium have been collected either as a means to assess biofilm growth rate  <cit> , or to determine if dispersed cells retain the intrinsic  phenotypic resistance to antimicrobials that is a hallmark of biofilms  <cit> . in the former study there is an implicit  hypothesis that the detachment rate is constrained by the medium substrate loading rate, and not simply a direct  response to the applied  shear force. expression of a gpi  anchored cell wall protein  has been shown to decrease adhesion between biofilms composed of yeast forms and a polystyrene surface  <cit> . the implication is that ywp1p may be the effective structural component in an active control network that induces biofilm detachment. a recent review has discussed cell dispersal from c. albicans biofilms with respect to its possible induction by farnesol, a quorum sensing agent that promotes formation of the yeast form  <cit> . c. albicans biofilms formed from mutants in which genes coding for key adhesins under the positive control of the bcr1p transcription factor have been disrupted produce thin fragile biofilms  <cit> . detachment of cells from biofilms formed from these mutant strains is significantly enhanced  <cit> .

evidence is accumulating that bacterial biofilms actively regulate dispersion processes using a variety of mechanisms  <cit> . the aim of the present study was to determine if we could find evidence indicating that c. albicans biofilm detachment from a biomaterial surface was actively regulated at the level of transcription. a clearly observable, reproducible transition between establishment of strong adhesion and loss of adhesion in a relatively copious early stage biofilm provided us with a simple tractable in vitro system for probing changes in the transcriptome associated with loss of adhesive bonds to a biomaterial. since the phenomenon involved the entire biofilm population we could apply a relatively simple scheme for array analysis which consisted of a closed loop time course comparison. a comparison of biofilm and batch cultures provided us with an additional way to screen for genes that were specifically involved in the detachment process.

RESULTS
the detachment process involves an early abrupt loss of strong adhesion
biofilms were cultured in a tubular reactor similar to that used in a previous study  <cit>  . figure 2a shows stages of biofilm detachment that are evident from visual inspection of the silicone elastomer tubing in which the biofilms were cultured. regions where the biofilm has been displaced from the tubing become visible by  <dig> h and continue to enlarge during the course of development. these regions of detachment are evident along the entire length of the tubing. biofilms cultured for  <dig> h appear to have only minimal points of contact with the silicone elastomer. typically, this tenuous association is completely lost between  <dig> and  <dig> h, at which point the entire biofilm is displaced downstream by the flow.

as in other c. albicans biofilm studies  <cit> , our inoculum was produced at 30°c in order to obtain a well defined dispersed population consisting entirely of yeast singlets and doublets, with no cell aggregates. this relatively large inoculum settles to the lower surface of the tubing during the  <dig> h incubation period. these cells, which still have the yeast morphology after the  <dig> h incubation period, are completely removed if the tubing is drained, leaving the lower tubing surface completely free of cells . contrary to our initial expectation, when medium flow is initiated, most cells remain associated with the surface. we found less than  <dig> cells/ml in aliquots collected immediately after initiation of flow until just before loss of the entire biofilm . cells that remain associated with the surface germinate and the biomass increases primarily by hyphal extension rather than increase in cell number . . biofilms grown for  <dig> h have developed a multilayer, multicellular structure that remains associated with the tubing after it is subjected to the large shear forces exerted at the interface by draining the tubing , indicating that as cells germinate they rapidly develop relatively strong cell to cell  and cell to surface  bonds.

the relatively strong adhesive association with the surface that is established by  <dig> h is weakened considerably before visible regions of the biofilm lift off the tubing and this is accompanied by a change in biofilm morphology. the early time course of this loss of adhesion was followed using cryosectioning, scanning electron microscopy  and time lapse photography . cryosections of the biofilm indicated that there was a fairly abrupt transition in the structural organization of regions of the biofilm  consisting of the appearance of hyphae extending into the surrounding medium between  <dig> and  <dig> min . characterization of the surface using sem showed that the abrupt structural transition was coincident with the loss of adhesion to the surface . at  <dig> and  <dig> min a multilayer biofilm remained after draining the tubing while at later time points  most of the cells were displaced by draining. no cells could be found on the lower  surface after draining tubing containing a  <dig> h biofilm . time lapse photography of the top of the biofilm during the transition indicated that macroscopic detachment was first visible at the edges of the biofilm as wavy flaps . at later times wrinkles appeared in the biofilm that, when viewed from the side, were evidently locations at which portions of the biofilm had been entirely displaced from the surface.

the structural reorganization observed at the  <dig> and  <dig> min time points becomes more pronounced as the biofilm develops. sections of  <dig> h biofilms were obtained transverse to the direction of flow  . the structure of the sections prepared using the spurr's embedding method  appeared quite similar to those prepared using cryosectioning, a histological technique that was designed to preserve the hydrated structure . both sectioning techniques indicated a structure in which hyphae extended from both sides of the detached biofilm into the surrounding medium. despite their relative immaturity, the  <dig> h biofilms showed evidence of production of extracellular polymeric substance  as indicated by staining with a monoclonal antibody against  β glucan . a previous study indicated that  β glucan is a primary component of c. albicans eps  <cit>

initial biofilm adhesion is dependent on expression of bcr <dig> and als <dig> but not on hwp1
a simple hypothesis is that the loss of adhesion described above involves a temporal shift in expression of two adhesins , regulated by the bcr <dig> transcription factor, that were shown play a prominent role in c. albicans biofilm development  <cit> . in order to pursue this idea we first determined if these genes were involved in establishment of the initial strong adhesive bond to the surface. figure  <dig> shows that at  <dig> min the reference  strain has established adhesion to the tubing surface while the bcr1/bcr <dig> and als3/als <dig> mutant biofilms are almost completely displaced from the surface by draining the tubing. bcr <dig> is a positive regulator of morphogenesis. however, the lack of establishment of adhesion of bcr1/bcr <dig> and als3/als <dig> strains was not entirely coupled to filamentation in a simple manner since a substantial proportion of the bcr1/bcr <dig> and als3/als <dig> mutant cells germinated  during the  <dig> min time interval. . the results for the hwp1/hwp <dig> mutant indicated that expression of this gene was not essential for establishment of firm adhesion, i.e., under our conditions and at this early stage in biofilm development. at  <dig> min the biofilm was multilayered and clearly attached. these results led us to characterize the detachment phenotype of a strain that overexpressed als <dig> which is described below.

comparison of the firmly and loosely attached biofilm suggests that glycosylation, vesicle trafficking and transport contribute to the adhesive phenotype
as shown in figure  a visible multilayered biofilm structure withstands the substantial shear force applied by draining the tubing for biofilms cultured for  <dig> h. a portion of the  <dig> h biofilms is typically removed from the surface by this procedure. these two subpopulations are referred to as the  <dig> h firmly  and  <dig> h loosely  attached biofilm. we reasoned that comparing the transcriptional profiles of these two subpopulations might uncover genes that were subsequently differentially regulated to mediate detachment in our flow model. the comparison of 1h f and 1h l biofilms revealed  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> repressed transcripts . upregulated genes fell into process ontological categories of vesicular trafficking, glycosylation and transport. rt-qpcr confirmed the changes in transcript levels of some genes enriched in glycosylation and vesicle trafficking functions that exhibited relatively small fold changes . the distinct pattern of expression of these genes within the context of the time course analysis is discussed in the next section.

time course analysis indicates detachment is associated with coordinated expression of mutually exclusive functional categories
in order to identify changes in the transcriptome that accompanied the abrupt detachment event we performed a closed loop time course analysis . in such a comparison, each sample is compared to two or more other conditions thus allowing us to visually validate the changes in transcript abundance. we compared the transcriptome of 1h f and 1h l biofilms with biofilms that had spontaneously and progressively lost their adhesive bonds . the time course array analysis produced  <dig> predicted orfs that were differentially regulated  for at least one pair wise comparison . . of the  <dig> differentially regulated genes,  <dig> have a known inferred function. there were also  <dig> genes that were significantly up or down regulated in more than one pair wise condition . comparison with two previous studies  <cit>  in which cells were transferred from 30°c to 37°c in ypd medium indicated that differentially regulated genes in the time course were not associated with this temperature shift.

k means analysis produced the most meaningful patterns in the time course array data . since expression levels of all  <dig> genes for all conditions were included in this analysis, an implicit assumption in the interpretation is that differences in gene expression levels detected between  <dig> and  <dig> h and  <dig> and  <dig> h are a temporal extension of the differential expression pattern exhibited between  <dig> and  <dig> h. the hierarchical cluster analysis presented in figure  <dig> provides some support for this assumption since it indicates that differences in expression levels between  <dig> to  <dig> h and  <dig> and  <dig> h are relatively closely related. the outlying location of the 1hl/1hf condition can be interpreted as indicating that differential transcript expression between these two groups should be treated as a separate category. in support of this interpretation we were unable to correlate genes differentially regulated during the time course analysis to genes identified in the comparison of the  <dig> h firmly  and  <dig> h loosely  attached biofilms. the proximity of the  <dig> h/1hf and  <dig> h/1hl conditions indicates it is valid to regard these two categories as reflecting similar temporal trends in differential expression.

the seven groups of genes identified by k means analysis fell into distinct go process categories summarized in table  <dig>  which shows the four or five most significant categories according to the p value. with a few exceptions, the go process category assignments for each group were mutually exclusive which suggests that the patterns uncovered by the k means analysis were functionally meaningful. categories related to carbohydrate biosynthetic processes  and interaction with the host, adhesion during symbiosis and adhesion to the host  have the most obvious possible functional relevance to the detachment phenomenon.

comparison with batch cultures indicates differential regulation of genes associated with a response to hypoxia, amino acid biosynthesis and cell surface proteins
if inoculation conditions are made as identical as possible, batch cultures are similar to the biofilm in terms of both cell morphology  and aggregation behavior . since cells in the batch cultures germinate and also exhibit cohesive  interactions we reasoned that genes differentially regulated in the biofilm to batch comparison and the time course analysis might contain a subset of genes involved more specifically in the detachment process, rather than exclusively in morphogenesis or cell to cell cohesion. it is conventional to compare biofilm and planktonic cultures in microarray analyses, where the planktonic culture serves as a sort of reference  <cit> . we compared  <dig> h and  <dig> h biofilm and batch cultures to each other since these time points bracketed the abrupt transition in which strong adhesion was lost. we used the 1h f biofilm for this comparison since we were attempting to uncover genes involved in mediating adhesive interactions.

the categories of genes that were differentially regulated between the biofilm and batch cultures are summarized in table  <dig>  . in general, genes coding for proteins involved in glycolysis, fermentation and ergosterol synthesis were upregulated while genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and the tca cycle were downregulated. this pattern of differential gene expression is very similar to that observed in comparisons of batch cultures grown under aerobic and relatively anaerobic conditions  <cit>  and indicates that biofilm cells were responding to hypoxia . the batch comparison data were ordered with respect to the ratio of the fold changes at the  <dig> h and  <dig> h time points. there were  <dig> genes for which this ratio was greater than  <dig>  or less than  <dig>  and also appeared in the list of significantly regulated genes in the time course analysis. the  <dig> genes for which the ratio  was greater than  <dig>  exhibited a pattern of expression that was fairly tightly clustered, similar to the group  <dig> pattern found by k means analysis . among these  <dig> genes were four which coded for proteins involved in response to stress: asr <dig>  cdr <dig>  orf <dig>  and ams <dig>

loss of strong adhesion is not influenced by oxygen availability at the interface or in the medium
the porous structure of silicone elastomers results in a high gas permeability  <cit> . . thus it is likely that oxygen penetration at the tubing surface might establish a gradient of oxygen at the biofilm/surface interface. the timing of the structural transition in which hyphae extending from the edges of the biofilm were first observed corresponds with the loss of adhesion  suggesting that the two phenomena might be related.

we tested the hypothesis that availability of oxygen at the biofilm/surface interface was providing a stimulus to induce detachment by placing a gas tight glass sleeve around the biofilm reactor and filling the sleeve with nitrogen gas. nitrogen was induced after  <dig> min of growth to allow time for the biofilm to establish firm adhesion to the surface. the presence of the nitrogen had a measurable effect on hyphal length which was reduced by 62% compared to the standard conditions . however, there was no visible difference in the detachment phenotype at  <dig> h. we performed additional experiments to see if we could perturb the detachment phenotype by availability of oxygen by either filling the glass sleeve with pure oxygen or saturating the medium with pure oxygen during biofilm development. although there were subtle perturbations in the biofilm structure  the detachment phenotype was not appreciably altered.

mutant strain analysis suggests that transcriptional regulation of a single gene candidate is not responsible for mediating the loss of strong adhesion
based on the array analysis presented above we chose seven genes  for further analysis. . in addition to genes indicated by our array analysis, we chose two genes for further study based on their possible function in the detachment process as suggested by previous work   <cit> . we also constructed a strain expressing als <dig> constitutively under the control of the act <dig> promoter based on its role in establishment of the initial firm adhesion of  <dig> h biofilms .

the detachment phenotype of nine mutant strains was characterized using visual inspection , cryosections of  <dig> h biofilms, and sem of the surface after draining the tubing. with slight variations, all the mutant strains exhibited detachment phenotypes that were quite similar. figure  <dig> presents a panel of results for six of the strains tested. in the top row are mutants exhibiting detachment phenotypes that we consider essentially identical. the detachment phenotypes of the aqy1/aqy <dig> and ywp1/ywp1mutants and the orf <dig>  double knockout were very similar to those shown in the top row. the macroscopic appearance of the psa2/psa <dig> mutant was similar to the reference strain but the biofilm was too fragile to withstand the application of the oct polymer to the surface so cryosections could not be obtained. in the bottom row are detachment phenotypes that exhibited slight variations. cryosections of the pga13/pga <dig> mutant did not produce hyphae that were clearly aligned at both edges of the biofilm. we tentatively attribute this to disruption of the structure during application of the oct polymer since this biofilm had the appearance of being more fragile than that of the reference strain. in contrast, the mkc1/mkc <dig> mutant produced a biofilm in which alignment of hyphae appeared to be more pronounced than in the reference strain. . the detachment phenotype of act1-als <dig> biofilm was the only one that differed appreciably from the reference strain in terms of macroscopic appearance. compared to the reference strain this mutant exhibited fewer regions of detachment that were relatively more displaced from the surface.

discussion
although circumstantial evidence strongly implicates that detachment from c. albicans biofilms plays a significant role in biomaterials centered infections, there is virtually nothing known about which types of detachment events might play a role, which conditions induce detachment, or the characteristics of the biofilms responsible for the dissemination. our biofilm model is most relevant to detachment events that might occur from vascular catheters which commonly transport a relatively rich nutrient broth  and are statistically among the most likely prosthetic devices to be associated with c. albicans bsi  <cit> . a comparison with previous results suggests that at this early stage the biofilm is at a critical stage where it can either loose its adhesive association with the silicone tubing or develop into a mature biofilm  <cit> . in order to have a tractable in vitro biofilm model we used an inoculum density that is higher than that expected under any conceivable hospital conditions. however, it is quite plausible that microcolonies that develop from a much smaller inoculum might respond similarly to a constant supply of rich medium and undergo a similar process of global detachment very early in their development. it is also reasonable to expect that the primary colonizers would have previously experienced a lower temperature environment such as the skin or a hospital room.

from a medical point of view, we would like to know the interplay of factors  that trigger different types of detachment events. the perception of biofilms as structured  <cit>  differentiated  <cit>  communities that may exhibit developmental stages that are actively programmed  <cit>  suggests that explicit intrinsic  components might play a role. two time course studies have provided a foundation for discovering points of active regulation of c. albicans biofilm developmental processes at the transcriptional level. significant changes in the transcriptome accompany both the establishment of initial association with the surface  <cit>  and precede the stage of pronounced increase in biomass  <cit> . this study is the first to address transcriptome changes that accompany a clearly observable biofilm detachment process. we have found that a transition in which a firm attachment to the surface is abruptly lost are coincident with changes in the transcriptome, and we have identified genes that are reasonable candidates for playing a role in this detachment. furthermore, a subset of the genes that were differentially regulated during the transition is not associated with either hyphal extension, the most obvious morphological change at the cellular level, or cell aggregation. the microarray data indicated that changes associated with the detachment process were complex and, even after using the array data as a guide for mutant strain construction, we were unable to demonstrate that transcriptional regulation of any single gene was essential for loss of strong adhesion.

the most direct evidence that biofilm developmental processes are actively controlled by biofilm-specific transcriptional regulatory networks has come from studies of bcr <dig> dependent genes  <cit> . bcr1p, a zinc finger domain transcription factor under the positive control of tec1p, a positive regulator of morphogenesis, activates a set of genes  that code for gpi anchored cell surface proteins that are required for normal biofilm formation. of these, als <dig> and hwp <dig> appear to play the most prominent role in biofilm development  <cit> , and evidence suggests that their differential expression could play a role in mediating detachment events  <cit> . we found that bcr <dig> was necessary for establishment of adhesion of the c. albicans biofilm to the silicone elastomer surface and that als <dig> was necessary for establishment of firm adhesion, while hwp <dig> was not required. although there was a slight trend of decreased expression of tec <dig> in the time course analysis, there was no indication that bcr <dig> was differentially regulated during detachment and overexpression of als <dig> had only a modest effect on the detachment phenotype.

the time course analysis indicated that the detachment process coincided with differential regulation of a relative abundance of genes coding for plasma membrane proteins, cell surface proteins and cell wall proteins, with a modest enrichment in these categories . these genes were scrutinized more closely for clues that would indicate changes in cell surface properties related to detachment. genes involved in transport  were highly represented indicating a shift in metabolism. there was no clear trend indicating that these transcripts were generally either increased or decreased during the time course. there was a general decrease in transcripts for genes involved in hyphal penetration  which is suggestive of a response to reject surface association. it would be reasonable to expect that induction of release from the surface would involve cell wall restructuring and two genes  are related to this function.

patterns of gene expression uncovered by k means analysis indicated that genes involved in similar biological processes were regulated together which provides some support for the hypothesis that the detachment process was associated with some form of coordinated transcriptional regulation. genes involved in dna packaging  and host interaction  were generally down regulated , while genes involved in carbohydrate/glycoprotein  biosynthetic processes and energy derivation/generation of precursor metabolites  were generally up regulated . among group  <dig> there were a number of genes coding for histones that were found to be differentially regulated by the quorum sensing agents farnesol or tyrosol , both of which have been shown to influence biofilm development  <cit> .

there are a substantial number of genes whose expression levels have been shown previously to influence c. albicans biofilm formation. the bcr <dig> dependent genes were discussed above. the one gene  specifically linked to c. albicans biofilm detachment  <cit>  was notably absent from the list of differential regulated genes in the time course analysis. this was not entirely unexpected since ywp <dig> is expressed primarily in the yeast form. another gene that was notably absent from the list was eap <dig>  the eap <dig> gene has been shown to be required for strong adhesion to polystyrene, which is similar to silicone elastomer in that it is relatively hydrophobic  <cit> . prp <dig>  a gene found to be upregulated upon binding of hyphae to polystyrene  <cit> , showed a trend of downregulation in our time course study. prp <dig> is an rna dependent atp-ase, and thus probably involved in general metabolism so we did not consider this as a candidate for functional analysis.

a reasonable hypothesis is that detachment from a silicone elastomer surface is induced by a change in cell surface hydrophobicity . c. albicans has a variety of options for binding to host cells via specific interactions, while csh provides a less specific means of binding to both host tissues and biomaterial surfaces  <cit> . presumably cell to cell cohesion within a biofilm could be maintained by a subset of the more specific interactions, while loss of csh would weaken adhesion to the hydrophobic silicone elastomer surface. genes implicated in determining csh include csh <dig>  <cit> , mnn <dig>  <cit>  and three genes that contain an eight cysteine domain that shows similarity to a class of fungal hydrophobins   <cit> . csh <dig> was upregulated during the time course of detachment, a result that is difficult to interpret since this would presumably enhance binding to the silicone elastomer surface. neither mnn <dig> nor csa <dig>  were among the genes differentially regulated in either the time course analysis or the batch comparison. pga <dig> , coding for a  mannosylated gpi anchored protein, was upregulated during the time course and rbt <dig>  coding for a gpi-anchored cell wall protein, was upregulated by factors of, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the  <dig> and  <dig> h biofilm/batch culture comparisons, but did not appear as a significantly regulated gene in the time course analysis.  in a previous study  <cit> ).

we attempted to exploit the comparison between 1h f and 1h l biofilm subpopulations to identify additional genes that were involved in mediating adhesion with the idea that the pattern of expression of these genes during the time course might suggest genes involved in the detachment process. however, genes identified in this comparison were generally not ones that appeared in the time course analysis and, in fact, the genes in this comparison exhibited a pattern of expression that was relatively removed from the time point comparisons. this is shown both by the hierarchical clustering across the different comparisons , and principle components analysis . our interpretation is that genes identified in the comparison of 1h f and 1h l biofilm subpopulations, many of which fall into process categories of glycosylation, vesicle trafficking and transport, are candidates for mediating cohesive  interactions rather than adhesive  interactions.

the batch cultures that we used for our biofilm/batch comparison were similar to biofilms in both morphogenesis and cell aggregation behavior, and thus we anticipated that this comparison might reveal genes associated with the biofilm-specific process of detachment. a substantial proportion of the  <dig> genes that were differentially regulated in the biofilm/batch comparison were probably associated with a response to a relative state of hypoxia in the biofilm   <cit> . however, expression of  <dig> genes coding for cell surface proteins were not differentially regulated in the previous analysis of the c. albicans response to hypoxia . of these  <dig> genes, the most highly upregulated gene in the  <dig> h biofilm to batch comparison was orf <dig> , a gene coding for a soluble protein that is more abundant in c. albicans biofilms formed on silicone elastomer than in corresponding batch cultures  <cit> . a notable proportion  of the cell surface genes code for gpi anchored or putative gpi anchored cell wall proteins , pga <dig> , and hyr1).

the patterns of gene expression across the time course conditions uncovered by k means analysis, supplemented by the biofilm/batch comparison and the inferred function suggested to us that ams <dig>  psa <dig>  cwh <dig>  pga <dig>  orf <dig> , aqy <dig>  and als <dig> were candidates for playing a major role in the detachment process. inferred functions of ams <dig>  psa <dig>  cwh <dig> and pga <dig> indicated that these genes might play a role in restructuring the cell wall, thus possibly modifying the adhesive properties  <cit> . ams <dig> and orf <dig>  were among the genes identified as unique to the biofilm process according to the batch comparison. orf <dig>  codes for a protein that may contribute to biofilm formation on silicone elastomer surfaces  <cit> . we speculated that aqy1p  <cit>  might be one component in a system enabling an orientational response to oxygen gradients, since hyphal orientation is regulated by calcium ion channels  <cit>  and aquaporins are proposed to have a role in cell tropism by acting in concert with ion channels to regulate cell volume changes  <cit> . aqy <dig> was highly up regulated in the biofilm/batch comparison. als <dig> was the major overexpressed gene in a detailed microarray studies that compared biofilms and batch cultures grown under a variety of conditions  <cit> . als <dig> has been described as a down stream effector of morphogenesis  <cit> . down regulation of als <dig> was associated with detachment so a strain expressing als <dig> constitutively under the control of the act <dig> promoter was constructed. we also chose als <dig> for mutant analysis based on its apparent contribution to the establishment of firm adhesion of  <dig> h biofilms. in addition, we characterized the detachment behavior of mutants lacking expression of mkc <dig>  a mitogen activated kinase, shown previously to be involved in surface sensing  <cit>  and ywp <dig>  a gene shown previously to be involved in detachment of yeast forms  <cit> . while the mutant strains pga13/pga <dig>  mkc1/mkc <dig> and act1-als <dig> exhibited slight modifications in the detached biofilm phenotype, there was no strong indication that any of the gene products encoded by our candidate gene list was a primary determinant in mediating detachment.

it is possible that the detachment process we observed is not regulated at the level of transcription. alternatively, the process could well be orchestrated by transcriptional regulation of a set of genes in a complex manner as is evident from the various interacting factors that have been shown to influence csh  <cit> . an intriguing possibility is that the hyphae that extend from the edge of the detached biofilm might be phenotypically distinct from the hyphae in the interior and that this phenotypic difference is conferred at the level of transcriptional regulation. there are also numerous possible points of post-transcriptional control  <cit> . the first step in testing this latter hypothesis would be to compare the transcriptome with the proteome, with a focus on cell wall proteins. the fairly abrupt, clearly discernable detachment process we have described would provide an ideal system for exploring these alternative, post-transcriptional mechanisms.

the detachment processes in bacterial biofilms that show evidence of active regulation can be classified into those which are elicited by an external stimulus  <cit>  and seeding dispersal, which occurs without applying an obvious external stimulus  <cit> . in this respect the detachment process we have described is similar to seeding dispersal since there is no obvious change in nutrient loading . evidence has been obtained that seeding dispersal is initiated by a change in an internal microenvironment in the biofilm  <cit> . the batch comparison indicated that biofilm cells were experiencing a relative state of hypoxia, and there was some evidence that this response was amplified during the time course of detachment. however, we found no evidence that oxygen availability was a factor in the detachment process. one possibility is that the detachment phenomenon originates from a change in hyphal cell surface properties that is a generic part of germination under these conditions. the early stage biofilm we examined did not exhibit the classic structure in which yeast are somehow sequestered at the base of the biofilm. it may be that these yeast are necessary for mediating the permanent adhesion to the surface, while hyphae provide an initial tenacious, but more transient anchor.

CONCLUSIONS
an early stage c. albicans biofilm inoculated from the yeast form onto a silicone elastomer surface and grown in rich medium under flow establishes both cohesive  and relatively strong adhesive  bonds. as cells germinate and hyphae grow by linear extension the adhesive bonds are progressively weakened over an  <dig> h period. this loss of adhesion is accompanied by a structural reorganization of hyphae along the perimeter of the biofilm such that they become aligned in a direction perpendicular to the interfaces delineated by the biofilm-medium and biofilm-substratum boundaries. the most pronounced transition in both adhesion and structural reorganization occurs within the first  <dig> h of biofilm development.

a k means analysis of microarray time course data indicated that changes in the transcriptome that accompany the loss of adhesion fell into mutually exclusive functional categories. the most relevant categories were judged to be adhesion, biofilm formation and glycoprotein biosynthesis. there was no obvious pattern to suggest that a single gene regulated the detachment process. consistent with this finding, a functional analysis using mutant strains did not reveal any striking changes in the detachment phenotype upon deletion or overexpression of key genes.

at this point in our understanding of c. albicans biofilm detachment it is uncertain which in vitro biofilm models will be most relevant to understanding detachment processes responsible for clinical cases of biomaterial centered infections. we propose that the biofilm model in our study will be useful for charactering aspects of early detachment events that may occur in catheters carrying a relatively rich medium such as vascular catheters delivering total parenteral nutrition.
