BACKGROUND
the dcx gene is located on the x chromosome  and encodes a  <dig> kda phosphoprotein of  <dig> amino acids. the dcx protein is a microtubule-associated protein  that interacts with and stabilizes the microtubule cytoskeleton  <cit> . this gene is specifically and transiently expressed in proliferating neuronal progenitors and in post-mitotic neuronal precursors during embryonic development and in neurogenic regions of the adult brain  <cit> . dcx expression occurs during corticogenesis and is absent during regenerative axonal growth, suggesting that dcx is a selective marker of cells committed to the neuronal lineage in both developing and adult brain  <cit> . one or more mutations in the dcx gene cause x-linked subcortical laminar band heterotopia /lissencephaly   <cit> . this developmental brain malformation syndrome is caused by abnormal neuronal migration leading to a profound cerebral cortical layer disorganization resulting in mental retardation and epilepsy.

such alterations in cortical lamination observed in humans were not detected in mice with dcx gene deletion; lamination defects were only observed in the hippocampus  <cit> . in contrast, rna interference -mediated knock-down of dcx in rodents caused impairment in radial migration of cortical neurons  <cit> . similarly, mice with mutations of both dcx and dclk  genes presented both disorganized neocortical lamination and severe cytoarchitectural defects of the hippocampus, suggesting redundant functions of dcx and dclk during neuronal migration  <cit> .

neuronal differentiation is a tightly orchestrated time- and location-dependent process in which many extracellular and intrinsic factors are involved  <cit> . whereas the temporal and spatial dcx expression patterns and dcx post-translational regulations are well known, dcx transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. however, to understand the mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation during embryogenesis and more precisely in stages before neuronal determination, it is crucial to investigate the transcriptional gene control in action during neuronal differentiation. in view of the relevance of dcx as a marker for neurogenesis and considering the importance of understanding dcx gene regulation, we analyzed a putative regulatory region upstream of the mouse dcx gene  and used it to drive reporter gene expression. we characterized the dcx promoter activity at different time-points during neuronal differentiation of mesc  and we defined a small region as an element required to provide specific and strong expression in neuronal precursors and young neuronal cells.

RESULTS
to study transcriptional regulation of the mouse doublecortin gene , we selected a 2kb-long fragment upstream of the transcription initiation site of the longest reported dcx mrna transcript . this 2kb-long fragment  contained tata and caat boxes and was cloned into promoterless reporter  vectors for analysis .

cell type-specific activity of the 2kb-long dcx promoter fragment
we first wanted to determine whether pdcx2kb was sufficient to induce transcriptional activity and to drive it specifically in cells expressing the endogenous dcx gene, namely neuronal precursor cells. two mouse cell types were used: cerebellar neurons from post-natal day  <dig> mice  in which endogenous dcx expression has already been reported  <cit>  and mouse embryonic stem  cells.

cell specificity of pdcx2kb transcriptional activity was observed in both heterogeneous cell cultures by transient expression of the egfp protein upon transfection with pdcx2kb-egfp constructs . in primary cerebellar cells, egfp under the control of pdcx2kb was detected only in cells expressing the endogenous dcx gene and not in other cell types, such as gfap-expressing astrocytes . control experiments using the widely active pcmv-egfp construct revealed that egfp fluorescence was detected indifferently in all cell types, neurons and glial cells alike. both gfap- and dcx-positive cells were fluorescent , showing that the transfection process was not cell-specific. similarly, egfp expression was only detected in esr <dig> cells after neuronal differentiation and was limited to dcx-positive or βiii-tubulin-positive cells, confirming pdcx2kb selectivity to dcx-positive neuronal precursor cells in vitro .

ex vivo electroporation of embryonic mouse brains was also conducted to confirm cell selectivity of pdcx2kb activity in a more physiological setting. pdcx2kb-egfp was transfected in brains of e <dig> -e <dig>  mice, a specific time point of corticogenesis  <cit> . dcx expression was observed in migrating cortical neurons originating from progenitor cells located near the ventricular proliferative zone. following pdcx2kb-egfp transfection, fluorescence was observed around the electroporation site in the proliferative zone of the cerebral cortex. fluorescent cells displayed morphology similar to that of migrating neuronal precursors . moreover, all fluorescent cells also expressed dcx. taken together, these qualitative analyses show that the 2kb-long fragment upstream of the dcx gene possesses regulatory sequences sufficient to mimic the activity of the endogenous dcx gene in mouse embryos and to limit its activity to dcx-positive neuronal precursors.

transcriptional activity of the dcx promoter in differentiating es cells
to study more efficiently the transcriptional regulation of the mouse dcx gene, we chose to use mouse embryonic stem  cells: these cells are able to proliferate indefinitely in vitro while retaining pluripotency, and also to differentiate into a large variety of cell types in vitro. hence, mouse es cells can differentiate into neural precursors able to generate functional neurons  <cit> , astrocytes and oligodendrocytes  <cit> . using our protocol , induction of neuronal differentiation leads to a progressive change in esr <dig> cell morphology to a characteristic cobblestone structure and, by neuronal differentiation day  <dig> , esr <dig> cells begin to form long cellular processes. from dd8/ <dig> on, bipolar cells proliferate and form rosettes.

dcx protein was detected at dd <dig> of esr <dig> differentiation  and was still present in immature neuronal cells-derived from esr <dig> cells at dd <dig> and dd <dig>  based on these observations and on the detection of dcx mrna at dd <dig>  we decided to use esr <dig> at dd <dig> for further analysis of the transcriptional activity of the mouse dcx promoter.

to characterize relevant regions of pdcx, we dissected the 2kb-long fragment into shorter fragments of  <dig>  kb,  <dig> kb  and  <dig> bp , and inserted them upstream of the luciferase reporter gene.

comparison of the respective activities of all constructs  in esr <dig> cells at dd <dig> revealed a higher activity in cells transfected with pdcx2kb than in control cells . transcriptional activities were also higher in cells transfected with shorter fragments  than with pdcx2kb . in contrast, the  <dig> kb-long pdcx fragment did not induce a transcriptional activity different from control, suggesting the presence of a transcriptional repressor region in this  <dig> bp fragment. in addition, deletion of  <dig> bp at the 3'end of pdcx1kb  prevented the pdcx1kb-induced increase of activity. this last result suggested the presence of important regulatory domains at the 3'end of pdcx, especially in a 79bp-long fragment. similar effects on the transcriptional activities of the different constructs were observed in pnd <dig> cerebellar cells , confirming the presence of similar regulatory control mechanisms in neuronal precursors from both origins . however, a discrepancy is observed between the relative activity of pdcx1kb and pdcx249bp between both cell cultures , maybe reflecting the fact that the target regulatory elements necessary for the dcx gene expression are different in two cell types. indeed, it is quite possible that activators or inhibitor elements, located in pdcx1kb and pdcx249bp respectively, are most needed during the differentiation of cgn compared to neuroblasts from esc. at that stage , esr <dig> cells are plated on gelatin-coated plates while cerebellar cells are plated on poly-ornithine substrate  .

the same relative activities of the promoter fragments were maintained throughout the entire differentiation program in esr <dig> cells . indeed, when esr <dig> cells were transfected every second day throughout the entire differentiation period and the luciferase activity measured  <dig> hours later, increasing levels of activities were observed along the process with a peak at the transfer onto poly-ornithine/lamin substrate for constructs pdcx2kb, pdcx1kb and pdcx249bp. the time-course studies confirmed the inhibition or the significant reduction of the transcriptional activity of pdcx at all stages by deletion of 79b at the 3' end of the pdcx sequences in constructs pdcx1kb and pdcx249bp . finally, we also examined the cellular specificity of pdcx1kb and pdcx249bp in differentiated esr <dig> and pnd <dig> cerebellar cells and confirmed that, similar to the pdcx2kb construct , both pdcx1kb and pdcx249bp fragments restricted the expression of the egfp reporter gene in dcx-expressing cells .

transcription factors regulating the mouse dcx promoter
comparative analyses were performed on the sequences of mouse, rat, human and chicken 2kb-long dcx promoter fragments using the vista software . a high sequence similarity was found between mouse and rat pdcx2kb sequences. comparison between mouse and human sequences revealed that sequence conservation was not detected throughout the 2kb-long sequence, but was limited to a ±  <dig> bp portion located at the pdcx2kb 3'-end. similarly, sequence conservation between the mouse pdcx2kb and the chicken pdcx2kb was only observed in a 183bp-long fragment located at the 3'-end. in addition, the strongest sequence conservation between mouse, rat, human and chicken pdcx2kb sequences was detected within this 183bp-long fragment . further analysis, using the matinspector software, revealed that many putative binding sites for members of several transcription factor families known to participate in neuronal differentiation/migration such as neurod, neurog, brn, pax, hox, sox and dlx are present in the 249bp-, 1kb-, 2kb-long dcx promoter fragments . in particular, this analysis revealed four conserved consensus binding sites for known transcription factors in the 79b-long fragment located at the 3'end of the dcx promoter : two perfect consensus sites for nf-y/caat, one perfect site for lef/tcf which are effectors of the canonical wnt pathway and one imperfect site for hnf6/oc <dig> , members of the onecut family  <cit> .

expression of putative transcription factors during neuronal differentiation of mesc
to investigate which of these transcription factors, present in the  <dig> bp fragment and potentially involved in dcx gene regulation, are expressed during neuronal differentiation of esr <dig> cells, the levels of mrna coding for dcx and for each factor  were measured at different time-points during neuronal differentiation .

the abundance of each transcript at each stage was calculated relative to the gapdh housekeeping gene mrna, based on published results  <cit> . the observed pattern of dcx transcript expression is consistent with that of dcx protein synthesis during neuronal differentiation of esr <dig> cells and with the observed transcriptional activity of the dcx promoter . no dcx transcript was detected in undifferentiated esr <dig> cells. levels of dcx transcripts progressively increased to reach a maximum at dd <dig> followed by a reduction at dd <dig>  each transcription factor transcript was detected in esr <dig> cells. the temporal profile of lef, hnf <dig> and tcf <dig> transcription factors presented patterns of expression similar to that of dcx, suggesting that expression of these transcription factors is also dependent on neuronal differentiating time. their levels were relatively low during the early phase of esr <dig> cell differentiation , progressively increased during the late phase of the differentiation program to peak at dd <dig> when dcx transcript levels were maximum. in contrast, nf-ya, nf-yb, nf-yc and oc <dig> transcripts displayed relatively constant steady state levels, with little variation during the entire differentiation program. the relative amounts of tcf <dig> and tcf <dig>  seem to depend on the differentiation process, with tcf <dig> decreasing during differentiation  <cit>  and tcf <dig> being apparently sensitive to the culture matrix substrate.

since mrna for each transcription factor was present in esr <dig> cells and since no transcription factor could be discarded on the sole basis of the temporal expression profile of its transcript, selective mutagenesis experiments were undertaken.

to determine the relative importance of each dna binding site present in the 79bp-long pdcx-luciferase fragment, we individually altered each putative binding site for lef/tcf, hnf6/oc <dig> or nf-y/caat in the dcx promoter using site-directed mutagenesis to generate pdcx249bp/lef*, pdcx249bp/hnf6* and pdcx249bp/nf-y* . then we compared the luciferase activities induced by each construct to that of pdcx249bp by transient expression experiments in esr <dig> cells at three stages of neuronal differentiation. at the beginning of the differentiation program , mutation of the nf-y or hnf <dig> binding sites did not affect pdcx249bp activity . in contrast, mutation of the lef/tcf site completely inhibited pdcx249bp activity. such inhibition was not detected in esr <dig> cells at dd <dig> . at that stage, the relative activity of every mutated pdcx249b was below that of the wild type pdcx249bp but higher than that of the 79bp-truncated pdcx249bp. finally, at dd <dig>  when many esr <dig> cells expressed the dcx gene and displayed a neuronal phenotype, mutation of any of the four binding sites reduced the activity of pdcx249bp to that of the 79bp-truncated pdcx249bp . similar results were found using pdcx1kb  and in pnd <dig> cerebellar cells . simultaneous mutation of all three binding sites was also performed . transfection experiments revealed that the transcriptional activation of pdcx249bp mutated for lef, hnf <dig> and nf-y binding sites is similar to the constructs with any one mutated site  at all stages, suggesting that an additional, not yet identified factor is responsible for the observed residual activity at dd <dig>  altogether, these results demonstrate first of all the importance of lef/tcf, hnf6/oc <dig> or nf-y/caat dna binding sites for dcx promoter activity at various stages of neuronal differentiation and that the corresponding factors are part of the regulatory mechanisms controlling dcx promoter activity. however, these transcription factors are not sufficient to induce full transcriptional activation of the dcx gene. in addition, the results obtained with the lef/tcf binding site reveal that this binding site could be more specifically involved in activating pdcx at early stages of neuronal differentiation of esr <dig> cells.

discussion
this present study shows that 249bp-, 1kb-, 2kb-long dna fragments located upstream of the dcx coding sequence, are sufficient for in vitro specific dcx expression: in heterogeneous differentiated neurons from mouse embryonic stem  cells, in primary mouse cerebellar neurons  and in organotypic slice cultures. the regulatory activity of all three constructs, visualized by egfp expression, overlapped endogenous expression of dcx or βiii-tubulin  in immature neuronal cells. in addition, no egfp expression was observed in non-neuronal cells. these results strongly suggest that the fragments isolated here are sufficient for specific neuronal expression in differentiating neural cells.

during our analysis of transcriptional activities of the deletion constructs, we observed a very weak activity of the  <dig>  kb fragment relative to the  <dig> kb construct, suggesting that the  <dig>  kb sequence upstream from pdcx1kb could contain transcriptional repressor elements. to determine the regulatory element susceptible to participate in transcriptional repression of dcx expression, we analyzed this sequence with the matinspector software http://www.genomatix.de, but no unique repressor element was identified. however, this  <dig>  kb sequence holds a short tandem repeat  of twenty-five ca repeats , that could act as positive or negative regulator of gene expression. short tandem repeats have been identified and are widespread in coding and non-coding regions of eukaryotic genomes from yeast to humans  <cit> . ca repeats are also potential z-dna-forming sequences that could affect gene expression. indeed, strs were shown to activate or repress gene expression depending on the length of the repeats  <cit> . this potential repressive element was not further investigated in this work, but it certainly deserves further attention also in the context of dcx-related disease.

dcx is expressed in differentiating/migrating immature neurons of embryonic and adult cns and pns. moreover, dcx presents a maximum expression during corticogenesis  and neurogenesis  <cit> . using a mouse esc model of neuronal differentiation, we demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of the dcx promoter increased during the differentiation program, with a maximum activity shortly after the cells were plated on poly-ornithine/laminin substrates  <cit> . both of these extracellular matrix  components were shown to promote the active extension of neuronal cell protrusions as well as their maturation  <cit> . in the present study, we further show that ecm components also promote expression of the endogenous dcx protein, in a pattern fully consistent with the transcriptional activity of the identified promoter region during the same differentiation process. this interesting observation suggests that it is possible to reproduce the dcx expression profile in an in vitro cell culture model and use it to better study the mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation of esc  <cit> .

dna binding sites for several transcription factors , known to participate to neuronal and migration processes were pointed out by bioinformatics analyses of the 2kb-long dna regulatory sequence of the mouse dcx gene. most of the transcription factor binding sites present on the mouse dna regulatory sequence were also detected on a  <dig> -kb dna fragment upstream of the translation start codon of the human dcx gene  <cit> . this human sequence included a sequence homologous to the sequence used in the present study and the first exon of the human dcx gene. furthermore, deletion experiments revealed the presence of critical regulatory sequences in a short fragment showing high sequence homology across species. within this sequence, three relevant consensus binding sites were detected. each transcription factor selected in the pdcx 3'-end  is known to play a role, in a time-dependent manner, in the neuronal differentiation program. mutational analysis revealed the outstanding importance of the lef/tcf potential binding site for activation in early stages of the differentiation process, while at later stages the activity seems to be evenly distributed among all the binding sites. simultaneous mutation of all three binding sites located in the  <dig> bp did not abolish the transcriptional activity of the dcx promoter, implying that dcx residual expression could be caused by a not yet discovered transcription factor located in the  <dig> bp region. interestingly, the three transcription factors whose expression pattern during neuronal differentiation correlated best with dcx promoter activity were hnf <dig>  tcf <dig> and lef. the latter are mediators in the canonical wnt pathway that participates in many developmental processes in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . the involvement of lef in the first steps of dcx gene activation is consistent with the observations that some effectors of the wnt canonical pathway contribute to neuronal differentiation of pluripotent cells, at least at specific stages  <cit> . hirabayashi and co-workers proposed that the wnt signaling pathway directs neuronal differentiation in the developing mouse neocortex  <cit> . they showed that activated β-catenin induced differentiation of neural precursor cells  at specific stages, whereas other studies suggested that wnt signaling promoted npc self-renewal  <cit> . lef/tcf and the other identified transcription factor complexes also play a role at later stages of the neuronal differentiation of esc.

in silico analysis of the dcx promoter, combined with mutagenesis experiments and rt-pcr analyses singled out the interesting onecut factors. first, a putative binding element for hnf6/oc <dig> was identified  in the  <dig> bp sequence ; second, the hnf <dig> mrna expression profile matched that of dcx and third, mutation of the hnf <dig> binding site abolished dcx promoter activity. together, these results suggest that onecut factors could be involved in dcx regulation. hnf <dig> and other onecut factors have been detected in mouse  <cit> , the zebrafish  <cit>  and also in drosophila and ascidia developing nervous system  <cit> . all this information suggests that hnf <dig> and other members of the onecut family could play a role during neuronal differentiation and possibly in dcx regulation. further experiments are currently underway in order to clarify onecut action on dcx expression

data presented in this study suggest that the maturation state of differentiating neuroblasts could be characterized by a specific transcriptional activity of the dcx gene. some data suggest that the mouse embryonic brain  contains two distinct populations of dcx-positive cells, according to their dcx expression levels  <cit> . in these dcx-positive cells, isolated by flow cytometry from the brains of transgenic mice expressing pdcx-egfp in embryonic, early postnatal and adult animals, cells with a low level of dcx expression  were multipotent as shown by their expression of nestin. on the other hand, dcxhigh cells showed an established neuronal specification, characterized by their expression of neuronal markers like βiii-tubulin or map <dig>  these results support the idea that all dcx+ neuronal precursors do not have the same potential to differentiate. in this study, neuronal cells obtained from differentiation of esc or primary cell cultures from brain embryos form a heterogeneous neuronal cell population. in this context, it is not surprising that dcx+ cells, obtained from esc differentiation, display different levels of dcx promoter activity. this most probably reflects an asynchrony of differentiating esc stages in the same cell culture.

CONCLUSIONS
the present work provides a molecular and cellular study of regulatory sequences , sufficient to promote specific neuronal expression of mouse dcx in neuroblasts. we show here that dcx expression is abolished when a specific region in the 3'-end of the promoter is lacking. in addition transcription factor binding sites  localized in this promoter region seem to act in a time-dependent fashion on the transcriptional activity of the dcx gene during neuronal differentiation of esc. future experiments on these short regulatory sequences will help to understand the transcriptional regulation of dcx gene expression and, maybe to isolate precursors at defined stages of neuronal differentiation based on their dcx expression.
