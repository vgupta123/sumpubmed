BACKGROUND
arsenic's toxic and medicinal properties have been appreciated for more than two millennia  <cit> . its two soluble inorganic forms, arsenite  and arsenate , entering drinking water from natural sources, have caused poisoning in taiwan, chile, argentina, bangladesh and west bengal, and most recently arsenicosis  has been detected in people from cambodia, vietnam, nepal, china, inner mongolia, bolivia and mexico  <cit> . in addition, arsenic contamination due to anthropogenic activity  is increasing in importance in parts of the usa, canada, australia, argentina and mexico  <cit> . although arsenic is toxic to most organisms, some prokaryotes have evolved mechanisms to gain energy by either oxidising or reducing it  <cit> .

prokaryotic arsenic metabolism has been detected in hydrothermal and temperate environments and has been shown to be involved in the redox cycling of arsenic  <cit> . the arsenite-oxidising bacteria isolated so far are phylogenetically diverse. the oxidation of arsenite may yield useable energy or may merely form part of a detoxification process  <cit> . to date, all aerobic arsenite oxidation involves the arsenite oxidase that contains two heterologous subunits: aroa  and arob   <cit> . aroa is the large catalytic subunit that contains the molybdenum cofactor and a 3fe-4s cluster and arob contains a rieske 2fe-2s cluster  <cit> .

although arsenic metabolism has been detected in both moderate and high-temperature environments, and mesophilic and thermophilic arsenite oxidisers have been isolated, no arsenic metabolism  has ever been detected in cold environments . one such environment with high concentrations of arsenic is the giant mine, one of canada's oldest and largest gold mines. it is located a few kilometres north of yellowknife, northwest territories, 62° north of the equator and  <dig> kilometres south of the arctic circle. gold was produced from  <dig> to  <dig> by roasting arsenopyrite -bearing ore. the mine now contains approximately  <dig>  tonnes of arsenic trioxide, stored in underground chambers  <cit> . temperatures in the underground stopes range from 4°c to 10°c  <cit> .

here we report the detection, isolation and characterisation of an aerobic psychrotolerant arsenite-oxidising bacterium from a subterranean biofilm in the giant mine. unlike other characterised arsenite oxidisers, this organism is capable of growing below 10°c and is the first heterotrophic organism to oxidise arsenite in the early exponential phase of growth. we also compare the diversity of arsenite oxidisers in two subsamples of the biofilm that vary in arsenite concentrations.

RESULTS
the giant mine has a long history of arsenic contamination and dissolution of stored arsenic trioxide by infiltrating groundwaters has increased arsenic concentrations at this site from a few to  <dig> mm. biofilms have formed at many places where water seeps into the underground excavations  <cit> . one such biofilm  was located growing in an abandoned stope below seepage from a diamond drill hole approximately  <dig> m below the arsenic trioxide chambers  . water taken from the top of the biofilm in  <dig> contained  <dig>  mm total soluble arsenic and  <dig>  mm arsenite. samples taken in  <dig> from the top and bottom of the biofilm contained  <dig>  mm total soluble arsenic and  <dig>  mm arsenite  and  <dig>  mm total soluble arsenic and  <dig>  mm arsenite . the concentration of arsenite in the  <dig> sample was substantially lower than that of the equivalent top sample from  <dig>  the reason for this was probably microbial arsenite oxidation during storage as the liquid was not extracted from the  <dig> sample until  <dig> days after collection whereas the liquid was extracted immediately from the  <dig> samples. sem examination of the biofilm revealed the presence of threadlike extracellular polymeric substances and distinct microorganisms .

the arsenite-oxidising bacterium, designated gm <dig> was isolated and found to be a gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile, heterotroph. phylogenetic analysis of its full 16s rrna gene sequence  showed it to be a member of the betaproteobacteria related to polaromonas species. gm <dig> is closely related  to polaromonas sp. js <dig>  a cis-dichloroethene-degrading bacterium isolated from granular activated carbon from dortmund, germany  <cit> , and polaromonas napthalenivorans cj <dig> a naphthalene-degrading bacterium isolated from a coal-tar contaminated aquifer in new york state, usa  <cit> . using the classifier tool of the ribosomal database project we classed gm <dig> as a polaromonas species  <cit>  and the first capable of oxidising arsenite. unlike its phylogenetic relatives gm <dig> was unable to grow with either cis-dichloroethene or naphthalene as sole carbon source .

growth of gm <dig> was tested at 4°c, 10°c and 20°c in a minimal salts medium  with  <dig> %  yeast extract in the presence and absence of  <dig> mm arsenite as described previously  <cit>  . under all conditions arsenite was oxidised to arsenate and oxidation occurred in the early exponential phase of growth . the generation time of gm <dig> was shorter in the absence of arsenite, and decreased with increasing temperature . gm <dig> did not grow above 25°c. to date, only one arsenite oxidiser has been demonstrated to grow below 20°c  <cit> . this organism, a chemolithoautotrophic arsenite oxidiser designated m <dig>  is a member of the alphaproteobacteria related to sinorhizobium species. m14's temperature range was between 10°c and 37°c with an optimum of 22°c  <cit> . gm <dig> is the first reported arsenite oxidiser capable of growth below 10°c.

the arsenite-oxidising ability of gm <dig> was further confirmed by testing for arsenite oxidase  activity in cells grown in the msm with  <dig> mm arsenite and  <dig> %  yeast extract. aro activity was measured at room temperature  in its optimal buffer,  <dig> mm 2-ethanesulfonic acid   . aro activity was higher when gm <dig> was grown at 10°c  compared with growth at 4°c  and 20°c  which were comparable. in growth experiments although all the arsenite is oxidised to arsenate in the early exponential growth phase the highest aro activity was observed in the stationary phase of growth .

in most cases, arsenite is required in the growth medium for arsenite oxidase gene expression  <cit> . there are two exceptions, thiomonas sp. str. 3as and agrobacterium tumefaciens str. 5a, where the arsenite oxidase is expressed when the organisms are grown in the absence of arsenite but in the latter the expression does not occur until stationary phase  <cit> . in gm <dig> arsenite oxidase expression is also constitutive when grown in the absence of arsenite  with  <dig>  u/mg observed in late exponential phase and activity also detected in early exponential phase . taken together this information suggests that there are at least two modes of regulating the expression of the aro genes in gm <dig>  possibly a two-component signal transduction system and quorum sensing. because of the broad temperature range for growth of gm <dig>  arsenite oxidase activity was determined at a variety of temperatures . activity occurred over a broad temperature range reaching a maximum at temperatures well above the optimum for growth .

the partial aroa gene sequence of gm <dig> was found to be identical to that of the partial aroa of the putative arsenite oxidiser limnobacter sp.  <dig>  another member of the betaproteobacteria  <cit>  but in a different family. no homologues of aroa were found in the genome sequences of gm1's closest relatives, polaromonas naphthalenivorans cj <dig> and polaromonas sp. js666; gm <dig> is thus clearly distinct from the other polaromonas spp.

to compare the arsenite oxidisers in the top  and bottom  subsamples from the  <dig> biofilm, two aroa gene libraries were constructed using a recently developed method  <cit> . the use of aroa-specific primers has been shown to be a useful approach for detecting and identifying arsenite oxidisers in environmental samples  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> aroa-like sequences , from  <dig> top  and  <dig> bottom  clones, revealed the diversity of arsenite-oxidising bacteria in the two subsamples. the corresponding protein sequences were compared with known and putative aroa sequences and with the sequence obtained from gm <dig>  eighteen different aroa-like sequences were obtained from the top library and ten from bot; only four were present in both. all but one of the sequences clustered within the betaproteobacteria; the exception, bot <dig>  clustered within the agrobacterium/rhizobium branch of the alphaproteobacteria. the top <dig> sequence is closely related  to the aroa homologue in rhodoferax ferrireducens. apart from bot <dig> the aroa-like sequences clustered into three distinct clades , none of which is close to any aroa sequences from known arsenite oxidisers. the bot <dig> sequence  was identical to the aroa sequence of gm <dig>  so the other sequences in clade c may also come from polaromonas species. the affinities of the organisms whose aroa sequences lie in clades a and b are not known.

rarefaction curves  of different dna sequence profiles suggest that the top library has higher sequence richness  than the bot library. curve saturation was not observed for either library, suggesting that not all of the aroa-like genes present had been detected. a separate rarefaction analysis was performed on the operational taxonomic units , where sequences were clustered with blastclust based on a 99% identity threshold. both otu curves come close to saturation, approaching similar richness asymptotes; aroa-like otu richness is similar in top and bot . while  <dig> clones may not have yielded the full sequence richness of either library, continued sampling would have been unlikely to reveal significant numbers of additional otus.

with almost all sequences represented by only a single clone  sequence diversity  is inevitably high in both subsamples. simpson's index  <cit>  does not differ between them . the two subsamples do, however, differ in composition. they are dominated by clones from different clades: top by clades b and c; bot by a and b . the difference reflects the numbers of clones from the three clades, rather than the distribution of the sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we provide the first evidence for bacterial arsenite oxidation below 10°c. the sample site, the giant mine, is an extreme environment with arsenic concentrations in excess of  <dig> mm in the underground waters  <cit> . in this study we have compared the diversity of arsenite oxidisers in two different subsamples and found that although the composition of arsenite-oxidising communities differs, the diversity does not. the isolated arsenite-oxidising bacterium gm <dig> was able to grow at low temperatures ; its arsenite oxidase was constitutively expressed and displayed broad thermolability.
