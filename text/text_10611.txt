BACKGROUND
production of pharmaceutical ingredients by using plant expression systems  has become a promising technology  <cit> . the advantages of producing pmps compared to conventional production systems  are as follows: cost-effectiveness, adaptability for scaling up and possibility to produce eukaryotic proteins with correct 3-dimensional structures  <cit> . plant-based systems such as transient expression or transgenic systems developed during the last two decades have been reviewed by paul and ma  <cit> . in both systems, higher protein yield has been achieved through improvement of the expression vectors  <cit> . despite intensive efforts aimed at pmp marketing, only glucocerebrosidase produced in plant cell culture for treatment of gaucher’s disease has been approved for human use  <cit> .

we previously reported mucorice-ctb, transgenic rice expressing cholera toxin b-subunit  designed as an oral vaccine against cholera  <cit> . mucorice provides a suitable vehicle for expression, accumulation, and mucosal delivery of antigens that are not only stable at room temperature for several years without loss of immunogenicity, but are also protected from digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. oral vaccination of mice and macaques with mucorice-ctb resulted in the induction of antigen-specific serum igg and mucosal iga responses with toxin-neutralizing immunity  <cit> . because of sequence similarity between cholera toxin  and heat-labile enterotoxin from enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, mucorice-ctb successfully induced protective immunity against both vibrio cholerae–induced and enterotoxigenic e. coli–induced diarrhea  <cit> . we also achieved high-yield ctb production in rice seeds by using a ctb overexpression system together with an rna interference  cassette to suppress the production of major endogenous storage proteins, prolamin 13 kda and glutelin a. the amount of ctb produced in rice endosperm without rnai reached only 1/ <dig> of that of mucorice-ctb with rnai  <cit> .

to perform a phase i study as the first step towards human application of mucorice-ctb, we have recently established a selection marker–free line  as a seed bank by using co-transformation with two different agrobacterium tumefaciens strains, each carrying a distinct t-dna containing either a selection marker cassette or the ctb and rnai cassettes  <cit> . this agrobacterium-mediated transformation system includes several steps:  sterilizing nipponbare seeds with sodium hypochlorite solution,  induction of calli with plant hormones,  transformation with agrobacterium carrying t-dna,  regeneration in the presence of plant hormones followed by cultivation under antibiotic pressure,  propagation of the three mucorice-ctb lines for at least five generations by self-pollination to fix the desired transgene. since it has been reported that the agrobacterium-mediated transformation system may cause genomic changes in the host organisms  <cit> , it is essential to assess the effects of our agrobacterium-mediated transformation system on the genome of mucorice-ctb seed bank intended for human use.

recently, next-generation sequencing  has greatly influenced the discovery of genetic markers  <cit>  and facilitated transcriptomic approaches  <cit>  in various organisms. furthermore, the increasing availability of reference genomes has promoted resequencing in a wider variety of species. resequencing allows detecting substantial numbers of genomic variations including single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions and deletions  between the target and reference genomes  <cit> . in addition to revealing the differences between rice subspecies , resequencing analysis has provided insights into the diversity of domesticated rice  <cit> .

in this study, using ngs, we investigated the genomic differences between three selection marker–free mucorice-ctb lines, including the line 51a intended for phase i clinical trial, and two wild-type  rice lines . the three mucorice-ctb lines were selected by the level of ctb protein production and elimination of the marker gene used for the initial transformant selection  <cit> . we found that these mucorice-ctb and wt lines are almost identical at the genomic level. the type of comparative analysis reported here can be used to estimate genome alterations not only in mucorice-ctb but also in other transgenic rice plants generated by using a similar agrobacterium-mediated transformation system.

RESULTS
read alignment to the rice reference genome
genomic dnas of five rice lines  were sequenced by ngs. after filtering to exclude reads with low sequence-quality scores, more than  <dig> million paired-end reads were obtained for each line . the reads from each line were aligned separately to the rice reference genome  <cit> . in addition to the  <dig> rice chromosomes, nucleotide sequences of the ctb expression construct, hygromycin resistance gene  used as a selection marker, and the binary vector used for agrobacterium-mediated transformation were added to the reference to examine whether these sequences are integrated into the genomes. the resulting mapping rates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . in all results of mapping of mucorice-ctbs, we confirmed that the hpt gene had been segregated and excised during the passage of generations . the coverage rate ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, whereas the depth  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .table  <dig>

mapping rate represents the ratio of the number of mapped reads to that of total reads. covered length represents the number of genome bases covered with at least one read. coverage rate is the ratio of covered length to the total length of the rice reference genome . depth was calculated by dividing the total length of all mapped reads  by covered length.



variant calling and distribution
the total numbers of detected variants  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the examined lines . variant distribution profiles were calculated in non-overlapping, consecutive 500-kbp windows for each chromosome, and the averages for mucorice-ctbs and wts were compared . on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  regions with higher variant density than other regions on the same chromosomes were observed. on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  these regions located close to the centromeres. variant distribution showed substantial consistency over most genome regions in mucorice-ctbs and wts, since we observed the variant densities varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , whereas the differences for every corresponding 500-kbp windows throughout the genome of mucorice-ctbs and wts were at most  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> .table  <dig>

comparison of the types of nucleotide substitutions of snps
line-specific snps were subdivided into transitions  and transversions . nucleotide substitution profiles were obtained for each line . g to a and c to t were the most frequent ts in both mucorice-ctbs and wts. we also found that the tv frequency from g to t and c to a was increased only in mucorice-ctbs. the ts/tv ratio for mucorice-ctbs and wts were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . these results suggest that the substitution patterns in mucorice-ctbs and wts were similar.figure  <dig>

comparison of variant-sharing profiles among mucorice-ctbs and wts
all variants were classified as line-specific , shared by two, three, or four lines, or common to all fivelines . the most abundant variant in number  was of common type. since the positions of all variants relative to the reference genome could be determined, we could define candidate line-specific variants by excluding the variants present in more than one line. mutation rates throughout the genome were calculated by dividing the number of line-specific variants in each line by the covered genome length and ranged from  <dig>  × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and the average number of line-specific variants was  <dig> . average numbers of line-specific variants for mucorice-ctbs or wts were similar for both totals and breakdowns .figure  <dig>

classification of variants by potential impact on protein function
using snpeff software and publicly available rice data sets  <cit> , we predicted the effects of variants on protein function and categorized all of the line-specific variants into  <dig> effect types , which we then grouped into four larger categories  on the basis of the assumed severity of each effect. most variants belonged to the modifier category, which is inferred to have only a weak impact. in the high category,  <dig> out of  <dig> variants were frame shifts and their numbers were similar among all lines. in the moderate category, there were  <dig> non-synonymous nucleotide changes in the coding regions  in line 50a,  <dig> in 51a,  <dig> in 55a, eight in wt <dig>  and seven in wt <dig>  in the low category, the number of synonymous amino acid changes  was slightly higher in 50a than in the other four lines.table  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we analyzed three mucorice-ctb lines and two untransformed  lines, one of which was originally used to produce the mucorice-ctb lines. our purpose was to assess, using ngs, the genome-wide effects of the agrobacterium-mediated transformation system used to generate the mucorice-ctb lines by comparing them to wt lines, and to validate ngs as a useful tool to confirm the inheritance of the transgene over the passage of generations.

the high-throughput illumina hiseq <dig> platform provided a large number of paired-end short reads of superior quality from all samples. the coverage was >99% relative to the rice reference genome . the number of variants  per  <dig> kbp varied greatly depending on the chromosome and position within the chromosome. highly condensed repetitive sequences have been found around the centromeres in rice  <cit>  and the biased amplification efficiency during ngs or the increased probability of mapping errors often occur within or around such regions  <cit> . our results showed that there were variant-rich regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in which we detected sharp peaks of variant distribution near the centromeres . the distribution of the average numbers of variants along the genome was similar in mucorice-ctb and wt. despite considerable variation in the variant densities among chromosomes, the differences between mucorice-ctbs and wts within the same region were small . these results suggest that mucorice-ctbs and wts have few differences in terms of genome-wide distribution of the number of variants.

kawakatsu et al.  <cit>  compared the variants in two mutant lines of cultivar koshihikari: one line was generated by gamma radiation and ethyl methanesulfonate, and the second line was derived from the first one by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. the transformation-specific mutation rate was determined as  <dig>  × 10-7/site. in our study, mucorice-ctb-specific variant rates ranged from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which are 2– <dig> times that from kawakatsu’s report. this difference may be due to the differences in cultivars or data analysis.

for the set of five lines, we analyzed line-specific variants, variants shared by two, three, and four lines, and those shared by all five lines  ; the common variants were the most abundant. no considerable difference was observed in the average numbers of line-specific variants  between wts and mucorice-ctbs . the pattern of nucleotide substitutions was similar and biased towards g to a and c to t in both groups . this ts has been reported to be caused by uv-radiation and the deamination of methylated c  <cit> . the ts/tv ratios determined in our study are similar to the ts/tv ratio for rice regenerated from long-term cell culture  <cit> . a higher number of g to t and c to a tv was found in mucorice-ctbs than in wts; this might explain the difference in the ts/tv ratio between mucorice-ctbs  and wts  . the difference in tv frequencies between mucorice-ctbs and wt can be explained by observations of cheng et al.  <cit> , who reported that oxidized g , which is often detected in living cells, may pair with a instead of c, resulting in a subsequent change of g to t. in our study, sterilization with sodium chlorite prior to mucorice-ctb callus generation may have caused g oxidation . because the transformation system we used consists of several steps including seed sterilization, callus induction, co-transformation with agrobacterium, plant regeneration, and the passage of generations, the specific factor responsible for genome-wide variations  remain to be elucidated.

most line-specific variants  belonged to the modifier category . according to the snpeff manual  <cit> , this category includes non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, which are unlikely to have marked effects on protein functions. the number of non-synonymous coding variants was slightly higher in all mucorice-ctb lines than in wt lines and may have resulted from g oxidation mentioned above, leading to amino acid substitutions.

since all mucorice-ctb lines were generated from wt <dig> seed stock, we expected that variants from the wt <dig> would be inherited by mucorice-ctbs. when the variants inherited to the progenies, the comparison of wt <dig> with mucorice-ctbs should result in no different. however, line-specific variants were still observed in all lines and their numbers were similar . some calli were chosen from different seed scutella; wt seeds used for generation of mucorice-ctb lines and for genomic analysis were from different individuals. therefore, line-specific variants in mucorice-ctbs and wts may be mainly due to individual differences within the same cultivar, and agrobacterium-mediated transformation system may have only a limited effect on the genome.

recently, seven domesticated and landrace cultivars were resequenced with ngs and compared with the rice reference cultivar nipponbare. the total numbers of variants in these strains were  <dig>  for omachi,  <dig>  for yamadanishiki,  <dig>  for kameji,  <dig>  for gohyakumangoku,  <dig>  for koshihikari,  <dig>  for norin- <dig>  and  <dig>  for moroberekan  <cit> . another study reported  <dig>  snps detected by ngs in koshihikari in comparison with the rice reference  <cit> . in the present study, we used nipponbare, the same cultivar as in the rice genome project  <cit> ; within each line, we detected ~ <dig>  total variants and on average  <dig> line-specific variants , which presumably resulted from individual differences in each line. thus, the numbers of variants between different cultivars appear to be much larger than those between individual lines within the same cultivar.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that mucorice-ctb and wt are almost identical at the genomic level and that the genome-wide effects in marker-free mucorice-ctb lines were slight in comparison with the individual difference in wt seed stocks. some difference in the prevalence of nucleotide substitutions between mucorice-ctbs and wts may be caused by the agrobacterium-mediated transformation system. it is essential to find and to control the affecting factors. an accurate genome-wide assessment technology enabled by further improvements in ngs platform, in terms of both hardware and software, could become a key approach in manufacturing plant-made pharmaceuticals.
