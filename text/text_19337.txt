BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells, which are derived from the inner cell mass  of the blastocyst stage of an embryo, are characterized by their ability to self-renew and to produce progeny that can give rise to the three germ layers   <cit> . growth and sustenance of these cells in vitro requires the presence of mouse embryonic fibroblast  cells as feeder layers  <cit> . these supportive feeder layers consist of connective tissue cells that form the matrix upon which es cells grow. recently, feeder-free systems have also been developed to culture es cells  <cit> . assuming that cells are cultured on correct medium with sufficient amounts of secreted factors, such as the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor , several key transcription factors work together to activate or inhibit target genes to maintain es cells in a proliferative, non-differentiating state. for example, transcription factors such as nanog  <cit> , oct- <dig>  <cit> , sox <dig>  <cit> , and sall <dig>  <cit>  have helped scientists elucidate how embryonic stem cells replicate without differentiating.

to attempt to identify the full set of genes involved in maintaining the stem cell state , high-throughput technologies like microarrays  <cit> , chromatin immuno-precipitation  <cit>  and mpss  <cit>  have been used to compare gene expression profiles between es cells and differentiating cells. these techniques allow the detection of differentially expressed genes, even at low transcript levels, but with varying levels of sensitivity. however, these studies can be compromised if the es cell sample contains a mixture of cells with depleted populations remaining in the stem cell state. this may lead to many markers, especially those expressed at low levels, not being detected  <cit> . alternatively, the differentiated cell sample may have reached a lineage specific differentiation stage where many of the genes expressed are specific to the developmental process  and not relevant to the initiation of differentiation. determining the time point for genome-wide comparative analyses of these cell populations is critical to derive a consistent set of "stemness" genes.

functional assays  or quantitative rt-pcr measurements on known es cell gene markers are commonly used to determine the timeline for the loss of pluripotency  <cit> . however, the relationship between gene expression and loss of pluripotency is complex  <cit> . two es cell markers  have been found to show no unequivocal temporal correlation between the expression of the genes and the loss of pluripotency  <cit> . the differentiation potential and self-renewal capability of the es cell colonies decreased rapidly during the initial  <dig> hours after lif removal, yet the expression level of es cell markers remained relatively unaltered for up to  <dig> hours  <cit> . in another study, six es cell markers  were found to decrease in expression level at variable time points and rates  <cit> . glover et al.  <cit>  used a meta-analysis to identify a small set of genes that show consistent changes in expression upon cell differentiation, giving a unique es cell signature. however, they also showed that the total of genes in a signature depended on the protocol used. these studies suggest that studies of single es cell markers with functional assays are not sufficient to define what is required to maintain the stem cell state. several factors need to be balanced in a particular way for es cells to remain in a self-renewing state. if this balance shifts, es cells may begin to differentiate  <cit> .

here, we devised a novel molecular pattern recognition procedure for the diagnosis of the es cell state, based on the expression patterns of a group of genes. genes that are differentially expressed between es cells and differentiating cells were identified from large publicly available es cell data sets. a diagnostic signature pattern consisting of five biomarkers was developed and assessed using a cross-validation strategy to give high sensitivity and specificity. these biomarkers, which are also expressed at low levels in the feeder layers of mouse embryonic fibroblast  cells, can be used to determine experimentally the differentiation state of es cell cultures. therefore they can also provide a step towards standardization of es cell studies by identifying definitively their closest embryological equivalents. this development is a step in the direction that reduces the possibility of signal contamination from the feeder layer of mef cells. use of a subset of differentially expressed genes, which encode secreted or transmembrane proteins, may allow development of a non-destructive proteomic assay to determine the state of an es cell culture.

RESULTS
identifying genes that correlate with maintenance or loss of pluripotency in es cells
 <dig> genes were found to meet the conditions  to be considered differentially expressed between embryonic stem cells and their differentiating progenies after lif removal and so form gstemness . these genes and their products should be necessary for the maintenance of, or need to be repressed in, cells in a proliferative, non-differentiating es cell state. genes that mark developmental stages in the embryo, including gbx <dig>  pitx <dig>  eomes, amot, dab <dig>  sox <dig>  fgf <dig>  nanog, sall <dig>  fgf <dig>  timp <dig>  kdr, cyp26a <dig>  dppa <dig> and dppa <dig> were among this set, which is consistent with earlier studies  <cit> . moreover, many of these differentially expressed genes have been previously found to be directly controlled by either nanog  <cit> , sox <dig>  <cit>  or polycombs  <cit> .

the differentially expressed set of genes was assigned to functional categories, several of which were statistically overrepresented  in the gene set . development-related genes, such as s100a <dig>  nrp <dig>  serpine <dig>  gbx <dig>  and pitx <dig> account for the largest portion  of genes in gstemness. this was followed by genes for regulatory molecules, such as transcription factors for nucleobase, nucleoside, and nucleotide metabolism for rapid cellular proliferation, and by genes for proteins involved in intracellular signaling, cell surface receptors and ligands . in addition, genes associated with cell differentiation, embryonic development, organ morphogenesis, and the tgf-β signaling pathway were also found to be significantly overrepresented in gstemness. a comprehensive list of constituent genes in each overrepresented annotation term is provided as additional file  <dig> 

a large proportion of gstemness genes  was classified as soluble intracellular proteins. membrane proteins  and soluble secreted proteins constituted only 21% and 18% of the entire set respectively. these latter two sets of genes form a group of genes whose protein products might be used as non-destructive markers of the differentiation state of embryonic stem cells.

diagnostic signature patterns using mrna transcript expression levels
the affymetrix data sets were used to determine diagnostic models intended to achieve high accuracy predictions of the stem cell state of the samples. for each n ,  <dig>  n-biomarker models were randomly selected from gstemness. diagnostic signature patterns for these models were derived and evaluated based on  <dig> random divisions of the complete affymetrix array set  into training and test samples. each test set consisted of  <dig> es cell samples and  <dig> differentiating cell samples that were not used in the training process. to determine the minimum set of biomarkers that could achieve a high level of accuracy, the average performance of each n-biomarker diagnostic model on the  <dig> test data sets was plotted . accuracy improved rapidly with the number of biomarkers included in the model up to  <dig>  and reached a plateau when n exceeded  <dig>  because of the varying quality and predictive powers of individual biomarkers towards loss of pluripotency and initiation of differentiation, incorporating additional biomarkers into a diagnostic model may not increase the predictive power of that model. some 5-biomarker diagnostic models that achieved higher prediction accuracy than 6-biomarker diagnostic models are shown in additional file  <dig> 

among the four classes of stemness biomarkers used for constructing diagnostic models , those biomarker models that were built using selections of  <dig> to  <dig> genes from the class of  <dig> secreted proteins achieved the highest sensitivity with the least number of biomarkers. certain biomarkers in that class, which are strongly related to developmental events or the maintenance of stem cells , may increase the accuracy. however, the effectiveness of some of these models may be lower when used in other test situations as these models had lower specificity at higher values of n. this is probably due to the feeder layers of mef cells also expressing  <dig> of these  <dig> biomarkers at high levels .

even though some diagnostic models are able to achieve 100% accuracy in terms of their sensitivity and specificity, their predictive power in general may be questionable due to the expression of some of these genes by the feeder layers of mef cells. excluding these models, there were three 5-biomarker diagnostic models that achieved the highest prediction accuracy . using these models, ≥ 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity was achieved. this indicates that as few as five biomarkers may be sufficient to diagnose unknown test samples with high prediction accuracy.

these three optimum diagnostic models consisted of six stemness biomarkers, two of which, transcription elongation factor a  and stathmin-like  <dig> , are over-expressed in es cells. the remaining four biomarkers, paired-like homeodomain transcription factor  <dig> , immunoglobulin superfamily, member 4a , receptor  activity modifying protein  <dig>  and tea domain family member  <dig> , have reduced expression levels in es cells but progressively increase their expression levels with differentiation. the results of diagnostic tests of the stem cell state of samples in the test data set, using these three 5-biomarker models, are summarized in table  <dig> 

random permutation tests to evaluate the probability for obtaining the optimum diagnostic models by chance showed that only  <dig> of  <dig>  randomised diagnostic models achieved ≥ 90% specificity and sensitivity, indicating that the probability of obtaining by chance a diagnostic model with the accuracy of the optimum model is less than  <dig> .

discussion
determining biological significance of genes in the diagnostic signature patterns
by using studies of gene expression in embryonic stem cells and cells which have begun to differentiate, a panel of genes has been identified as biomarkers of the difference between the two states. these biomarkers could be used as a simple test of the differentiation state of a cell culture. a total of six biomarkers  were found to be most effective for this purpose. these genes were among the  <dig> genes that showed the most statistically significant differential expression between es cells and differentiating cells.

of these genes, stathmin-like  <dig>  was demonstrated to be a direct target of β-catenin/tcf-mediated transcription in hepatoma cells  <cit> . β-catenin/tcf is frequently activated during embryogenesis  <cit> , consistent with its elevated expression in es cell culture observed in the signature pattern. in addition, the stathmin family members were previously known to inhibit microtubule polymerization through their microtubule-destabilizing activity  <cit> , and might inhibit cell differentiation which is known to involve a complete reorganization of the microtubule network  <cit> .

transcription elongation factor a ,  <dig>  encodes a protein that promotes read-through of transcriptional blocks by stimulating the nascent rna cleavage activity of rna polymerase ii  <cit> . tcea <dig> has also been identified as having icm-specific expression  <cit> . tcea3-/- mice demonstrated this gene to be indispensable for the self-renewal capability of hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> .

the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor  <dig>  encodes a gene implicated in the establishment of left-right-handed asymmetry in mouse embryogenesis. it also regulates both morphogenesis and gene expression in developing extraocular muscles  <cit> . together with other factors, it induces formation of many epithelial-derived organs, including bone  <cit> , heart muscle  <cit>  and hematopoietic  <cit>  development. it would be expected that this gene will only be activated when es cells begin differentiation, as reflected by the low expression level for this gene in es cells.

the immunoglobulin superfamily, member 4a  was first isolated as one of the genes preferentially expressed during neuronal differentiation of mouse embryonal carcinoma cells  <cit>  and was later isolated in the mouse developing nervous system and epithelium of various organs  <cit> . although its role as a mast-cell adhesion molecule for attachment to fibroblast cells has been clearly elucidated  <cit> , little is known about its function during es cell differentiation. unlike the three biomarkers mentioned before, igsf4a does not have a previously identified association with es cell biology. however, its transcript level is consistently differentially expressed between es cells and their differentiating progeny .

receptor activity modifying protein  <dig>  encodes a type i transmembrane protein modulator that, when in complex with calcitonin receptor-like receptor , determines the ligand specificity of the crlr on the cell surface. together, they are known to play a key role in vasodilation and angiogenesis via the extracellular binding of adrenomedullin, which acts as a multifunctional peptide hormone  <cit> . usually, the mrna levels of crlr and ramp <dig> correlate strongly with adrenomedullin availability. its expression level is low in es cells and high when the cells start to differentiate.

tead <dig>  among all tea domain family genes, is uniquely expressed in mouse embryos during the first week of early mammalian development  <cit> . this gene, which encodes a site-specific dna binding protein, was previously confirmed to be expressed in several types of stem cells including embryonic stem cells  <cit> . together with its transcriptional co-activator, yap <dig>  it can activate the expression of genes that serve different functions during cell differentiation and development. in agreement with previous results, the expression level for tead <dig> in differentiating cells is almost 3-fold higher than its level in es cells.

we have shown that the signature patterns derived here from a subset of the available training samples have high prediction accuracy when used on the remaining samples from which they were not derived. as these signature patterns were derived from es cells differentiating following removal of lif, the signature patterns might be affected if different differentiation conditions were used , retinoic acid , ascorbic acid). improvements in the prediction accuracy of the biomarker signature patterns by testing and refining them on a larger set of highly enriched cell lines will be possible in the future. sampling bias might have affected the derivation of the patterns by treating es cells and their differentiating counterparts as groups. the differentiation of es cells includes the formation of distinct pluripotent cell populations that are characterized by their temporal expression of biomarkers  <cit>  and this delineation could not be made here. assignments provided by the original authors, which treated all pluripotent cell samples as a single discrete cellular entity of es cells, were used. similarly, the derivatives from es cells, from 2– <dig> days, were treated as one group of differentiating cells.

recently, glover et al.  <cit>  used a meta-analysis to investigate es cell signature changes in three mouse es cell lines. they discovered  <dig> genes with absolute changes in expression level that correlate well with decreasing frequency of es cell pluripotency. further validation, using q-rt-pcr, of  <dig> of these genes led to a set of seven genes that showed rapid and consistent temporal down-regulation in expression across es cell lines and differentiation protocols. in contrast to their method, which identifies es cell signature change based on individual gene expression changes and bootstrap confidence values, this study evaluates es cell signature changes based on a panel of biomarkers. here the coordinated expression levels of a panel of both up- and down-regulated biomarkers were considered to jointly provide a signature pattern for diagnosis. in addition, instead of providing a set of parameter thresholds to be used in the definition of the es cell signature change, several pairs of signature patterns consisting of five biomarkers  were provided as a basis of comparison.

the diagnostic test developed here was applied to the dataset  of glover et al.  <cit> . three differentiation conditions, , were used by those authors to study es cell differentiation. the projection of biomarker expression levels in these three conditions onto the 5-biomarker  signature patterns derived here indicates that the signatures performed well under the first two conditions. this is consistent with glover et al.'s finding that exposure to ra has the most rapid effect on es cell differentiation. the response of es cell differentiation to the third condition , however, was less prominent than that observed for ra. the projection of the signature patterns resulted in a differentiation status of cell population that is more es cell-like . there are two possible reasons why the signature patterns did not detect the differentiated status of the dmso-treated cells. first, dmso may induce slower gene expression kinetics leading to the loss of cell pluripotency when compared with lif removal and ra treatment  <cit> . second, the signature patterns derived from es cell differentiation following lif removal may not be optimized to detect dmso-induced cell differentiation. dmso treatment induced expression of genes is associated with mesodermal differentiation  <cit>  and was less rapid and homogeneous in differentiation to skeletal myoblasts than ra-induced es cell differentiation to neuronal cells  <cit> . however, as there were only two biological replicates used by glover et al.  <cit>  for each differentiation protocol these results may be questionable.

going beyond mrna, using secreted proteins from gstemness as diagnostic signature patterns
there is great interest in diagnosing the differentiation state of es cells without the destruction of the cells. three possible approaches to distinguish es cells as they differentiate could be by using unique combinations of biomarkers that are either secreted extracellularly , or are membrane bound proteins  with extracellular domains . their relative protein abundance could be assessed using techniques such as fluorescent-tagged signalling molecules or monoclonal antibodies that selectively adhere to these proteins. in total,  <dig> genes from gstemness are classified as soluble secreted proteins. half of these are highly expressed in the mouse embryonic fibroblast cells used as feeder layers and therefore not useful as extracellular biomarkers. signature patterns based on secreted proteins predict the cell state in the affymetrix data sets accurately , however, they fail in other platforms  even when more biomarkers are included .

a second approach, using only membrane bound biomarkers gmembrane as signature patterns, was also applied. twenty of the  <dig> genes of this type in gstemness had low transcript levels in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. several n-biomarker diagnostic models  using these genes  were able to achieve high prediction accuracy across the three expression analysis platforms . a third approach used a combined set of secreted and membrane proteins . likewise, several n-biomarker diagnostic models  using these genes  were able to achieve high prediction accuracy across the three expression analysis platforms. this overall prediction accuracy is comparable to that achieved by the optimum mrna diagnostic model reported previously . however, due to the complex relationship between mrna transcript levels and protein abundance, further experiments on these membrane bound biomarkers should be conducted to asses their usefulness towards detection of the differentiation status of es cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that the differentiation states of es cells following lif removal can be stratified efficiently using a set of diagnostic signature patterns consisting of only  <dig> "stemness" biomarkers. in contrast to other classification methods, this simple scheme derives diagnostic signature patterns that can be applied across different array platforms. it can be implemented in the laboratory to provide a convenient adjunct to conventional functional assays for determining the overall differentiation state of an es cell colony following lif removal.
