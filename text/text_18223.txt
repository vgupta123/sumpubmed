BACKGROUND
recent studies have discovered an abundance of copy number variations  in human and domestic animal genomes  <cit> . cnv is defined as a variable copy number of dna segments ranging from 50bp to several megabases  compared with a reference genome  <cit> . the initial study from the analysis of the human genome indicated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most important source of genome sequence diversity and the main contributors to phenotypic variation, environmental response and disease susceptibility  <cit> . however, the first two genome-wide scans of cnvs in the human genome, which are considered as landmark of cnv studies, have showed that cnvs distribute ubiquitously in the genome  <cit>  and are important source of genetic variance  <cit> . since then, thousands of novel cnvs were detected in the human genome  <cit> . so far, there are  <dig>  cnvs identified in the human genome  which cover more than 53% human genome. besides in human, cnvs have been also identified in many other species, including mouse  <cit> , fruit fly  <cit> , dog  <cit> , pig  <cit>  and cattle  <cit> .

it has been revealed that although cnvs account for a smaller proportion of all variations comparing with snps, they involve larger genome region of all variant bases  <cit>  and can potentially influence phenotypes or lead to diseases by employing a wide variety of mechanisms, such as changing gene dosage, disrupting genes structure  <cit>  and altering gene expression by exposing recessive alleles or indirectly through disturbing the regulation regions of genes  <cit> . multiple studies in human have identified that cnvs contribute to phenotypic diversity and complex diseases such as developmental delay, systemic lupus erythematosus, autism and neuroblastoma  <cit> . phenotype variations caused by cnvs were also observed in domestic animals. for instance, the pea-comb phenotype in chicken is caused by the duplication of the first intron of the sox <dig> gene  <cit> . the white coat phenotype in pigs is caused by the copy number variation in the kit gene  <cit>  and the white and grey coat colour in sheep is caused by the copy number variation in the asip gene  <cit>  . a duplication encompassing the fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and oraov <dig> genes lead to dorsal hair ridge and susceptibility to dermoid sinus in dogs  <cit> . it was also reported that cnvs may be associated with many diseases and developmental abnormalities in domestic animals, such as cone-rod dystrophy  <dig>  <cit>  and startle disease in dogs  <cit> , osteopetrosis and abortions and stillbirths in cattle  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that a cnvr located on bta <dig> is associated with the index of total merit and protein production, fat production and herd life in holstein cattle  <cit> . these demonstrate that cnvs can be considered as promising markers for some traits or diseases in domestic animals.

currently, there are two main platforms, i.e., comparative genomic hybridization  arrays  <cit>  and snp arrays  <cit> , which have been extensively used in human and animals for cnv screens. the advantages and disadvantages associated with each platform were compared in  <cit> . cgh arrays have the highest signal-to-noise ratios, but give relatively low or intermediate resolution in cnv detection. snp arrays provide high resolution of cnvs and are more convenient for high-throughput analysis and follow-up association studies due to the quantification of allele-specific copy number  <cit> . therefore, many studies pay more attention to cnv detection based on snp arrays, particularly along with the increasing availability of high density snp arrays. in recent years, advances in next-generation sequencing have provided a new platform for more detailed characterization of cnvs in human and animal genomes  <cit> . but it is still too expensive for detecting cnvs in a large-scale population. in addition, methods for cnv detection using sequence data are still limited and more comprehensive algorithms or programs are needed for sequence-based cnv detection with higher resolution and sensitivity.

in the present study, we investigated genome-wide characteristics of cnvs in chinese hosltein cattles by using the bovine high-density  snp arrays. consequentially, we identified  <dig> candidate cnv regions on  <dig> autosomes and  <dig> candidate cnv regions on the x chromosome. the result is an important complementary to the cnv map in the cattle genome, which provides an important resource for studies of genomic variation in the cattle genome.

RESULTS
genome-wide detection of cnvs
in total,  <dig> cnvs on autosomal chromosomes and  <dig> on the x chromosome were detected using penncnv. by aggregating overlapping cnvs, a total of  <dig> cnvrs  were identified , which cover  <dig>  mb of the cattle genome and correspond to  <dig> % of the genome sequence. the  <dig> cnvrs on autosomes cover  <dig>  mb and  <dig> % of the genome sequence of autosomes, but the numbers of cnvrs on each chromosome very significantly . the lengths of them range from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb with an average of  <dig>  kb and a median of  <dig>  kb.the ratio of the total cnvr length on a chromosome to the chromosome length varies from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . chromosome  <dig> has the densest cnvrs with an average distance of  <dig> mb between cnvrs. the number of snps in each cnvr varies from  <dig> to  <dig>  among these cnvrs,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of them are in loss, gain and both  status, respectively. the frequencies of these cnvrs in the study population range from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . in particular, there are  <dig> cnvrs with frequency >5% and  <dig> cnvrs > 10%, respectively. the cnvr with the highest frequency  is on bta  <dig>  the detailed description of each cnvr identified on autosomes is given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the  <dig> cnvrs on the x chromosome cover  <dig> mb and  <dig> % of the genome sequence of the x chromosome. the lengths of them range from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb with a mean of  <dig>  kb and a median of  <dig>  kb. among these cnvrs,  <dig> are in loss status,  <dig> in gain status and  <dig> in both status. the frequencies of these cnvrs range from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. specifically, there are  <dig> cnvrs with frequency >15%. the detailed description of each cnvr identified on the x chromosome is given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  it should be noted that the biggest cnvr, either among all cnvrs on autosomes or on the x chromosome, was detected in almost all animals. further, out of all of the cnvrs detected,  <dig>  have size less than  <dig> kb .

gene content of cnvrs
a total of  <dig> genes within or overlapped with the cnvrs were retrieved from the ensembl genes  <dig> database http://asia.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> mirna,  <dig> snrna, three snorna, three rrna, two miscrna and two retrotransposed gene . nearly 60%  of the cnvrs encompass one or more annotated genes, while 40%  of them without any annotated genes.

after converting the bovine ensembl gene ids to their orthologous associated human gene ids, we found  <dig> human orthologous genes , of which  <dig> are included in the human database of genomic variants http://dgvbeta.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home?ref=ncbi36/hg <dig>  the go analysis for the  <dig> genes show that genes of the terms of cognition, environmental response, olfactory receptor activity and neurological system process are dominantly represented in the bovine cnvrs . the kegg pathway analysis revealed that these genes are mainly represented in the pathway of olfactory transduction .

cnv validation by qpcr
quantitative pcr  was performed to validate  <dig> cnvrs chosen from the cnvrs detected in the study. one or two pairs of primers were designed for each cnvr. these cnvrs represent different status of copy number variation  and different cnvr frequencies  . for each cnvr,  <dig> positive samples  on average were tested. for cnvrs with lower frequencies all positive sample were tested, while for cnvrs with higher frequencies part of positive samples were tested. in addition, a certain number of random negative samples were also tested as negative control in qpcr.

of the  <dig> cnvrs,  <dig>   were confirmed by qpcr. the average size of the  <dig> confirmed cnvrs and the  <dig> unconfirmed cnvrs were  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. additionally, the proportions of confirmed positive samples varied from  <dig> % to 100% for different confirmed cnvrs. however, for some cnvrs, negative samples were also confirmed to contain cnv  with an average false negative rate of  <dig> %. figure 3a-c illustrates the qpcr results for three confirmed cnvrs of different types .

discussion
several algorithms for cnv detection based on snp array have been developed and implemented in different programs, e.g., penncnv, gada, cnvpartition, etc. each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses as summarized by winchester et al.  <cit> . however, most cnv studies based on snp array in human and animals used only the penncnv software , although winchester et al.  <cit>  recommended using multiple algorithms on a single dataset to produce the most informative and reliable results. in this study, we chose to use only penncnv for two reasons: 1) some studies indicated that penncnv is more reliable in detecting cnvs than some other algorithms ; 2) when using multiple algorithms, it is difficult to made a conclusion how many cnvs there should be, if we only accept the cnvs commonly detected by all algorithms, there are certainly a lot of cnvs being missed, on the other hand, if we accept all cnvs detected by different algorithms, there must be a lot of false positive cnvs. furthermore, in this study, cnv was inferred with a strict criterion  to reduce the risk of high false positive rate due to use only one algorithm.

so far, cnv detection in the cattle genome has been reported in several studies using different technological platforms, i.e., comparative genomic hybridization  array  <cit> , bovine  <dig> k snp beadchip  <cit> , bovine hd snp beadchip  <cit>  and next- generation sequencing  <cit> . in the present study, using the bovine hd snp beadchip, we identified  <dig> autosomal and  <dig> x-chromosomal cnvrs. we assessed our results by comparing with previous published cattle cnvs. since most existing cattle cnvs are mapped on the btau_ <dig>  genome builds, we converted our results from umd <dig>  to btau_ <dig>  using the ucsc liftover tool  <cit> .  <dig> out of  <dig> cnvrs  were successfully converted from umd  <dig>  to btau_ <dig>  genome assembly . here, we only compare the cnvrs on autosomes, since the x chromosome was excluded in most of other cnv studies. the comparison results are presented in table  <dig> 

based on btau <dig>  bovine genome assembly.

a: cnvrs on chr un and mitochondrial sequence are excluded;

b: cnvrs on chr un are excluded.

it is notable that only a small proportion of cnvrs in our study overlapped with other studies. similar situation were also reported in human and other mammal cnv studies. the inconsistence between results of different studies can be due to the differences in size and structure of the study population, platform and algorithm for cnv calling, and cnv  definition between these studies as well as potential technical and random errors. it also suggests that a vast amount of cnvs existing in the cattle genome has not been discovered. we summarized the detailed characteristics of the cattle cnvrs on autosomes reported in all studies . in general, the cnvrs identified based on the 54k snp chip are much longer than those based on cgh array, hd snp chip or sequence data, while the cnvrs based on sequence data are the shortest. it can be explained that the illumina  <dig> k snp panel with an average gap size of  <dig> kb is not sufficient to detect small cnvs in cattle. in the present study, we performed cnv detection using the bovinehd beadchip with an average gap size of  <dig>  kb. it should recognize that a cnv was defined to contain  <dig> or more consecutive snps in all of the previous cnv studies based on the  <dig> k snp chip. although we defined a cnv to contain ten or more consecutive snps in the present study, the identified cnvrs are much shorter on average than those based on the  <dig> k snp chip. particularly, in comparison between this study and our previous study using the 54k snp chip  <cit> , both of which performed cnv detection in chinese holstein cattle, besides the difference in cnvr size, much more cnvrs were identified in this study, although the population used in this study is much smaller than that in the previous study. this demonstrates that the hd snp chip provides an advantage over the  <dig> k snp chip to detect cnv since it can detect many small cnvs in addition to the large ones. this was also proved by the study of hou et al.  <cit> , who used the hd snp array and identified much more cnvrs than their previous study based on the 54k snp array . in comparison with the study of hou et al.  <cit> , much fewer cnvrs were identified in the present study, although both studies are based on the hd snp array. this should be explained that a much larger study population with multiple breeds  was involved and a less strict creterion was applied to define cnv  in their study. if we apply the same criterion to define cnv,  <dig> cnvrs could be obtained.

in order to confirm these potential cnvrs, we performed quantitative pcr for  <dig> randomly selected cnvrs and  <dig> of them  were confirmed successfully. the percentage is higher than the results of previous reports in animals  <cit> . it can be explained that the high density probe of the bovinehd beadchip and the strict cnv definition  were used in this study. most of the positive samples revealed by penncnv prediction agreed well with the qpcr experiments. however, there are also a small proportion of false negative samples. the average false negative rate for each cnvr was  <dig> %. false negative identification in cnv detection has also been reported in previous studies  <cit> . it demonstrates that although the strict criteria of our study can minimize the false-positive rate, it also simultaneously resulted in false-negative rate. besides, some positive samples which are not confirmed may not be really the false positive ones. because the primers used to confirm the cnvrs may have been designed outside the actual boundaries for some individuals as the cnvrs are the union of cnvs in different animals.

the cnvrs identified in our study cover or overlap with a total of  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> are orthologous with corresponding human genes. most  of these orthologous genes are included in the human database of genomic variants , i.e. they are also related with cnvs in human. especially, the functions of some genes are enriched in the same go terms  and pathways  as those reported in other cnv studies in cattle and other mammals  <cit> . we also compared the  <dig> cnvrs identified in this study with the reported qtl collected in the cattle qtl database . since some qtl have too large confidence interval, we focused on qtl with confidence interval less than 30cm and considered those qtls with overlapped confidence intervals greater than 50% as the same qtl. in this way, we identified  <dig> qtl in total.  <dig> out of the  <dig> cnvrs harbor or partially overlap with  <dig>  qtl . these qtl are involved in many traits, such as milk production traits, carcass traits, reproduction traits, and health traits .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we identified  <dig> cnvrs distributed on all of the  <dig> autosomes and the x chromosome of the bovine genome using the bovinehd beadchip. qpcr was performed for  <dig> cnvrs to validate the results and  <dig>  of them were confirmed successfully. six hundred and ten genes are covered by or overlapped with these cnvrs, most of which are also reported to be related with cnvs in the human genome. compared with the results of cnv studies based on bovine 54k snp array, cnvs detected in this study have smaller mean size, higher resolution and higher qpcr validation rate, suggesting that cnv detection based on high-density snp arrays can significantly improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cnv calling. findings in our study enhance the cnv map in the cattle genome and provide meaningful information for investigation of associations between cnvs and important traits in cattle in further study.
