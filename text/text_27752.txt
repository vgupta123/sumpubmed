BACKGROUND
patients with epilepsy have a greater risk for obesity than the general population due to treatment of anti-epileptic medications  <cit> , and obesity is also a common comorbidity in children with untreated epilepsy  <cit> . although metabolic dysfunction is known to modulate the outcome of brain injury and increase seizure severity  <cit> , it remains unclear the molecular mechanisms that metabolic dysfunction causes excitotoxicity-induced neuronal death. however, accumulating evidence suggests that metabolic dysfunction could have a deleterious effect on excitotoxicity-induced neuronal death. specifically, a high-fat diet  is associated with brain insulin resistance and compromised synaptic integrity  <cit> . adiponectin-deficient mice exhibit insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation  <cit> , and adiponectin-deficient mice fed a hfd display increased seizure severity, whereas injection of adiponectin reduces kainic acid -induced excitotoxicity  <cit> . furthermore, the neurotoxins methamphetamine and ka increase mortality and neurodegeneration in ob/ob mice more than in lean mice  <cit> .

ka-induced hippocampal changes are associated with blood-brain barrier  leakage, astrogliosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, calcium overload, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum  stress . nuclear factor-kappab -mediated neuroinflammation is induced by seizures and increases susceptibility to excitotoxicity-induced neuronal cell death  <cit> . in particular, the nuclear factor e2-related factor  <dig> -mediated defense pathway is involved in neuronal sensitivity to ka  <cit> , and activation of this pathway exerts neuroprotective effects by elevating antioxidant enzymes  <cit> . for example, nrf <dig> plays an important role in protecting hepatocytes from hepatic steatosis in hfd-fed mice  <cit> . obesity-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress also contribute to the initiation and progression of seizures  <cit> . in our previous study, we showed that an er stress inhibitor attenuates ka-induced hippocampal cell death  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, whether the nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway plays a role in ka-induced brain injury in hfd-fed mice has not been studied.

therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether chronic hfd-induced obesity contributes to deleterious effects of ka treatment on the hippocampus and to investigate several mechanisms including inflammation and oxidative stress between metabolic dysfunction and neuronal injury. we also examined whether obesity-induced systemic inflammation exacerbates the inflammatory changes induced by ka treatment.

RESULTS
effect of a hfd on obesity-related phenotypes and insulin resistance
mice were fed with a normal diet  or hfd for 8 weeks. hfd mice had heavier body weights, livers and epididymal fat pads than nd mice . h&e staining revealed that hfd mice had distended hepatocytes with accumulated fat and epididymal fat pads with the presence of many macrophages . hfd mice also had higher levels of hepatic triglyceride  than nd mice . to confirm whether a hfd causes metabolic dysfunction, we measured levels of serum lipid metabolic factors and hepatic enzymes. hfd mice displayed elevated levels of serum free fatty acid , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , total cholesterol, and tg .

to confirm the effect of a hfd on insulin resistance, we measured blood glucose and serum insulin level, and performed glucose tolerance test  and insulin tolerance test  . after 4 weeks, hfd mice were more glucose tolerant than nd mice . hfd mice showed hyperinsulinemia and a greater increase in glucose levels than nd mice during an itt and a gtt . hfd mice also exhibited hypoadiponectinemia  and increased serum levels of interleukin- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor -α compared with nd mice .

effect of a hfd on ka-induced seizure activity and mortality
we next examined whether a hfd affects ka-induced seizure severity. hfd mice showed more severe seizure behaviors than nd mice, showing stretching of the body, tail straightening, and bulging eyes during the first 5 min after ka injection . to further evaluate seizure activity, we performed electroencephalographic  recordings. hfd mice showed a characteristic pattern of more spontaneous seizure activity within 5 min after ka treatment , and hfd + ka mice exhibited a higher number and longer duration of seizure spike trains than nd + ka mice . hfd + ka mice also displayed lower survival rates than nd + ka mice .fig.  <dig> effects of a hfd on ka-induced seizure activity and mortality. a seizure behavior scores for nd + ka and hfd + ka mice. scores were recorded every  <dig> or 10 min. b eeg recording within 5 min of a spontaneous seizure in nd + ka and hfd + ka mice. c quantification of eeg recordings during 4 h after ka injection in nd + ka and hfd + ka mice . d percentage of nd + ka and hfd + ka mice that survived for 24 h after ka injection. data are shown as mean ± sem. *p <  <dig>  for hfd + ka mice versus nd + ka mice

upon examination of cresyl violet-stained sections, we found more pyknotic nuclei, typically found in apoptotic cells, in the ca <dig> region of nd + ka and hfd + ka mice . to confirm that ka induced neuronal death, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dutp nick end labeling  staining . both nd + ka and hfd + ka mice showed a dramatic increase in tunel-positive cells in the hippocampus. hfd + ka mice  showed more tunel-positive cells than nd + ka mice .fig.  <dig> effects of a hfd on ka-induced hippocampal cell death and calcium overload. representative microphotographs of cresyl violet staining  and tunel staining  in the ca <dig> region of nd, nd + ka, hfd, and hfd + ka mice. scale

together, these results indicate that hfd exacerbates ka-induced neuronal death. to investigate whether ka affects calcium-mediated cell death in hfd-fed mice, we performed immunohistochemistry with hippocalcin and western blot analysis with calpain <dig>  a calcium-dependent protease. double immunostaining showed a lack of hippocalcin-positive calcium-buffering neurons  in the hippocampus of both nd + ka and hfd + ka mice . we found that calpain <dig> expression was increased in nd + ka-and hfd mice compared with nd mice, and a hfd augmented the ka-induced increase in calpain <dig> expression .fig.  <dig> effects of a hfd on hippocalcin and calpain <dig> expression ka-treated hippocampus. a representative microphotographs of double immunofluorescence of hippocalcin and neun in the ca <dig> region of nd, nd + ka, hfd, and hfd + ka mice. scale bar 50 μm. b western blot analysis of calpain <dig>  densitometry values for each protein were normalized to α-tubulin and expressed as fold change relative to the nd group. data are shown as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig>  versus nd. #

effects of a hfd on ka-induced neuroinflammation
previous studies show that ka treatment induces neuroinflammation and microglial activation through high mobility group box  <dig>  and its receptor, toll-like receptor  <dig>   <cit> . we confirmed that ka treatment increased hippocampal hmgb <dig> and tlr <dig> expression . we also showed that a hfd in the absence of ka treatment also increased hippocampal hmgb <dig> and tlr <dig> expression. then, we examined iba- <dig> immunoreactivity and found that the increased labeling in the ca <dig> region of nd + ka mice and even greater labeling in the ca <dig> region of hfd + ka mice . consistent with these results, western blot analysis showed that a hfd significantly increased the ka-induced expression of iba- <dig> protein . we also observed an upregulation of hippocampal cyclooxygenase- <dig>  expression in nd + ka, hfd, and hfd + ka mice compared with nd-fed mice . however, there was no significant change in both nd + ka and hfd + ka mice. immunohistochemistry revealed intense cox-2-staining in the dentate gyrus  and ca <dig> regions after ka treatment, particularly in hfd + ka mice . additionally, we also found inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression is increased in the hippocampus of nd + ka, hfd, and hfd + ka mice compared with nd-fed mice .fig.  <dig> effects of a hfd on ka-induced neuroinflammation. western blot analysis of hmgb <dig>  and trl <dig> . densitometry values for each protein were normalized to β-actin and expressed as fold change relative to the nd group. c representative immunofluorescence images of iba- <dig> in the ca <dig> region after ka treatment. scale bar 50 µm. a nd; b nd + ka; c hfd; d hfd + ka. d western blot analysis of hippocampal iba- <dig> levels after ka treatment. densitometry values for iba- <dig> were normalized to β-actin and expressed as fold change relative to the nd group. data are shown as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig>  versus nd. #

effects of a hfd on ka-induced er stress and nrf2/ho- <dig> defense pathway
the er response involving protein kinase rna-like er kinase  and its downstream activating transcription factor <dig>  are essential for er stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> . to examine whether hfd alters expression of er stress-induced proteins in the hippocampus after ka treatment, we performed western blot analysis. we found that both ka treatment and a hfd increased perk and atf <dig> expression . these results suggest that hfd contributes to ka-induced neuronal death by increasing er stress signaling, particularly the perk-atf <dig> pathway. in addition, consistent with an increase in er stress, we found that both ka treatment and a hfd increased 4-hydroxynonenal  expression .

nrf <dig> signaling plays an important role in protection against brain injury  <cit> . therefore, we examined whether a hfd affects hippocampal nrf <dig> expression in response to ka treatment using western blot analysis and double immunofluorescence staining. western blot analysis showed that nrf <dig> expression was increased in hfd and hfd + ka mice compared with nd mice . we also observed that ka-treated mice showed a dramatic increase of nrf <dig> in the nucleus of neun-positive neurons . activation of nrf <dig> in response to brain injury may be dependent on the induction of antioxidant response element -related genes  <cit> . therefore, we assessed hippocampal heme oxygenase- <dig>  and nadh:quinone oxidoreductase- <dig>  expression using western blot analysis. nd + ka or hfd mice exhibited greater ho- <dig> and nqo <dig> expression than nd mice, and a hfd augmented the ka-induced increase in ho- <dig> and nqo <dig> expression .fig.  <dig> effects of hfd on ka-induced hippocampal nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> expression. a western blot analysis of nrf <dig>  b representative immunofluorescence images of nrf <dig>  and neun  in the hippocampus of nd and hfd mice with or without ka treatment. scale bar 50 µm. c western blot analysis of ho- <dig> in the hippocampus of nd and hfd mice with or without ka treatment. densitometry values for nrf <dig> and ho- <dig> were normalized to β-actin and expressed as fold change relative to the nd group. data are shown as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig>  versus nd. #

discussion
hfd-induced chronic inflammation, mainly elicited by microglia in the brain, exacerbates pathologies by increasing production of reactive oxygen species  and proinflammatory cytokines. our findings support previous observations that obesity is associated with seizure susceptibility in children and that metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue, contributes to neuroinflammation and exacerbates ka-induced neuronal death . interestingly, hfd-induced calpain <dig> expression was augmented by ka treatment and ka-induced hippocampal cell death was more prominent in hfd-fed mice than in nd-fed mice. thus, we suggest that metabolic dysfunction-induced inflammation may augment ka-induced calcium overload, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress and thereby contribute to neuronal cell death.

metabolic dysfunction, such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis, can exacerbate seizure-induced brain injury  <cit> , and conversely the use of common anti-epileptic drugs leads to weight gain and metabolic dysfunction  <cit> . in particular, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet , which is sometimes used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, can lead to hepatic steatosis  <cit> . in a previous study, kd-fed mice showed lower fasting blood glucose and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance  levels than mice fed standard chow and hfd-fed mice showed higher glucose and homa-ir levels than kd-fed mice  <cit> . taken together, these findings suggest that kd as a treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy does not affect insulin resistance but induces hepatic steatosis. thus, obesity paired with anti-epileptic drugs or a kd may not exacerbate seizure-induced neuronal cell death, but chronic hfd-induced insulin resistance may bring other seizure-related outcomes such as neuroinflammation, er stress, and ros.

we found that mice fed a hfd diet for 8 weeks exhibited obesity-related phenotypes and insulin resistance. then, we tested whether hfd-induced obesity exacerbates seizures. consistent with evidence that ka-induced neurotoxicity is exaggerated in ob/ob mice  <cit> , we found that ka-treated hfd mice showed more severe seizures and greater mortality than ka-treated nd mice. also, adiponectin deficiency, which is characteristic of obesity and diabetes, increases seizure sensitivity and neuronal loss in the ka-treated hippocampus  <cit> . although adiponectin deficiency alone without metabolic changes may not be sufficient to enhance seizure sensitivity, there is a strong positive correlation between seizure severity and insulin resistance in hfd mice  <cit> . we previously found that intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant adiponectin protects against bbb breakdown and neuronal cell death  <cit> . in the present study, hfd mice had lower serum adiponectin levels than nd mice. these findings indicate that metabolic disturbances may exacerbate seizure-induced neuronal injury.

we found that ka-treated hfd mice exhibited more neuroinflammation than ka-treated nd mice. specifically, hippocampal levels of the microglia marker iba- <dig> were elevated in nd + ka mice and even further elevated in hfd + ka mice. a hfd can cause peripheral and central inflammation and the induction of ros in rodents  <cit> . we also found that a hfd increased levels of the inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and tnf-α. as a recent study reports that ka treatment disrupts the bbb  <cit> , we speculate that hfd-induced induction of inflammatory cytokines may exacerbate ka-induced inflammation through a breakdown of the bbb.

levels of hmgb <dig> are increased in children with febrile seizures  <cit> , and increased expression of hmgb <dig> contributes to the generation and perpetuation of seizures in humans or mouse models of epilepsy  <cit> . furthermore, antagonists of hmgb <dig> can decrease seizure recurrence  <cit> . consistent with our previous study showing that ka treatment induces microglial activation through hmgb <dig>  <cit> , we found increased hmgb <dig> and tlr <dig> expression in the hippocampus of ka-treated mice with or without hfd and then ka-induced microglial activation was augmented by ka treatment. this data indicate that hfd-induced systemic inflammation may exacerbate ka-induced neuroinflammation through microglial activation.

oxidative stress is an important factor contributing to excitotoxicity-induced brain injury. ros enhances glutamate release and expression of specific genes of lipid peroxidation and dna oxidation resulting in neuronal death  <cit> . in a previous study, valproic acid, which is commonly used to treat epileptic seizures, reduced the number of tunel-, iba-1-, and 4-hne-positive cells in rats with ischemic injury  <cit> . consistently, higher levels of 4-hne were found in the hippocampus of rats with soman-induced seizures  <cit> , suggesting that increases in lipid peroxidation products might be due to excitotoxicity-induced increases of no-related reactive radicals in the ka-treated hippocampus. alternatively, mild oxidative stress induced by a kd may activate an nrf2-mediated antioxidant response, leading to a decrease in ros production  <cit> .

in addition to oxidative stress, ka treatment causes a persistent increase in intracellular ca2+ and disruption of er-mediated ca2+ homeostasis in hippocampal neurons  <cit> . our previous study demonstrates that an er stress inhibitor attenuates ka-induced ca2+ signaling and activation of the perk-atf <dig> pathway 6 h after ka treatment  <cit> . in the present study, we found that although both a hfd and ka treatment increased hippocampal levels of perk and atf <dig>  their expressions in hfd-treated mice were not significantly increased by ka treatment. this data indicate that chronic hfd itself may contribute to er stress in the brain.

nrf <dig> participates in the modulation of microglia under conditions of lipopolysaccharide- or mptp-induced neuroinflammation  <cit> . in the present study, we observed increased levels of nrf2/ho- <dig> in the ka-treated hippocampus and even greater levels in the hippocampus of hfd + ka-treated mice. in agreement with our results, a previous study showed higher nrf <dig> mrna levels in the cerebral cortex of hfd mice compared with nd mice  <cit> . we found that in addition to elevated nuclear nrf <dig> content, total nrf <dig> was also increased in hfd + ka mice. a previous study reports that nrf <dig> knockout mice display increased sensitivity to ka-induced seizures  <cit> , suggesting that nrf <dig> activation is an important defense against the deleterious outcomes of ka treatment. similar to nrf <dig> expression, we found that ka-induced ho- <dig> and nqo <dig> expression was further increased by hfd, suggesting that activation of nrf2/are may be a response to the seizure-induced brain damage. mostly, both ho- <dig> and nqo <dig> are considered as representative antioxidant proteins via nrf <dig> signaling. because mouse nqo <dig> promoter gene contains an nrf2-binding consensus regulatory sequence known as are  <cit> . a previous study suggests that inhibitor of ho- <dig> do not improve neuronal survival and increases mortality in ka-injected rats  <cit> , but pretreatment with the anti-oxidant curcumin attenuates ka-induced neuronal death by controlling ho- <dig> expression  <cit> . however, our results suggest that activation of the nrf2/ho-1/nqo <dig> pathway may respond to chronic hfd-induced oxidative stress and aggravate brain insults such as ischemia, trauma, and seizures. thus, we suggest that nrf <dig> is involved in regulating the expression of both ho- <dig> and nqo <dig> against ka-induced oxidative or inflammatory insults.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results of this study suggest that complex mechanisms affected by obesity-induced systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, er stress, calcium overload, and oxidative stress may contribute to neuronal death after brain injury.
