BACKGROUND
songbirds offer unique opportunities for studying the links between genome, brain structure, neurophysiology, behavior and evolution. they are one of the most successful vertebrate radiations, diversifying into more than  <dig> different species over the past ~ <dig> million years  <cit>  and displaying a great range of physical, behavioral and social adaptations  <cit> . many songbird species are readily observed in their natural habitats and several species have been domesticated . all songbirds share a highly specialized neural system for learned vocal communication. indeed, songbirds are one of the few animal groups capable of complex vocal learning and stand alone as accessible experimental models relevant to human speech  <cit> . neurobiological research using songbirds has consistently generated new insights that were later found to be true for other vertebrates; examples include definitive evidence for sexual differentiation of brain circuits, seasonal changes in brain anatomy, and lifelong neuronal replacement  <cit> .

against these opportunities, the songbird as a research model also presents challenges. although the zebra finch has emerged as a primary focus, many other songbird species are studied especially in natural contexts. it will be important to develop tools and reagents that allow study not just of one species  but of many, so as to exploit the diversity of vocal behavior shown by songbirds. some of these studies will be comparative in nature . other research objectives may focus on a single wild-caught species to address questions of gene regulation and variation in a particular niche, environment or behavioral paradigm. a related challenge is that researchers with expertise in field biology, neuroscience, physiology or behavioral analyses may not necessarily have equal expertise in molecular genetics, and vice versa.

in response to these needs and opportunities, in  <dig> we inaugurated the songbird neurogenomics  initiative  <cit> . our goals were to leverage rapid advances in genomic technology, so as to bring new resources to songbird research and stimulate collaborative approaches that would integrate field researchers, physiologists and molecular biologists. here we describe the following accomplishments, which form the foundations of the ongoing song initiative: 1) three generations in the development of an evolving catalog of gene sequences expressed in the zebra finch brain; 2) production and validation of dna microarrays useful for study of diverse songbird species; 3) organization of an efficient community-based mechanism for stimulating use of these resources.

RESULTS
high-throughput expressed sequence analysis and annotation
over the course of five years, we generated three sequential assemblies of expressed sequence information, each one incorporating more data drawn from both our own primary sequencing efforts and from other zebra finch research groups working in parallel . for efficient generation, annotation and presentation of expressed sequence information, we made use of the estima software interface  <cit>  and a production pipeline that had been refined in development of resources for cattle  <cit> , honeybees  <cit>  and other emerging research organisms  <cit> . in the first phase of the project, we applied high-throughput dna sequencing methodologies to generate a collection of expressed sequence tags  from a normalized zebra finch brain cdna library. the resulting sequence information was assembled , made publicly available via the internet  <cit>  in  <dig>  and used to build the cdna array described later in this report. in the second phase of the project, we incorporated sequence information obtained from a sister project  <cit> . the sequences were re-assembled  and used in fabrication of an affymetrix array as described  <cit> . in the third phase, we incorporated additional data from subtractive sequencing of our original cdna library and data from another sister project  <cit>  .

estima:songbird build 1
for the primary est assembly used in production of the song  <dig> k array , cdna clones were 5'-end-sequenced using high-throughput methods.  <dig>  filtered high-quality ests were clustered and assembled into  <dig>  non-redundant sequences , comprising  <dig>  pure singlets,  <dig>  contigs and an additional  <dig>  clustered singlets . in subsequent est builds and blast analyses ,  <dig> of the build  <dig> sequences were absorbed into larger contigs or aligned against redundant gene targets in other species, and  <dig> failed to align anywhere . thus we estimate build  <dig> and the corresponding song  <dig> k microarray represent products coming from between  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique genes, with the uncertainty depending on the origin of the  <dig> ests that cannot yet be aligned with a known orthologous genomic region.

estima:songbird build 2
the estima:songbird database was designed to be a dynamic repository for zebra finch cdna sequences in an evolving collection. a complementary initiative centered at duke university emphasized the isolation of full-length cdna clones from libraries representing a diversity of zebra finch brain states  <cit> . the duke investigators provided us with sequencing chromatograms from their project, and we combined this with our sb01-02- <dig> sequence data to produce a single assembly representing  <dig>  filtered high-quality reads and  <dig>  assembled unique sequences . this assembly was used as the basis for design of a short-oligo affymetrix array in a parallel project at lund university  <cit>  . to estimate gene representation empirically, we performed a test blast search for  <dig> orthologs of specific interest across a range of functional categories . forty-one  were present in build  <dig>  including representatives of each of the functional categories of interest. however, numerous gaps in coverage remain, as shown for example by absence of several important steroid receptors and channel proteins in the assembly.

estima:songbird build 3
in a third build of the database, we incorporated two more rounds of subtractive sequencing plus additional sequences from colleagues at rockefeller university  <cit> . the combined total of high-quality filtered reads now reached a total of  <dig> , which assembled into  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts . having reached a marginal redundancy of 64%, we suspended further sequencing of this cdna source. however, the frequency of singletons remains high  indicating considerable sequence diversity still remains unrepresented.

annotation
we performed machine annotations of each of the sequential estima builds by blast sequence similarity searches against external databases, making the results publicly available through the estima:songbird website  <cit> . for build  <dig>  the blast analyses aligned 77% of the assembled unique sequences to putative orthologs in other vertebrates . for nomenclature, we used the international protein index  of the european bioinformatics institute  as a primary reference point  <cit> . ipi is a database of cross references between the primary data sources, providing a minimally redundant yet maximally complete set of protein sequences and stable identifiers for featured species . ipi also maps to a growing set of qualified gene ontology  terms for its sequence entries. searching against chicken ipi, we obtained alignments for  <dig>   of our assembled build  <dig> sequences .

in addition to the  <dig>  sequences that aligned with ipi records, another  <dig> found matches against the chicken unigene database but not ipi, and a further  <dig> aligned against human unigene but neither chicken unigene nor ipi . in sum, we were able to assign "custom annotation" names for  <dig>  sequences, or 60% of the build  <dig> assembly. a further 17% showed significant alignment to the chicken genome at sites with no current functional gene annotation, and the remaining 23% have not yet been aligned to any putative orthologous genomic region.

microarray production and validation
for gene expression studies, two different dna microarrays were produced from the first two estima:songbird builds . after estima:songbird build  <dig>  the sequenced cdna inserts were pcr-amplified and spotted onto a glass microarray; for contigs, a single representative clone was spotted . in addition to these clones, we also added  <dig> previously characterized cdna clones as controls on the array . the total number of addresses on each array =  <dig>  . an annotation file for this array based on the songbird <dig> assembly is presented as additional file  <dig>  from estima:songbird build  <dig>  a separate short oligonucleotide array  was produced using sets of  <dig> mer "perfect match" probes designed by affymetrix  <cit>  . we performed three detailed analyses to assess the performance of these microarrays to validate their use for specific research objectives.

zenk hybridization analysis 
one of the most-studied examples of differential gene expression in the songbird brain is the induction of the immediate early gene zenk in the auditory lobule  of the telencephalon following presentation of song playbacks  <cit> . we used this phenomenon as the basis for a primary test of the  <dig> k microarray. the original canary cdna clone for study of zenk expression in both canaries and zebra finches  <cit>  was spotted redundantly on the array as a replicated internal control. additionally, a near-full-length cdna from the zebra finch was spotted once on each array as one of the "known" genes. fortuitously, three other cdnas representing distinct parts of the transcript were also present on the array, as they did not form contigs in our est sequence assembly . thus the microarray contains  <dig> different probes spanning the zenk mrna and also representing the sequences of two different songbird species.

for this first experiment we used  <dig> microarrays and a simple direct-comparison design, where each array was hybridized with two probes from a different pair of zebra finches. for each pair, one bird heard a  <dig> minute song stimulus and the other bird heard only silence. they were immediately euthanized and total rna was extracted from the dissected als. we analyzed the hybridization data using a two-stage parametric linear modeling approach . data for the five zenk-hybridizing probes are summarized in table  <dig> 

a. mean of intensity ratios for song-stimulated sample divided by silence control sample .

b. p-value  of null hypothesis that song and silence groups have the same distributions, derived from a 2-stage parametric linear model .

c. false discovery rate  <cit> .

d. mean of all measurements ; background intensities were less than  <dig> in all cases.

each probe reported an increased signal in the song-stimulated samples versus controls. the redundantly replicated canary zenk control probe measured a two-fold increase in hybridization signal in the song-stimulated samples, somewhat smaller than in past studies where signal for this probe was localized in histological sections by in situ hybridization  <cit> . nevertheless the increase was observed here with high statistical confidence . both the canary and zebra finch control cdnas reported similar fold-changes and mean signal intensities, suggesting that these hybridization conditions support effective species cross-hybridization for zenk. for the other three est-derived probes, the magnitudes of increase ranged from  <dig> -fold to  <dig> -fold. interestingly, the 5'-most probe measured the smallest fold-change but had the largest mean signal intensity, with the converse for the 3'-most probe. these differences may reflect differential rates of rna processing along the transcript or sequence relationships to other cross-hybridizing molecules .

concordance of song  <dig> k and lund-zfa arrays
comparing microarray analyses between different platforms and labs is a difficult task and the results have to be interpreted cautiously. these problems include not only differences in array design and fabrication but also differences in sampling handling  <cit>  and differences in the approaches to analyse data from cdna and short-oligo affymetrix arrays. although we acknowledge these problems and the fact that quantitative comparisons are very difficult, we still believe that it is useful to qualitatively compare our two zebra finch array platforms. to the degree the platforms give fundamentally similar results, they validate each other. to compare the song  <dig> k array and the lund-zfa array, a set of  <dig> samples  were hybridized to both array types.

on the song  <dig> k array, between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the spots on each array  were detectable above local background by the genepix software, indicating that almost all of the cdnas on the array are expressed in each of the male and female adult brains . on the lund-zfa array, when we used a global background calculated from the cells with the 2% lowest signals +  <dig> sd we found that  <dig> % –  <dig> % of the probes were detectable above background . since each est on an affymetrix array is represented by  <dig> probes and only  <dig> probes need to be detectable for significance, virtually all of the ests on the arrays will be detected. hence, both platforms are similar in this rough measure of sensitivity and both detect almost all the transcripts in male and female adult brains.

to compare detection of differentially expressed rnas, we focused only on those singletons/contigs that could be mapped in a 1: <dig> relationship across the two platforms, i.e., represented by one clone on the song  <dig> k array and one probe set on the lund-zfa array. this resulted in  <dig>  comparable gene targets  on each array type . at a false discovery rate  of  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were significantly different between males and females on the song  <dig> k array, versus  <dig> genes on the lund-zfa array. note that the quantitative differences between the two significant lists are not directly comparable due to differences in sample handling and array analyses. however, despite this the lists shared  <dig> genes in common, such that most of the expression differences found on the lund-zfa arrays were also found on the song  <dig> k array . hence, the fact that so many of the sexually dimorphic genes were identified by both array types shows that the results from the two platforms are in concordance. presentation and analysis of sex-regulated genes per se is the subject of a separate investigation  to be reported elsewhere.

moreover, we also compared the estimated log2-fold changes for all genes on both array types . the overall pearson correlation coefficient is  <dig> ; while this may not seem very high, the separate analyses of each array type indicate that > 95% of the genes likely have zero fold-change plus random measurement error, so they are not expected to be correlated  <cit> . the correlation coefficient between genes with significant expression differences on both arrays is  <dig> . this clearly shows that both platforms to a large degree identify the same biological variation.

we conducted a principle components analysis of all  <dig> sets of array values  after scaling the pre-processed expression values to the overall mean for each gene . interestingly, the first principle component , which explains  <dig>  % of the variation, separates the arrays by sex. this shows that the effect of sex is much more important than any variation between platforms that is measured by the other principal components, and that both array platforms are efficient in picking up the biological variation between the samples. the array difference shows up in pc <dig>  & pc <dig> , while the sample pairs do not segregate together until pc <dig> & pc <dig> . the larger between-sample variation in pc <dig>  for the lund-zfa array compared to the song  <dig> k array may reflect technical and analytical differences between the hybridizations on the two platforms , and does not necessarily indicate an intrinsic difference in the quality of the two arrays.

comparative genomic hybridization assessment
a major goal of the song initiative is to facilitate application of genomic analysis to the broad range of songbird species now used in research. to assess the efficacy of our  <dig> k zebra finch array for measuring gene expression in other songbirds, we performed a set of comparative genomic hybridizations , where instead of reacting the arrays with labeled tissue mrna , we hybridized with labeled genomic dna from each of the species. in this way, any differences in signal intensity can be attributed directly to sequence differences between the species, not confounded by differences in gene expression. in general, avian species have a substantially lower repeat density than do mammals, simplifying the analysis of genomic dna hybridizations  <cit> .

for cgh analysis, we obtained dna from four other species representative of those proposed for study by the song initiative collaborators . white-crowned sparrows and song sparrows are common subjects for field research in north america; the canary is a domesticated species typically studied in the laboratory. like the zebra finch, all are members of the superfamily passeroidea. the european starling is studied both in the wild and in captivity. as a member of a different superfamily , the starling is somewhat more distant from the zebra finch. for comparison we also obtained dna from two even more distantly related birds, the kingbird and the chicken. the kingbird is a suboscine; like songbirds, suboscines are also members of order passeriformes, but suboscines have no apparent vocal learning ability and are estimated to have diverged from oscines  about  <dig> mya  <cit> . we also obtained dna from chickens, a member of a different order of birds that diverged from passeriformes approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . each species was represented by four separate individuals,  <dig> males and  <dig> females. each sample from an individual bird was hybridized on a separate array along with a universal reference sample of genomic dna pooled from  <dig> zebra finches  labeled with cy <dig>  the individual samples were labeled with cy <dig> and the universal reference with cy <dig> . the resulting data were then expressed as the log ratios of the signal in the two dye channels for each spot on the arrays. a log ratio of zero indicates equal signal from the test species and the reference genomic dnas.

a clear effect of phylogenetic distance is evident in the cross hybridizations to the zebra finch array using dna from the kingbird  and the chicken , as shown by histogram analysis log ratios for all the spots on the arrays . histograms from hybridizations using genomic dnas from the other oscine species  were essentially indistinguishable from the zebra finch histogram when all spots on the array were included. however, statistical analysis detected a small subset of spots with significantly different hybridization signals in the other oscines relative to the zebra finch. histograms focusing on the  <dig> genes showing the greatest effect of species are presented in fig. 3b. with the three other passeroidea , the histogram peak height is reduced somewhat  and a scattering of genes appears with log ratios of 1– <dig> . with the somewhat more distant starling the number of genes with reduced signals is slightly larger, and the number larger still with the kingbird dna. with the chicken dna, the central peak  is abolished altogether and the curve for these  <dig> genes is now shifted by approximately  <dig> logs to the right. hierarchical clustering of the cgh array data is also consistent with the general phylogenetic relationships of the species under comparison .

interestingly, we also noted cases where particular spots on the zebra finch array gave strongest signals against the genomic dna of species other than the zebra finch . an example is shown in detail in fig 3d. note the sharp drop in signal intensity against all species other than zebra finch except for the starling, where a sharp increase in hybridization signal is detected. we speculate that cases like this may represent species differences in gene copy number.

the community collaborations
the production of the song  <dig> k array resulted in enough pcr product to print at least  <dig> microarrays. to engage the broad songbird research community in this research while maintaining consistent technical standards, we devised the following plan. in  <dig> we circulated a broad invitation for investigators to apply for use of some of the resulting dna microarrays. we offered to perform the rna extractions and hybridizations centrally by a single skilled investigator , at no cost to the applicant beyond the cost of producing the tissue. each initiating investigator would have control over initial publication of resulting data, but all data would eventually be available for use in a planned meta-analysis. the call for applications is provided here as additional file  <dig>  in response,  <dig> research groups proposed a set of  <dig> experiments representing a range of research questions and foci . in march  <dig>  these proposals were reviewed by the central steering committee for the song initiative  <cit> , with feedback offered as appropriate to the initiating investigators. systematic execution of these experiments began soon thereafter and should be completed by the end of  <dig> 

experiments  were nominated by investigators in the community following specific guidelines . investigator groups are indicated by locale and a "group" letter code ; asterisk indicates investigators outside of the core group responsible for program development. experiments were classified according to the primary contrast  defined by the experimental design, with these general contrasts as indicated by number in the table:  <dig>  comparative;  <dig>  brain sex;  <dig>  critical period;  <dig>  activational;  <dig>  environmental. cgh: comparative genomic hybridizations validating zebra finch array use against the  <dig> other species proposed for study across all experiments.

discussion
using a pipeline for high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics, we generated ~ <dig>  reads of sequences expressed in the zebra finch brain. we incorporated these and  <dig>  more reads from other projects in the community into a single master database available to the public via the internet  <cit> . our approach has been iterative, progressing through three sequential builds each one incorporating additional data. we used our evolving sequence assemblies in the design of two different microarrays for gene expression studies and we have deployed these resources in a large set of collaborations that should continue to bear fruit in the future.

the  <dig>  filtered high-quality sequences in the current  build of estima:songbird describe approximately  <dig>  non-redundant transcript segments. although this is a dramatic increase in the number of sequence information available , this collection is still only a partial representation of the sequence diversity in zebra finch brain. most of the sequences are represented by only a single read and even after three library subtractions, one of every three new sequences generated was still novel. an early analysis of rna complexity in the canary forebrain suggested a population of as many as  <dig>  different transcripts, with total nucleotide diversity approaching the size of the genome itself  <cit> . this complexity seemed implausible when that analysis was first done, but recent studies in species from flies  <cit>  to humans  <cit>  have now demonstrated that transcription is much more widespread in the genome than previously anticipated.

some of the  <dig>  non-redundant sequences undoubtedly represent discontinuous portions of common transcripts, including alternative splicing products as well as non-overlapping ests. indeed, using the chicken ipi annotation, we detected significant matches for  <dig>  sequences but only  <dig>  of these ipi identifiers were unique. presumably this indicates that a substantial fraction of the  <dig>  "unique" sequences in the sb <dig> assembly are in fact derived from a smaller set of genes; by extrapolation this suggests an upper bound of  <dig>   unique transcription units represented by the sb <dig> assembly. hence we have no reason at this juncture to expect the complement of protein coding genes is any larger for the zebra finch than it is for the chicken, i.e.,  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> .

approximately 23% of estima:songbird  <dig> sequences do not align significantly against the current build of the chicken genome . some of these could represent orthologs of sequences that are present in the chicken genome but not yet incorporated into the chicken genome build. the current chicken genome assembly is believed to lack approximately 8% of the genes in the full genome complement, including sequences on the female-specific w chromosome in particular. our cdna libraries were prepared from a mix of both sexes.

as is true for all gene indices, annotation of function is a major ongoing challenge. very few genes in songbirds have received any sort of direct experimental analysis thus we must rely on inferences based on similarities to sequences in other species. the closest species with significant genome annotation is the chicken. however, annotation of the chicken genome itself has relied heavily on putative orthologies to mammalian sequences. during our three sequential builds we probed a number of databases to assess their utility for generating putative functional annotations according to sequence similarities. as of build  <dig>  we focused on the chicken international protein index as a primary annotation reference. this is a relatively conservative reference and reflects alignments only with known or predicted protein coding sequences. only 42% of our build  <dig> assembled sequences align against the ipi index, and these represent only a third of the total number of sequence identifiers in the complete chicken ipi index. we anticipate that many of the currently unannotated build  <dig> sequences probably represent non-coding segments of ipi-annotated genes. identification of these relationships should follow from the annotation of the zebra finch genome assembly, expected in  <dig> 

our database probably also contains some non-coding rnas  <cit> . a preliminary blast analysis of the  <dig>  ests in our current database against mirbase  <cit> , a compendium of ~ <dig> known microrna sequences, revealed significant alignments for  <dig> zebra finch ests against  <dig> mature microrna sequences . additional work will be required to establish whether these sequences are indeed processed into mature micrornas in the zebra finch.

to stimulate broad application of genomic approaches to songbird research, we generated a cdna microarray from our first est build and organized a community collaboration system for design and execution of experiments using this array. part of our group also developed an affymetrix oligonucleotide array based on our second est build  <cit> . to validate these tools and to refine the general methods for the community collaborations we did several analyses. these analyses included assessment of optimal methods for rna purification, ma plots of hybridization data, amplification and labeling from dissected brain samples; and methods for microarray statistical analysis. some of these studies are summarized in our call for community collaborations . validation of the affymetrix array has been done by the group at lund university and is not included in this publication. in our main report here, we described several analyses that may have more general implications for transcriptome analysis in songbirds.

the song  <dig> k cdna microarray includes  <dig> different probes for transcripts derived from the zenk gene, including one from the canary sequence. all probes gave signals well above background with labeled cdna from the dissected auditory lobules of individual birds hearing either song or silence, and all reported an increase in signal in the song-stimulated birds relative to the silence controls. comparing the near-full positive control probes from zebra finch and canary, both gave equivalent signal intensities and fold-change measurements. in the direct-comparison design used for this experiment, a group size of  <dig> birds per condition hybridized on  <dig> arrays was sufficient to reach fairly robust statistical significance for three of the single-spotted probes. the fourth  would not have passed the threshold for identification using even generous criteria . this est reported a mean intensity that was almost three-fold higher than for the zebra finch and canary positive control probes. we suspect this may indicate cross-hybridization to some other sequences for this particular probe. alternatively, the variations in mean intensities and fold-changes for the five different probes could indicate differential transcription or rna processing across the transcript, phenomena that are increasingly observed in high-resolution analyses of transcription units  <cit> . it is also worth noting that in this preliminary experiment we detected changes in  <dig> other probes at the significance threshold of the single-spotted zebra finch cdna postive control . analysis of song-regulated sequences is a topic of several of the proposed community collaborations and will be described in detail elsewhere.

with the production of the lund-zfa array after estima build  <dig>  <cit> , we were able to compare hybridization results using the same tissue samples on the two array platforms. almost all of the transcripts represented on each platform were detected in adult male and female brains, and there was a general concordance between the platforms on the estimated log2-fold changes for the transcripts they had in common. while the exact "significant" gene lists varied slightly, much of this difference is probably due to differences in sample treatment and analyses between the two array types, which determine the probability of detecting differences. for, example, the song- <dig> k arrays used a common reference design which helps to normalize differences between arrays, whereas the individual samples had additional shipping and handling before being hybridized to the lund-zfa arrays, which could have added to their variability. despite the differences between the platforms, a principle components analysis  shows that the biological differences between males and females dominate over any technical differences between the arrays. in sum, both array platforms describe a similar overall picture of differential gene expression and should be useful for further studies.

when we surveyed the songbird research community for interest in using the  <dig> k array, we recognized that there was considerable interest in experiments involving species other than the zebra finch . we initiated comparative genomic hybridizations at this point primarily to evaluate the feasibility of cross-hybridizations with other species. the use of single-species microarrays for species cross-hybridizations is a controversial point in the literature . direct comparison of gene expression in different species on a single-species array is especially problematic, as variations in gene copy number, sequence divergence and rna expression levels are all confounded. however, for most of the experiments initially proposed for community collaborations, the goals were to analyze particular phenomena within a single species, focusing on phenomena that are not well represented in the zebra finch . we believe that our cross hybridization studies clearly validate our  <dig> k cdna microarray for within-species comparisons of other oscine songbirds , with the caveat that some minority of the probes will give reduced signals compared to hybridizations with zebra finch material. one must also interpret any annotations with particular care, and cross-hybridization results based on particular zebra finch array probes may need to be verified independently, e.g., by resequencing in the target species and rt-pcr to confirm regulation.

the lund-zfa array was developed with our second build of estima:songbird , and it was specifically designed with the intent of supporting research in other songbird species. quantitative analysis of cgh to dna from the common whitethroat  supports the efficacy of cross-hybridization as 96% of the ests are called as present  <cit> . taking these studies together with our own, zebra finch probes have now been shown to be adequate for detecting signals in the all three major superfamilies of the passerida parvorder of the oscines   <cit> . however, our data for the kingbird  suggest that use of zebra finch arrays for analysis of sub-oscines  may be more problematic. direct empirical tests are needed to establish viability for use with corvid species, oscines that diverged from the passerida ~ <dig> mya.

CONCLUSIONS
with an inclusive and integrative approach, the songbird neurogenomics initiative has established a rigorous foundation for application of genomic technology by the community of researchers focused on songbirds. already our estima:songbird database has been used in the study of gene dosage compensation in birds vs. mammals  <cit> , sex chromosome evolution  <cit> , regulation of brain caspase- <dig> activity in experience-dependent plasticity  <cit> , development of markers for study of population genetics in zebra finches  <cit> , and identification of sequences subject to positive selection in birds . with the third build of the estima:songbird database now complete, we anticipate future improvements in transcriptome annotation will soon come from other new approaches including whole genome tiling arrays and massively parallel sequencing  <cit> . in the meantime, the collection of microarray experiments organized here  will generate a broad profile of gene expression in the songbird brain across multiple dimensions of species, sex, neuroanatomy, developmental age, physiological state and behavioral context. the active engagement of a broad research community was instrumental in the selection of the zebra finch as the second avian species for whole genome sequencing, after the chicken  <cit> . continuing community participation will be crucial in applying these emerging resources to the expanse of fundamental research questions posed by songbirds.
