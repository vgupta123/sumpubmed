BACKGROUND
fhit is a tumour suppressor gene that is frequently inactivated by deletions in several human tumours, as it overlaps perhaps the most active of common fragile sites fra3b, at hsa3p <dig>  . infact, fhit is highly responsive to environmental carcinogens, to treatment with aphidicolin – which specifically activates common fragile sites -, and is involved in the development of breast, lung, cervix, stomach, pancreas, head and neck, and kidney tumours, as well as of urothelial tumours, mainly bladder tumours  <cit> . the fhit protein is absent or reduced in most cancers, although transcription of the gene is not necessarily altered, as in many malignancies only one allele is lost  <cit> . the human fhit is huge, spanning about  <dig>  mb at the fra3b locus. however, it codes for a protein of just  <dig> amino acids, derived by translation of  <dig> tiny exons of which only exons  <dig> to  <dig> contain the orf; the transcript is very small too,  <dig>  kb  <cit> .

fragility at fra3b and the consequent inactivation of fhit are interesting also because of the presence of an integration site for human papilloma virus mapped to intron  <dig>  <cit> .

we are investigating fhit in cattle because tumours of the urinary tract in this species are a good model for human carcinogenesis, and because of the suggested involvement of papillomavirus in tumorigenesis  <cit> . urinary bladder tumours are a common pathology of 4- to 12-year-old cattle and there is a strong pathogenetic relationship between bpv- <dig> and some carcinogenic principles of bracken fern  <cit> . prolonged ingestion of toxic compounds released by bracken fern, such as ptaquiloside, is responsible for an initial cell transformation of urothelial cells via ras activation; it is believed that papillomavirus infection is associated with tumour progression, whose major clinical symptom is the so called chronic enzootic hematuria . it is likely that fhit also plays a role in the process  <cit> , and it is an obvious candidate for deletions affecting the locus that should represent the bovine homologue of fra3b.

in a recent study we isolated an exon tag for bovine fhit which allowed us to map the gene by fish to bta22q <dig> and with radiation hybrids to the telomeric region of bta <dig>  <cit> . here we used a comparative genomic approach with human fhit to completely annotate the bovine gene. thus, we describe a  <dig> mb  <dig> bac contig covering the gene, and present evidence for a very high level of sequence conservation and genomic organization over the whole fhit region between the two species. finally, we isolated and sequenced four fhit cdna isoforms, and documented the physiological expression profiles by means of rt-pcr and northern blot analysis.

this information will be the starting point to study the role of fhit in papillomavirus-associated tumours of bovine urinary bladder, and more in general will help to interpret the implication of fhit in animal carcinogenesis, including the recently hypothesized role in apoptosis of a phosphorylated form of the fhit protein  <cit> .

RESULTS
assembly of a bac contig covering fhit
short sequence tags derived from the fhit human genomic sequence or taken from the trace archive of the bovine genome sequencing project, were used to isolate by pcr clones from an ordered bac library  <cit> . exon tags were first employed but given the anticipated large size of the genomic region to be covered , intronic stss were also used. the stss that did not amplify comparatively were adapted to the bovine thanks to the homology to non annotated sequence entries available in the bovine genome database  and bovine genome sequencing trace archive. the whole primer's set is shown in table  <dig> . as many fhit exons are very short, primers were often designed covering the exon-intron boundaries or spanning the exon from within adjacent introns. in most instances the approach was successful, and unexpectedly also intronic tags positioned very far from exons worked in pcr, supporting once more the high degree of sequence conservation between human and cattle.

by sequential screens of the bac library with selected primers, a total of  <dig> bac clones was retrieved, belonging to three subcontigs. the software finger printed contigs  was used as explained in methods to produce the most likely arrangement of the bacs tiling in a single contig. its structure, shown in figure , was subjected to experimental validation using two approaches, 1) amplification of sts tags on the individual bacs, and, 2) alignment of available sequence from the bac clones  to contigs of sequence retrieved from the bovine genome database.

the tiling pattern of bacs in the contig as suggested by fpc was consistent with the pcr mapping data for all the exon and intron tags, except for a group of  <dig> bacs, labeled with an asterisk in figure . the inclusion of those bacs in the fhit contig was likely an fpc artefact; indeed, the programme selects the best tiling of a set of clones following a merely statistical evaluation of the similarity in their restriction fingerprints. in our case, however, three lines of evidence allowed to resolve the ambiguity. first, sts-content mapping revealed that none of the  <dig> bacs contained the expected tags based on the proposed fpc output . second, bacs bi0643h <dig> and bi0947b <dig>  boxed in figure , could be directly linked in the contig, as they were both positive to the intron 8– <dig> tag. third, the sequence of the bac-ends, available for clones bi0195d <dig>  bi0520a <dig>  and bi0545b <dig>  was blasted to the bovine genome database and identified a contig assigned to bta <dig> , which is extraneous to the fhit bovine locus, previously mapped to bta <dig>  <cit> .

in conclusion, the bac contig covers a region of about  <dig> mb spanning the entire fhit locus. the bovine gene is split into  <dig> exons like the human, separated by introns that appear also similar in size. the only exception to this highly conserved pattern is exon  <dig> , which is completely different with respect to sequence and position in the two species. as shown in figure , bovine exon  <dig> is placed between two intron  <dig> tags , while the human's exon  <dig> position is between i2– <dig> and i3– <dig> tags. another difference in the organization of the bovine gene is the presence of two alternative exons  <dig>  that have no homology in the human fhit. more details on transcripts and alternative splicing are given in a later section.

vista global alignments
to study further the degree of conservation at the fhit locus between the bovine and the human, all the available contigs covering the region were recovered from the bovine genome database  using representative tags from the bac clones of the fhit contig previously described. seven large contigs were retrieved:  , containing exon 1;  , containing exon  <dig> to i2– <dig> tag;  , containing i2– <dig> to i3– <dig> tag;  , containing i3– <dig> to i5–2c tag;  , containing i5– <dig> tag;  , containing i5–2d to i5– <dig> tag;  , containing exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  the contigs were submitted to the mvista server along with the human fhit sequence  in order to analyse the conservation at the locus. however, as most of the bovine contigs represent largely unfinished raw sequence, e.g.  contained two large stretches  of unassigned base calls, all n runs longer than  <dig> kb were removed before submitting the contig files to the mvista server. in addition, as there is a maximum limit of  <dig> mb for the base sequence to be used as reference, the human fhit genomic sequence from hsa <dig> contig  was cut between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig>  the fhit gene coordinates are nt  <dig> to  <dig> 

the graphical output of the mvista server analysis is shown in figure  <dig>  the bovine contigs are labeled  <dig> to  <dig> according to their expected position with respect to the human reference sequence. the conservation of sequence with the human reference sequence was substantially high, in agreement with the data obtained through the sts mapping of the bac contig described previously. in addition, as the contribution of exons to the whole alignment is negligible , the vista output clearly suggested that non coding sequence was not only conserved , but also arranged very similarly between the two species. thus, the tiling of bovine contigs followed the expected order and did not suggest the existence of rearrangements at the locus between human and bovine, with possibly one exception, represented by contig  that required special attention. indeed, the original contig sequence could be aligned only after, 1) removing two large stretches of  <dig> and  <dig> kb of ns  from the sequence and, 2) aligning the 5'  <dig> kb of the modified contig  independently from the remaining 84– <dig> kb portion , which had also to be reverse-complemented to successfully align. as shown in figure  <dig>  nw_930116_b was proximal to nw_930116_a, and contig  was placed in between them, with a  <dig> bp overlap at the 5' end with nw_930116_b and a  <dig> kb overlap at the 3' end with nw_930116_a. this ordering was also in agreement with the tiling of bacs in the contig of figure , and with the pcr mapping of exons and introns tags. an explanation for the apparent rearranged structure of the original contig  is that it was formed by merging two sub-contigs  in the wrong order during the assembly of the whole bovine genome sequence. in this respect, the vista alignment clearly suggested that contig  might represent a missing portion in the real arrangement of the correct  contig. our interpretation of the arrangement of the seven retrieved genomic contigs is consistent with experimental data, but shall find a final confirmation only when the complete annotation of the bovine genome will be available.

the exon/intron structure of the bovine fhit gene is summarized in table  <dig> . the gene coordinates were identified using the seven genomic contigs retrieved from genbank  as reference sequence. the size of the introns could not be defined exactly in all cases, as most contigs still contain large blocks of unfinished sequence; however the predicted size of introns  <dig> and  <dig>  based on this work, is very close to that of the human gene. this is noticeable, especially for intron  <dig>  that is over  <dig> kb, and is known to be the major target of deletions that affect the gene structure in human cancers. it is tempting to speculate that fhit intron  <dig> might have a similar role also in tumours affecting cattle.

fhit cdna isolation and analysis of expression
in a previous report, we mapped the fhit gene by fish and radiation hybrids using a bovine est that matched human exon  <dig>  <cit> . here we designed primers on the human fhit cdna to cross-amplify the bovine cdna by means of rt-pcr. thus, oligonucleotides exon 1f and exon 10r , were used to amplify nearly the entire cdna , on rna extracted from brain, spleen, kidney, liver, lung and testis. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, fhit is transcribed ubiquitously, and pcr products were obtained in all tissues, although of different sizes. thus, four bands were visible within the entire set of samples, and were recovered from the gel and sequenced. a band of  <dig> bp was present in all tissues except kidney, that showed a band of  <dig> bp. a third product of  <dig> bp was found in brain, spleen, and kidney, but not in lung and liver, and a fourth product of  <dig> bp was detected in testis. the existence of four different cdna isoforms is due to an alternative splicing of exons that belong to the 5' untranslated portion of the gene. this was confirmed by sequencing the isoforms of figure  <dig> and performing additional rt-pcrs with selected combinations of exon-primers on the same panel of tissues, with the addition of bladder. the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  with a schematic representation of the exons arrangement and size of the different isoforms. all the isoforms contain the entire coding portion of the fhit mrna, so they translate into the same polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids coded by exons  <dig> to  <dig>  the difference in the rt-pcr products for kidney, spleen and brain  is due to the alternative use of exon 4b , yielding a longer cdna of  <dig> bp and a shorter of  <dig> bp; the  endometrium cdna is a bovine non annotated cdna entry taken from genbank that has the same structure of the longer cdna isoform described in the present study for brain, spleen and kidney . testis shows a different exon  <dig> variant, 4a , thus the cdna in that tissue is  <dig> bp long. a fourth cdna exists and is the shortest of all: it is the only one with exon  <dig> , but is missing exon  <dig>  so its whole length is  <dig> bp. this cdna is one of the two isoforms detected in the kidney.

for a comparative analysis, human cdna entries were also retrieved from genbank. as in the bovine, an alternative use of exons is apparent in the case of the human fhit, as shown in the lower portion of figure  <dig>  three isoforms are shown that are characterized by alternative splicing of three exons  <dig> variants, respectively of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp, none of which has any homology with the bovine alternative exons  <dig> 

northern blot analysis
the expression of fhit was also monitored by northern blot analysis with a labeled cdna probe in the tissues used in rt-pcr , and, additionaly, in heart and muscle . in all samples a major transcript of about  <dig> – <dig>  kb was visible, a size very close to the known human fhit mrna,  <dig> bp . as already with rt-pcr, fhit was ubiquitously expressed, with apparently higher levels of mrna in testicular tissue and spleen. however, although equal amounts of polya mrna were used, the evidence coming from the northern blot is only qualitative and cannot be taken as suggestive of variable expression levels between the investigated tissues.

the resolution of the gel used for the northern blot did not allow to clearly distinguish the mrna isoforms as in the rt-pcrs of figure  <dig>  heart and muscle showed a band of slightly higher molecular weight, but since these tissues were not studied by rt-pcr, it is likely that the major band visible in the northern blot was a mixture of the cdna isoforms described before. only in testis and kidney the probe revealed two additional bands of lower molecular weight,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. as these mrna species were not detected with the rt-pcr assay, it is difficult to establish if they were real or rather represented a partial degradation of the fhit mrna of  <dig> – <dig>  kb, prior to electrophoresis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we used a comparative genomic approach to fully annotate the bovine fhit gene. a set of  <dig> bacs was assembled in to a genomic contig that covers  <dig> mb of dna. the bovine fhit turned out to have the same arrangement as in man, and an extraordinary conservation of sequence was found throughout all the locus, in such a way that not only the number, but also the size of introns was virtually identical between the two species. the size of the bovine gene could be inferred from the alignment of the bac contig tags with the  <dig> genomic contigs recovered from genbank , and was around  <dig>  mb from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  our data allowed to extend the well known finding of a high degree of synteny between the human and bovine genome down to the level of a single gene, including, at least for fhit, the size and nucleotide sequence of introns as large as  <dig> kb, like intron  <dig> 

our data contribute to the ongoing bovine genome sequencing project with the annotation of a rather large genomic region. the comparative approach that we used allowed us to highlight inconsistencies and errors in the assembly of bovine genomic contigs spanning the fhit gene region. studies of this kind will be important to speed up and assist the laborious work of finishing the assembly of the whole bovine genome sequence.

fhit is a very important oncosuppressor gene that lays in the middle of the major common fragile sites of the human genome, fra3b. the role of the fra3b/fhit locus in the onset and development of a vast category of important cancers in man has been largely documented. a typical feature of fhit involvement is that rearrangement at the locus gives rise to a complex set of homo- and hemizigous deletions that affect gene function  <cit> . among all the tumours showing a loss of fhit activity, are tumours of the lower urinary tract, especially bladder tumours, one of the most frequent cancers in man. the same situation is likely to exist in cattle tumours, and our complete annotation of the bovine fhit gene will allow to characterize the role of the gene in urothelial tumors, especially of the lower urinary tract. these are a common pathology of 4- to 12-year-old animals grazing in bracken fern  infested lands  <cit>  and showing chronic enzootic hematuria  <cit> .

using the set of bacs covering the entire bovine fhit region that we describe in the present work, it will be possible to scan tumour samples in search of markers that are lost due to chromosomal breakage, a finding that would confirm the existence of the bovine homologue of the human fragile site fra3b.

knowledge of the molecular genomic organization of the fhit locus as gathered from our work will be exploited also to study a peculiar feature of the urinary bladder tumors of cattle. frequently, such tumors are positive to bovine papilloma virus type- <dig> , and an intriguing synergy has been suggested between the virus and some clastogenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds released by the bracken fern ingested by animals at pasture. the hypothesis has been made that compounds such as ptaquiloside act synergistically with bpv- <dig> either in a latent or activated form to produce the neoplastic transformation of cells with a mechanism that remains largely unknown. thanks to the detailed fhit mapping and annotation achieved in this work, insights into the relation between the presence and activation state of bpv and tumors might come from the study of integration of bpv at the fhit locus. as a matter of fact, we have found a short dna region in the bovine fhit intron  <dig>  that is homologous to a known integration site of human papillomavirus type  <dig> at fra3b/fhit in man   <cit> .
