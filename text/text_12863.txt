BACKGROUND
xenobiotic biotransformation has been classified into  <dig> phases. the majority of phase i biotransformation was implemented by cytochrome p <dig>  family with  <dig> major isotypes in human <cit> . each isotype has overlapped spectra of substrates and catalyzes multiple reactions. activations or suppressions of certain isotypes as a result of precipitant drugs have been associated with several clinically important drug interactions <cit> . the phase ii biotransformation involved several conjugation reactions . these conjugations attach new functional groups to the xenobiotic that had gone through phase i metabolism <cit> . the cyp <dig> isotypes in rodents are often different in gene regulation and enzymatic activity from those in human and thus cannot reliably predict the toxicity or metabolic profiles of xenobiotics in human <cit> .

the idealistic cell culture model to simulate in vivo biotransformation of xenobiotics is the use of primary human hepatocytes. however, the acquisition of normal human hepatocytes is cumbersome with ethical as well as biological considerations. the cultured cells are short lived and have to be swiftly prepared from fresh tissues <cit>  making them unfeasible for most studies. alternative sources of human cells have been developed to mimic the phenotypes of hepatocytes. a viable source is the mesenchymal stem cells  derived from bone marrow <cit> .

the very first effort to generate hepatocyte-like cells was taken through the co-culture of mscs with isolated liver cells <cit> . subsequent efforts employed fetal liver-conditioned medium <cit> , selective cytokines and coating matrix <cit> . alternate cell sources such as adipose tissue <cit> , amniotic fluid <cit>  and wharton's jelly <cit>  were employed. the major proposed application of these hepatocyte-like cells is to implement liver regeneration <cit> . the xenogeneic transplants of human hepatocyte-like cells into mice after ccl4-induced liver injury have been attempted with moderate success <cit> . several groups had characterized the phenotypes  in contemporary hepatocyte-like cells <cit> , but none has made the long-term characterization to demonstrate their stability. the long-term stability of the cells is required for the application of xenobiotic testing in new drug development.

the life span of hepatocyte-like cells from these diverse sources after differentiation induction was generally limited. immortalizing hepatocyte-like cells or their precursors  would be a more feasible solution, resulting in a sustainable and consistent source of hepatocytes. the polycomb group transcription factor bmi- <dig> <cit>  that could drive cancer cell proliferation <cit>  and normal stem cell self-renewal was selected for immortalization. the validity for using these immortalized cells for cell culture metabolic study relies on the maintenance of hepatocyte phenotypes as represented by a panel of specific markers. hepatocyte-like cells from various msc sources exhibited different intensities of hepatocyte specific markers <cit> . we immortalized the msc as a precursor for hepatocyte-like cells by using both human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene  and bmi- <dig> through lentiviral transduction <cit> , and examined whether the resulting immortalized cells after differentiation induction could maintain hepatocyte phenotypes and metabolic functions.

RESULTS
the identification of mscs
cells isolated from bone marrow aspirate displayed a spindle shape upon reaching confluence . the htert/bmi-1-transduced msc  still maintained fibroblast-like, spindle morphology at 40th passage  with an exponential growth pattern . the identity of the studied mscs was confirmed by the presence of mesenchymal stem cell markers . mscs that had gone through immortalization still contained similar levels of cd <dig> and cd <dig> , but was virtually devoid of hematopoietic markers  as determined by a flow cytometer.

proliferative activity of transformed mscs
the growth rate of mscs was slow at the first passage, picked up and steadily increased in subsequent  passages. in later  passages, growth rate was again slowed down to a complete stop . to bypass the replication senescence, we transformed mscs with either htert plus bmi- <dig>  or htert alone  from  <dig> independent donors. after  <dig> days or 20- <dig> population doubling level , the proliferation rate of untreated mscs decreased to a final stop. the cellular morphology switched to epithelial-like, indicating the reduction of stem cell properties. in contrast, bmi/htert-msc grew steadily for more than  <dig> months  and exhibited unaltered morphology . in contrast, htert-mscs, similar to untreated mscs, could not bypass replication senescence. bmi/htert-msc cells have been maintained for over a year, confirming their immortalization. to ensure that both bmi- <dig> and htert were expressed in these transformed mscs, specific primers were designed to separately quantify endogenous and exogenous expression of both bmi- <dig> and htert using quantitative rt-pcr. the endogenous expressions of htert and hbmi- <dig> in untreated mscs at the 4th passage were lower than those in transformed mscs at the same passage. the ectopic expressions of both htert and bmi- <dig> were detected at a steadily high level for over a year . the morphology was also stable throughout the study. our success rate for immortalization of msc was  <dig> clones out of  <dig> clones from each donor.

the differentiation of mscs to hepatocyte-like cells
after finishing hepatic induction, the hepatocyte-like cells carried the expansion of several basic hepatocyte genes  with a corresponding polygonal morphology . immortalized hepatocyte-like cells at the first passage were loosely attached to adjacent cells . up to 70-80% of the hepatocyte-like cells deposited glycogen, especially in densely populated area . after switching to 10% fbs, dmem/f <dig> the intercellular attachment was denser with blurring of cell boundary . at confluence, duct-like structure was observed . the cells could maintain cell division beyond  <dig> months  with sustainable hepatocyte function suitable for drug screening.

expression levels of hepatocyte-specific markers
up to 88% of hepatocyte-like cells  and immortalized hepatocyte-like cells , as opposed to 5% of mscs, contained intracellular albumin. almost 95% of hepg <dig> cells contained albumin . in subsequent passages, hepatocyte-like cells maintained at least 70% of albumin-containing cells . the functional activity of hepatocyte-like cells at different passages was investigated using urea assay . the conditioned medium of hepatocyte-like cells contained far higher level of urea than that of mscs, but was comparable to that of hepg <dig>  using mrna levels inherent to mscs as a reference, the relative expression levels of the corresponding genes in the hepatocyte-like cells, hepg <dig> cells and the primary human hepatocytes were determined using quantitative real-time pcr. the basal expression patterns for hepatocyte-specific genes at passage 5- <dig>  were varied, depending on the stage of hepatocyte maturation. the afp expression that is usually presented in hepatic progenitors was detected at higher level than those of the primary human hepatocytes and hepg <dig> cells . the observation of cytokeratin <dig> expression confirmed the differentiation of mscs into endodermal tissue. three major hepatocyte genes were up-regulated in hepatocyte-like cells, namely glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , hnf-4α  and tyrosine aminotransferase . the observation of all hepatocyte specific genes confirmed that the transformed mscs could actually differentiate into functional hepatocyte-like cells.

the basal expression of phase i and phase ii enzymes in hepatocyte-like cell
after maturation induction, hepatocyte-like cell culture was continued in imdm with 1% fbs, 2% dmso for  <dig> weeks at confluence  <cit> . cells were harvested and determined for phase i and phase ii enzyme expressions . specific transcription factors such as ahr, pxr and car in hepatocyte-like cells were increased by about  <dig> times those of mscs. these genes are involved in the transcription of cyp <dig> isotypes  <cit> . genes that were highly expressed in hepatocyte-like cells included one phase ii enzyme ugt1a <dig> and  <dig> cyp <dig> isotypes . in particular, the expression level of cyp2b <dig> in hepatocyte-like cells was even higher than that of hepg <dig> while other isotypes achieved comparable expression levels to those of hepg <dig>  however, all cyp <dig> isotype expressions in hepatocyte-like cells were only 10-20% that of normal hepatocytes. the authenticity of the real-time rt-pcr products of hepatocyte markers and cyp <dig> were confirmed through the analysis for melting curve using sequence detection software version  <dig>  .

enhancing phase i enzyme expression using prototypic inducers
the expressions of cyp1a <dig>  cyp2b <dig>  cyp2d <dig> and cyp2c <dig> in hepatocyte-like cells were significantly increased to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> folds respectively after the induction with dexamethasone or rifampicin . cyp3a <dig> and cyp2c <dig> expressions were extensively up regulated by  <dig> and  <dig> folds, respectively in hepatocyte-like cells. in hepg <dig>  the expressions of cyp2b <dig>  cyp2c <dig> and cyp3a <dig> were increased to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> folds using rifampicin. in the primary hepatocyte, the expression of cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  cyp2b <dig> were raised to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> folds that were comparable to those of the hepatocyte-like cells. the induction of cyp3a <dig> expression in the hepatocyte-like cells  outpaced that of the primary hepatocyte . the expressions of most cyp <dig> isotypes in undifferentiated mscs were induced by merely 2- <dig> folds.

hmsc, hepg <dig>  primary hepatocyte and hepatocyte-like cell were induced with prototypic inducer drugs. the cyp <dig> mrna level was detected by real-time pcr. the experiment was performed in triplicate for all compounds. data was normalized by untreated  and was analyzed by non parametric one-tailed student t test  * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> .

substantial induction of cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  cyp2c <dig> and cyp3a <dig> isotype activities in hepatocyte-like cells
using luminescent cyp450-specific substrates, we determined cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  cyp2c <dig> and cyp3a <dig> isotype activities after the induction with either rifampicin or omeprazole in hepg <dig>  msc and hepatocyte-like cell. we observed end-point catalytic activity after incubating substrates to the cells using a luminometer. in hepatocyte-like cell, the activity of cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig> and cyp3a <dig> was increased to approximately 6- <dig> folds that of the untreated cell . a mild increase in cyp2c <dig> activity  was observed . the activity of cyp1a <dig> and cyp3a <dig> in hepatocyte-like cells was already higher than those in hepg <dig>  the primary hepatocyte provided the highest activities in all cyp <dig> isotypes. a significant increase in rifampicin-induced cyp3a <dig> activity was confirmed by the accumulation of cyp <dig> in hepatocyte-like cell as demonstrated by immunofluorescent staining . the staining for afp and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α confirmed the identity of the hepatocyte-like cell. the corresponding staining to the primary hepatocyte served as the positive controls . no significant induction was detected in untreated mscs, but untreated hepg <dig> and untreated hepatocyte-like cell had low basal level of cyp1a <dig>  cyp1a <dig>  cyp2c <dig> and cyp3a <dig> activities.

discussion
the hepatocyte-like cells have been developed to replace the primary hepatocytes for the studies of xenobiotic-induced cyp <dig> isotype expression, hepatotoxicity, and xenobiotic biotransformation. taken together, the cell morphology, cell-selective markers  as well as certain specific phenotypes  indicated that the putative hepatocyte-like cells were correctly driven toward hepatocyte differentiation. to our knowledge, there has not been any attempt to bring hepatocyte-like cells derived from msc as a stable model for the study of cyp <dig> isotypes or new drug development. only certain isotypes  have been studied immediately after differentiation  <cit> . the expression of various transcription factors that regulate cyp <dig> isotypes <cit>  including hepatocyte nuclear factor   <cit>  during hepatogenic differentiation has been reported. pxr, ahr and car are considered to be the most important regulators of xenobiotic-induced regulation of many cyp <dig> isotypes <cit> . we observed increasing expression of pxr, car and hnf-4α in correlation with the degree of hepatocyte-like cell maturation.

several investigators had developed hepatocyte-like cells from different stem cell sources and various differentiation protocols <cit> . the msc sources were bone marrow, adipose tissue and wharton's jelly <cit> . the differentiation phenotypes were generally lost after a few days in all studies including one employing embryonic stem cells as precursors <cit> . the senescence of the precursor mscs led to decreasing both proliferation and plasticity  <cit> . our mscs also reached senescence after 20- <dig> population doublings, similar to others  <cit> . the generation of hepatocyte-like cells from mscs has been plagued by the lack of stable supply of the precursor mscs and their differentiation capacity. these obstacles would be obviated if immortalized hepatocyte-like cells with intact phenotypes could be generated.

a classical gene employed for immortalization is the telomerase reverse transcriptase  that prevents replicative senescence associated with decreasing telomere length resulting from repeated cell division  <cit> . lesser known immortalization genes are sv- <dig> large t antigen  and bmi- <dig> <cit> . bmi- <dig> inhibit senescence and extended the life span of normal human cell by suppressing p16ink4a that allows cell entry into division <cit> . moreover, the overexpression of bmi- <dig> could inhibit tgf-β signaling <cit>  that would otherwise induce hepatocyte cell death <cit> .

mscs lost their originally high telomerase activity  <cit>  after being seeded as primary cultured cells  <cit>  and eventually lost their stem cell property  <cit> . we had expected that the addition of a constitutively expressing construct of htert  to mscs would solve the senescence  <cit> , but a slight postponement of senescence was observed. only after bmi- <dig>  <cit>  had been co-introduced were the senescence phenotypes extensively delayed. the transduced cells had increasing spindle morphology with at least 80% of the whole population contained both cd <dig> and cd <dig>  these cells could be maintained for over  <dig> year while still maintaining their growth in exponential phase. the given constructs have an advantage of the inclusion of loxp site that allows the removal from the genomic insertion site.

it is even more exciting when the precursor cells of the hepatocyte-like cells were already immortalized. we modified the hepatogenic differentiation protocol from previous reports  <cit>  by extending the last step of maturation from  <dig> weeks to  <dig> weeks in culture medium supplemented with 2% dmso. normally, we cannot achieve a complete hepatocyte differentiation. however, after using limiting dilution technique, a stable clone of functional hepatocyte-like cell was established. our clone of differentiated immortalized cells could propagate in standard culture condition for greater than  <dig> months with sustainable hepatocyte specific makers and functions.

the confirmed hepatocyte phenotypes that included the expression of albumin, α-fetoprotein cytokeratin  <dig>  hnf-4α, and tyrosine aminotransferase were up-regulated for  <dig> -  <dig> folds that of the undifferentiated mscs. however, the overall basal gene expressions were  <dig> - 40% those of the primary hepatocyte. the flow cytometry analysis indicated that at least 80% of the hepatocyte-like cells, in comparison with 90% of hepg <dig>  produced albumin. likewise, the urea production of our cells was comparable to that of hepg <dig>  greater proportion of our hepatocyte-like cells  carried glycogen than did others <cit> . the expression of transcription factors for cyp <dig>  as well as that of the phase ii enzyme  was observed. the  <dig> - 50-fold induction of the expression of  <dig> major cyp <dig> isotypes  in response to known enzyme inducers  was confirmed, although their basal levels were less than those of the primary hepatocyte by 100- <dig> folds. unexpectedly, hepg <dig> achieved much weaker induction of cyp1a <dig>  cyp2d <dig>  cyp2c <dig> and cyp2c <dig> in response to rifampicin, dexamethasone and omeprazole than did hepatocyte-like cells. the immunofluorescent study of cyp3a <dig> in hepatocyte-like cells after induction indicated that the up-regulation of protein level was consistent with the induction of mrna expression.

although cyp <dig> isotypes are presented in most cell types, not all cell types are suitably employed to study the cyp450's response to xenobiotics. to elucidate the suitability of the hepatocyte-like cells for the study of cyp <dig> isotypes, we have extensively investigated the expressions of all major isotypes plus the enzymatic activity of selected isotypes in response to enzyme inducers. we have demonstrated that the un-modified mscs contained low basal levels of cyp <dig> isotypes and elicited only  <dig> - 5-fold induction to prototypic cyp <dig> isotype inducers . therefore, the use of mscs is not considered a viable alternative for cyp <dig> study. we observed extensively high expressions of most cyp <dig> isotypes in response to inducers in hepatocyte-like cells than those in mscs or hepg <dig>  although the basal levels of certain cyp <dig> isotypes were lower than those of primary hepatocytes or hepg <dig>  changing the precursors of hepatocyte-like cells from mscs to embryonic stem cells or induced pleuripotential stem cells could not bring up the basal levels of all isotypes  <cit> . an exception was found in cyp2b <dig>  where the hepatocyte-like cells had comparable expansion to that of the hepg <dig>  the low basal levels of these cyp <dig> isotypes in hepatocyte-like cells might be attributed to their completely lack of exposure to xenobiotics as opposed to the primary hepatocytes or hepg <dig>  based on the expansion of cyp <dig> isotypes' expression in response to inducers, hepatocyte-like cells are considered a more sensitive and informative model.

CONCLUSIONS
the continuous hepatocyte-like cell lines have been generated from htert plus bmi-1-immortalized human mscs. these continuous cell lines contained hepatocyte markers  including all major cyp <dig> isotypes . the basal mrna expression of cyp <dig> isotypes was low, but readily up-regulated up to  <dig> folds upon the exposure to enzyme inducers. the high inducibility of cyp <dig> transcripts would serve as a sensitive model for profiling xenobiotic-induced expression of cyp <dig>
