BACKGROUND
nitrogen is a component of nucleic acids, proteins and many other biological molecules thus, it is an essential element for all living organisms. although the n <dig> gas is abundant in the atmosphere, it can not be readily used by most organisms. nitrogen fixation is a key process in which molecular nitrogen is reduced to form ammonia, which is the form used by living systems for the synthesis of many organic compounds  <cit> . biological nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the oxygen-sensitive enzyme nitrogenase present in some microorganisms known as diazotrophs, mainly bacteria  <cit> .

the most abundant and extensively studied nitrogenase is the molybdenum -dependent enzyme  <cit> . it is composed of two metalloproteins: the mofe-protein  and the fe-protein   <cit> . both the mofe and fe-protein are irreversibly damaged by oxygen  <cit> . o <dig> exposure leads to inappropriate oxidation of the metalloclusters, decrease of protein secondary structure and further degradation  <cit> .

yet, several nitrogen-fixing bacteria are aerobic and demand high o <dig> flux for proper cellular metabolism. therefore these bacteria present mechanisms to solve this apparent paradox. under high o <dig> concentration, they increase metabolism and consume more carbon source than needed to satisfy its energy requirement for growth in order to decrease o <dig> pressure  <cit> . subtle adjustments in the composition and functioning of the respiratory chain, mainly differential expression of cytochromes, were described  <cit> . additionally, diazotrophs grown in air secrete abundant extracellular polysaccharides and live inside colonies that help to produce a local microaerobic environment  <cit> .

besides the respiratory protection mechanism, it was shown that a few nitrogen-fixing bacteria present a conformational protection mechanism of nitrogenase against o <dig> <cit> . such system involves the interaction of a ferredoxin protein  with the nitrogenase complex that results in stabilization of a reversibly inactive complex. the ferredoxin protein is found as an homodimer that contains a  <dig> cluster and interacts specifically and reversibly with the nitrogenase complex  <cit> .

similar mechanisms were described in azotobacter chroococcum <cit> , azotobacter vinelandii <cit> , clostridium pasteurianum <cit>  and klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> . the fesii protein was mainly studied in a. vinelandii <cit> . site-directed mutagenesis and crosslinking experiments revealed two residues possibly with fundamental roles on the interaction of fesii with nitrogenase  <cit> .

previous studies have shown evidences of a similar mechanism of conformational protection in gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, however the putative fesii protein was not yet identified  <cit> .

due to the great importance of biological nitrogen fixation for sustainable crop production, advances have been achieved in genetics and biochemistry, culminating in the determination of the crystallographic structures of both nitrogenase components  <cit> . however, studies on protein regulation and dynamics need to be carried out to a complete understanding of the molecular nature of the process.

in order to gain knowledge on structure and function of the proteins involved in the conformational protection of nitrogenase, we performed bioinformatic analysis on the whole genome sequence of g. diazotrophicus and identified a putative fesii protein. in addition, molecular modeling, dynamics and docking studies on both a. vinelandii and g. diazotrophicus fesii proteins and nitrogenases were carried out, elucidating molecular aspects of protein-protein interaction.

RESULTS
gdia <dig> codes for a putative fesii protein of g. diazotrophicus
c. pasteurianum and a. vinelandii fesii proteins were target of several theoretical and experimental studies  <cit> . thus, its primary sequences were used to search for an homologue in g. diazotrophicus. searches were performed on both versions of g. diazotrophicus complete genome sequence available, containing  <dig>  and  <dig>  predicted protein coding genes. however, similarity searches on predicted protein sequences or raw genomic sequence did not return any hit with high sequence similarity  and coverage .

in order to follow up the search for a putative fesii in g. diazotrophicus the functional properties of fesii proteins were analyzed. for instance, a. vinelandii fesii protein presents  <dig> kda and a fer <dig> domain  <cit> , found in ferredoxins that are electron carrier proteins with a 2fe-2s cofactor acting in a wide variety of metabolic reactions. the members of this family are proteins of approximately one hundred aminoacids with four conserved cysteine residues that coordinate the  <dig> cluster and have a general core structure consisting of beta-alpha-beta  <cit> .

accordingly, ureta et al,  <dig>  <cit>  have shown the co-precipitation of a  <dig> kda protein with nitrogenase of g. diazotrophicus cells grown diazotrophically under high oxygen concentration. this result suggested a conformational protection mechanism of nitrogenase in g. diazotrophicus, involving a  <dig> kda protein.

in a second attempt to identify the g. diazotrophicus fesii protein, we have analyzed the whole genome sequences for ferredoxin proteins. from the  <dig> orfs analyzed, a search for textual annotation with the “ferredoxin” or “2fe-2s” syntax revealed  <dig> putative ferredoxins. from these, only  <dig> present predicted molecular weight between  <dig> and  <dig> kda, around the expected size for a putative  <dig> shethna protein. analysis of these  <dig> ferredoxins for the presence of functional domains disclosed two orfs in g. diazotrophicus genome with high score for the fer <dig> domain . however, they correspond to the same protein, as they come from one of each complete genome sequence available. they are 99% identical and the only difference is that gdia <dig> is  <dig> aminoacids longer  than gdi <dig>  thus, gdia <dig> was chosen for further analysis.

in order to assert the putative function of gdia <dig>  prediction of secondary structure of a. vinelandii fesii was compared to the predicted secondary structure of gdia <dig>  both sequences form  <dig> beta sheets followed by an alpha helix and  <dig> subsequent beta-sheets . a. vinelandii fesii presents a  <dig> residues larger loop in the region 77- <dig>  in summary, the secondary structure profile of both proteins is highly similar and the only structure discrepancy is the mentioned loop region .

following this analysis, the functional conserved residues from a. vinelandii fesii were investigated for corresponding residues on the putative g. diazotrophicus sequence. lou et al  <dig>  <cit>  described the importance of two lysine residues  crucial for fesii interaction with nitrogenase. interestingly, gdia <dig> presents two arginine residues  in a conserved position . k and r are both basic residues and might encompass same function in the protein context. besides, a. vinelandii fesii presents  <dig> cysteine residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  that coordinate the metal cluster, essential for plenty function of fesii  <cit> . gdia <dig> also presents this  <dig> cysteine residues well conserved in structure . altogether, these results strongly suggest that gdia <dig> is the gene that codes for the putative fesii in g. diazotrophicus.

fesii molecular models revealed a conserved β-grasp core structure
the results discussed above strongly suggest that gdia <dig> is the putative fesii protein of g. diazotrophicus. however, there are no structural information available for both a. vinelandii fesii and gdia <dig>  it is far known that protein structure is a determinant of protein function and three-dimensional structure is more conserved than protein sequence. thus, as a support to the above predictions, 3d comparative models for gdia <dig>  as well as for a. vinelandii fesii, were constructed.

the first step in comparative modeling is the definition of a template sequence. the template sequence must have its 3d structure experimentally determined with high accuracy and present sequence similarity with the target. the quality of 3d structure  and the alignment between template and target sequences are crucial for the model quality. therefore, several alignments were generated for the fesii sequences, using information from sequence database searches, secondary structure prediction and available homologues with resolved 3d structures. alignments were then manually optimized in order to minimize gaps and assert that the conserved domain residues are aligned. although gdia <dig> and a. vinelendii fesii might both perform the conformational protection of nitrogenase, they share low sequence similarity . therefore, template structures chosen for comparative modeling of each of them were different. gdia <dig> chosen template is fdvi protein , a  <dig> ferredoxin essential for growth of rhodobacter capsulatus <cit> , also a diazotrophic bacterium. a. vinelandii fesii chosen template is e. coli fdx , an adrenodoxin-type  <dig> ferredoxin with an essential role in the maturation of various iron-sulfur  proteins  <cit> . this two template proteins share some structural similarity and both coordinate a  <dig> cluster.

the a. vinelandii fesii model  exhibited high stereochemical quality  and a high probability to represent a native-like conformation . the average distance deviation between backbone equivalent atoms  measures the similarity between 3d structures after optimal superposition; the rmsd score for fesii proposed model vs. the crystal structure of fdx was  <dig>  Å, a further indication of the high quality of the model  <cit> . a remarkable feature of this model is a large loop region, comprising aminoacids 77- <dig>  as expected from the observed gap in sequence alignment. in overall, this represents a structure of high quality.

the gdia <dig> model  also presented high stereochemical quality  and is a highly probable native-like structure . the rmsd between gdia <dig> model and fdvi crystal structure is  <dig>  Å, representing the overall quality of the model.

in overall, the molecular models obtained are highly informative since their templates present high resolution and molecular modeling included alignment optimization, loops refinement, secondary structure prediction and metalloclusters positioning. although fesii and gdia <dig> models were built from different template structures, they share many structural features. the rmsd between their structures is only  <dig>  Å . this reflects the protein structure conservation, the most required feature for proper protein function maintenance. both models present  <dig> well defined beta-sheets and  <dig> structural alpha-helix . the specific arrangement of these structural elements is a conserved motif typical of the general core structure characteristic of ferredoxin proteins, known as beta-grasp fold . the beta-grasp fold supplies an effective scaffold for binding iron-sulfur clusters in the case of the 2fe-2s ferrodoxins  <cit> .

additionally, the  <dig> cysteine residues are positioned towards the  <dig> cluster, as was expected, in both models . the  <dig> lysine  residues of a. vinelandii fesii and the corresponding  <dig> arginine  of g. diazotrophicus are positioned at exposed surface and might be involved in nitrogenase interaction, as suggested before.

altogether these results provide evidence that fesii and gdia <dig> could perform same molecular function.

fesii dimer is the stable functional unit
previous studies detected that c. pasteurianum and a. vinelandii fesii binds to nitrogenase complex as an homodimer. analyses of electrostatic potential and solvent exposed surface of the monomer molecular models were performed to identify a possible dimerization interface. electrostatic potential of a. vinelandii fesii revealed a predominant positive structure. however, protein-protein dimerization surfaces are typically neutral, as hydrophobic residues are usually found enclosed inside the complex structure. charged residues largely exposed at protein surface may also contribute to protein-protein interactions through salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. careful analysis of solvent accessible residues showed a possible region of dimerization comprising hydrophobic and basic residues accessible to solvent comprising l <dig>  m <dig>  g <dig>  l <dig> and p <dig>  therefore, these residues were set as obligatory contacts for docking calculations. additionally, the large loop region  presents some hydrophobic aminoacids and consequently was set as a semi-flexible region for docking experiments. the resulting dimer  presented high quality , a symmetric structure  and complementarities of shape and charge in the dimerization interfaces. the loop region seems to strengthen protein dimerization. a  <dig> ns molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous solution revealed that the dimer is stable , supporting the hypothesis that the dimer is the functional unit. gdia <dig> showed a similar pattern of charge distribution in comparison to fesii . mainly positive residues are found in the surface. from the solvent exposed surface residues, the most notable ones  were selected as obligatory contacts for docking experiment. calculations resulted in dimer structure with native-like structure  that close resembles the a. vinelandii fesii dimer model . shape and charge complementarities of the surface interface of the proposed dimer are according to physicochemical restrictions. gdia <dig> dimeric orientation is very similar to fesii  and showed stable behavior after  <dig> ns of dynamics simulation .

g. diazotrophicus nitrogenase complex structure is close related to a. vinelandii nitrogenase
in order to better understand the conformational protection mechanism of nitrogenase from oxygen damage, analysis of fesii-nitrogenase interaction is required. the protection is due to the formation of an oxygen-tolerant three-component nitrogenase complex   <cit> . crystal structures of a. vinelandii nitrogenase complex were already determined and presented insights on multiple docking sites of nucleotides  <cit> . mutant forms of nitrogenase proteins were also studied and revealed key residues for nucleotide-protein interaction  <cit> . in contrast, fesii interaction with nitrogenase complex was not yet studied in respect to structural aspects. in addition, it lacks information on 3d structure of g. diazotrophicus nitrogenase complex.

as a strategy to fulfill this gap, a molecular model of g. diazotrophicus nitrogenase complex was built through comparative modeling. the fe-protein presents 70% identity and 85% positivity with the a. vinelandii homologue. the mofe-protein α-subunit shows 71% identity and 81% similarity with the a. vinelandii counterpart. the β-subunit of mofe-protein is 52% identical and 70% similar to the a. vinelandii protein. in summary, all components of nitrogenase complex from g. diazotrophicus and a. vinelandii share high sequence similarity. therefore, the template structures for both components of nitrogenase complex were the a. vinelandii subunits.

in consequence of this high degree of similarity between target and template sequences, the molecular model of g. diazotrophicus nitrogenase complex presented high stereochemical quality. molecular models of fe-protein , mofe-protein α and β-subunits  presented 99%, 98% and 99% of residues in allowed regions of ramachandran plot. the overall rmsd between each crystal structure and the proposed model is  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, respectively. such a high quality model is suitable for protein-protein interaction analysis.

a negative pocket anchors the fesii positive region near the fe-protein/mofe-protein interface in the nitrogenase complex
as mentioned before, a few studies reported the interaction of fesii with nitrogenase. nitrogenase protein is found as an oligomer . the binding site of fesii in nitrogenase is not clearly described. it was shown that a  <dig> ferredoxin of c. pasteurianum binds the mofe-protein at a site involving both subunits of the mofe-protein  <cit> . however, in a. vinelandii and a. chroococcum it was demonstrated that fesii binds to the nitrogenase complex, but not to each individual subunit  <cit> . apparently, the formation of a three-component nitrogenase complex  is essential for nitrogenase oxygen tolerance and suggests that fesii interacts near the subunits interface of nitrogenase complex  <cit> . furthermore, in a. vinelandii, several site-directed mutants were constructed and tested for its fesii capability of interaction with nitrogenase  <cit> . two of those  lost ability of interaction. this experiment showed the importance of these two k residues for interaction. however, it was not shown if is due to direct contact or allosteric effect.

the oxygen-stable three-component complex is very large to perform blind docking calculations in a feasible computational time. in order to elucidate this mechanism, electrostatic surface, shape and physicochemical complementarities of both fesii and nitrogenase complex were exhaustively inspected. a. vinelandii fe-protein presented  <dig> glutamic acid residues  at fe-protein surface near the interface with mofe-protein. this negative area visually fits in shape and charge the fesii region around k <dig> and k <dig>  the two lysine that may have an important role in the initial steps of recognizing the nitrogenase component residues . in addition, the histidine  <dig>  is in this same structural interface. it was suggested that h <dig> might modulate the fesii protein’s affinity for nitrogenase in a redox state-dependent manner  <cit> .

g. diazotrophicus gdia0615-nitrogenase interaction was also analyzed. the surface electrostatic potential and structural shape of both were manually inspected. as observed in a. vinelandii proteins, there is a small negative pocket on the interface of fe-protein and mofe-protein. this region is completely complementary in shape and charge to the unique positive region of gdia <dig>  corresponding to r <dig> and r <dig> neighborhood. such suspicious analysis suggests these arginine residues are directly involved in the nitrogenase oxygen-stable three-component complex formation in g. diazotrophicus .

in order to support these analyses, docking calculations of a. vinalendii fesii protein and nitrogenase complex were performed. according to the evidences described above, nitrogenase e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> residues and fesii k <dig>  k <dig> and h <dig> were set as active residues for docking calculation .

fesii β-chain are indicated by an . nitrogenase residues marked with an asterisk  belong to the fe-protein and those without are from mofe-protein. polar interactions were classified in salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. atoms participating on these contacts were separated in backbone or side-chain atoms.

from the  <dig> complexes generated,  <dig> are clustered in the same docking site and show a very similar conformational structure. they also represent the lowest energy complexes obtained and the best one is shown on figure  <dig> . the complex structure presented energy values of: - <dig>  +/-  <dig>  , - <dig>  +/-  <dig>  ,  <dig>  +/-  <dig>   and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  . analysis of these energetic components of fesii-nitrogenase complex confirmed that interaction is mainly due to electrostatic potential. this result explains previous experimental data which shows that an increase in ionic strength disrupts the fesii-nitrogenase complex  <cit> .

further, the docking complex structure revealed that fesii k <dig> and k <dig> are directly involved in the complex formation, supporting the earlier mutagenesis data  <cit> . fe-protein residues engaged on interaction are e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  d <dig> and e <dig>  mofe-protein main aminoacids are e <dig> and d <dig> . additional residues also participate on molecular interactions, either through hydrogen bonds, saline contacts or electrostatic interaction .

CONCLUSIONS
the nitrogenase conformational protection mechanism against oxygen is a bacterial strategy to avoid the enzyme degradation during a sudden increase in oxygen concentration. fesii protein  interacts with nitrogenase complex  <cit> . the three-component complex keeps nitrogenase inactive but transiently protected from damage by oxygen  <cit> . this oxygen-stable nitrogenase complex is formed only under conditions of low ionic strength in the presence of mgcl <dig>  and requires all three components to be present in an oxidized state  <cit> .

a. vinelandii fesii was target of a few studies regarding its function and regulation. this study contributed for the understanding of this mechanism with structural aspects. in contrast, g. diazotrophicus protein involved in nitrogenase conformational protection was not yet known. the results described herein present for the first time a putative fesii protein for g. diazotrophicus. a detailed analysis of all predicted orfs of complete genomic sequence revealed only one possible protein coding gene  for the putative fesii. although gdia <dig> present low sequence similarity with a. vinelandii fesii, all functional residues are well conserved. a comparative analysis of the 3d molecular models of gdia <dig> and fesii support the hypothesis of gdia <dig> protective function. both form a beta-grasp folding and present similar electrostatic properties. in addition, they are functional as symmetric homodimers that interact through a hydrophobic interface.

a. vinelandii fesii docking with nitrogenase complex revealed a putative binding site near the fe-protein/mofe-protein interface, corroborating previous data on the three-component complex. this interaction is dependent of shape and charge complementarities. two fesii lysine residues , as well as an histidine h <dig> participate actively on interaction. on the other hand,  <dig> glutamic acid residues of fe-protein enclose a negative cavity for fesii binding. in g. diazotrophicus we suggest that arginine residues r <dig> and r <dig>  histidine h <dig> and adjacent regions compose the main region for gdia <dig> interaction with nitrogenase complex. in overall, this study provided the first molecular insights on structural properties of the conformational protection mechanism of nitrogenase against oxygen. such study will certainly contribute to a better understanding of the biological nitrogen fixation process.
