BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  is a leading cause of infantile diarrhoea in developing countries  <cit> . net secretory diarrhoea results from altered host cell signaling events, loosening of tight junctions and is exacerbated by the destruction of absorptive tissue, the host intestinal microvilli  <cit> . these phenotypes are mediated by a type iii secretion system, a molecular syringe that secretes bacterial proteins into host cells, and is a common feature of many gram-negative pathogens  <cit> . the mechanism of epec diarrhoeal disease is similar to that of enterohemorrhagic e. coli , and thus epec can be used as a surrogate for investigating disease caused by this more serious threat to public health. while, by definition, epec, possesses no diffusible toxins, ehec in contrast produces shiga toxin, causing bloody diarrhoea or hemorrhagic colitis. the production of shiga toxin also can lead to the life-threatening complication, hemolytic uremic syndrome , which occurs in approximately 10% of reported cases of ehec infection  <cit> .

in developing countries, studies have shown that administering zinc to children with diarrhoea reduces the severity of disease  <cit> . it was initially hypothesized that this effect was due to correction of zinc deficiencies often seen in impoverished and malnourished children in these regions of the world. certainly zinc is an important nutrient due to its fundamental role as a cofactor - over  <dig> zinc-depedent enzymes have been identified from all forms of life, with many of these such as carbonic anhydrase forming a basic part of human metabolism. zinc is also found in non-enzymatic contexts in humans, for example its structural role in the ubiquitous zinc finger transcriptional regulators  <cit> . zinc is also important for immune function, and zinc deficiency adversely affects the health and development of children  <cit> . however, a double-blind, randomized, controlled study involving  <dig> children with acute diarrhoea conducted in new delhi, india demonstrated that zinc supplementation benefited children in the experimental group irrespective of the child’s initial plasma zinc level  <cit> . thus beyond being an important co-factor necessary for immune and enzyme function in children, zinc also reduces the duration and severity of diarrhoeal disease caused by e. coli. for an initial study conducted in calcutta, many, but not all of the reported cases were caused by epec. thus some researchers have argued for greater use of zinc supplementation to treat bacterial diarrhoeal disease in children in the developing world  <cit> .

in epec, zinc causes a reduction in net protein secretion via the type iii secretion system  <cit> , encoded within the pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement or lee. as an underlying mechanism, this metal ion reduces the expression of espa, encoding the monomer of the molecular syringe, and espb, which in conjunction with espd encodes the pore that inserts into the membrane of the host cell  <cit> . the genes espaespb and espd are found within the lee <dig> operon of epec  <cit> . evidence suggests that zinc dependent down regulation of lee <dig> involves the global regulator protein ler, encoded within the lee <dig> operon. zinc also reduces expression of lee <dig>  and thus ler  <cit> .

in our current study we sought to understand the underlying mechanism of how zinc reduces the expression of lee genes of epec. we found no evidence to suggest that zinc directly acts on the regulatory protein ler. rather, we present evidence that zinc causes epec envelope stress, leading to a σe-dependent stress response characterized by increased expression of rpoe. treating epec with ammonium metavanadate  – a known chemical inducer of the σe-dependent response – caused a reduction in type iii-dependent secretion similar to that observed in the presence of zinc. this is a first account of a specific mechanism on how zinc supplements reduce the duration and severity of disease caused by epec and related diarrhoeal pathogens.

RESULTS
millimolar concentrations of zinc are required to inhibit ler binding
previous studies indicated that exogenous zinc diminished epec pathogenesis, in part, by inhibiting expression of virulence genes. specifically, expression of genes of the lee, encoding components of the type iii secretion system, were reduced in the presence of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm zinc acetate  <cit> . data suggested that, for the lee <dig> operon, encoding espa, zinc-dependent down-regulation required the global regulator ler  <cit> , which controls expression of the lee <dig> operon. thus we initially posited that upon zinc stress cytoplasmic concentrations of this metal ion prevented ler binding to lee <dig> regulatory dna.

to test this hypothesis, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays  using purified components . one hundred nanograms of lee <dig> regulatory dna was incubated with  <dig> nm ler protein with increasing amounts of zinc acetate. in the absence of added zinc, the ler/dna complex migrated poorly into the polyacrylamide gel compared to the dna fragment alone, consistent with previously published data  <cit> . concentrations of added zinc acetate up to  <dig> μm showed no effect on the ability of ler protein to bind and shift the lee <dig> regulatory dna . at  <dig> μm, or  <dig> mm, zinc acetate we observed reduction in the ability of ler to bind lee <dig> dna by 80%. thus in vitro, millimolar concentrations of zinc were necessary to disrupt ler binding to regulatory dna sequences.

under normal physiological conditions, it is estimated that the concentration of free zinc within e. coli is in the femtomolar range, less then one zinc atom per cell  <cit> , whereas the zinc quotient of the cell– that complexed with amino acids, ribosomal proteins and enzymes– reaches micromolar concentrations. because millimolar concentrations of zinc acetate were necessary for disrupting ler binding to lee <dig>  and no putative zinc binding domains are found within ler , we concluded that alterations of lee gene expression by zinc did not involve direct interaction of zinc with the regulatory protein ler.

lee gene expression is reduced by zinc in k- <dig> laboratory strains
to further our understanding of zinc alteration of lee gene expression we transformed plasmids containing lee1-lacz and lee4-lacz fusions  into the prototypical epec strain e2348/ <dig>  epec strain lrt <dig>  strain jpn <dig> lacking the eaf virulence plasmid, and the k- <dig> strain mc <dig>  strains were grown in dmem medium in the presence and absence of  <dig>  mm zinc acetate, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. β-galactosidase activity derived from the lee <dig> operon was significantly diminished in the presence of zinc in all four strains . similarly, β-galactosidase activity derived from the lee1-lacz, multi-copy fusion was also diminished by the presence of  <dig>  mm zinc acetate in the four strains tested .

as a control we determined whether  <dig>  mm zinc acetate affected the growth rate of either epec or the laboratory strain mc <dig>  we found that the doubling times of epec strain e2348/ <dig> were  <dig> and  <dig> minutes in dmem for  <dig> or  <dig>  mm zinc acetate added, whereas for mc <dig> the doubling times were  <dig> and  <dig> minutes for  <dig> and  <dig>  mm zinc acetate, respectively. thus the growth rate of the pathogenic strain e2348/ <dig> was slowed by ∼10% though that of the laboratory strain was more adversely affected by zinc. these results indicated that previous assays demonstrating zinc-mediated down-regulation of lee genes using qrt-pcr  <cit>  could be faithfully reproduced using a lacz reporter gene system, that down-regulation of lee <dig> occurred in the absence of ler in the k-12-derived strain mc <dig>  and because we could observe this regulation in mc <dig> derivatives that the regulation was not specific to the epec pathotype.

down-regulation of lee genes by zinc occurs in the absence of zinc ion homeostasis regulators zur and zntr
we took advantage of the fact that zinc down-regulation of lee genes could be reconstituted in k-12-derived strains to determine whether the observed regulation involved regulators of zinc ion homeostasis. the zur regulator represses expression of the znuabc zinc transporter when the bacterium has excess intracellular concentrations of zinc, while zntr stimulates expression of the znta exporter when excess concentrations of zinc are found within the cytoplasm  <cit> . in the mc <dig> Δzur strain sip <dig> containing the pjlm <dig> plasmid, β-galactosidase activity derived from the lee <dig> operon decreased from ∼ <dig> to  <dig> miller units in the presence of  <dig>  mm zinc acetate, a 5-fold reduction . similarly, in the mc <dig> Δzntr strain containing the pjlm <dig> plasmid β-galactosidase activity decreased from ∼ <dig> to  <dig> miller units, a 7-fold reduction , in the presence of  <dig>  mm zinc acetate. we therefore concluded that zinc-mediated repression of lee <dig>  encoding ler, did not require the global regulators of zinc homeostasis zur or zntr.

zinc stress increases  rpoe expression
previous publications have indicated that excess zinc induces the expression of genes involved in envelope stress  <cit> . while these studies were conducted in complex media, including lb, we wanted to determine if genes associated with envelope stress were stimulated by zinc in the tissue culture medium dmem used in our assays. we therefore plated the mc4100-derived strains ct <dig>  containing a single-copy rpoe-lacz fusion, jlm <dig> and jlm <dig>  containing lee1lacz and lee4lacz fusions, respectively, and as a negative control, strain mcamp containing a single-copy bla-lacz fusion on dmem agar. sterile disks containing  <dig> μl of varying concentrations of zinc acetate were placed on the lawns of bacteria on selective medium containing x-gal, and growth proceeded overnight at 37°c.

a relatively small zone of growth inhibition was noted surrounding the disk containing  <dig> mm zinc acetate for all strains tested . thus high concentrations of zinc inhibited growth of these mc <dig> derivatives. consistent with our previous assays, we observed decreased β-galactosidase activities, indicated by a lack of blue color, surrounding the zinc acetate-containing disks on the plates containing the jlm <dig> and jlm <dig> strains, demonstrating that lee <dig> and lee <dig> expression was down-regulated in the presence of zinc acetate. however, we also observed similar down-regulation of β-galactosidase activity derived from the bla-lacz negative control fusion from strain mcamp, suggesting that zinc caused a generalized down-regulation of gene expression in e. coli.

in contrast to these results, we did not observe a down-regulation of the rpoe-lacz fusion from strain ct <dig> in the presence of any of the zinc acetate concentrations tested, indicated by blue color directly adjacent to the disks . consistent with this observation, by miller assay  <cit> , β-galactosidase activity derived from the rpoe-lacz fusion strain ct <dig> in dmem increased  <dig> -fold from 512± <dig> to 865± <dig> miller units  in the presence of  <dig>  mm zinc acetate. because rpoe expression occurs via a mechanism whereby the alternate sigma factor rpoe is released from the cytoplasmic membrane upon insult  <cit> , we concluded that e. coli grown in dmem experiences envelope stress in the presence of zinc acetate, consistent with previously published reports using complex media  <cit> .

zinc damages the epec envelope
to substantiate the damage to the epec envelope, comprising the inner membrane, periplasmic space, and outer membrane, suggested by our reporter gene fusion assays, we performed electron microscopy. epec bacteria were grown in dmem tissue culture medium in the absence and presence of  <dig>  mm zinc acetate. in the absence of zinc, the envelope of the bacteria appeared intact . however, after growth in dmem in the presence of zinc the outer membrane of the bacteria appeared compromised, and we observed what appeared to be multiple membrane blebs on individual bacteria . furthermore, we also observed bacteria with irregularly shaped inner membranes . these data provided direct evidence that zinc damages the epec envelope.

chemical disruption of the epec envelope diminishes type iii secretion
zinc stimulates the expression of rpoe  and physically damages the epec envelope . these data demonstrated that, as for laboratory strains of e. coli, zinc causes envelope stress in epec. along with down-regulation of lee genes encoding type iii secretion system components envelope stress could, at least in part, explain why zinc reduces diarrhoea in a rabbit illeal loop model of infection  <cit> . to test this hypothesis we monitored proteins secreted from epec grown in dmem in the presence of ammonium metavanadate . ammonium metavanadate causes envelope stress and specifically stimulates the rpoe regulon  <cit> . thus our prediction was that this chemical, in a manner similar to zinc, would diminish protein secretion via the type iii secretion system of epec strain e2348/ <dig> 

to test this prediction strain e2348/ <dig> was grown in dmem overnight, in static cultures in the presence of increasing concentrations of nh4vo <dig>  bacteria were pelleted, and secreted proteins were harvested from the supernatant by tca-precipitation. to control for proteins being released from the bacteria independently from the type iii secretion system, we also harvested supernatant proteins from the strain cvd <dig>  deleted for escn, encoding the atpase  <cit> . we monitored secretion in the presence of zinc because protein secretion was previously shown to be diminished in the presence of this metal ion  <cit> .

upon separation by sds-page, for wild type strain e2348/ <dig> we observed the espb protein migrating to ∼ <dig> kda, which was dependent upon the type iii system for secretion given that this band was absent in the lane corresponding to the Δescnstrain cvd <dig> . the identity of espb was confirmed by an in-gel tryptic digest followed by mass spectrometry . increasing concentrations of nh4vo <dig> caused diminished protein secretion in a concentration dependent manner, such that at  <dig> mm of this chemical secretion of espb was diminished by more than 70%. because nh4vo <dig> stresses the bacterial envelope, specifically targeting the rpoe stress pathway, we concluded that stress to the epec envelope caused decreased protein secretion via the type iii secretion system.

zinc precipitates phosphate from the tissue culture medium dmem
through the course of growing epec cultures in dmem we observed that, not the doubling time, but rather the growth yield was modestly diminished in the presence of zinc acetate . in addition, cfu/ml values after overnight growth in dmem were ∼ <dig>  x  <dig> versus  <dig>  x  <dig> in the absence and presence of  <dig>  mm zinc. as phosphate is present in dmem at  <dig> mm concentration, zinc phosphate is insoluble in solution, and we observed a small amount of white precipitate in dmem in the presence of zinc acetate , we hypothesized that the addition of zinc removed phosphate from this tissue culture medium. indeed we observed that after the addition of millimolar concentrations of zinc, the concentration of soluble phosphate diminished in a linear fashion in dmem . therefore we concluded that zinc removed the essential element phosphorous from solution, and was the most likely explanation for the modestly diminished epec growth yield in the presence of zinc.

discussion
in this report we begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which zinc diminishes epec virulence. though previous data had indicated that zinc reduces lee gene expression, in a ler-dependent manner  <cit> , as a negative control in this report we also observed that zinc reduced expression of the bla gene, encoding β-lactamase. thus zinc appeared to be a general down regulator of a subset of e. coli genes  <cit> , including those associated with epec virulence  <cit>  . consistent with this conclusion, we found no evidence for specific regulation by zinc interacting with ler, or involvement of the major zinc homeostasis regulators zur or zntr. however, toward the goal of using dietary supplements to diminish the severity of disease caused by epec, and the related ehec, zinc clearly reduces the expression of bfp, lee genes, including the lee <dig> operon encoding ler, and stx encoding the shiga toxin  <cit>  .

looking for a general stress pathway to explain the observed down regulation of epec virulence genes, we observed stimulation of rpoe expression in the presence of zinc . we concluded that zinc caused envelope stress to epec grown in defined dmem. consistent with our observation, rpoe and a number of rpoe-dependent genes including rpoh and htra were stimulated in the e. coli k- <dig> strain w <dig> grown in lb in the presence of zinc chloride  <cit> . however, it is not likely that the rpoe sigma factor controls expression of lee genes because the promoters identified for the lee operons of epec were clearly rpod-dependent, having consensus sequences highly similar to those of promoters transcribed by the σ70-containing rna polymerase holoenzyme  <cit> .

zinc causes envelope stress, in part, by compromising protein tertiary structure, complexing with the thiol side chain of cysteine residues and/or disrupting disulfide bonds. predictably, extracellular zinc causes a transient induction of the genes necessary for cysteine biosynthesis, thought to mop up excess cytoplasmic zinc  <cit> . a brief, transitory increase in intracellular zinc concentration most likely occurs inside of the bacterium, particularly for the strains containing mutations in either zur or zntr, upon addition of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm zinc acetate to the culture medium. however, evidence suggests that zinc is quickly complexed to cysteine because the cysteine biosynthetic genes are stimulated by zinc stress  <cit>  and then intracellular zinc concentrations return to normal conditions where free zinc is in the femtomolar range, less than one zinc molecule per bacterium  <cit> .

in epec, the type iii secretion system is assembled through the envelope, spanning the inner and outer membranes, and beyond, in order to inject effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm  <cit> . thus one would predict that zinc adversely affects the assembly, and integrity of the injectosome once assembled, ultimately preventing protein secretion. here we demonstrate that zinc physically alters the epec envelope  and that the envelope stressor nh4vo <dig>  which modifies lipid a of the lps  <cit>  and specifically stimulates the rpoe regulon, inhibits type iii protein secretion in a manner similar to that observed for zinc  <cit>  . thus diminished lee gene expression and disruption of type iii system-dependent protein secretion via envelope stress most likely, largely explain reduced net secretory diarrhoea in the presence of zinc in an ileal loop model of infection using rabbit enteropathogenic e. coli <cit> .

the chemical environment within the ileal loops is likely to be altered by the presence of zinc. notably, our results using the tissue culture medium dmem  suggest that millimolar quantities of zinc within ileal loops will lead to the precipitation of zinc phosphate and thus reduced availability of phosphate, limiting the number of bacteria within the loops. zinc acetate levels within the rabbit intestine reached  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm three days post administering of  <dig> mg of dietary zinc  <cit> . thus this level of zinc within the rabbit intestine not only reduces virulence functions of the bacterium, but will also diminish the availability of phosphate. e. coli has two major inorganic phosphate transporters: the pit system is a high velocity, low affinity system with a km of  <dig>  μm, while the pst system is a low velocity, high-affinity system having a km of  <dig>  μm  <cit> . therefore, in our experimentation , the level of phosphate did not reach levels low enough to inhibit growth, or reduce the doubling time, even in the presence of  <dig> mm zinc acetate, but some loss of the overall availability of phosphate in the dmem resulted in the observed reduced growth yield.

CONCLUSIONS
zinc interacts with multiple entities in order to affect epec virulence- the host, the bacterium itself and the surrounding medium. in humans inadequate levels of dietary zinc lead to an imbalance of the th <dig> and th <dig> adaptive immune responses, in part by a loss in function of the zinc-containing, thymic hormone thymulin, necessary for t-cell maturation  <cit> . so certainly, malnourished children in developing countries experiencing zinc deficiencies will have impaired immune function. previous reports clearly indicate that zinc reduces net secretory diarrhoea in a rabbit ileal loop model of infection  <cit> , and our our data now establish that envelope stress and the resultant loss of type iii secretion system function begin to explain results observed in the animal infection model. furthermore, because zinc can be given in relatively large doses without toxicity, this metal ion might also act to remove phosphate from the intestinal lumen, limiting bacterial populations. in sum, our results argue for a more widespread use of dietary zinc supplements to reduce epec diarrhoea in children living in the developing regions of the world, but this therapy approach might also be effective against a number of related, type iii secretion system containing gram-negative, diarrhoeal pathogens, for which therapy options are becoming increasingly limited.
