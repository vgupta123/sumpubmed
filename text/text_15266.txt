BACKGROUND
gap junctions are transcellular channels formed by the juxtaposition of two hemichannels, each composed of six connexin monomers, present on adjacent cells. the assembled gap junctions then aggregate to form gap junction plaques. gap junctional communication maintains metabolic continuity between cells and mediates the rapid and efficient transmission of small molecules, including second messengers among the interconnected cells.

connexin <dig>  is the principal gap junction protein expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, where it has been implicated in transmitting hormonal, mechanical load and growth factor induced signals  <cit> . mutation of connexins has been implicated in several diseases  <cit> . point mutations in gja <dig>  the gene encoding the gap junction protein cx <dig>  result in the human pleiotropic disorder oculodentodigital dysplasia, which includes skeletal manifestations  <cit> . mouse models of oculodentodigital dysplasia  <cit>  and cx <dig> genetic ablation  <cit>  have underscored the importance of cx <dig> in skeletal function. however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which gap junctions regulate the function of skeletal tissues.

using osteoblast cell lines, we have demonstrated that cx <dig> can modulate growth factor responses and signal transduction cascades, leading to altered gene expression and osteoblast function  <cit> . we have recently reported that modulation of cx <dig> can affect signal transduction in response to fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  in a protein kinase c-delta -dependent manner in osteoblasts  <cit> . pkcδ is a member of the novel pkcs, which, unlike classic pkcs, are calcium-independent but are activated by diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine. in a previous study, we demonstrated that overexpression of cx <dig> in a mouse osteoblast cell line could enhance the transcriptional response of the osteocalcin gene promoter to fgf <dig> treatment; an effect that could be abrogated by inhibition of pkcδ expression or activity  <cit> . conversely, inhibition of cx <dig> expression could attenuate the ability of these cells to respond to fgf <dig>  from these data, we hypothesize that cx <dig> may recruit pkcδ locally to the gap junction plaque where it can respond to second messengers being propagated through the gap junction channel. indeed, numerous studies have shown that cx <dig> can serve as a docking platform for signal complexes, including β-catenin, src, pkcα and pkcε  <cit> . the novel pkc family member, pkcδ, has not been shown to interact with cx <dig>  accordingly, we set out to examine the biochemical interactions between cx <dig> and pkcδ as it relates to the effects of fgf <dig> signaling. by understanding these biochemical interactions, we gain insight into the biologically relevant signals that may be propagated through gap junction channels as well as a greater understanding of how gap junctions regulate signal transduction cascades and, ultimately, cell function.

RESULTS
pkcδ-dependent phosphorylation of cx43
whole cell extracts were prepared from mc3t <dig> osteoblasts following treatment with vehicle , fgf <dig>  or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  for up to  <dig> minutes. western blots probed with anti-phospho-pkcδ  antibodies reveal that treatment with fgf <dig>  increases the phosphorylation of pkcδ by  <dig> minutes, increasing further by  <dig> minutes . antibodies against phospho-cx <dig>  reveal that fgf <dig> treatment induces a concomitant phosphorylation of cx <dig> at serine  <dig>  a known target of pkc-mediated phosphorylation . we observe similar results with pma treatments, a positive control for pkc phosphorylation at threonine  <dig> and cx <dig> phosphorylation at serine  <dig>  <cit> . pre-treatment of mc3t <dig> cells with the pkcδ inhibitor rottlerin  prevents the fgf2-induced phosphorylation of cx <dig> at serine  <dig> . this suggests that pkcδ phosphorylates cx <dig> and that the two proteins physically interact, at least transiently, during fgf <dig> treatment.

immunofluorescent detection of pkcδ and cx43
in order to examine the subcellular localization of activated pkcδ, mc3t <dig> cells treated with vehicle or  <dig> ng/ml fgf <dig>  for the indicated times, were fixed and stained with anti-phospho-pkcδ  antibodies . by immunofluorescence microscopy, we examined the localization of phospho-pkcδ  in osteoblasts over a time course following exposure to fgf <dig>  while classic pkcs are rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane upon activation, pkcδ has been shown to translocate not only to the plasma membrane but also to the nucleus  <cit> . prior to treatment with fgf <dig> , phospho-pkcδ is detected diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and in defined foci in the nuclei. occasional, weak staining is observed at the periphery of cells. in contrast, within  <dig> minutes of exposure to fgf <dig>  there is a rapid accumulation of phospho-pkcδ staining observed in the nuclear compartment . interestingly, we did not see a generalized staining of the plasma membrane with anti-phospho-pkcδ antibodies, rather we noticed a distinct pattern of staining near the point of cell-cell contacts, that is remindful of the staining we see for cx <dig> in these cells. the apparent accumulation of phospho-pkcδ staining at cell-cell contacts remained at  <dig> minutes following fgf <dig> stimulation . to determine if pkcδ is accumulating at the plasma membrane, we prepared protein extracts on plasma membrane preparations from osteoblasts during a time course of fgf <dig> treatment. subsequent, western blots of these plasma membrane extracts were probed with anti-pkcδ, anti-phospho-pkcδ  and anti-cx <dig> antibodies. there is a notable accumulation of pkcδ and phospho-pkcδ in the membrane protein extract following treatment with fgf <dig> for  <dig> minutes . this accumulation at the plasma membrane is transient, however, as it begins to diminish  <dig> minutes after fgf <dig> administration. cx <dig> levels in the membrane fraction remain relatively static . importantly, both proteins are found in the plasma membrane fraction, thus allowing for a potential protein-protein interaction.

given that both proteins are found in the plasma membrane and possess similar patterns of staining, we next sought to see if the pattern of staining observed with phospho-pkcδ antibodies following fgf <dig> administration was consistent with localization at cx <dig> gap junction plaques. accordingly, we performed immunofluorescent co-detection of both phospho-pkcδ  and cx <dig>  cx <dig> is diffusely detected throughout the cytoplasm with distinct areas of bright, punctate fluorescence at the periphery of the cells, near cell-cell borders . pkcδ is primarily observed at the nuclear compartment of these cells, though a similar pattern of fluorescence accumulation in defined regions at cell-cell borders is observed . when the fluorescent images are merged, there is a distinct co-detection of both pkcδ and cx <dig> in punctate clusters near cell-cell contacts, consistent with the expected pattern of staining seen at gap junction plaques . importantly, while this immunofluorescent co-detection of pkcδ and cx <dig> does not confirm any protein-protein interaction, it provides critical feasibility that the two proteins are located in situ in a manner that could permit protein-protein interactions.

co-immunoprecipitation of cx <dig> and pkcδ
next, we attempted to establish protein-protein interactions between cx <dig> and pkcδ by biochemical means. we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from whole cell extracts isolated from mc3t <dig> cells. previous studies have shown that pkcα and pkcε can interact with cx <dig>  <cit> . as a result, we used an anti-panpkc antibody and an anti-pkcε antibody as controls to ensure the efficacy of our co-immunoprecipitations. first, we confirmed the specificity of the antibodies to be used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments by western blotting mc3t <dig> whole cell extracts . as expected, we detect the presence of pkcδ, pkcε and cx <dig> in mc3t <dig> cells. additionally, the abundance of these factors was not appreciably affected by treatment of the cells for  <dig> minutes with fgf <dig> . next, we examined whether anti-cx <dig> antibodies could be used to co-immunoprecipitate pkc family members, including pkcδ. immunoprecipitations were performed with non-immune igg, anti-pkc or anti-cx <dig> antibodies, and western blots of supernatant  and bead  fractions from the immunoprecipitations were probed with anti-panpkc, anti-pkcδ and anti-pkcε specific antibodies, as indicated in figure 4b. in all cases, non-immune igg failed to immunoprecipitate pkcs. as expected, anti-pkc isoform antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate pkcs. importantly, anti-cx <dig> antibodies were able to co-immunoprecipitate proteins detectable with all three anti-pkc antibodies, supporting a protein-protein interaction between pkcs  and cx <dig> 

next, we attempted the opposing co-immunoprecipitation, using anti-pkc antibodies to co-immunoprecipitate cx <dig>  immunoprecipitations were performed with non-immune igg, anti-cx <dig>  or anti-pkc antibodies, and western blots of supernatant  and bead  fractions from the immunoprecipitations were probed with anti-cx <dig> specific antibodies, as indicated in figure 4c. non-immune igg failed to immunoprecipitate pkcs. as expected, anti-cx <dig> antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate cx <dig> protein. antibodies against panpkc, pkcδ and pkcε precipitate two products that are detected with cx <dig> antibodies, a ~ <dig> kd and a ~ <dig> kd protein. the ~ <dig> kd protein is the non-phosphorylated  form of cx <dig>  while the ~ <dig> kd protein is a phosphorylated form of cx <dig> . interestingly, it would appear that phosphorylated cx <dig>  is preferentially associated with all three pkcs, as this is the principal product detected in the bead fractions from co-immunoprecipitations with anti-pkc antibodies , in contrast to the predominance of the ~ <dig> kda band  that is observed in the cx <dig> direct immunoprecipitation .

to validate that this ~ <dig> kd product corresponds to phosphorylated cx <dig>  co-immunoprecipitations were performed using non-immune igg, anti-cx <dig> and anti-phospho-pkcδ antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated products were probed by western blotting with anti-cx <dig> or anti-phospho-serine specific antibodies. the same noticeable enrichment of the higher molecular weight product  is observed in the co-immunoprecipitations of cx <dig> with anti-pkc antibodies in comparison to the direct cx <dig> immunoprecipitation. . in support of the notion that the  <dig> kda protein is a phosphorylated form of cx <dig>  the anti-phospho-serine antibody strongly reacts with the ~ <dig> kda product in the co-immunoprecipitations with anti-pkcδ antibodies . these data reinforce the hypothesis that pkcδ preferentially associates with phospho-cx <dig> 

we have previously shown that pkcδ  translocates to the nucleus of fgf <dig> treated osteoblasts by  <dig> minutes  <cit> . at intermediate time points following fgf <dig> treatment, there is a distinct accumulation of pkcδ in nodules at the plasma membrane, as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  to determine the kinetics of association between cx <dig> and pkcδ in fgf <dig> treated osteoblasts, mc3t <dig> cells were treated with fgf <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes. whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with non-immune igg or anti-pkcδ antibodies and western blots of supernatant  and bead  fractions from the immunoprecipitations were probed with anti-cx <dig> antibodies, as shown in figure  <dig>  there is a distinct increase in the cx43/pkcδ interaction following  <dig> minutes of exposure to fgf <dig> . this association is transient, however, as the cx43/pkcδ interaction is reduced to below basal levels by  <dig> minutes . by  <dig> minutes of fgf <dig> treatment, we are unable to co-precipitate cx <dig> and pkcδ . this data is consistent with the kinetics of cellular re-distribution of pkcδ following fgf <dig> treatment, shown in figure  <dig> 

gst pulldown of pkcδ with the cx <dig> c-terminal tail
finally, in order to confirm that the association between pkcδ and cx <dig> occurs in the c-terminal domain of cx <dig>  we performed gst-pulldown assays, using a recombinant gst-cx <dig> fusion protein that spans amino acids 241- <dig> of the cx <dig> c-terminal tail . we anticipated association of pkcδ with the c-terminal tail of cx <dig> because this domain is commonly associated with the assembly of signal complexes  <cit>  and includes characterized pkc phosphorylation sites  <cit> .

recombinant, purified gst-cx43ct or gst-alone were crosslinked to glutathione sepharose 4b beads. the crosslinked beads were then used to pulldown interacting proteins from mc3t <dig> whole cell extracts. the input and bead fractions were then western blotted with anti-pkcδ antibodies. gst-cx43ct-conjugated beads could strongly pull down pkcδ from mc3t <dig> whole cell extracts . beads conjugated to gst alone were unable to pull down pkcδ. specificity of the gst-pulldown was confirmed by probing the western blot with anti-gapdh antibodies, which revealed an immunoproduct in the input fraction but not in either bead fraction .

discussion
previously, we have shown that modulation of cx <dig> protein levels can affect the impact of fgf <dig> on osteoblast transcription in a pkcδ-dependent manner  <cit> . in that study, we reported that over expression of cx <dig> potentiates the transcriptional response to fgf <dig> by enhancing the activation and mobilization of pkcδ in the cell, which ultimately increases transcription of the osteoblast specific gene, osteocalcin. conversely, we show that inhibition of cx <dig> expression or function could inhibit the responsiveness of the osteocalcin gene to fgf <dig> treatment. these data established the involvement of cx <dig> and pkcδ in the osteoblast response to fgf <dig>  however, it remained undetermined how the relative abundance of cx <dig> could impact pkcδ function.

several studies have shown that fgf <dig> can activate pkcδ  <cit> , or that fgf <dig> can increase phosphorylation of cx <dig>  <cit> . additionally, the activation of pkc isoforms, by phorbol esters has been shown to result in the inhibition of gap junctional communication  <cit> . however, a physical interaction of pkcδ with cx <dig> has never been reported, nor has fgf <dig> been shown to increase phosphorylation of cx <dig> in a pkcδ-dependent manner.

in this study, we demonstrate via immunofluorescence staining and biochemical methods that pkcδ physically interacts with cx <dig>  while alone, the immunofluorescence does not prove a physical interaction, we think that this data provides strong support of the feasibility of a physical interaction in situ and that the co-precipitation studies are biologically relevant. we go on to characterize the kinetics of the phosphorylation, interaction and cellular translocation following fgf <dig> treatment, revealing a transient association of pkcδ with cx <dig> at the plasma membrane and subsequent accumulation of pkcδ in the nucleus following treatment with fgf <dig>  our study is the first to show that pkcδ can physically interact with cx <dig> in osteoblastic cells, and that there is a pkcδ-dependent phosphorylation of cx <dig> at serine  <dig> that occurs in response to fgf <dig> administration. it is likely that multiple phosphorylations of cx <dig> occur, in addition to the one detected at serine  <dig>  as phosphorylation of serine  <dig> alone is not sufficient to result in the observed molecular weight shift of cx <dig> on sds-page gels to ~ <dig> kda  <cit> .

a similar interaction between cx <dig> and another novel pkc family member, pkcε, has been reported following fgf <dig> treatment in cardiomyocytes  <cit> . it is unclear whether the involvement of pkcδ in the fgf2-response and association with cx <dig> also occurs in cardiomyocytes, or whether this is an osteoblast-specific interaction. it would not be surprising that pkcδ could also associate with cx <dig> in cardiomyocytes, as fgf <dig>  pkcε, pkcδ and cx <dig> have all been implicated in cardioprotection following ischemia  <cit> . notably, in a previously reported study in osteoblasts, we did not detect a translocation of pkcε following fgf <dig> treatment in these cells, suggesting distinct roles for pkcδ and pkcε in the fgf2-response of bone forming cells  <cit> .

in this study, we report that pkcδ physically interacts with the c-terminal tail of cx <dig>  we speculate that the preferential interaction of pkcδ with the phosphorylated form of cx <dig> is because pkcδ directly phosphorylates cx <dig> . the fact that inhibition of pkcδ activity with rottlerin can prevent phosphorylation of cx <dig> at serine  <dig> indicates that, at a minimum, pkcδ lies upstream of cx <dig> phosphorylation, and that cx <dig> may be a direct substrate for pkcδ. alternately, it is possible that the phosphorylation of cx <dig> is a prerequisite for the docking of pkcδ with the cx <dig> c-terminal tail. future studies will explore these alternatives. it should also be noted that, while commonly used as an inhibitor of pkcδ, the specificity of rottlerin has been questioned  <cit> .

in total, these data support our model that cx <dig> affects osteoblast function by regulating signal transduction cascades. we predict that intercellular communication via gap junctions results in the sharing of signals/second messengers among coupled osteoblasts, permitting cells to respond more robustly to extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, hormonal signals or mechanical load. central to this model is the concept that cx <dig> serves as a docking platform for signaling complexes, recruiting them to the gap junction plaque where they can respond to transmitted signals/second messengers. previously, we had identified pkcδ as a mediator of the cx <dig> enhanced response of osteoblast to fgf <dig> but, it was unknown whether or not pkcδ was recruited to the cx <dig> gap junction plaque to participate in signaling  <cit> . now, we can add pkcδ to the growing number of signaling complexes that are recruited to and participate in signaling at the gap junction plaque.

by establishing the protein-protein interactions that can occur between gap junctions and signaling complexes, we gain valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms by which gap junctions/connexins can affect cellular signaling to ultimately affect cell function. additionally, we learn how gap junctions themselves may be regulated. indeed, phosphorylation of cx <dig> can affect its function/transport, including assembly of hemichannels, transport to the plasma membrane, channel gating and turnover  <cit> . furthermore, the clarification of these interactions lends insights into the biologically relevant molecules that may be propagated through gap junction channels. the activation of several signaling cascades downstream of the fgf2-fgf receptor complex generates second messengers that may transverse the gap junction channel. among the signal cascades activated by the fgf2-fgf receptor complex include ras-erk mapk cascade, phospholipase cγ, phospholipase d and cytosolic phospholipase a <dig>  which produce second messengers like inositol phosphate derivates, diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid, and calcium  <cit> . of note, several of these second messengers have been shown to regulate pkcδ activation  <cit> .

importantly, it is equally plausible that the role of cx <dig> in fgf-signaling is independent of its function as a permeable pore for direct cell-cell communications. connexins have been widely implicated as functioning as unpaired hemichannels  <cit> . furthermore, several studies have revealed important non-channel roles for connexins in cell function  <cit> . for example, it is possible that cx <dig> may affect fgf2-initiated signaling cascades and osteoblast function by sequestering signal complexes to cellular microdomains, altering mitochondrial function, direct nuclear shuttling or affecting signal complex turnover, independent of cell-cell communication.

future studies are needed to define the need for pkcδ protein docking with the cx <dig> gap junction channel. more specifically, if the proximal recruitment of pkcδ to the cx43-dependent "shared" messenger is required to transmit the amplification of the fgf <dig> response among osteoblasts. by studying the mechanism of action of gap junctions in transmitting signals among the cells of bone, we hope to be able to understand the role of gap junctions in how skeletal cells coordinate function during bone growth, remodeling and repair.

CONCLUSIONS
cx <dig> can serve as a direct docking platform for the recruitment of pkcδ in order to affect fgf <dig> signaling in osteoblasts. pkcδ is found to transiently associate with cx <dig> at cell-cell junctions, following stimulation with fgf <dig>  subsequently, pkcδ accumulates in the nucleus, where we have shown in a previous study that it alters transcription of key osteoblastic genes  <cit> . these data expand the list of signal molecules that assemble on the cx <dig> c-terminal tail and provide a critical context to understand how gap junctions modify signal transduction cascades in order to impact cell function.
