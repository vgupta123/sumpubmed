BACKGROUND
over the past decade, microarrays have evolved beyond high-throughput gene expression profiling to a wide variety of applications that include genotyping and resequencing. even more diverse are the biological venues where these new developments have been applied. this report describes a novel array-based assay that accurately identifies and quantifies nucleotide sequences that share extensive identity. such an approach has numerous applications including human leukocyte antigen  system, viral or bacterial genotyping, characterization microbial species within environmental samples, or as described here, the measurement of pathogen specific human memory t-cell repertoire diversity.

during the initiation of immune responses, individual t-cell clones recognize peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex  molecules through t-cell receptors . tcrs are heterodimers consisting of either α and β chains or γ and δ chains. each chain is composed of variable , diversity , joining , and constant  regions encoded by gene segments that undergo rearrangement during thymic t-cell development  <cit> . the shape and charge, and therefore tcr specificity is determined by the selection of the v, d and j genes, as well as the rearrangement process itself where nucleotides at junctions of the v, d, and j segments are added or removed. the portion of the tcr encoded at the rearrangement site is referred to as the third complementarity-determining region . any rearrangement utilizing the same v and j genes is identical except for the unique nucleotide sequence of the cdr <dig>  this sequence is considered to define a clonotype and serves as a fingerprint for the t-cell lineage bearing it. the frequency with which a particular tcr clonotype is encountered can be taken to be a measure of clonal expansion.

the amino acid sequence encoded by cdr <dig> conveys fine antigen specificity. often recognition of a particular antigen-mhc complex is mediated by tcr using identical v chains with very similar cdr amino acid sequences . because of the degeneracy of the genetic code this can lead to responses characterized by multiple clonotypes that encode identical cdr <dig> amino acid sequences.

since antigen specific t-cell responses are central to human immunity, and there is significant interest in the relationship between lymphocyte diversity and immunocompetence, the analysis of t-cell repertoires is highly relevant  <cit> . an individual α/β repertoire consists of an estimated  <dig> β chains, each pairing with a limited number of α chains, thus the complexity of the tcr makes analysis cumbersome  <cit> . molecular genetic approaches have been developed for analysis of tcr repertoires that involve amplification of cdna using c and v specific primers, or genomic dna between v and j specific primers, followed by separation of pcr products through denaturing gel electrophoresis. this approach, termed spectratyping, provides an estimation of the abundance of a particular v gene family relative to others as well as the different tcr based on their cdr <dig> length  <cit> . the highest resolution method for measuring and identifying t-cells within repertoires is to generate sequences of the cdr <dig>  this is known as clonotyping and can be accomplished by using pcr to amplify variable families from cdna followed by sub-cloning and sequencing the product to study repertoire structure  <cit> . such approaches have been found to give an unbiased measurement of tcr diversity  <cit> .

we have been studying the cytotoxic memory t-cell response to influenza virus  <cit> . the m1-derived epitope, m158– <dig>  an immunodominant peptide derived from influenza a virus, induces a strong cd <dig> t-cell response in hla-a <dig> individuals  <cit> . m158– <dig> bound to hlaa <dig>   is preferentially recognized by cd <dig> t-cells expressing β variable  <dig> chains  rearranged to jb <dig>  chains and possessing cdr <dig> regions with an "irss" amino acid motif. we have also observed that the memory repertoires are complex consisting of a few clonotypes observed often, many clonotypes observed once and others present in intermediate abundances. such complexity in memory repertoires implies a selection for multiple t-cell lineages and belies a simple selection process. we have already shown that different clonotypes may be needed at different stages in an immune response relative to pathogen density  <cit> . further work is required to study how this repertoire complexity changes with time, exposure to pathogen or immunization in a population of hla-a <dig> individuals.

in cases such as this, where a complex repertoire exhibits an identified, highly prevalent cdr <dig> amino acid motif, with individual clonotypes observed at different frequencies, an alternate high resolution approach to sub cloning and sequencing of family specific tcr vb pcr products would be to generate microarrays that represent all possible encoding of a particular motif. such an approach would enable a rapid, high-throughput measurement of clontypic diversity at the nucleotide level, thereby facilitating population-based studies aimed at better understanding the processes of memory repertoire selection. described here is a microarray assay that accurately identifies and quantifies t-cell repertoires for vb <dig> – jb <dig>  rearrangements possessing irss as the core amino acid sequence. because the final serine in the motif is often encoded by the j region gene, the actual number of possibilities encoding most encountered irss motifs is  <dig> .

the described assay represents the foundation of an expanding system to quantitatively measure a broader range of the memory repertoire that greatly simplifies the process of sampling immune repertoires in large populations over time. this specific application is directly relevant to laboratories investigating t-cell receptor usage, however, the overall strategy is applicable for quantitative genotyping of any complex mixture or highly polymorphic system where the constituent sequences differ by only one or a few nucleotides.

RESULTS
previously, we observed that t-cells of hla-a <dig> individuals responding to influenza m <dig> peptide utilized tcr rearrangements between the jb <dig>  and vb <dig> gene families possessing cdr <dig> regions encoding an "irss" amino acid motif  <cit> . therefore, our goal was to develop an oligonucleotide based-microarray for typing the presence and abundance of  <dig> cdr3β sequences encoding irss as the core amino acid motif. these  <dig> clonotypic sequences from vb <dig> – jb <dig>  expressing t cells account for  <dig> % of the memory repertoire in  <dig> individuals analyzed thus far.

the assay design is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the array is comprised of  <dig> 63-mer probes. the probes were designed with a  <dig> nucleotide 5'-region specific for the arabidopsis thaliana ltp <dig> gene; a  <dig> nucleotide polya spacer, and a  <dig> nucleotide irss-specific region  placed at the 3'-end of the probe. the a. thaliana specific region offers advantages in terms of quality control. first, it makes possible the hybridization of a single labeled complementary a. thaliana synthetic target to all elements of the array . second, since oligonucleotides are synthesized in a 3'→5' direction, robust a. thaliana signal provides control to the synthesis quality of the more important 3' cdr3β-specific region. this approach, combined with the use of a labeled tracking oligonucleotide that is co-spotted with the analyte-specific 63-mers  <cit> , provides control of both probe synthesis and array fabrication.

specificity of  <dig> irss-specific cdr3β probes
specificity is a major issue in any genotyping assay. previously, we have found short oligonucleotides useful in resolving alleles sharing extensive identity  <cit> . thus, we empirically optimized the length of the cdr3β-specific probe region to  <dig> nucleotides . in order to test the specificity of each of the  <dig> probes, complementary synthetic targets  were designed to precisely mimic the anti-sense strand of rt-pcr products generated by the vb <dig> and jb <dig> -specific oligonucleotide primers used for clonotyping.

the  <dig> irss clonotype sequences possess high degrees of identity, with any single clonotype differing by only one or a few nucleotides from any other . thus, the degree of cross-hybridization and its potential impact on identifying and quantifying specific cdr3β sequences was investigated. in general the measured intensity  of a probe i can be written as:

* entire probe sequence: 5'-gaa gag tat ggt ttc gta tac gta aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa axx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx-3' 

**entire synthetic target sequence: cy3–5'-cgg ccc gaa gta ctg ctc gta xxx xxx xxx xxx act act ggc aca gag ata gaa agc tgt cgg gtt ctt ttg g-3'

where αij is a factor that measures the degree of cross hybridization from probe j and ii is the intensity of probe i when there is no cross hybridization . to quantitatively evaluate cross hybridization ), each of the  <dig> synthetic targets were independently hybridized to printed slides possessing  <dig> replicate arrays. figure 2b illustrates such a hybridization. on each array , we expect all probe intensities to be zero  except the probe  for which corresponding synthetic target has been introduced. thus, αi,k was obtained for all i, k. this is represented by the color-map illustrated in figure 3a. although the specific hybridization of each synthetic target is clearly evident, variable degrees of cross hybridization existed between some synthetic target:probe combinations. we examined the dependence of cross hybridization  on the number of nucleotide differences between the possible synthetic target:probe pairs. such pairs constituted  <dig> % of all possible pairings , and as expected cross hybridization primary arose from pairs that differed by a single nucleotide . however, among all pairs that possess a single nucleotide difference, there is extensive heterogeneity in their cross hybridization, as evidenced by the large standard deviation.

when hybridizing known mixtures of synthetic target to the cdr3β array, we found that the resulting measured intensities did not correlate with the known input ratios. we have attributed this lack of linearity to differences in hybridization efficiency between the different irss encoding sequences, despite their high overall homlogy. although the signal derived from a cohybridized a. thaliana synthetic target is useful for array quality control, using it to normalize potentially different amounts of support-bound probe between spots did not improve the overall correlation of reconstitution experiments , lending support to the lack of linearity arising from differences in hybridization efficiency. thus, we designed a dual hybridization format where the signals of an equimolar mixture of all  <dig> cy3-labeled targets are used to normalize the cy5-labeled cdr3β rt-pcr patient/subject signal . since the normalizing mixture possesses all synthetic targets at an equal molar concentration, we would expect their intensity to be i <dig> = i <dig> = ... = i <dig> = i <dig>  where i <dig> is a constant and their measured intensity to be:

 mnorm,i=∑j=1108αijij=i0∑j=1108αij

in figure 3c the expected  and measured intensities for all synthetic targets are plotted where a linear relationship  is observed.

evaluation of assay quantitativeness through reconstitution studies
to evaluate the ability of the assay to accurately identify and quantify different cdr3β sequences within a complex mixture, reconstitution studies were performed. to avoid purchasing two sets of synthetic targets, these validation experiments were conducted in a single color format , with the normalizing equimolar mixture of all  <dig> synthetic targets hybridized to separate slides . twenty six unique test mixtures were prepared where  <dig> to  <dig> different synthetic targets  were introduced at percentages of  <dig> % to  <dig> %. the test mixtures possessed  <dig> to  <dig> total picomoles of synthetic target. within the  <dig> mixtures, each of the  <dig> clonotypes was measured at least  <dig> times at  <dig> different input percentages. each test mixture was analyzed through hybridization to  <dig> to  <dig> replicates arrays.

in each of the  <dig> mixes, the actual clonotype abundances were closely captured by measured abundances. the results of representative mixes are shown in figure 4a–b. we found the system sensitive to input percentages as low as  <dig> %. the data from all  <dig> mixes was collectively analyzed . despite some under estimation of high input percentages and some over estimation of low input percentages, good agreement between known input percentages and measured percentages was observed . overall, we observed intra and inter-slide variances of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. the data were examined to determine if any probe consistently over or under-measured its corresponding input percentage and no biases were detected . as reflected in figures 4a and 4b reliable measured percentages were observed within mixes down to the 2–3% input level, below which false-positive calls were detected. therefore the false discovery rate  <cit>  which was defined as fraction of clonotypes that reached the detection limit that were not introduced into the test mixture, at different detection sensitivities was examined. at a detection sensitivity of 4% or higher, the fdr was equal to  <dig>  at detection sensitivities between 3% and 1%, the fdr ranged from  <dig> % to 13%, respectively.

analysis of m158–66/hla-a <dig> -specific cd <dig> t-cell cultures by traditional clonotyping and array analysis
to validate the array in t-cell repertoire analysis, it was used to analyze human recall responses to influenza m158– <dig> restricted by hla-a <dig>  three human subjects were analyzed . in each case triplicate t-cell cultures were propagated  then analyzed by microarray and traditional clonotyping. short term recall cultures are a standard assay for increasing the frequency of antigen-specific clonotypes in the sample. this occurs because the specific t cells expand and some of the non-specific t cells die out in the cultures. cultures are performed in triplicate to control for the variation that arises in a complex biological response in vitro.

rna extracted from each culture was reverse transcribed, and amplified with forward and reverse primers targeting the vb <dig> and jb <dig>  segments, respectively. in the case of the microarray analysis, the product was amplified with cy <dig> labeled jb <dig>  primer, purified and hybridized, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  with the traditional approach, unlabeled product was cloned into a plasmid vector, transformed into escherichia coli, plated, and  <dig> colonies per culture  were sequenced to establish clonal diversity.

in the reconstitution studies, we determined that at a sensitivity of detection ≥ 4% the fdr was equal to  <dig>  when comparing the microarray data to traditional clonotyping under these strictest standards , we observe that on average, the array detects slightly more clonotypes than does cloning and sequencing . in subject a, the array detected  <dig> clonotypes not observed by cloning, while cloning identified  <dig> clonotype not observed by the array. in subject b, the array detected  <dig> clonotype not observed by cloning, while cloning detected  <dig> clonotypes not observed by the array. in subject c, the array detected  <dig> clonotypes not observed by cloning, while cloning identified  <dig> clonotypes not observed by the array.

if the data is examined using a 1% sensitivity of detection  the total number of clonotypes detected the by array analysis among the three subjects increases from  <dig> to  <dig>  this increased sensitivity of  <dig> additional clonotypes would be predicted to include approximately  <dig> false positives. at this stringency, the array detected nearly twice as many clonotypes than did cloning/sequencing . in analysis a, the array detected  <dig> clonotypes not observed by cloning, while cloning identified  <dig> clonotype not observed by the array. in analysis b, the array detected  <dig> clonotypes not observed by cloning, while cloning detected  <dig> clonotypes not observed by the array. in analysis c, the array detected  <dig> clonotypes not observed by cloning, while cloning identified  <dig> clonotypes not observed by the array.

among subjects a, b and c there were respectively  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clonotypes commonly detected by the array and cloning/sequencing. when evaluating the rank order of clonotype abundance determined by each method, the approaches are not significantly different .

discussion
in this report, we describe a spotted oligonucleotide microarray application for the investigation of cytotoxic memory t-cell repertoires against influenza matrix protein, m158– <dig> in hla-a <dig> individuals. this expandable approach specifically identifies  <dig> highly related cdr3β sequences that encode the irss core amino acid motif and accurately quantifies their relative abundances within a complex mixture. the design, development, and use of this assay depended on the use of novel strategies to control for array fabrication variables and vendor oligonucleotide synthesis quality, as well as to normalize differences in hybridization efficiencies between the closely related target sequences.

the microarray application described here is unlike most array assays. typically, the arrayed probes represent up to tens of thousands of independent parallel assays, where each probe measures the relative abundance of a single distinct gene among the samples being compared. in this application each of the  <dig> cdr3β-specific probes measure the contribution of individual clonotypes within a single sample to define the t-cell repertoire. in order for the repertoire to be accurately measured, it is paramount to control any array fabrication and/or oligonucleotide probe variables that might lead to erroneously high or low signal intensities at any given address on the array. the susceptibility of spotted microarrays to fabrication-based quality control issues is well documented  <cit> . when array imaging is conducted with confocal laser scanners possessing narrow bandwidths, fluorescein is compatible with the commonly used cyanine dyes. thus, we typically tag cdna probes during amplification using fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide primers  <cit> . however, fluorescently modifying oligonucleotide probe sets is cost prohibitive, therefore, we co-spot a fluorescein-labeled "tracking" oligonucleotide at low molarity with the target-specific probes  <cit>  when printing oligonucleotide arrays. in either case, labeling the array with a third fluorophore, enables array quality control prior to hybridization of potentially precious samples to substandard arrays.

as useful as the tracking oligonucleotide is, it is not fully informative in controlling oligonucleotide synthesis. the novel dual specificity probe design described here possesses a 5'-region specific for the a. thaliana ltp <dig> gene intended to facilitate evaluation of probe synthesis. this region is synthesized after the 3' cdr3β-specific region, thus as shown in figure 2a, a single hybridization with a. thaliana ltp <dig> synthetic target can provide control of oligonucleotide synthesis for the entire probe set. thus, using the a. thaliana ltp <dig> signal intensity it is possible to show relative equality of the probes across the array, a necessary prerequisite to specificity testing of each probe with the synthetic targets. an unexplored and more costly alternative to ensure immobilization of full-length probes would be to print 5' amine modified oligonucleotides onto slides coated with n-hydroxysuccinimide  ester reactive groups. we have also empirically determined that the 63-mer probe design yields better signal intensities upon hybridization of synthetic targets compared to 17-mer probes encompassing only the cdr3β, despite the high surface density that can be achieved by printing the short probe . this effect is attributable to the possibility that labeled target molecules may have less steric interference and greater access to the longer probes  <cit> . thus, our probe design provides a means of synthesis quality control, possesses a short cdr3β-specific region for high specificity, yet is of sufficient length to generate robust hybridization signals.

in typical array-based gene expression or genotyping applications, it is desirable that all the probes on the array possess similar hybridization characteristics, however, minor performance differences are tolerable since comparisons of different samples are made across a single probe. in this application, single samples are quantitatively analyzed over multiple probes, making it necessary to account for differences in probe efficiencies. having quantified the performance of probes for the  <dig> irss encoding cdr3β clonotypes it is theoretically possible to mathematically correct differences in hybridization efficiency. in practice we found that this approach is cumbersome. although the array performs in a predictable manner, the exact degree of correction for each probe is dependent on experimental conditions and array fabrication. thus, proper mathematical correction would require implementing sophisticated algorithms to correct for the inter-experiment differences. this is neither realistic nor convenient. in view of the situation, we have instead designed a practical approach that employs hybridization of the equimolar mixture cy3-labeled synthetic targets to allow normalization of differences in hybridization efficiencies between probes.

spectratyping and clonotyping have been the mainstays of analyzing tcr diversity for over a decade, however, in addition to the strategy described here, other array-based strategies have been employed. ogle et al.,  <cit>  directly measured lymphocyte receptor diversity by utilizing the cross-hybridization patterns of t or b cell transcripts to affymetrix genechips. more recently, bonarius et al.,  <cit>  interrogated tcr diversity by first hybridizing cdr3-specific "annealers" to amplified product, which in turn were ligated to a random hexamer array. while this elegant approach provides a measurement of the overall t-cell repertoire, it has not been shown able to quantitatively resolve clonotypes differing by a single nucleotide.

CONCLUSIONS
we have validated this new array strategy through reconstitution studies, using known mixtures of synthetic target , as well as through comparison to traditional cloning and sequencing of vb17-jb <dig>  pcr product . these studies show that array-based clonotyping is a reliable, efficient, and cost effective approach that is at least as informative as traditional clonotyping. while unmodified 63-mer probes are very affordable, the set of labeled synthetic targets for normalization are relatively expensive. however, the reagent costs required to set up this type of array-based genotyping system can be distributed over thousands of analyses. thus, in terms of both materials and labor, the cost of clonotyping by array is less that than cloning and sequencing. the array based method is also more direct in that there are fewer steps between rt-pcr and data acquisition, thus exhaustive cloning and its potential biases are avoided. as with any genotyping assay, one must have knowledge of the sequences being assayed, therefore a practical limitation of the approach is the requirement for a priori knowledge of the tcr usage of the t-cell response under analysis. once this has been established, the array based approach allows for much higher through-put making more feasible population based studies of the human immune response to influenza a. these efforts lay the foundation for expanding the clonotyping array to cover additional motifs, including those vb17-jb <dig>  rearrangements encoding irsa, vrss, mrsa, and srss, relevant to monitoring memory responses to influenza a. the approach used here is broadly applicable to situations where complex mixtures of highly homologous sequences need to be quantitatively resolved. examples of such applications include hla typing, viral or bacterial genotyping and characterization microbial species within environmental samples.
