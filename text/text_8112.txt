BACKGROUND
fitting quantitative phenotypes from genome-wide data is a rapidly emerging research area, also object of dedicated data contests  <cit> . given the complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying many common human diseases, one of the most significant challenges to catch genetic variations associated to functional effects is enabling a modeling approach that is really multivariate and predictive  <cit> . in particular, it is clear that modeling should be based on patterns of multiple snps  rather than on single snps. attention is thus directed towards machine learning methods that can provide snp selection simultaneously with the regression model, and manage high-order interactions and correlation effects among features. in this view, a handy off-the-shelf solution is the application of the random forest method  <cit> , available with fast implementations  both for classification  or regression . regarding the haplotype data pattern problem, new kernel functions have been proposed for predictive classification by support vector machines  in a cross-validation experimental framework  <cit> .

given that flexible machine learning methods for genotype data are becoming available, the second top challenge is building around the modeling exercise a framework that controls the sources of variability involved in the process. lack of reproducibility in gwas has been investigated and is known to have multiple causes  <cit> . some of the technical causes may well transfer to genotype analyses by multivariate machine learning. specifically, it is critical to consider the risk of selection bias  <cit>  to warrant that predictive values and molecular markers be reproducible across studies on massive genotype datasets. the issue of reproducibility regards the whole sequence of preparatory and preprocessing steps , model selection, application and validation .

baggerly and coombes  <cit>  proposed a “forensic bioinformatics” approach to revise a highly-influential series of medical papers on genomic signatures predicting response to chemotherapeutic agents. their attempt at reproduction of the original results led to the discovery of a series of fatal flaws on data preparation and application of methods to publicly-available microarray and preclinical chemo-sensitivity data for several cancer cell lines. a series of clinical trials has been suspended as a consequence. for machine learning methods, the stage of model selection is usually the most complex. to overcome variability and bias effects arising from choices hidden in the modeling path, a serious effort has been provided by the fda’s led initiatives maqc and maqc-ii  <cit> . in particular, for classifiers of microarray data, the maqc-ii consortium has studied how predictivity and stability of biomarkers is associated to the type of adopted data analysis protocol , intended as a standardized description of all steps in training, model selection and validation on novel data  <cit> . the type of internal and external validation methods used for selection of the best markers and models results as one of the main effects on predictive accuracy. interactive effects of choices in the analysis design  have been demonstrated also in gwas in an extension of the maqc-ii study  <cit> . however, limited efforts have been directed to detailed daps in the regression framework, and on genotype data in particular. in this work we propose a machine learning regression approach for genome-to-phenotype prediction to improve the use of quantitative phenotypes as target variables in functional genomics. we consider first a standard support vector regression  algorithm and then the l1l <dig> regression  <cit>  approach. the machine learning methods are part of a software pipeline that implements a complete dap for regression on genotype data. the l1l <dig> pipeline also includes a model selection module based on the concept of stability of ranked lists, previously developed for genomic profiling  <cit> . a procedure testing for markers highly correlated and proximal on the chromosome, termed saturation, is also provided in the pipeline. we present examples of prediction of quantitative phenotypes on a genomewide dataset of 12k snps. the dataset used in this study , which we will refer to as the ”gscan dataset”, is publicy available , courtesy of the wellcome trust center for human genetics. data include familiar, genotype and phenotype information from a population of  <dig> generations of heterogeneous stock mice  <cit> . two quantitative phenotypes were used: the percentage of cd8+ cells , and the mean cell haemoglobin . the number of samples is  <dig> for %cd8+ and  <dig> for mch. the results from our methods are compared with those of a reversible jump monte carlo markov chain  model adapted to fitting quantitative phenotypes and applied to the same dataset  <cit> .

RESULTS
for comparability with the reference study  <cit> , the accuracy was measured as the squared correlation coefficient between the predicted phenotype and its actual value on test data, according to an appropriate dap. the dap for svr was chosen so to replicate the one used in  <cit> . since this dap is prone to introduce selection bias , we chose a stricter dap for l1l <dig>  thus limiting the overestimation of its predictive performance. the learning pipeline was first applied to a dataset where phenotype values had been randomly shuffled in order to check for predictions based on random associations. the prediction accuracy resulted close to zero for svr and l1l <dig> regression methods, as expected. predicted accuracy values for the complete experiment are listed in tab.  <dig>  squared correlation coefficients for the three methods were averaged over  <dig> re-samplings of the development/validation splits. the results shown for svr have been obtained with a gaussian kernel , and figures for the reference mcmc method are reproduced from  <cit> . for mch, table  <dig> shows an average performance indicator of  <dig>  against  <dig>  of mcmc, corresponding to an increase of 32%. the increase is statistically significant with respect to both mcmc and l1l2: a p-value <  <dig>  was obtained using a t-test . for cd8+, the same p-values were respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> : therefore, the difference in the average performances is not statistically significant, i.e. the three methods are equivalent on this phenotype. for each experiment, the l1l <dig> pipeline yields lists of features ranked by the regression weights. unlike l1l <dig>  the gaussian kernel svr is unable to provide lists of ranked feature: therefore, a linear svr was used to select features with this approach. the predictive accuracy of the linear svr was significantly lower than all three reported methods on both phenotypes . for both l1l <dig> and linear svr, we term ’top-ranked’ the snps in the top 10-percentile of the distribution of the weights for at least  <dig> of  <dig> experiments. these snps are systematically and significantly associated to the given trait. however, correlation between features is characteristic of high throughput molecular data and it is well-known that correlated, functionally important variables may be discarded or poorly ranked. the process of recovering these additional variables is termed saturation. we thus introduce the notion of ’top-correlated’ markers, i.e. snps whose population profiles are highly correlated  with those of top-ranked snps. table  <dig> shows the characteristics of top-correlated snps with respect to their relative top-ranked snp. only top-ranked snps with at least  <dig> top-correlated snps are shown. the distributions of the chromosome distance and of the regression weights of top-correlated snps were analyzed for several values of correlation thresholds . top-correlated snps are clustered around the reference top-ranked snps  and as the correlation threshold increases the median of the distribution of distances decreases quickly. the addition of top-correlated snps as candidate features for the regression model provides a saturation strategy that may help defining non-punctual loci of interest on the chromosomes. fig. 1b shows that top-correlated snps are generally assigned higher regression weights from the l1l <dig> algorithm, although some of them are eliminated . thus the impact of the saturation procedure is expected to be limited on the regression model, while yielding a more dense set of candidate markers. the approach has been compared on the gscan dataset with a previous gwas  <cit> . in fig.  <dig> we pool top-ranked and top-correlated snps  for the cd8+ phenotype and both methods, and show their position on the genome against gwas candidate loci  <cit> . loci selected by both svr and l1l <dig> overlap on most of those selected by the gwas. stability of features is crucial for reproducibility and identification of the most relevant biomarkers. the accuracy-stability diagnostic plot in fig.  <dig> for the l1l <dig> method and cd8+ phenotype shows that the same parameter set is optimal on each of the  <dig> runs .

the squared correlation coefficient between predicted and true values is computed from the pipeline in fig.  <dig> by different methods, with 95% bootstrap confidence interval in brackets. mcmc results are reproduced from  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
prediction of quantitative phenotypes from high-throughput genotype data is an emerging research goal with significant applications. it can be envisioned that this predictive modeling problem will evolve into fitting a multidimensional phenotype pattern or a phenotype trajectory. more sophisticated predictive tools still need to be developed to achieve this goal, but it is anyway urgent to deploy experimental setups that can appropriately support model selection and biomarker identification. here we introduced a framework for the systematic use of machine learning regression methods on whole-genome datasets. building on results from the fda’s led maqc-ii initiative, the framework includes a pipeline of procedures  to avoid selection bias and ensure reproducibility. the application of the pipeline to up to  <dig>  <dig> features was made feasible by an efficient software implementation, also suitable for high performance computing facilities. a dap reproducing those of the original study  <cit>  and employing a gaussian kernel svr obtained results comparable with the mcmc method. however the model selection solution does not protect from overfitting and cannot directly derive a list of selected snp. the l1l <dig> method was as accurate as the reference study despite the use of a more stringent dap, and it is able to provide an embedded feature selection which has shown to cope well with the problem of recovering correlated variables. an adjuvant therapy to the issue of correlated variables was proposed with the snp saturation procedure, based on the concept of top-correlated features. the saturation procedure can be seen as a black box algorithm within the pipeline that automates an analysis by linkage disequilibrium after one biomarker is found. snp saturation also reduces spatial sparsity, because the additional markers are in general close to the top-ranked markers, as shown on the gscan data. the finding opens the possibility of encoding by special kernels feature and spatial correlation together.

the l1l <dig> pipeline also makes use of a model selection criterium aimed at increasing the stability of the list of candidate markers. as a result, the features selected by l1l <dig> are compatible with results of a previous gwas on the same dataset  <cit> . this study confirms that machine learning approaches may support a more effective and reproducible use of multivariate genotype data for the prediction of quantitative traits  <cit> .
