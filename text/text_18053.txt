BACKGROUND
earth's environments exhibit the most diverse physico-chemical conditions, including extremes of temperature, pressure, salinity and ph. among these factors, temperature certainly exerts a deep selective pressure on cell biochemistry and physiology  <cit> . indeed, temperatures approaching 100°c usually denature proteins and nucleic acids, and increase the fluidity of membranes to lethal levels  <cit> . it is therefore of great interest to study how organisms coped with the molecular adaptations required to thrive in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures. such organisms, which are distributed among the three domains of life, are called "thermophiles" or "hyperthermophiles", if they exhibit an optimal growth in either a 45°c – 80°c or a 80°c – 110°c temperature range, respectively  <cit> .

to date, a number of studies has been carried out to understand how proteins found in hyper/thermophilic organisms are stabilized  <cit> . thanks to the wealth of sequence and structural information available today on hyper/thermophilic proteins, it is becoming clear that there is not a general rule for the stabilization of proteins at high temperatures. rather, an increased thermal stability seems to be achieved through a combination of different small structural modifications involving, amongst the others, ion-pairs interactions, hydrogen bonds and packing of hydrophobic residues  <cit> .

regarding the latter, one frequently invoked theory is that the packing of hydrophobic side chains is improved in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins, when compared to their mesophilic counterparts  <cit> . many studies on proteins adaptation to high temperatures focused on the differences in compactness between hyper/thermophilic and mesophilic proteins using accessible surface area  <cit>  or cavity size  <cit>  as judgment criteria. however, as discussed by robinson-rechavi and godzik  <cit> , and by gromiha  <cit> , these approaches present several drawbacks, e.g., the individual contribution to the enhanced thermostability of different structural environments and inter-residue contacts cannot be assessed. hence, alternative ways to quantify protein compactness were adopted. for example, gromiha  <cit>  analyzed the long range and inter-residue contacts in mesophilic and thermophilic proteins of sixteen different protein families, and found that an increase in contacts between hydrogen-bond forming residues increases protein stability. very recently, the contact order  <cit>  is receiving increasing attention, thanks to the findings obtained by godzik and his research group  <cit> , who found that hyperthermophilic proteins from t. maritima have higher contact order than their mesophilic counterparts. most importantly, contact order is correlated to the folding rate of proteins that fold with a two-states mechanism  <cit> .

however, a severe limitation of this and other  <cit>  studies is that two residues are considered to be in contact if the distance between their cα atoms or between one atom and any other atom is below an arbitrary threshold. for example, robinson-rechavi et al.  <cit>  considered two residues to be in contact if any of their atoms are closer than  <dig>  Å, while gromiha  <cit>  made use of a sphere of  <dig>  Å centered on cα atoms to define long-range contacts. furthermore, this approach bears another important drawback: it does not permit to quantify the hydrophobic contact area between two interacting residues. the hydrophobic contact area between buried residues represents in fact an indirect measure of both entropic  and enthalpic  effects .

therefore, despite a series of experimental and theoretical studies on the molecular mechanisms of protein folding  <cit>  and stability  <cit>  argued that the hydrophobic contacts play a role of paramount importance in such processes, the difference of apolar contact area between large datasets of proteins from hyper/thermophilic organisms and their mesophilic homologs, to our knowledge, has been never quantified.

such consideration, along with the wealth of information provided very recently by structural genomics projects, prompted the comparison of a large number of protein crystal structures from hyper/thermophilic organisms and their mesophilic homologs, in order to assess the role played by the hydrophobic contacts in the stabilization of the protein core, at high temperatures.

RESULTS
analysis of the apolar contact area
two datasets were obtained from a collection of  <dig> hyperthermophilic and thermophilic proteins, retrieved from structural databases using several keywords . in the first case a choice criteria favouring quality over quantity of data yielded a non redundant dataset, which will be referred to as "a", including  <dig> crystal structures, lacking any structural defect and displaying a maximum resolution of  <dig>  Å and a maximum r-value of  <dig> . dataset a represents a subset of a second dataset, which will be referred to as "b". dataset b is composed of  <dig> crystal structures lacking any structural defect, displaying a maximum resolution of  <dig>  Å and a maximum r-value of  <dig> . for each structure composing the two datasets, a mesophilic homologous counterpart was collected, following the same above mentioned choice criteria. the computation of the total apolar contact area  between the residues of each structure pair composing dataset a and b was then carried out. the statistical significance of the observed differences of aca between hyper/thermophilic proteins and their mesophilic counterparts was assessed with a paired t-test. the results are reported in table  <dig> . t-test values are expressed as the associated probability p of acceptance of the null hypothesis, that is, there are no significant differences of aca between hyper/thermophilic and mesophilic pairs. t-values scoring >  <dig>   <  <dig> ) are considered statistically significant. figure  <dig> shows the difference of apolar contact area computed over the whole structures of the protein pairs composing the two analysed datasets. the obtained values were normalized by the sequence length of each protein. in dataset a,  <dig>  of the  <dig> considered protein pairs showed an increase of the aca ; the corresponding p was ~ <dig>  . in dataset b,  <dig>  of the  <dig> protein pairs showed an increase of the aca ; the corresponding p was ~ <dig>  . although the obtained differences were not considered statistically significant, according to the t-test validation analysis, for both datasets , nonetheless they indicated a general increase of the apolar contact area in hyperthermophilic proteins, compared to their mesophilic counterparts.

a more detailed analysis on the structurally conserved regions  <cit>   of the structures composing dataset a and b indicated that, in both datasets, a number of hyperthermophilic proteins underwent a highly significant  <  <dig> ) increase of the hydrophobic contact area of those residues composing the scrs . scrs were defined as regions displaying a similar local conformation, lacking insertions and deletions and composed of at least three consecutive residues. scrs are therefore protein segments that conserve the same main-chain conformation in each pair of structures analysed, excluding the intervening regions whose structure differs markedly amongst different proteins  <cit> . considering the role of great importance played by the hydrophobic contacts in stabilizing and possibly driving the protein folding mechanism, it seemed interesting to analyse how, during evolution, the scrs coped with the modifications of the hydrophobic contacts necessary to achieve the correct fold at high temperatures. in dataset a ,  <dig>  of the  <dig> considered protein pairs showed an increase of the aca  ~ <dig> ). the same trend was also observed for dataset b , in which  <dig> of  <dig> protein pairs  displayed an increased aca in the direction mesophile → hyper/thermophile  ~ <dig> ). the measured mean Δaca was  <dig>  Å2/residue and  <dig>  Å2/residue for datasets a and b, respectively. however, if only the hyperthermophilic/mesophilic pairs were considered, the mean Δaca was  <dig>  Å2/residue and  <dig>  Å2/residue for datasets a and b, respectively. the maximum measured difference was  <dig>  Å2/residue for the pair 1v7r/1k7k . since these quite high differences of aca can be due to other factors than acquired thermostability , the t-test validation analysis was repeated without these extreme pairs, obtaining again not significant results .

to get a deeper insight into the statistically significant increase of the hydrophobic contact area of protein cores from hyperthermophilic organisms, the possible occurrence of a larger amount of hydrophobic contact area has been examined in different secondary structure elements. in dataset a ,  <dig> out of the  <dig> hyperthermophilic proteins considered showed an increase of aca in the α-helices of the protein core, compared to their mesophilic counterparts, while in dataset b  the same ratio was  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins, with a measured significance p ~ <dig>  and p ~ <dig>  for datasets a and b, respectively. although in this latter case significant deviations from normality, as judged by the application of the shapiro-wilk normality test, were observed for the distribution of mesophilic values, nonetheless removing three outliers gave a shapiro-wilk p ~ <dig>  and a t-test p ~ <dig> . these results indicated that α-helices are mainly involved in the increased amount of hydrophobic contact area which was observed comparing hyperthermophilic/mesophilic proteins. conversely, no statistically significant trends have been observed in the comparison of the aca in the β-strands of the scrs . in dataset a,  <dig>  of the  <dig> considered protein pairs showed an increase of the aca, while in dataset b,  <dig>  of the  <dig> pairs exhibited an increase of the aca. the mean value of Δaca is - <dig>  Å2/residue and  <dig>  Å2/residue for dataset a and b. therefore, at least for the hyperthermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs, it can be concluded that the statistically significant increase of the hydrophobic contact area of protein cores involves mainly the α-helices and not the β-strands.

differences in the amino acid composition of the residues involved in conserved hydrophobic contacts
the differences of amino acid composition of the residues involved in conserved hydrophobic contacts   <cit>  between hyperthermophilic proteins and their mesophilic counterparts is expressed in units of standard deviation from the measured mean value, raa. raa values >  <dig> or <  <dig> indicate, respectively, a frequency of residue type aa higher or lower than the expected mean. raa values ≥  <dig>  standard deviations  from the mean value  were considered statistically significant. compositional analysis shows no statistically significant differences between hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins, regarding the identity of the residues involved in the formation of hydrophobic contacts, except for isoleucine, that scored at ~ <dig>  standard deviations from the mean in both datasets a and b. it is important to emphasize that, in evaluating the differences of amino acid composition of the residues involved in conserved hydrophobic contacts, dataset b, containing  <dig> hyperthermophilic/mesophilic protein pairs more than dataset a, is probably more confident. in any case, since both datasets a and b gave very similar results, the role played by isoleucine is probably independent from the number and type of structures analysed.

preferred amino acid interactions in conserved hydrophobic contacts
in order to further investigate the statistically significant increase of isoleucine in chcs of hyperthermophilic proteins, compared to their mesophilic counterparts, an analysis was carried out to infer which amino acid pairs are preferred in the formation of hydrophobic contacts. preferred amino acid pairs forming hydrophobic contacts were identified by computing the number of times a particular pair of residues comprised in scrs makes a hydrophobic contact, displaying an apolar contact area >  <dig>  Å <dig>  the results of this analysis are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  where each element ij of the interaction matrix reports, in units of standard deviation from the mean value, the measured frequency of interaction between residue i and residue j. for dataset a, accounting for  <dig> apolar contacts, five types of interactions  showed a frequency ≥  <dig>  standard deviations from the mean value; in every case, isoleucine is involved in such interactions. similar results were obtained for dataset b, where  <dig> interactions were counted: of six types of interactions scoring at >  <dig>  standard deviations, five  involved the amino acid isoleucine. the other statistically significant interaction is between glutamate and lysine, scoring at  <dig>  standard deviations from the mean. the closeness between the apolar atoms composing glu and lys residues might be only a secondary effect in the generation of strong ion-pairs between these two residues.

preferred amino acid substitutions in conserved hydrophobic contacts
favoured amino acid substitutions between the hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins were calculated from the results obtained by the chc_find tool  <cit> . the residues exchange analysis was indeed limited to the identified conserved hydrophobic contacts. the obtained substitution matrices are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  values are expressed in units of standard deviation from the mean. only values scoring at  <dig>  standard deviations or more from the mean were considered statistically significant. again, almost all of the most significant exchanges involve isoleucine in both datasets . these exchanges are reflected in the variation of average amino acid composition of hyperthermophiles , where a marked increase of isoleucine content can be detected. the only other exchange observed not involving isoleucine is ala→val, scoring at  <dig>  standard deviations from the mean.

discussion
the main goal of this study was to evaluate on a quantitative basis the relationship between hydrophobic contacts and proteins adaptation to high temperatures.

an essential prerequisite to carry out such a study is to assemble a large and minimally redundant set of very high resolution crystal structures. indeed, despite the observation that each protein family seems to adopt different structural strategies to adapt to high temperatures  <cit> , common trends may be outlined if a large number of structural data is available  <cit> . at the same time, since computed values of apolar contact area are mostly influenced by the relative position of the interacting residues, their precision is affected by the resolution of the crystal structures analysed. therefore two datasets were culled from a set of  <dig> crystal structures from thermophilic  and hyperthermophilic  organisms, and their mesophilic counterparts. the rationale of this choice was to assure that the obtained results were not biased either by the paucity of data, or by the quality of the collected crystal structures.

as already discussed by chen et al.  <cit> , the increase of the apolar contact area in hyperthermophilic and thermophilic proteins may be achieved at least by two different mechanisms: an evenly distributed increase over all residues; a local increase over key residues. the latter mechanism, that has been shown to be a major contribute to the enhanced thermostability of proteins from t. maritima  <cit> , seems to involve mainly residues already implied in the formation of hydrophobic contacts. this suggests that a better compactness may originate from an even better connectivity in those protein regions that already have a tendency to compactness and not by simply "tightening the loops"  <cit> . the results obtained in this work on the difference of apolar contact area  agree with this hypothesis: a significant increase of aca was measured in both datasets only when the analysis was limited to the scrs of the hyperthermophilic structures. the scrs were presumably subject to similar constraints during the divergent evolution of a family of proteins from a common ancestor, and therefore they possibly contain most of the determinants necessary to maintain the fold. considering the role played by hydrophobic contacts in this sense, it is not surprising that the residues composing the scrs and engaging hydrophobic contacts were mostly involved in the structural modifications necessary to achieve and maintain a proper fold at high temperatures. moreover, the finding that the measure of the difference of aca resulted highly significant only when limited to the scrs, could explain some apparently not significant results previously obtained by measuring accessible surface area  <cit>  or cavity size  <cit> .

the statistically significant increase of ~ <dig>  Å2/residue of apolar contact area was observed only in the scrs of hyperthermophilic proteins. therefore, it can be argued that proteins from thermophilic organisms usually adopt different strategies to enhance thermostability. indeed, it has been demonstrated that moderately and extremely thermostable proteins rely on different mechanisms to achieve greater stability  <cit> . ion-pairs interactions represent presumably a predominant force in thermophilic proteins, as well as in many hyperthermophilic proteins  <cit> . on the other hand, comparisons of mesophilic and hyperthermophilic protein structures indicate that the hydrophobic effect has a contribution to stability only at high temperatures, while only moderately thermophilic proteins show an increase in the polarity of their exposed surface  <cit> . two factors could be responsible for this difference: the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic forces involved in protein stabilization, and/or the phylogenetic origin of the extremely thermophilic organisms, that belong to the domain archaea, and are therefore distinct from moderately thermophilic organisms, which are mostly bacteria. in any case, the obtained results strongly suggest that packing of hyperthermophilic proteins, in comparison with their mesophilic homologs, has improved significantly, and it is reasonable to deduce that this increased amount of apolar contact area contributes to the stabilization of the native state of the protein.

our analysis revealed that α-helices were mainly involved in the increased amount of aca. surprisingly, no statistically significant trends have been observed in the comparison of the aca in the β-strands of the scrs. we cannot provide a clear explanation of this different behaviour between secondary structures. an intriguing possibility is that β-strands are, generally, already almost optimally packed, even in mesophilic proteins, resulting in a small margin of improvement. however, it is also possible that this observation is due to 'sample bias' e.g., the peculiarities of the available protein structures.

structural stabilization of α-helices in protein cores may therefore represent a component of great importance for the enhanced termostability of hyperthermophilic proteins. a number of studies in the past has stressed the importance of the enhanced stability of α-helices as a general feature of many hyperthermophilic proteins. in order to investigate the role of α-helices in protein thermostability, petukhov et al.  <cit>  compared energy characteristics of α-helices from four families of hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins, using statistical mechanical theory for describing helix/coil transitions. they found that the magnitude of the observed decrease in intrinsic free energy on α-helix formation of the thermostable proteins was sufficient to explain the experimentally determined increase of their thermostability. furthermore, protein engineering studies showed that a well-packed α-helix structure is related to large increase in thermostability  <cit> . it is well known that the flexibility of α-helices is often required to assure protein function, such as conformational transitions in substrate binding or protein-protein interactions  <cit> . however, an excessive flexibility of this secondary structure element, at high temperatures, could result in an insufficient stability to maintain its native conformation, causing the entire protein to unfold.

according to thermodynamic studies on model peptides in aqueous environments, two main factors appear to play a key role in the structural stability of the α-helices: the presence of amino acids with intrinsic helical propensity, and side chain-side chain interactions  <cit> . therefore, we further investigated the nature of the increased stabilization of α-helices composing the scrs of hyperthermostable proteins, determining the differences in amino acid composition of the residues involved in chcs. the results of this analysis strongly suggest that isoleucine and, to a lesser extent valine, mostly to the detriment of leucine, are involved in the formation of more hydrophobic contacts in hyperthermophilic proteins, compared to their mesophilic counterparts. likewise, the importance of isoleucine in the formation of chcs of hyperthermophilic proteins was confirmed by the analysis of the preferred amino acid interactions in chcs, where almost all types of interactions scoring at >  <dig>  standard deviations involved the amino acid isoleucine, and by the favoured amino acid substitutions between the hyperthermophilic and mesophilic proteins in chcs. a large amount of theoretical and experimental studies demonstrates the importance of isoleucine in the stabilization of protein structures from thermophilic organisms. malakauskas and mayo  <cit>  reported the computer-aided engineering of a seven-fold mutant of the β <dig> domain of the streptococcal protein g, exhibiting a melting temperature above 100°c and an enhancement in thermodynamic stability of  <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> at 50°c over the wild-type protein. of seven mutations, five were of type xxx→ ile, and they improved side-chain packing in the interior of the protein. an increased content of isoleucine in thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins, to the detriment of leucine, was also noted by haney et al.  <cit>  and kumar et al.  <cit> . more recently, a structural genomics based study carried out by chakravarty and varadarajan  <cit>  reported that leucine is preferentially substituted by the β-branched residues valine and isoleucine, at buried sites.

several studies have demonstrated in the past that leucine has a slightly higher α-helix propensity than isoleucine and, generally, β-branched residues  <cit> . this assumption, which is apparently in contrast with the results obtained by this work, derives from substitution experiments in short polyalanine α-helices-forming peptides in water  <cit> . this process is mainly associated with the loss of conformational entropy of residues during the folding of α-helices in an aqueous environment: freezing side chain with fewer internal rotational degrees in the α-helix conformation would be entropically less expensive. however, it must be noted that these experiments, and many derived propensity scales, do not take into account solvent entropy effects. as discussed by creamer and rose  <cit> , neglect of solvent entropy appears justified for a peptide side chain because no significant differences in solvation energy are expected in the side chain of a solitary polyalanyl helix during a helix-coil transition. in either case, the side chain is highly solvent-exposed. the same situation would not be appropriate for a protein helix that, upon association with the remainder of the molecule, engages a solvent-shielded interaction surface. in this study, only the α-helices composing the scrs and therefore mostly found in the protein core were considered for further investigation. therefore, application of helix propensity scales might be not appropriate in this case. for example, li and deber  <cit>  have shown that α-helices propensity scales are not appropriate for non aqueous environments and that β-branched amino acids, as valine and isoleucine, rank among the best helix promoters in an apolar environment, as a lipid bilayer.

on the other side, hydrophobic contacts deriving by side chain interactions could play a role of great importance in the stabilization of the α-helices composing the scrs of hyperthermostable proteins. at temperatures above 80°c, the hydrophobic effect, that is considered to be a dominant force in protein folding  <cit> , is mainly enthalpy driven  <cit> . in fact, while at high temperatures the entropy contribution to the protein stability tends to zero, the loss or gain of van der waals interactions acquires increased importance. for example, constructing  <dig> barnase mutants in which hydrophobic interactions were deleted, serrano et al.  <cit>  found a strong correlation between the degree of barnase destabilization and the number of methyl side chain groups that were lost . these data agree with the preferred substitutions  observed in the chcs of our datasets.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, taken together the obtained results indicate the preference, in the hydrophobic contacts, for isoleucine and valine residues as an important feature contributing to the enhanced thermostability of α-helices in hyperthermophilic proteins, possibly occurring through a decreased flexibility of these elements of secondary structure. this effect, in turn, may be due to an increased number of buried methyl groups in protein core and/or a better packing of α-helices with the rest of the structure, caused by the presence of hydrophobic β-branched side chains.

despite the advances in the design of hyperthermostable protein variants  <cit> , a potential drawback of these approaches is still constituted by the time consumed by computer algorithms for exploring the whole sequence protein space. other things being equal, focussing on the apolar contact area of the α-helices of the protein core through substitutions increasing the number of methyl side chain groups and/or resulting in a better packing of the secondary structure elements, will potentially give clues for the thermostabilization of the protein.
