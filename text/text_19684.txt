BACKGROUND
the rosa <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> is frequently used for the integration of transgene constructs to achieve ubiquitous or conditional gene expression in mice. the rosa <dig> transcript is spliced into three exons and ubiquitously expressed in all cell types and developmental stages, but not translated to a protein  <cit> . the locus was first identified by the integration of the rosaβ-geo  gene trap vector in pool # <dig> of transduced embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . this integration site, residing at the xbai site within the first intron of rosa <dig>  has been used for es-based gene targeting from its discovery on. a rosa <dig> targeting vector is extending 1 kb upstream and 4 kb downstream from the integration site within the first intron, flanking transgene inserts  <cit> . in the classical gene targeting procedure, targeted es cell clones are injected into blastocysts to obtain germline chimeric mice and the transmission of targeted alleles to their offspring. this approach requires laborious handling of es cell cultures and waiting times of 9– <dig> months until identification of positive f <dig> pups  <cit> . nevertheless, the rosa <dig> locus is frequently targeted via es cells for inserting single transgene copies in a standardized configuration into the mouse genome. the mouse genome informatics database  refers to  <dig> rosa <dig> knock-in mouse strains that have been generated for probing the effects of constitutively or conditionally expressed mutant proteins or for the imaging of reporter genes in vivo. rosa <dig> knock-in alleles are often configured such that coding regions are expressed under the control of the cag hybrid promoter  <cit>  or they are connected with splice acceptor elements to the endogenous rosa <dig> transcript  <cit> . conditional gene expression is achieved by insertion of a loxp-flanked transcriptional stop element between the promoter and coding regions. in such a case, gene expression is induced by crossing the conditional knock-in line with transgenic mice expressing cre recombinase in specific cell types  <cit> .

double-strand breaks  induced by engineered nucleases in mouse zygotes have emerged as powerful tool for the direct, single step production of targeted mutants, independent of es cells. proof of principle was provided with zinc-finger nucleases and talens  <cit> , both of which have been largely displaced by the more versatile and efficient crispr/cas <dig> gene editing system  <cit> . this system is composed of the generic cas <dig> nuclease that is guided to specific target sites by short sgrnas including  <dig> nucleotides complementary to the target sequence upstream of a pam signal . gene editing is achieved by endogenous dsb repair pathways, either imprecisely by non-homologous end joining  causing small deletions, or by homology-directed repair  using repair template vectors for the precise insertion of new sequences. in mouse zygotes, crispr/cas <dig> has been efficiently used for generating small deletions and knockout mutations by the nhej repair pathway, reaching frequencies of 50 % in pups derived from rna microinjections  <cit> , even in inbred backgrounds such as c57bl/ <dig>  in contrast, hdr events with co-injected targeting vectors occur rarely in zygotes. a limited number of studies reported the generation of knock-in alleles at frequencies of 5–15 % for a small number of genes  <cit> , not targeting rosa <dig> and using genetic hybrid embryos known for superior viability. thus, an approach for the direct production of rosa <dig> knock-in alleles in c57bl/ <dig> embryos is presently not established, despite this inbred background being a standard in biomedical research.

here we applied crispr/cas <dig> for the knock-in of conditional transgenes into rosa <dig> of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes. using modified cas <dig> mrna and sgrna targeting the intronic xbai site of rosa <dig>  compatible with common targeting vector homology regions, we achieved the knock-in of 8–11 kb inserts in 10–20 % of pups derived from microinjections of c57bl/ <dig> embryos. this frequency increased to 50 % upon the combined microinjection of cas <dig> mrna and cas <dig> protein, as tested in blastocyst assays. in addition to editing of the mouse germ line in zygotes, crispr/cas <dig> offers a new perspective for modifying gene function in somatic tissues. to avoid the vector-mediated delivery of the large cas <dig> transgene into primary cells, we generated rosa <dig> knock-in mice for the cre/loxp-dependent expression of cas <dig>  taken together, our protocols and resources support the fast and direct generation of new rosa <dig> knock-in alleles and of cas9-mediated in vivo gene editing in the c57bl/ <dig> background.

RESULTS
efficient dsbs induction at the rosa <dig> intronic xbai site in c57bl/ <dig> zygotes
to achieve crispr/cas9-mediated knock-in into rosa <dig>  we selected sgrna target sequences spanning the xbai site within the first intron, adapted to the homology regions of gene targeting vectors used for es cells that cover sequences up- and downstream of this site  <cit> . as we have shown previously, sgrosa26- <dig>  exhibits high activity in mouse cells  <cit> . we therefore selected sgrosa26- <dig>  together with a cas <dig> mrna that includes a plasmid coded polyadenine  tail   <cit> , for targeting in zygotes. the most effective concentrations of cas9-162a and sgrosa26- <dig> rnas were determined by microinjection of varying amounts of rna into the pronuclei of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes, followed by embryo culture to the blastocyst stage. genomic dna was extracted from each blastocyst and used for pcr amplification of the target region . pcr products were analyzed for nhej repair-associated deletions by digestion with xbai or the t <dig> endonuclease i . at the lowest concentrations of cas9-162a  and sgrosa26- <dig>  rnas, rosa <dig> alleles from 40 % of the embryos exhibited sequence deletions, as shown by the presence of xbai resistant bands, whereas t7ei assays were less sensitive . sequencing of cloned pcr products from four blastocysts confirmed the presence of small deletions at the expected cleavage site. of note, individual deletion events could generate new xbai sites, causing an underestimation of gene editing events by xbai digestion . upon rna microinjection of cas9-162a at 25 ng/μl and sgrosa26- <dig> at  <dig>  ng/μl, 80 % of cultured embryos showed xbai resistant pcr products, a percentage that was not further increased at higher concentrations . xbai resistant pcr products represented a minor fraction in most of the samples, indicating the preferential modification of the rosa <dig> allele in a heterozygous and/or mosaic pattern, although ~10 % of the embryos showed processing of both alleles. we reasoned that conditions leading to rosa <dig> deletions in the majority of embryos may also support knock-in events in at least a fraction of embryos, since hdr can occur in mammalian cells at ~10 % of nuclease induced dsbs  <cit> .fig.  <dig> crispr/cas <dig> induced dsbs at the rosa <dig> intronic xbai site in mouse zygotes. a: diagram of the mouse rosa <dig> locus. the sgrosa26- <dig> target sequence upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif  and the xbai site within the first intron are indicated. the locations of primers used for nested pcr are shown . b: in vitro blastocyst assay: zygotes microinjected with cas <dig> mrna and sgrosa26- <dig> rna were cultured for 4 days to blastocysts. genomic dna was extracted from each blastocyst and used for pcr amplification of the target region and genotyping by xbai or t <dig> endonuclease i . c: agarose gel electrophoresis of  <dig>  kb pcr products amplified with the r26f2/r26r <dig> primer pair from blastocysts derived from microinjected zygotes  . pcr products were either digested with xbai  or with t7ei . xbai resistant  <dig>  kb or t7ei sensitive  <dig>  kb bands  indicate the presence of modified rosa <dig> alleles harboring sequence deletions. wt – wildtype control, m – size marker. d: sequence comparison of cloned pcr products  amplified from blastocysts # <dig> - # <dig> . deleted nucleotides are shown as dashes, the sgrosa26- <dig> pam sequence is shown in red. e: frequency of blastocysts showing nhej-based mutagenesis as indicated by the presence of xbai resistant rosa <dig> pcr products, in relation to the concentrations of cas <dig> and sgrosa26- <dig> rnas used for the microinjection of zygotes



knock-in of a conditional cas <dig> transgene into rosa <dig> of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes
to enable gene editing by crispr/cas <dig> in vivo, we aimed for germ line integration of a conditional cas <dig> transgene into the rosa <dig> locus of c57bl/ <dig> mice such that the delivery of the large cas <dig> coding region into primary cells can be avoided. as a template for hdr, we constructed the targeting vector prosa-cas <dig>  harboring an 11 kb insert flanked by standard rosa <dig> homology regions, extending 1 kb upstream and 4 kb downstream from the xbai site mentioned above . the vector’s insert includes a cag promoter region, a loxp-flanked transcriptional termination  element and the cas <dig> coding region linked to an ires-gfp reporter element. in addition, splice acceptor and polya elements were placed upstream of the cag promoter for the termination of the endogenous rosa <dig> transcripts . from pronuclear microinjections and transfer of  <dig> c57bl/ <dig> zygotes with prosa-cas <dig> dna, sgrosa26- <dig> and cas9-162a rnas we obtained  <dig> live pups . to verify the activity of cas <dig> in microinjected zygotes, these mice were first analyzed for the incidence of small deletions at the rosa <dig> target site. pcr amplification of the target region on genomic dna from ear biopsies using the primer pair r26f2/r <dig> and the xbai digestion assay confirmed the presence of xbai resistant, nhej processed rosa <dig> alleles in  <dig> of  <dig> pups  . next, we used a cas9-specific primer pair for pcr and identified six mice harboring the cas <dig> transgene . these potential founder mutants were further analysed to discriminate knock-in alleles from random vector integrations. none of these mice showed knock-in to both rosa <dig> alleles since additional wildtype or xbai resistant pcr products were detected using the r26f2/sar/r <dig> or f2/r <dig> primer combinations . for the detection of correct, targeted integrations by pcr, we used the r26f <dig> primer, recognizing a genomic sequence outside of the upstream homology region of the targeting vector, together with the vector specific primer sar. the predicted  <dig>  kb pcr product could be amplified from five of the six cas <dig> transgenic mice, indicating the correct configuration of the knock-in allele in founders # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig> . sequence analysis of these pcr products confirmed their identity as being derived from rosa26lsl-cas <dig> hdr alleles . in  <dig> of  <dig> founders, southern blot analysis of ecori digested tail dna using a rosa26-specific 5′-hybridization probe showed the predicted  <dig>  kb band and thus correctly targeted alleles, whereas founder # <dig> exhibited a larger band, in addition to the  <dig>  kb fragment from the rosa <dig> wildtype locus . for germline transmission of the targeted alleles, founders # <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were crossed to c57bl/ <dig> wildtype mice and their offspring were genotyped using the cas <dig> internal cas9f/r primer pair. all founders transmitted the rosa26lsl-cas <dig> allele to about half of their offspring . the rosa <dig> loci of one pup each from founder # <dig>  and # <dig>  were further analyzed by southern blotting of ecori digested genomic dna using an external rosa <dig> 5′ hybridization probe. both pups showed the expected  <dig>  kb band for the heterozygous rosa26lsl-cas <dig> allele, in addition to the  <dig>  kb band derived from the rosa <dig> wildtype locus .fig.  <dig> knock-in of a conditional cas <dig> transgene into rosa <dig> of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes. a: strategy for insertion of the cag-loxpstoploxp-cas9-ires-egfp cassette into the mouse rosa <dig> locus. sgrosa26- <dig> and cas <dig> introduce a double-strand break between 1 kb and 4 kb fragments used as homology arms in the targeting vector. homology-directed repair  leads to the insertion of the cassette into the genome. the locations of pcr primers, restriction sites and the rosa <dig> hybridisation probe in the targeted and wildtype alleles are indicated. b: gel electrophoresis of xbai digested rosa <dig> pcr products  amplified from pups  derived from microinjections of targeting vector, sgrosa26- <dig> and cas <dig> rnas.  <dig>  kb bands of xbai resistant products  indicate sequence deletions, wildtype products  are reduced to  <dig>  kb. m - size marker, b <dig> - c57bl/ <dig> wildtype control. c: pcr detection of an internal segment of cas <dig> in pups derived from microinjections using primers cas9f/cas9r . bottom: three primer pcr for the simultaneous detection of the rosa <dig> target region  and of vector sequences , showing that all samples harbor at least one nonrecombined rosa <dig> allele. v – vector positive control, h2o – negative control. d: cas9-positive mice  were further tested for correct knock-in  into rosa <dig> using a pcr reaction with a forward primer located outside of the 5′-homology region  and a reverse primer located in transgene ;

thus, using cas <dig> and sgrosa26- <dig> rnas, we achieved the targeted integration of an 11 kb conditional cas <dig> transgene into the rosa <dig> locus of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes at a frequency of 13 % and the rosa26lsl-cas <dig> founder mutants transmitted the targeted allele through their germ line.

cas <dig> is functional in b cells of rosa26lsl-cas <dig> mice
to confirm the functionality of the rosa26lsl-cas <dig> allele, we isolated naive b cells from spleens of three heterozygous f <dig> mice by using cd <dig> microbeads because the cd <dig> antigen is expressed on nearly all mouse leukocytes except for immature and resting mature b cells. the b cells were treated with cell permeable tat-cre recombinase for deletion of the loxp-flanked stop element, activated with lps, inducing b cell proliferation and differentiation, for 2 days. the activated b cells were harvested and used for isolation of genomic dna and cellular proteins . as shown by a three primer pcr for the detection of the recombined alleles, tat-cre removed the stop element with high efficiency  and sequence analysis of the pcr products confirmed the presence of a single loxp site between the cag promoter and the cas <dig> coding region . the expression of cas <dig> protein from the activated rosa26lsl-cas <dig> allele was analyzed by western blotting using lysates of tat-cre treated b cells and cas <dig> or flag-tag specific antibodies. both antibodies verified the expression of the  <dig> kd cas <dig> protein in tat-cre treated b cells from three heterozygous rosa26lsl-cas <dig> mice .fig.  <dig> cas <dig> is expressed in b cells of rosa26lsl-cas <dig> knock-in mice. a: strategy for isolating naive b cells from spleens of three rosa26lsl-cas <dig> f <dig> mice by cd <dig> depletion and activation of cas <dig> expression by deletion of the loxp flanked stop element upon treatment with tat-cre protein. b: scheme of the tat-cre-mediated deletion of the neo/stop element . detection of cre-mediated deletion of the neo/stop cassette by pcr using dna of tat-cre/lps-treated b cells and the indicated primers. rosa26lsl-cas <dig> alleles produce a  <dig>  kb band , cre recombined alleles are detected by a  <dig>  kb band . c: sequencing results of  <dig>  kb pcr products  showing the correct deletion of the loxp flanked stop element, leaving one loxp site in between the cag promoter and the cas <dig> coding region. d: western blot analysis of lysates prepared from tat-cre/lps treated b cells of three rosa26lsl-cas <dig> f <dig> mice using antibodies against the flag tag, cas <dig>  or beta-actin



the nuclease activity of the expressed cas <dig> protein was confirmed by the transduction of tat-cre treated, lps activated b cells with retroviral particles expressing sgrosa26- <dig>  a puromycin resistance and a bfp gene . the transduced b cells of f <dig> rosa26lsl-cas <dig> heterozygous pups from three different founders  were selected with puromycin for three days, leading to an enrichment of bfp+ transduced cells to 90 % . we then isolated genomic dna from facs sorted bfp+ cells from the experimental and control cultures and performed pcr amplification of the sgrosa26- <dig> target region, followed by xbai digestion and t7ei assays. in both groups, we found high levels of xbai resistant and t7e sensitive rosa <dig> pcr products , indicating sufficient cas <dig> expression from the conditional rosa26lsl-cas <dig> allele to achieve targeted mutagenesis.fig.  <dig> cas <dig> is functional in b cells of rosa26lsl-cas <dig> knock-in mice. a: scheme of genome editing in primary mouse b cells using crispr/cas <dig>  naive b cells from spleens of three individual heterozygous rosa26lsl-cas <dig> f <dig> mice were isolated using cd <dig> depletion, treated with tat-cre and stimulated with lps for 24 h. tat-cre/lps treated b cells were transduced with retroviral particles co-expressing sgrosa26- <dig> and bfp to target the rosa <dig> locus. one day later, the transduced b cells were selected with puromycin until day  <dig>  b: facs analysis of b cells  before  and after puromycin selection . the gate indicates the fraction  of successfully transduced bfp+ cells. c: gel electrophoresis of t7ei or xbai digested pcr products  amplified from dna of facs sorted bfp+ cells , indicating sequence deletions by the presence of t7ei sensitive or xbai resistant bands 



these results verified the expression of functional cas <dig> nuclease in rosa26lsl-cas <dig> f <dig> offspring upon cre-mediated activation of the transgene. since the targeted allele was introduced into c57bl/ <dig> zygotes, the rosa26lsl-cas <dig> mouse line allows cas9-mediated gene editing in vivo and in primary cells of c57bl/ <dig> mice. the rosa26lsl-cas <dig> line will be distributed through the jackson laboratory .

analysis of off-target activity
genomic sequences showing high similarity to the sgrosa26- <dig> target-sequence may lead to unintended gene editing at such off-target sites. to determine the importance of off-target modification in our system, we predicted the off-target sites of sgrosa26- <dig> in the mouse genome based on sequence similarity to its target-sequence and selected the three sites with the highest risk of being edited . we then amplified and sequenced these loci from six heterozygous rosa26lsl-cas <dig> f1-mice  and from the six cas <dig> positive mice of the founder generation . we did not detect any genetic modification in all of the analysed off-target loci, since solely wildtype, but no mixed sequence reads were obtained . although we cannot rule out off-target effects in other loci, these results suggest that in the present setting, off-target effects are not dominant.fig.  <dig> analysis of off-target activity. a: the top  <dig> predicted off-target sites of the rosa26- <dig> target sequence sorted according to sequence divergence  and the pcr scheme for the analysis of the top  <dig> off-targets . negligible mismatches are shown in grey. b: pcr amplification of the off-target site  <dig>  from two f <dig> pups each derived from the mutant founders # <dig>  # <dig> or # <dig>  and sequencing results of the respective bands . c: pcr amplification of the off-target site  <dig>  from two f <dig> pups each derived from the mutant founders # <dig>  # <dig> or # <dig>  and sequencing results of the respective bands . d: pcr amplification of the off-target site  <dig>  from two f <dig> pups each derived from the mutant founders # <dig>  # <dig> or # <dig>  and sequencing results of the respective bands 



knock-in of a conditional galectin-1-e2a-pd-l <dig> transgene into rosa <dig> of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes
evidence that the rosa <dig> targeting strategy outlined above can be extended to other transgenes was obtained in experiments aiming at the generation of signal-on alleles encoding the immunomodulatory proteins galectin- <dig>  and pd-l <dig> , linked by a self-cleaving e2a peptide. for this purpose we constructed a rosa <dig> targeting vector by inserting the 8 kb transgene into a gateway cloning destination vector  <cit> , harboring λ-phage attr sites in between the loxp flanked stop element and an ires-gfp reporter gene . for knock-in into the rosa <dig> locus the lgals1-e2a-cd <dig> targeting vector was microinjected together with sgrosa26- <dig>  and cas9-162a  rnas into the pronuclei of  <dig> c57bl/ <dig> zygotes. to control for embryo viability, the injected zygotes were cultured overnight to the 2-cell stage. we recovered  <dig> such embryos  that, upon transfer into foster mothers, resulted in the birth of  <dig> pups . genomic dna from ear biopsies was first used for the detection of vector integrations by pcr amplification of an internal segment of the stop element using the neof/r primer pair . four pups showed the predicted 324 bp band and were further genotyped using the r26f3/sar primer pair, enabling the detection of rosa <dig> hdr alleles by a forward primer  outside of the vector’s upstream homology region and a vector-specific reverse primer . the predicted  <dig>  kb pcr product could be amplified from  <dig> pups , confirming the presence of rosa <dig> knock-in alleles . the presence of the protein coding segment was further confirmed using an lgals <dig> and cd <dig> specific primer pair. in addition, we verified the correct integration of the targeting vector in both founders by southern blot analysis of ecori digested tail dna using an external rosa <dig> 5′ hybridization probe. both founders showed the  <dig>  kb band predicted for the rosa26lgals-cd <dig> allele, in addition to the  <dig>  kb band derived from the rosa <dig> wildtype locus . the two founder mutants are presently bred for germline transmission of the targeted rosa26lsl-lgals/cd <dig> allele.fig.  <dig> knock-in of a conditional galectin-1-e2a-pdl <dig> transgene into rosa <dig> of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes. a: strategy for insertion of the cag-loxpstoploxp-lgals1-e2a-cd274-ires-egfp cassette into the mouse rosa <dig> locus. sgrosa26- <dig> and cas <dig> introduce a double-strand break between 1 kb and 4 kb fragments used as homology arms in the targeting vector. homology-directed repair  leads to the insertion of the cassette into the genome. the locations of pcr primers, restriction sites and the rosa <dig> hybridisation probe in the targeted and wildtype alleles are indicated. b: gel electrophoresis of pcr reactions from genomic dna of ten pups derived from microinjections using primers neof/r for detection of an internal vector segment . second panel: mouse dnas were further tested for correct knock-in  into rosa <dig> using a pcr with a forward primer located outside of the 5′-homology region  and a reverse primer located in transgene ; the predicted band has a size of  <dig>  kb. third panel: dna quality was controlled with a rosa26-specific pcr . lower panel: pcr detection of the galectin-1-e2a-pdl <dig> transgene using lgals1f  and cd274r  primers. +: positive control dna from a rosa <dig> knock-in mouse generated from es cells; h2o: negative control. c: southern blot analysis of ecori digested tail dna from vector-positive mice  using an external rosa26-specific hybridization probe. knock-in alleles are predicted to show a 6 kb ecori band; for sample # <dig> the tail biopsy yielded insufficient gdna. control – dna from a rosa <dig> knock-in mouse generated from es cells, c57bl/ <dig> – wildtype control



in conclusion, the present direct targeting approach using crispr/cas <dig> in zygotes allows the rapid generation of new rosa <dig> knock-in mouse lines on the c57bl/ <dig> inbred background. since 10–17 % of transferred embryos developed into live pups and 10–20 % of them were correctly targeted mutants, the establishment of a new knock-in line requires the microinjection and transfer of no more than 100– <dig> zygotes.

resources for rosa <dig> targeting in zygotes
to facilitate the construction of new conditional rosa <dig> targeting vectors, we provide targeting vectors harboring pairs of λ-attr sites for the insertion of coding regions in between a loxp flanked stop element and an ires-gfp or -bfp reporter by gateway cloning . each of these versions either contains the cag promoter for transgene expression or an acceptor element for splicing to the endogenous rosa <dig> transcript. in addition, we provide conditional targeting vectors enabling the standard cloning of new inserts into an asci site located upstream of an ires-gfp reporter or into the asisi or mlui site of a reporter-free plasmid . for the preparation of sgrosa26- <dig> and cas9-162a rnas for microinjection we provide plasmids pbs-u6-sgrosa26- <dig> and pcag-cas9-162a. all plasmids will be distributed via the addgene repository  and protocols for rna production and the pcr-based detection of modified rosa <dig> alleles and off-target analysis are included in the additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> 
rosa <dig> targeting vectors for conditional gene expression. for the construction of new conditional rosa <dig> targeting vectors we provide plasmids which include the standard rosa <dig> homology regions of 1 kb and 4 kb merging at the sgrosa26- <dig> target site and a loxp-flanked stop element containing a neomycin  or puromycin  resistance gene. gene expression is either driven by the cag promoter  or through the rosa <dig> promoter by  capture of the endogenous transcript via a splice acceptor site . coding regions for transgene expression can be inserted into destinations vectors for gateway cloning by replacement of the λ phage attr-flanked cmr/ccdb segment or into unique asci or asisi/mlui restriction sites. for the imaging of gene expression most vectors, except pr <dig> cag asisi/mlui, include a gfp or bfp reporter linked with an ires element. pa –polyadenylation site



in addition to the standard conditions with sgrosa26- <dig> and cas9-162a rnas, as used for the generation of rosa26lsl-cas <dig> and rosa26lsl-lgals/cd <dig> mice, we explored whether the frequency of knock-in events can be further increased by the co-injection of recombinant cas <dig> protein. for these test experiments we cultured microinjected zygotes to the blastocyst stage, extracted genomic dna and determined the frequency of rosa <dig> knock-in and deletion events by pcr. for the knock-in into rosa <dig>  we used a venus targeting vector harboring the 1 kb standard 5′-homology region and a 3′-homology region shortened from 4 kb to  <dig>  kb  to facilitate the detection of recombined alleles by pcr using the vector-specific primer venusf and the external downstream r26r <dig> primer . we analyzed two groups of  <dig> blastocysts each that were derived from the microinjection of zygotes with aliquots of an identical preparation of sgrosa26- <dig> rna, cas9-162a mrna and prosa26-venus dna, except that one sample was supplemented with cas <dig> protein  immediately before injection. as shown in fig. 8b, we found two embryos  positive for the  <dig>  kb knock-in pcr product in the group microinjected with the rna/dna preparation alone, comparable to our previous results. in the group microinjected with additional cas <dig> protein  <dig> of  <dig> embryos  were positive for the knock-in pcr product. although the small sample size prevents statistical evaluation, it is possible that the combined use of cas <dig> mrna and protein leads to increased cas <dig> cleavage and improved hdr. the frequency of small deletions at the rosa <dig> target site, as assessed by xbai digestion of pcr products, was also clearly elevated in embryos co-injected with cas <dig> protein .fig.  <dig> coinjection of cas <dig> mrna and cas <dig> protein into zygotes. a strategy for insertion of a venus reporter into the mouse rosa <dig> locus. sgrosa26- <dig> and cas <dig> introduce a double-strand break between 1 kb and  <dig>  kb fragments used as homology arms in the pr26-venus targeting vector. the locations of pcr primers in the targeted and wildtype rosa <dig> alleles are indicated. sa- splice acceptor, pa polyadenylation site. b mouse zygotes were microinjected with pr26-venus, sgrosa26- <dig> and cas <dig> mrna or cas <dig> mrna and protein. the embryos were cultured for 4 days and genomic dna was isolated from  <dig> blastocysts each, for pcr-based detection of hdr or deletion events. top panel: gel electrophoresis of pcr products. targeted alleles  are detected by amplification of a  <dig>  kb genomic segment using the vector-specific primer venusf and the r26r <dig> primer, located downstream of the vector homology region. the presence of integrated or nonintegrated vector dna was tested using the r26f2/r <dig> primer pair, amplifying a  <dig>  kb vector segment as well as  <dig>  kb of the rosa <dig> target region . lower panel: rosa <dig> alleles with sequence deletions were detected by  <dig>  kb of the target region , followed by xbai digestion and gel separation. xbai resistant pcr products indicate the presence of sequence deletions  whereas wildtype products are reduced to  <dig>  kb fragments . c sequencing of pcr products amplified with primers venusf and r26r <dig>  showed the predicted recombination between the targeting vectors homology region and adjacent downstream genomic sequence



discussion
efficient gene editing in mouse zygotes using the crispr/cas <dig> system has been mainly reported for the generation of knockout alleles by small sequence deletions in genetically hybrid embryos. however, many research applications require precisely targeted mutations on the c57bl/ <dig> inbred background. specifically, targeted insertions into the rosa <dig> locus are frequently used for the constitutive or conditional expression of transgenes in a standardized single copy configuration. here we established a crispr/cas <dig> based approach for generating rosa <dig> knock-in alleles in c57bl/ <dig> zygotes. we found that transgene inserts of  <dig> or 11 kb were targeted to rosa <dig> in 10–20 % of the mice derived from microinjections of 100– <dig> c57bl/ <dig> zygotes. for the detection of potential off-target modifications by cas <dig>  we tested six rosa26lsl-cas <dig> f <dig> pups each at three predicted off-target sites. since these sites showed no modifications, we conclude that sgrosa26- <dig> does not lead to obvious, frequent off-target processing.

to facilitate the future production of rosa <dig> knock-in mouse lines, we provide various targeting constructs for the insertion of new transgenes using gateway or restriction site cloning. furthermore, we found a higher proportion of rosa <dig> knock-in alleles in a small group of embryos microinjected with cas <dig> mrna and additional cas <dig> protein. although this result is out of reliable statistical evaluation, it is possible that the microinjection of cas <dig> protein and sgrna stimulates dsb formation and hdr early on, complementing and preceding the translation of cas <dig> mrna that supports sustained nuclease activity over time. thus, provided that live mutants will be obtained at similar rates, the combined supply of cas <dig> mrna and protein could further streamline the production of rosa <dig> and other knock-in mutants, provided that future experiments will confirm our initial findings. in addition, the suppression of nhej repair by inhibition of dna ligase iv  <cit>  may provide another option to increase the yield of rosa <dig> hdr alleles in zygotes. since we also successfully used a shortened,  <dig>  kb 3′-homology region for the knock-in of venus into rosa <dig>  it will be interesting to further investigate which lengths of homology regions, in relation to the size of transgene inserts, are required for optimal hdr efficiency.

previous studies on the direct targeting of rosa <dig> used pairs of zinc-finger nucleases  <cit>  or talen  <cit>  in zygotes and achieved hdr frequencies of  <dig> – <dig>  %  or  <dig> – <dig>  % , respectively, for the insertion of reporter genes. intrinsic limitations for dsb induction by these earlier nuclease designs may be posed by the requirement for binding of two protein molecules to the target dna and for the dimerization of their nuclease domains. since for cas <dig>  dsbs are formed by only one single protein/rna complex we reason that higher levels of mutagenesis can be achieved by the delivery of preformed cas9/sgrna into zygotes. as an alternative to sequence-specific nucleases, cre/loxp mediated recombination has been used in zygotes for vector integrations by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange  into a modified rosa <dig> allele at efficiencies of  <dig> –25 %  <cit> . however, the rmce approach is incompatible with the use of cre/loxp dependent constructs and requires the maintenance of a breeding colony of rmce acceptor mice for embryo production.

using crispr/cas <dig> we generated a new conditional cas <dig> mouse line for in vivo and ex vivo gene editing in the c57bl/ <dig> inbred background. a similar strain was previously generated by gene targeting in 129-derived r <dig> es cells  <cit> . a minimum of  <dig> backcross cycles with c57bl/ <dig> mice will be required for the establishment of a congenic cas <dig> strain, precluding prompt phenotypic studies that require this widely used inbred background. since rosa <dig> has been also validated as a ‘safe harbor’ integration site in rats and pigs using es cells  <cit>  or nuclear transfer  <cit> , crispr/cas9-based rosa <dig> knock-in in zygotes could also be of use in these species. finally, efficient targeting of the rosa <dig> locus in the c57bl/ <dig> background allows the direct targeting of complex experimental compound mutants and thus bypassing time-consuming breeding strategies.

CONCLUSIONS
rosa <dig> is frequently used as standardized insertion site for single transgene copies via gene targeting in es cells, an approach that requires laborious handling of cell cultures and 9– <dig> months’ time until the identification of positive f <dig> pups. here we applied crispr/cas9-assisted mutagenesis for the single step insertion of conditional transgenes into rosa <dig> of c57bl/ <dig> zygotes. using modified cas <dig> mrna and sgrna targeting the intronic xbai site of rosa <dig>  we achieved the knock-in of 8–11 kb inserts in 10–20 % of pups derived from microinjections of c57bl/ <dig> embryos. upon the combined microinjection of cas <dig> mrna and cas <dig> protein we found knock-in alleles in 50 % of cultured blastocysts. for modifying gene function by crispr/cas <dig> in somatic tissues of c57bl/ <dig> mice, to avoid the vector-mediated delivery of the large cas <dig> transgene into primary cells, we generated rosa <dig> knock-in mice for the cre/loxp-dependent expression of cas <dig>  taken together, our protocols and resources support the fast and direct generation of new rosa <dig> knock-in alleles and of cas9-mediated in vivo gene editing in the widely used c57bl/ <dig> inbred strain.
