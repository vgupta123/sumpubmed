BACKGROUND
anthrax is a disease of animals including humans and results from infection by bacillus  anthracis  <cit> . anthrax spores reside in soil samples worldwide and are resistant to environmental insults such as temperature, moisture and uv irradiation. spores enter host animals via inhalation, epidermal or gastrointestinal routes with respiratory route being the most fatal. once inside hosts, the spores germinate and secrete three toxin components, called lethal factor , edema factor  and protective antigen , encoded by the pxo <dig> plasmid. lf, a metalloprotease, plus pa is termed lethal toxin and ef plus pa is termed edema toxin  <cit> . the combination of bacteremia and release of the protein toxins leads to sepsis, pulmonary edema and other fatal effects  <cit> .

pa is responsible for translocating the two other gene products, lf and ef, into the cytosol of susceptible cells  <cit> . the precursor form of pa  binds to ubiquitous cell surface receptors including von willebrand factor, tumor endothelial marker  <dig>  and capillary morphogenesis protein  <dig>  <cit> . pa <dig> is cleaved by furin as well as by serum proteases  <cit> . the active form of pa  then heptamerizes and binds with a high affinity to lf or ef  <cit> . the complex of pa with lf or ef forms a channel to allow lf/ef to translocate from the endosome to the cytosol where the toxic effects associated with lf are manifest  <cit> . cationic peptides that inhibit furin-mediated activation of pa <dig> to pa <dig> are also effective in blocking lethal toxin cytotoxicity  <cit> .

ef is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase and thus elevates intracellular camp levels of intoxicated cells  <cit> . as a result of this mechanism, ef causes the additional pathological effects in the host although it is less virulent than lf. recent studies have demonstrated that adefovir diphosphate is a potent inhibitor of anthrax ef, in vitro  <cit> .

anthrax lf is a representative member of the zinc-dependent endopeptidases family as demonstrated by the presence of the hexxh zinc-binding consensus sequence  <cit> . lf, an  <dig> kd protein, is one of the main virulence factors of anthrax  <cit> . lf contains numerous anionic sites both within the active site and at distant sites  <cit> .

macrophages are target cells of lf toxicity in animal model systems. exposure of murine macrophages to lethal toxin resulted in rapid loss of cell viability  <cit> . conversely, mice depleted of macrophages were not sensitive to lethal toxin  <cit> . the mechanism of lethality has been attributed to release of cytokines or apoptosis as well as other mechanisms but is highly dependent upon the lf concentration  <cit> .

the mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase  pathway is a major regulator for communication of extracellular signals to the nucleus and is involved in cellular adaptations to the environment  <cit> . in the cytosol, lf cleaves members of the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase  family in the n-terminal region including mapkk family members 1– <dig>  <cit> . the reduced levels of mapkks then prevent p <dig> kinase-mediated activation of immune mechanisms b. anthracis to evade host immunological mechanisms. recently published studies have demonstrated that small molecules can inhibit lf activity and subsequently block lf-mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> .

at present, the only mechanism to fatally "intoxicate" cells with lethal factor is via host infection with b. anthracis spores that germinate in lymphatic tissues and secrete their toxin components. none of the three individual gene products of pxo <dig> are toxic in vivo  <cit> . inhibitors of other proteases such as angiotensin converting enzyme and hiv-1/hiv- <dig> proteases are effective and highly specific drugs for the treatment of chronic diseases  <cit>  and therefore suggest a logical strategy for identifying anthrax lethal factor inhibitors. based upon the demonstration of the anionic rich regions of lf  <cit> , we chose chemical libraries that included cationic compounds to test for lf inhibition. these studies were directed at identification of compounds that selectively inhibited lf both at the enzyme level then evaluation of their effects in cell culture based assays. an ideal therapeutic would penetrate susceptible cells and be effective protease inhibitors in "post-exposure" models of treatment.

RESULTS
substrate kinetics
using mapkkide™ as substrate, velocity vs. substrate curves were analyzed by dynafit, a nonlinear fitting program  <cit> . the results of the forward progress curves demonstrated a clear substrate inhibition process as previously shown with a different substrate  <cit> . the km and ki values for mapkkide™ were calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig> ±  <dig> μm, respectively. these data suggest that multiple inhibitory mechanisms may be available as sites for binding of lf inhibitors .

endogenous polyamines inhibit lethal factor enzyme activity
based upon the presence of anionic sites on lf, we hypothesized that cationic compounds, including members of known drug-like chemical families, might inhibit lf enzyme activity. an initial focused library of commercially available cationic compounds  from numerous chemical classes was assembled and tested at a concentration of approximately  <dig> μg/ml in the lf enzyme inhibition assay. one of these compoundsspermine, was found to inhibit anthrax protease activity in a concentration-dependent manner with a ki value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . in contrast to the potent inhibition of anthrax lf protease enzyme activity, this compound was >40-fold weaker as a botulinum protease inhibitor  and much less active on mammalian proteases including trypsin, cathepsin b and cathepsin d . several other endogenous polyamines, including spermidine, and ornithine, were evaluated for activity as lf inhibitors; these endogenous compounds were weaker than spermine but were still concentration-dependent inhibitors .

aminoglycosides inhibit lf enzyme activity
aminoglycoside antibiotics bind to the polyamine class of glutamate receptors by a mechanism unrelated to antibiotic activity  <cit> . we therefore evaluated a series of commercially-available aminoglycosides  to determine their potencies as lf inhibitors. the results demonstrated that some members of this chemical class were potent inhibitors of anthrax lf cleavage of the substrate . both natural aminoglycosides and synthetic aminoglycosides  were active. of these, neomycin was the most potent aminoglycoside with a ki value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. based upon chemical size, we chose to focus on neamine and related compounds .

exogenous nucleic acids alter lf inhibition by neomycin
since aminoglycosides are known to bind to nucleic acids  <cit>  we evaluated key compounds in the absence of dna  and in the presence of a variety of nucleic acids. at concentrations < <dig> μg/ml, nucleic acids did not affect lf enzyme activity. as shown in fig  <dig>  the potency of neomycin was greater in the absence of dna compared to in the presence of salmon testes dna . the higher concentration of dna caused a ~10-fold right shift in potency of neomycin. in contrast, the concentration-dependent inhibitory activities of neamine or spermine were unaffected by dna or rna .

cationic peptides inhibit furin enzyme activity
cross-inhibition of lf and furin has been demonstrated for polyarginine based inhibitors  <cit> . we therefore examined the ability of our panel of lf inhibitors to inhibit furin in an in vitro substrate cleavage assay. as expected, several polyarginine derivatives inhibited furin activity . none of the remaining compounds interfered with furin activity at concentrations up to  <dig> μm.

discussion
in the initial phase of this study, we sought to identify compounds that selectively inhibited anthrax lethal factor enzyme activity. such compounds were hypothesized to be potential lead molecules for optimization as drugs to treat b. anthracis infection. since inhibitors of this protease were not known at the time, we chose to screen structurally diverse collections of individual compounds  as one approach towards lead identification. we included simple linear cationic polyamines  in the screening library with the hypothesis that they might bind to anionic sites on lf and thus block substrate cleavage. the data presented in this study show that spermine  is a concentration-dependent, sub-micromolar inhibitor of lf with reduced inhibitory potencies  versus other bacterial and mammalian proteases. polyamine analogs of spermine, including spermidine and ornithine were less active than spermine but still displayed concentration-dependent inhibitory effects as lf inhibitors.

based upon literature demonstrating that both polyamines and aminoglycoside antibiotics bind to the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor  <cit> , we also evaluated aminoglycoside antibiotics for lf inhibition. in our independent studies reported here and identified by other laboratories  <cit>  we found that gentamicin inhibited lf enzyme activity without inhibiting other proteases from bacterial and mammalian sources. we then showed that other compounds were more potent lf inhibitors than gentamicin. to further validate the mechanism, we tested cationic peptides  such as d- and l-hexaarginine as well as non-peptidyl cationic polymers including poly-l-arginine and poly-l-lysine ; the larger cationic polymers  were more potent inhibitors. while these large molecules will not be drug leads, they validated the mechanistic hypotheses of lf inhibition. based upon these data, we concluded that neamine possessed the most relevant combination of drug-like properties and it was used as a scaffold for designing more potent and cell permeable analogs  <cit> .

aminoglycosides are effective antibiotics for the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections as well as certain mycobacterial infections  <cit> . their use, however, is limited by lack of oral absorption and toxicity at high doses including both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity  <cit> . because of such toxicities, intravenous use of aminoglycosides in large and diverse age/health populations would pose a significant risk if used as prophylactic agents. orally active/non-toxic compounds are still needed for protection against bioterrorist threats based on b. anthracis and its toxins.

high affinity polyamine interactions with nucleic acids are well known in both cell-free and cellular systems  <cit> . in anticancer studies, for example, exogenous polyamines are cytotoxic by depleting endogenous polyamine levels through feedback inhibition mechanisms  <cit> . the cellular uptake of linear polyamines is well-recognized and numerous transporters have been shown to modulate polyamine levels within cells and organelles .

we also sought to determine if the presence of dna or rna in the mapkk cleavage assays would affect polyamine inhibition of lf activity. first, we demonstrated that nucleic acids did not inhibit lf activity at concentrations below those known to be present in human blood . subsequently, we have also demonstrated that the presence of these nucleic acids prevent certain compounds such as neomycin but not neamine from inhibiting lf activity. one hypothesis we have considered is the role of size of the inhibitory molecules; smaller compounds such as spermine and neamine did not bind nucleic acids whereas larger molecules that inhibited lf  were rendered less potent in the presence of 4– <dig> μg/ml of dna or rna. this is a unique pharmacological discovery first demonstrated in this effort.

all three chemical classes  are highly charged molecules; they were not expected to be active in cell models of anthrax lethal factor cytotoxicity. this result was confirmed in our initial lf cytotoxicity studies with raw  <dig>  macrophage cells as all compounds were not active up to the highest concentration tested . recent studies  <cit> , however, have demonstrated that aminoglycosides at "seemingly physiological conditions" inhibit lf and exhibit antibiotic activity against b. anthracis. in addition, linear polyamines enter cells by multiple mechanisms including active transport  <cit> . these different results highlight the need for continued research in this area including longer compound exposure periods.

inhibition of the proprotein convertase, furin, by cationic peptides was expected since cationic hexapeptides and nonapeptides have been demonstrated to inhibit furin activity  <cit> . in contrast, however, the charged, nonpeptidyl compounds were inactive as furin inhibitors at concentrations up to  <dig> μm. it is likely that other small molecule cations will inhibit furin processing. such compounds may be effective in a broad spectrum of diseases where furin cleavage of proteins play a role, such as alzheimer's disease, viral infections and bacterial infections  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the enzymologic and pharmacologic results presented in this study demonstrate the role of anionic sites on anthrax lethal factor that specifically bind cationic compounds from different chemical classes. ultimately multi-drug and multi-dose combinations of antibiotics that suppress production of anthrax spores plus edema factor and lf inhibitors that target intracellular toxins will be employed to treat people exposed to anthrax gene products. recently, an antiviral agent called adefovir was found to inhibit edema factor adenylate cyclase activity  <cit> . combinations of edema factor and lethal factor inhibitors along with gram-positive antibiotics could be utilized to treat people exposed to anthrax or its gene products. as a spin-off of these efforts, researchers may want to determine if the presence/absence of nucleic acids affects the potency of selected compounds.
