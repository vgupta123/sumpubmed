BACKGROUND
with the continuous decline in the cost of genome sequencing due to the development of new technologies  <cit> , numerous prokaryotic genomes are being sequenced, and this number will soon approach a few thousand. since the biological functions of an organism are encoded in its genome, knowing its genome sequence can greatly facilitate the understanding of its biological functions. however, due to the expensive nature of experimental characterization of biological functions of an organism, ideally, these functions should be largely deduced computationally from its genome sequence. nevertheless, understanding the function of even a relatively simple prokaryotic cell from its genome sequence remains one of the most daunting challenges in the post-genomic era. in particular, we know very little about the cis-regulatory elements or transcription factor  binding sites  in the vast majority of sequenced prokaryotic genomes because of the lack of an accurate and efficient computational method for predicting tfbss in sequenced genomes.

the difficulty of computational prediction of tfbss in a prokaryotic genome is mainly due to the short length and degenerate nature of tfbss, which complicates their discovery within the long upstream inter-operonic regions in which they usually reside. furthermore, although some tfbss in prokaryotes have a palindromic structure, any segment of an inter-operonic sequence can in principle be a tfbs as long as a tf can recognize it. therefore, tfbss are usually predicted by comparative analysis of multiple sequences that are known to contain or potentially contain tfbss. based on the observation that the transcriptional regulation machinery including tfbss is relatively conserved in closely related genomes, various forms of phylogenetic footprinting algorithms have been developed to identify conserved dna segments as possible tfbss in the promoters of orthologous genes in a group of related prokaryotic  <cit>  and fungal genomes  <cit> . for the convenience of discussion, in this paper, we refer a set of similar tfbss as a motif.

these algorithms typically start by predicting tfbss in the upstream intergenic sequences of a group of orthologous genes using a motif-finding tool, and then cluster the resulting motifs into distinct sets according to the similarity values among the motifs using different clustering strategies and similarity measures  <cit> . although meaningful results have been achieved by these algorithms in their specific applications, their prediction coverage of possible tfbss in the applied genomes is generally low  <cit> . for instance, using a bayesian clustering algorithm to group similar tfbss predicted in e. coli k <dig> by phylogenetic footprinting in an earlier work  <cit> , qin et al.  <cit>  could only predict  <dig> motifs covering only  <dig> operons, while the e. coli k <dig> genome is predicted to encode 266- <dig> tfs, and more than  <dig> operons  <cit> . in another study, van nimwegen et al.  <cit>  used a monte carlo sampling strategy to partition into clusters a set of tfbss predicted by phylogenetic footprinting  <cit> ; this study yielded only  <dig> significant clusters/motifs. more recently, liu et al.  <cit>  used the phylonet algorithm  <cit>  to cluster putative tfbss predicted by the motif-finding program consensus-v6c  <cit>  through phylogenetic footprinting in the shewanella oneidensis genome, finding that phylonet is not able to efficiently cluster the predicted tfbss. therefore, an additional hierarchical clustering procedure was used to achieve reasonable predictions  <cit> .

in our opinion, there are two unnecessarily exclusive problems in these existing algorithms, limiting their performance and applications. first, these algorithms used only a single motif-finding tool in the phylogenetic footprinting process for identifying putative tfbss. however, it has been shown that these motif-finding tools can only predict at most 30% of known tfbss in the input intergenic sequences, and may be biased to some types of tfbss, though different tools may complement with each other for recovering different types of tfbss  <cit> . second, most of these algorithms assume that the putative tfbss predicted by a phylogenetic footprinting procedure are all true tfbss; therefore the subsequent clustering procedure is designed to group similar motifs into distinct ones without filtering out the spurious predictions. however, a considerable portion of the predicted motifs are clearly spurious predictions due to the low prediction accuracy of current motif-finding tools  <cit> .

to overcome these problems, we have recently developed a new algorithm named gleclubs  for genome-wide de novo prediction of tfbss in a prokaryotic genome  <cit> . although gleclubs also employs a phylogenetic footprinting technique to first identify all possible tfbss, and then clusters similar motifs, it is distinct from the prior methods in two ways. first, in order to harvest as many as possible true tfbss by phylogenetic footprinting, gleclubs uses multiple well-evaluated complementary motif-finding tools instead of using only a single tool, and considers multiple outputs of each tool. second, gleclubs assumes that only a small portion of predicted tfbss by phylogenetic footprinting are true tfbss, and that the vast majority of them are spurious predictions. therefore, the goal of the clustering step of gleclubs is to discriminate true tfbss from spurious ones using an iterative filtering procedure, instead of simply partitioning putative tfbss into distinct groups. we have shown that gleclubs outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of the prediction sensitivity and specificity in e. coli k <dig>  b. subtilis and s. oneidensis  <cit> . we found that the major bottleneck for the prediction accuracy of gleclubs is the accuracy of operon predictions that are used to guide the extraction of inter-operonic sequences for phylogenetic footprinting  <cit> . when inter-operonic sequences are correctly extracted, gleclubs can recover at least 80% known tfbss in both e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, according to regulondb  <cit>  and dbtbs  <cit> , respectively.

nevertheless, gleclubs and all of the other prior algorithms that we are aware of, only aim at predicting tfbss in a single target genome even though multiple reference genomes are used during the phylogenetic footprinting and subsequent clustering steps; therefore the information derived for the tfbss in the reference genomes are not fully utilized. for this reason, all these algorithms including gleclubs are not efficient enough to be applied to all the sequenced prokaryotic genomes. in this study, we have developed a new version of gleclubs called extended-gleclubs  for simultaneous de novo prediction of tfbss in a group of prokaryotic genomes that we call a group of target genomes. we showed that egleclubs can achieve at least the same level of prediction accuracy for a group of genomes as gleclubs does for a single genome; however, it can simultaneously predict tfbss in dozens of closely related genomes. therefore egleclubs is more efficient than gleclubs, and can be used for predicting tfbss in the increasing number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes.

RESULTS
tfbss can be effectively identified by phylogenetic footprinting based on predicted coors using multiple motif-finding tools
in a typical phylogenetic footprinting procedure with a single target genome, upstream intergenic sequences are extracted based on a group of orthologous genes of a gene in the target genome  <cit> . we  <cit>  have previously shown that intergenic sequences extracted from a group of orthologous operons determined by an operon in the target genome outperforms intergenic sequences extracted based on a group of orthologous genes determined by a gene in the target genome for motif-finding. in current study, in order to predict tfbss in a group of genomes, we predict clusters of operons with orthologous relationships  in the genomes. we then extract upstream inter-operonic sequences based on the predicted coors. clearly, by the design of the algorithm for predicting coors, the extracted sequences are unlikely biased to any genome in the group. application of the algorithm  to a group of target genomes comprised of  <dig> Î³-proteobacterial genomes including e. coli k <dig>  resulted in  <dig>  coors and inter-operonic sequences sets which contain  <dig>  known e. coli k <dig> tfbss as described above. to evaluate whether or not we can effectively identify these known e. coli k <dig> tfbss in the inter-operonic sequence sets based on the coors, we applied seven motif-finding tools that we have evaluated previously  <cit>  to these  <dig>  inter-operonic sequence sets. these seven tools were meme  <cit> , bioprospector  <cit> , motifsampler  <cit> , cubic  <cit> , mdscan  <cit> , weeder  <cit>  and consensus  <cit> . these tools were chosen based on evaluations by others  <cit> , the balance of different algorithm designs and ease of use. as shown in figure 2a, these tools have different performances in their ability to recover known e. coli k <dig> tfbss in the inter-operonic sequence sets for their best, top  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> predictions, but they all identify an increasing number of known e. coli k <dig> tfbss when more predictions are considered. we can define a lower bound of specificity as the number of predicted known tfbs divided by the number of predicted tfbss, to evaluate the prediction specificity of each tool, although since tfbs in e. coli k <dig> have not been completely characterized, this estimate of specificity may be overly conservative. as shown in figure 2b, the increasing number of known e. coli k <dig> tfbss recovered by each tool when more top predictions are considered is at the cost of a decreased lower bound of specificity. furthermore, the predictions of these tools are complementary to one another as their combined predictions recover more known tfbss than does any single tool . however, weeder and consensus substantially underperform the other tools, and their predictions were all covered by the other tools, therefore they were not further considered. using a low bound specificity cutoff of 5% , and based on the results shown in figure 2a, we consider for further analysis a total of  <dig> motifs in each inter-operonic sequence set associated with a coor, including the top  <dig> predictions of meme, the top  <dig> predictions of bioprospector, and the top  <dig> predictions of cubic, mdscan and motifsampler, respectively. therefore, there are a total of  <dig>  Ã  <dig> =  <dig>  predicted motifs  for this group of target genomes. these predicted motifs recover  <dig>   known e. coli k <dig> tfbss in the extracted inter-operonic sequence sets. as shown in figures 2c and 2d, although there are large overlaps among the predictions of these tools, each tool has its own considerable unique predictions. therefore, we have achieved at least the same level of sensitivity as our previous results obtained from the inter-operonic sequences based on operons using e. coli k <dig> as the single target genome  <cit> . these results suggest that tfbss can be effectively identified based on the predicted coors, and that our choice of these five tools and their top predictions are sufficient enough to recover true tfbss in the inter-operonic sequence sets, though other choices of motif-finding tools are possible, in particular, when better ones are available in the future. furthermore, although our predictions were only evaluated in e. coli k <dig> because very little is known about tfbss in other genomes in the group, it is highly likely that similar results have been achieved for the other genomes in the group since the coors are unlikely biased to any genome in the group .

optimal selection of a group of target genomes is vital for the prediction of tfbss
since each genome in a group of target genomes is both a target genome for which we want to predict all possible tfbss and a reference genome for all the others in the group, the composition of genomes in a group can largely affect the results of phylogenetic footprinting. furthermore, it has been shown that cis-regulatory systems in prokaryotes evolve very rapidly and are extremely flexible  <cit> , thus traditional phylogenetic analyses may fail to detect conserved cis-regulatory systems. to quantify the level of conservation of cis-regulatory systems in a group of related genomes, we constructed a special phylogenetic tree that largely reflects the relationships of the cis-regulatory systems in the genomes, using a method that we developed previously <cit>  . the tree for  <dig> Î³-proteobacterial genomes is shown in . to determine the level of conservation of cis-regulatory systems, so that phylogenetic footprinting would perform best in the corresponding genomes for recovering known tfbss, we selected five sub-trees including e. coli k <dig> using different branching points with increasing distances in the tree for the Î³-proteobacterial genomes , and obtained five groups of genomes as follows: group a containing escherichia genomes, group b containing escherichia and shigella genomes, group c containing escherichia, shigella, and salmonella genomes, group d containing escherichia, shigella, salmonella, and yersinia genomes, and group e containing escherichia, shigella, salmonella, yersinia, pseudomonas, shewanella, and vibrio genomes. as shown in figure 2e, groups a and b did not perform very well because only genomes that are very closely related to each other were used. similarly, group e did not perform well either, presumably because some genomes in the groups have cis-regulatory systems that are too divergent. in contrast, groups c and d that include genomes encoding cis-regulatory systems that are intermediately related to that of e. coli k <dig> are the best in recovering the known e. coli k <dig> tfbss in the extracted intergenic sequences. interestingly, removal of other very closely related escherichia genomes in groups c and d decreased the performance of phylogenetic footprinting . this result is consistent with an earlier observation that inclusion of reference genomes that are very closely related to the target genome may improve the performance of phylogenetic footprinting if other reference genomes that are intermediately related to the target genome are also included  <cit> . as shown in figure 2e group d recovers the largest number of known e. coli k <dig> tfbss and has the largest number of overlapping predictions with those of its neighboring groups c and e. since group d does not include any genomes that share less than 50% of tfs with any other genomes, we used this as the criterion for selecting a group of target genomes for the prediction of their tfbss. in other words, by default, we select a sub-tree from the phylogenetic tree of cis-regulatory systems of a group of sequenced genomes belonging to the same phylum/subphylum or class to form a group of target genomes, such that each genome in the sub-tree shares at least 50% of its tfs with any other genomes in the group . accordingly, we used group d to evaluate the performance of our motif clustering algorithm.

selection of the motif similarity cut-offs Î± and Î² for the construction of motif similarity graphs g <dig> and g <dig>  respectively
next, we want to distinguish true tfbss from spurious ones in the set of input motifs predicted for a group of target genomes by gradually filtering out the latter based on the following two assumptions as we used in gleclubs previously  <cit> : 1) a true motif is more likely than a spurious one to be found by multiple tools from the same inter-operonic sequence set based on a coor; and 2) a true motif is more likely than a spurious one to have a similar motif found in a different coor. to this end, we use a graph-theoretic approach similar to that used in gleclubs. however, instead of first constructing a single motif similarity graph, we begin with two motif similarity graphs g <dig> and g <dig> using a low and a high motif similarity score cut-offs Î± and Î² , respectively . as shown in figure 2f, the distribution of the similarity scores among all predicted motifs in the group is largely left-shifted relative to that among the sub-motifs of each known motif in e. coli k <dig>  suggesting that the majority of predicted motifs are irrelevant to one another or are spurious predictions. on the other hand, there is a considerable overlap between the two distributions of the similarity scores, suggesting that the true motifs cannot be easily separated from the spurious ones by a single similarity score cut-off. the same conclusion was reached by us previously when e. coli k <dig> was chosen as the single target genome  <cit> . furthermore, in the current application we have to deal with a much large set of input motifs  identified from the  <dig>  inter-operonic sequence sets based on the same number of coors in the group of genomes, which is almost twice more than those when e. coli k <dig> was used as the single target genome  <cit> . ideally, a motif similarity graph should be constructed, so that most relevant true sub-motifs are connected by edges with higher weights, while most irrelevant and spurious motifs are not. according to the similarity score distributions shown in figure 2f, the optimal similarity score cut-off value seems to be located around  <dig> . however, we found that with this similarity score cut-off or lower, the density of a resulting graph  was too high . and a graph of this size  could not be efficiently clustered into dense subgraphs/clusters by any clustering algorithms that we have tested, including the markov chain clustering  algorithm  <cit>  that is best known for its high efficiency for clustering very large graphs. however, the density of the motif similarity graphs decreases precipitously when the motif similarity cut-off is greater than  <dig>   while the resulting graphs still include the vast majority  of input motifs as long as the cut-off is less than  <dig>  . therefore, we selected the cut-off Î± â for the construction of motif similarity graph g <dig> that includes the vast majority of input motifs. nevertheless, g <dig> usually still has a too high density  to be efficiently clustered, therefore, we construct a substitute motif similarity graph g <dig> using a higher motif similarity score cut-off Î² â. since g <dig> has a low enough density , thus can be efficiently clustered by the mcl algorithm, while the graph still keeps more than 90% of the input motifs . therefore, our clustering algorithm works by first clustering g <dig> into dense subgraphs, and then recruits those in g <dig> but missed in g <dig> .

prediction of tfbss in a group of Î³-proteobacterial genomes including e. coli k <dig> and a group of firmicutes genomes including b. subtilis
the egleclubs algorithm ranks the predicted motifs in each genome in a group of target genomes according their clusterscores defined by formula . to evaluate the prediction accuracy and robustness of our algorithm, we first applied it to a group of  <dig> Î³-proteobacterial genomes including e. coli k <dig> , and a group of  <dig> firmicutes genomes including b. subtilis  using the same parameter settings. these two groups of genomes were chosen for the evaluation as the relatively large numbers of known tfbss in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis can be used to systematically verify our predictions in the two genomes.

as shown in table  <dig>  of the  <dig>  and  <dig> known tfbss belonging to  <dig> and  <dig> motifs in e. coli k <dig>  <cit>  and b. subtilis  <cit> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> belonging to <dig> and  <dig> motifs, respectively, are correctly extracted and included in the upstream inter-operonic sequence sets according to the predicted operons in the genomes  <cit>  and our criterion that each set has to contain at least three sequences . consequently, about  <dig> and 21% of tfbss in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis  <cit> , respectively, were not included in the inter-operonic sequence sets due to the incorrect operon predictions or the restriction of our criterion, and thus could not be predicted by our clustering algorithm. the reason that there are a larger portion  of missed tfbss in the extracted sequence sets for b. subtilis than that  for e. coli k <dig> is that more inter-operonic sequence sets containing a sequence from b. subtilis were deleted as the corresponding coors contain fewer than three operons, and thus were not further analyzed . the five motif-finding tools returning a total of  <dig> motifs in each inter-operonic sequence set recover  <dig>  and  <dig> known tfbss belonging to  <dig> and  <dig> motifs in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively . thus,  <dig> and 88% of known tfbss included in the inter-operonic sequence sets are recovered by the phylogenetic footprinting procedure in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis  <cit> , respectively .

the percentage in a brace is the recovery rate at that step based on the previous step. *the calculations are based on the top  <dig> and  <dig> motifs/clusters predicted in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively.

we then calculated the cumulative recovery rate by the top-ranked motifs of the  <dig>  and  <dig> known tfbss found by phylogenetic footprinting in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively. as shown in figure 5a, with the increase in the number of top-ranked clusters, the cumulative recovery rate of known tfbss by the top-ranked clusters increases very rapidly for the top  <dig> and  <dig> clusters, which recover  <dig>   and  <dig>  of the  <dig> and  <dig> known tfbss in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively, and then it enters a saturation phase with a small linear increase. we also calculated the recovery rate of the  <dig> and  <dig> motifs by the top-ranked clusters in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively. we consider that a known motif is recovered by one cluster if at least 20% of its known tfbss are included in this cluster. as shown in figure 5b, with the increase in the rank of clusters, the cumulative recovery rate of known motifs by the top-ranked clusters increases rapidly for the top  <dig> and  <dig> clusters, recovering  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the  <dig> and  <dig> motifs in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively, and then it also enters a saturation phase with little increase. therefore, our clustering algorithm has achieved rather high sensitivity in recovering the known tfbss as well as the known motifs of both genomes. interestingly, the cumulative recovery rate of known motifs saturate at around the top 300-th and 230-th predicted motifs, which is close to the number of tfs that have been estimated in the e. coli k <dig>  <cit>  and b. subtilis genomes  <cit> , respectively. the rapid recovery of known tfbss  and motifs  by top-ranked clusters also suggest that the higher the rank of a cluster, the more likely it is a true motif.

to assess the specificity of the predictions in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, we calculated the number of cumulative unique predicted tfbss in the top-ranked clusters. we consider a predicted tfbs to be unique if there is no other site overlapping with it by more than eight bases. as shown in figure 5c, with the increase in the rank of clusters, the number of cumulative unique predicted tfbss in both genomes increases in a way very similar to the cumulative recovery rates of known tfbss shown in figure 5a, and then it saturates around the top 300-th and 230-th clusters, covering about  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique tfbss in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively.

there are  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique predicted tfbss in the whole set of  <dig>  and  <dig>  input motifs predicted by phylogenetic footprinting in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively. therefore, the vast majority of predicted tfbss have been filtered out by our algorithm in both genomes. the fact that these relatively small numbers  of unique predicted tfbss recover  <dig>   and  <dig>  of  <dig>  and  <dig> known tfbss in the top  <dig> and  <dig> clusters of e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively, suggests that our clustering algorithm has significantly enriched the true tfbss in the predictions . it is highly likely that our algorithm has achieved high prediction specificity in both genomes, although we cannot accurately compute the prediction specificity and false positive rate, because not all tfbss in both genomes are currently known. however, we can estimate the low bound of prediction specificity based on the partially known tfbss to be 22%  and 7%  by the top  <dig> and  <dig> clusters in which  <dig>  and  <dig>  motifs recovered in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis, respectively. as shown in , the top  <dig> predicted motifs in both e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis recover  <dig> known motifs, achieving a low bound specificity of 50% in both genomes. therefore, we have achieved at least the same level of prediction accuracy in both genomes as we have previously obtained when e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis were used as the single target genome  <cit> .

in the current study since our selection of genomes in the two groups of target genomes, and prediction of coors are not biased to any particular genome, e.g., e. coli k <dig> or b. subtilis in the groups, it is highly likely that we have also achieved the same level of prediction accuracy for all of the genomes in the groups, although we cannot systematically verify our prediction in the genomes other than e. coli k <dig> or b. subtilis, because none of these genomes has enough number of known tfbss for doing so. however, if we inspect the predictions in any of these less-studied genomes, biologically meaningful results can be always identified http://gleclubs.uncc.edu/pbs. for example, if we look at the top-ranked motifs in yersinia pestis biovar mediaevails that is relatively far away from e. coli k <dig> in the tree  in the Î³-proteobacterial group, the 2nd top-scoring motif is similar the crp binding sites in e. coli k <dig>  and the genes that bear a binding site of this motif are annotated to be involved in carbon and energy metabolism, therefore it is highly likely that this is the crp binding motif in the genome. the 3rd top-scoring motif is similar to the fur motif in e. coli k <dig>  and genes that bear a binding site of this motif are annotated to be involved in ion assimilation, therefore it is highly likely that this motif is recognized by fur in this genome. the 32-nd top-scoring motif is associated with genes involved in arginine biosynthesis, thus is likely to be the binding motif of the regulator argr in this genome. the binding sites of the 43-rd top-scoring motifs are born by genes involved in pentose metabolism, so this motif is likely to be involved in the regulation of pentose metabolism, however, its cognate tf cannot be predicted based on the current data. the 50-th top-scoring motifs is similar to the lexa motif in e. coli k <dig>  and many genes bearing a binding site of this motif are annotated to be involved in dna damage repairing, so it is likely that this motif is recognized by lexa in this genome. similar results are seen for the other yersinia genomes in the group http://gleclubs.uncc.edu/pbs. therefore, egleclubs can not only predict known tfbss in model organisms, but also can predict novel tfbss in less-studied organisms. the predicted tfbss in the  <dig> Î³-proteobacterial and  <dig> firmicutes genomes can be found at the website of egleclubs http://gleclubs.uncc.edu/pbs. more importantly, with only one more graph clustering step than its predecessor gleclubs , egleclubs can predict tfbss in a group of up to  <dig> genomes. therefore, egleclubs is more efficient than gleclubs.

furthermore, these results also show that we have achieved the similar prediction accuracy in b. subtilis based on the  <dig> firmicutes genomes as in e. coli k <dig> based on the  <dig> Î³-proteobacterial genomes using the same parameter settings, suggesting that our algorithm is very robust in predicting tfbss in different groups of genomes. in addition, it is noticeable that the cumulative binding sites, motifs and unique putative binding sites in b. subtilis all saturate faster than those of e. coli k <dig> , respectively, although both genomes encode similar number of genes  and operons . this might indicate that b. subtilis encodes fewer tfs than does e. coli k <dig>  in fact, according to the dbd database  <cit> , the e. coli k <dig> genome was estimated to encode  <dig> tfs, while the b. subtilis genome  <dig> tfs.

prediction of tfbss in a group of cyanobacterial genomes
to further evaluate the prediction accuracy and robustness of egleclubs, we applied it to a group of  <dig> target genomes chosen from  <dig> sequenced cyanobacteria  using the same parameter settings. despite the important roles of cyanobacteria in global primary production and the evolution of green plants, our current understanding of cis-regulatory systems in even the best-studied cyanobacterial synechocystis sp. pcc  <dig> strain  is still very limited. since there are not many known tfbss in any cyanobacterial genome, we cannot systematically verify our predictions in a way as we did in e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis. however, as shown in figure 2f, the similarity scores of the input motifs for this cyanobacterial group have a very similar distribution to those of the Î³-proteobacterial and firmicutes groups, suggesting that egleclubs should also perform well in this group of genomes. furthermore, if we use our predictions in pcc <dig> as an example, as shown in figure 5c, the number of cumulative unique putative tfbss in the top-ranked clusters in the genome rapidly saturates at ~ <dig>  around the 200-th cluster, indicating that we have likely enriched the true tfbss in pcc <dig> as in the cases of e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis. again, the much faster saturation of the cumulative unique predicted tfbss in pcc <dig> than in b. subtilis and e. coli k <dig>  suggests that the number of tfs in pcc <dig> might be fewer than those in these two genomes. indeed, dbd predicts that there are  <dig> tfs in pcc <dig>  <cit> , even though the actually number might be greater than this number  <cit> . moreover, a few experimentally characterized or computationally predicted motifs by other ad hoc methods are among the top  <dig> predicted motifs in pcc <dig> , including the phob motif   <cit> , ntca motif   <cit> , and crp motif   <cit> . it is worth noting that, although the crp regulons in cyanobacteria are rather diverse as we recently showed  <cit> , egleclubs can still accurately identify the crp binding motif in pcc <dig> with a high rank. therefore, these results again unequivocally demonstrate that egleclubs is robust enough to predict tfbss in various groups of less-studied genomes with high accuracy.

correlation between the number of predicted motifs and the number of tfs encoded in genomes
as shown in figure 5d, the number of top-ranked clusters at which the cumulative unique predicted tfbss saturate is highly correlated to the number of predicted tfs in the dbd database for each genome in the three groups of target genomes. therefore, the saturation point can be used to roughly estimate the number of motifs encoded in each genome in a group of target genomes. these results again suggest that our predictions of tfbss in each genome have achieved a high level of accuracy, and that our algorithm is very robust in terms of parameter settings for different groups of target genomes. interestingly, the two bacteria that have the largest number of predicted motifs and tfs, namely, serratia proteamaculans  <dig> and klebsiella pneumoniae mgh  <dig> , are free-living pathogens of human and animals  <cit> http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/ <dig>  their more complex gene regulatory systems might be due to their needs to cope with very different living environments. in contrast, the bacterium that has the smallest number of predicted motifs and tfs is the cyanobacterium synechococcus pcc <dig>  which thrives in seawater where nutrients are relatively stable. furthermore, cyanobacteria can acquire their carbon source through photosynthesis, and thus generally have simpler gene regulatory systems.

discussion
phylogenetic footprinting followed by motif clustering has been proven the most practical method for genome-wide tfbs prediction in prokaryotic genomes. however, the existing methods including the gleclubs algorithm that we developed earlier  <cit>  were designed to predict tfbss in a single target genome of interest, and the tfbss in multiple reference genomes were largely ignored and not predicted. therefore these algorithms are not very efficient and cannot be applied to a large number of sequenced genomes. the major reason for this practice is that these methods identify orthologous gene groups for phylogenetic footprinting based on the gene contents in the target genome, therefore, inter-operonic sequences pooled based on these orthologous gene groups are inevitably biased to the target genome, and the coverage of predictions in reference genomes may not be high enough to be used for the genome-wide prediction of tfbss in the genomes. in the current study, we have developed the egleclubs algorithm for simultaneous genome-wide prediction of tfbss in each genome in a group of genomes without introducing a bias to any genome via overcoming two technical obstacles. first, we identify coors in a group of target genomes based on the gene contents and operon structures in each genome, and treat each genome in the group equally both as a target genome and as a reference genome for the others. therefore, the pooled inter-operonic sequences are unlikely to be biased to a particular genome. second, because we consider every gene in each genome in the group, we end up with about twice as many inter-operonic sequence sets as we have when a single target genome was considered  <cit> . to circumvent the difficulty of clustering a much larger motif similarity graph with relatively high density for predicting tfbss, we construct two similarity graphs g <dig> and g <dig> with a high and a low motif similarity score cut-offs, respectively. we first cut g <dig> into dense clusters, and then recruit in the resulting clusters the input motifs in g <dig> but not in g <dig>  and reconnect those that are not connect in g <dig> but in g <dig>  true motifs are then gradually separated from spurious ones through multiple rounds of subsequent graph clustering. application of the egleclubs algorithm to a group of  <dig> Î³-proteobacterial genomes including e. coli k <dig>  a group of  <dig> firmicutes genomes including b. subtilis, and a group of  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes, resulted in similar prediction results in both the e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis genomes as we have achieved when each was used as the single target genome by gleclubs  <cit> . due to the limited knowledge of tfbss in most sequenced genomes, we can only systematically verify our predictions in the two model bacteria e. coli k <dig> and b. subtilis. we assert, however, that it is highly likely that we have achieved the same level of prediction accuracy for each genome in the three groups of genomes because of the unbiasedness of our algorithm to any genome in the groups. therefore, we have improved our original algorithm for simultaneously predicting tfbss of dozens of genomes without a cost to prediction accuracy. to further speed up the algorithm, we are currently parallelizing the egleclubs algorithm through distributed computing, so that it can be applied to all the sequenced prokaryotic genomes in the public databases.

in addition, with a single set of parameter settings, our algorithm performs equally well on the groups of Î³-proteobacterial, firmicutes and likely cyanobacterial genomes. therefore, it is very robust for predicting tfbss in various groups of genomes. the robustness of our algorithm can be explained by the similar distributions of the similarity scores among the input motifs identified in the different groups of target genomes, and the similar distributions of the sub-motifs of the known motifs in different genomes . consequently, the coverage of nodes and the graph density of motif similarity graphs under different motif similarity score cut-offs in the three groups are similar . therefore, the motif similarity score cut-offs used to construct motif similarity graphs for the three groups of genomes work equally well. since these distributions are determined by the first principles of biochemical rules, thus they are unlikely to be genome-specific. therefore, we expect that our algorithm can be applied to any group of target genomes using similar parameter settings.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new algorithm for genome-wide de novo prediction of tfbss in a group of related prokaryotic genomes. the algorithm has achieved rather high prediction accuracy, and is very robust and computationally efficient. the resulting tool can be used for annotating tfbss in the increasing number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes.
