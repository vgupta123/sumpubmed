BACKGROUND
sex determination is absolutely fundamental to the fitness of sexually reproducing organisms, yet the “switches” modulating female versus male development are incredibly diverse  <cit> . this diversity arises from surprisingly numerous transitions in sex determination mechanisms across taxa, yet little is know about the evolutionary and developmental forces underlying these transitions. given the current catalog of identified sex determination mechanisms, fish are arguably the taxon with the highest diversity of sex determination mechanisms  <cit> . broadly, sex determination mechanisms are categorized as environmental , behavioral , or genetic . historically, the architecture of genetic sex determination was considered relatively simple, with a single inherited cue driving both primary gonadal sexual development, and producing resounding secondary sexual effects throughout the organism  <cit> . in vertebrates with genetic sex determination, sex determination alleles act as this cue. in species with xy sex determination systems, inheritance of the y allele is associated with male development ; with zw systems the w allele is associated with female development . when a sex determination allele arises on an autosome, the evolutionary trajectory of that chromosome can change, with new selection pressures potentially leading to local recombination suppression and heteromorphy over time  <cit> . thus sex determination alleles can exist on highly degenerated sex chromosomes such as the y chromosome in mammals  <cit> , within defined sex loci with local recombination suppression  <cit> , or as a simple polymorphism with no associated chromosomal changes  <cit> .

as sex determination alleles are cataloged, surprising overlap suggests repeated modification of a few pathways across broad taxa to modulate sexual development. specifically, members of the sry-related hmg box  and doublesex and mab- <dig> related  families of transcription factors, and anti-müllerian hormone  pathway members, have repeatedly evolved as sex determination factors . studies in fish have been key to identifying the diversity of vertebrate genetic sex determiners, with a role for dmrt first identified in medaka, and later demonstrated in chicken and frog   <cit> ; similarly the role of the amh pathway was first identified in pejerrey and fugu, and later in platypus  <cit> . moreover, recent identification of sex determiners such as gsdf and sexually dimorphic on the y-chromosome  within fish make it clear that sex determination mechanisms are not limited to the above pathways  <cit> .

it was also within fish that polygenic sex determination was discovered  <cit> , demonstrating that genetic sex determination need not be monogenic in nature. in polygenic sex determination systems, multiple, independently segregating sex determination alleles interact to determine sex within a species  <cit> . historically, examples of polygenic sex determination were considered anomalous or evolutionarily transitory; however, with broader surveys and readily available genomic tools, polygenic sex determination has been identified in multiple animal taxa, including fish, mammals, insects, and copepods  <cit> , suggesting that polygenic sex determination is a common and stable evolutionary strategy.

in fish, polygenic sex determination systems exist in both single- and multi-locus configurations. in platyfish , three alleles  segregate at the sex determination locus, interacting to determine male versus female development in what is sometimes referred to as an xyw system  <cit> . in some east african cichlids , xy and zw sex determination systems reside on distinct chromosomes, and epistasis between genotypes at the two loci determines male versus female development  <cit> . polygenic sex determination in fish can involve more than two sex determination alleles. for example, mapping sex as a quantitative trait in a hybrid cross of two cichlid species identified at least five different loci interacting in an epistatic hierarchy to determine sex  <cit> . in sea bass, the genetic architecture of sex determination may be equally polygenic, with recent mapping efforts identifying at least four loci in the genome associated with sex determination  <cit> .

in zebrafish , several independent studies indicated a highly polygenic basis of sex determination in standard laboratory strains ; however, a more recent study revealed a monogenic zw sex determination system in natural populations, with the w allele absent from laboratory strains, presumably lost during domestication  <cit> . the zebrafish findings serve as a cautionary tale for interpreting laboratory results without natural context, but also speak to the lability of sex determination and development in fishes. such lability has been known for some time, with the loss of a natural sex chromosome and arisal of a novel autosomal sex determiner during selective breeding in guppies  described nearly a century ago  <cit> . in natural context, the forces underlying such transitions between sex determination systems are poorly understood.

the adaptive radiation of african cichlid fish is a powerful model system for the study of evolution and development, and an astounding diversity of genetic sex determination loci have been revealed from just a handful of studied species . these sex determination loci exist in various contexts, including polygenic sex determination  <cit> , on supernumerary chromosomes  <cit> , and in regions of potential recombination suppression indicative of early sex chromosome evolution  <cit> . the riverine cichlid astatotilapia burtoni has served as a longstanding model of sexual physiology, behavior, and related gene expression  <cit> , yet until recently sex determination in the species was largely unexamined. a recent study described sex-specific transcriptional differences in the gonad of a. burtoni  <cit> , and another inferred the presence of an xy system in the species using crossing experiments with hormonally sex-reversed individuals  <cit> . however, direct genetic mapping of sex determination was not previously performed for a. burtoni.

here, we describe use of double digest restriction associated dna sequencing  to perform genome scans for sex-associated loci in small a. burtoni families, followed by replication in additional, independent families. we order the a. burtoni genome scaffolds to two other, higher quality cichlid genomes to orient mapping. mapping results indicate the presence of an xyw locus on linkage group  <dig> , and an xy locus on lg5- <dig> . the evidence for at least three sex determination alleles strongly supports the presence of polygenic sex determination in a. burtoni, though we discuss caveats related to sex reversal and lability of sex determination during fish domestication. additionally, haplotype data define an additional pair of linkage groups involved in the other a. burtoni-specific chromosome fusion.

RESULTS
comparative scaffolding of the a. burtoni genome

a. burtoni was one of five cichlid species sequenced as part of the cichlid genome project, but was also the species with the most fragmented genome assembly . in order to provide chromosome-level organization of a. burtoni scaffolds for mapping, we ordered and oriented them to anchored genomes of two of other cichlid species . the nile tilapia  genome assembly was anchored to a high-resolution radiation hybrid map, providing a golden path  <cit> . genome scaffolds of metriaclima zebra, a lake malawi species, were also anchored to a radseq-based genetic map  <cit> . a. burtoni scaffold assignment was consistent by linkage group for both species, but regular inconsistencies in scaffold order indicate a moderate level of intrachromosomal rearrangement between o. niloticus and m. zebra. we use the o. niloticus scaffolding for the following analysis because it provided the most parsimonious ordering based on our marker data, including producing continuous, uninterrupted mapping intervals. we number a. burtoni linkage groups based on synteny with established o. niloticus linkage group numbering, per convention in the cichlid genetics community  <cit> .

identification of two sex determination loci
two a. burtoni families with near-equal sex ratios were genotyped using a ddradseq strategy, and resulting snp marker genotypes were tested for association with gonadal sex . markers with significant p values  were further sorted by allele frequency in each sex, to search for minor alleles at intermediate frequency in one sex, and absent in the other, following a dominant model of sex determination . both families had numerous markers with significant associations with phenotypic sex, and alignment of marker sequences to the tilapia genome revealed clustering of the associated markers by linkage group. in one family, marker genotypes in a region of lg <dig> show near perfect association with sex, as do markers on unanchored portions of the tilapia assembly including unk <dig> and unk <dig> . based on association and haplotype patterns we predict that sex-associated scaffolds aligning to unk <dig> and unk <dig> should be placed on lg <dig>  within or adjacent to the sex associated scaffolds aligning there. because maternal alleles at lg <dig> co-segregate with sex, we designate this family as having sex determined by a zw system.table  <dig> summary of ddradseq mapping families

in a second family, associated rad markers consistently aligned to tilapia lg <dig> and lg <dig> . previous karyotype analysis demonstrated that a. burtoni has two fused chromosome pairs relative to all other haplochromine cichlids surveyed  <cit> . examination of our associated marker genotypes at lg <dig> and lg <dig> revealed clear haplotypes with no recombinants spanning the two linkage groups , demonstrating that lg <dig> and lg <dig> constitute one of the chromosome fusions in the a. burtoni karyotype relative to tilapia; we refer to this fusion as lg5- <dig> in a. burtoni . paternal alleles co-segregate with sex at lg5- <dig>  and thus we designate it as carrying an xy sex determination system.fig.  <dig> association of sex with snp markers on lg5- <dig> in family  <dig>  with comparisons to other mapping studies. a association plotted as the negative log of fisher’s exact test p value of marker alleles with sex , aligned to a. burtoni genome scaffolds ordered and oriented to lg <dig> and lg <dig> of the o. niloticus genome assembly . in a. burtoni, lg <dig> and lg <dig> are fused relative to other cichlids. lines on association plot indicate sliding window analysis of association data . b comparison of sex-associated markers with previous mapping studies in cichlids, with numbers linking to references. colored bars indicate range of sex-associated markers relative to a. burtoni scaffolds above in a. kudo et al.  <cit>  described association with sex without indicating an xy or zw system. roberts et al.  <cit>  mapped the orange blotch  pigmentation allele, tightly linked to a w sex determination allele




because the two discovery families were relatively small and provided relatively low power to detect associations, we confirmed association of these loci with phenotypic sex by testing  <dig> additional families with simple sequence repeat  markers on lg <dig> and lg5- <dig> . segregation of parental alleles at either lg <dig> or lg5- <dig> is associated with sex determination in the majority of families tested. in families where genotypes at lg5- <dig> are associated with sex, the sire’s alleles are consistently associated with sex of offspring , replicating findings from the discovery family, and providing strong evidence for an xy sex determination system on lg5- <dig>  where multiple families from the same lg5- <dig> xy sire were tested, the same paternal haplotype is consistently associated with male sex in offspring . we infer that this paternal haplotype is tightly linked to a dominant y male sex determination allele.table  <dig> association of genetic markers with sex in families

in families where lg <dig> is associated with sex determination, either a maternal or a paternal allele can be found associated with sex, depending on the family tested . in several families, a maternal haplotype segregates with sex in the offspring, and the same maternal haplotype is associated with female sex in multiple families, supporting the presence of a dominant w female sex determination allele . surprisingly, paternal alleles at lg <dig> co-segregate with sex of offspring in families from two sires, suggesting that a dominant y male sex determination allele may also be present on lg <dig> . differences in parental inheritance of sex determination alleles among families with lg <dig> sex determination suggest that an xyw sex determination system akin to that found in platyfish may be present at lg13; however, occasional sex reversal could also account for observed patterns in the absence of a lg <dig> y allele .

several families showed no association of sex with markers at lg <dig> or lg5- <dig> . these families allow the possibility of additional, unidentified sex determination loci in a. burtoni. alternatively, interactions among identified sex determination alleles, or between sex determination alleles and the environment, could confound interpretation.

interactions between sex loci
because we find multiple loci and alleles that appear to impact sex, we would expect some families to be segregating multiple alleles that would interact to influence sex determination. studies in both tilapias and lake malawi cichlids with polygenic sex determination have revealed clear patterns of epistasis relating to phenotypic sex . unfortunately, we find no clear examples of such interactions in our families. one small family  has perfect segregation of sex with paternal alleles at lg <dig>  supporting the sire having an lg <dig> xy genotype. two sons but no daughters in the family also inherit a multi-marker haplotype at lg5- <dig> associated with the lg5- <dig> y in other families . we hypothesize that the genotype of the sire and two sons in this family is lg5- <dig> xy, lg <dig> xy, and thus that individuals with a y allele at each locus are viable and develop as males; however, this interpretation is based on a single, small family and is thus very tentative.

in families tested where sex is not clearly associated with alleles at either lg <dig> or lg5- <dig> alone , inter- and intra-locus interactions may be present that do not conform to our expected patterns of allelic dominance. additionally, some families were not included in this study because they had extreme sex ratios , and/or few offspring, preventing meaningful interpretation of inheritance patterns; however, interaction of multiple sex alleles may produce skewed sex ratios or non-viable genotypes. in cichlids and other fish species, co-segregation of both y and w alleles in families produces female-biased sex ratios  <cit> , and in pygmy mice with an xyw system, mating of some sex genotypes results in inviability of a portion of their offspring  <cit> . parnell and streelman described five distinct sex determination loci  in a lake malawi cichlid mapping cross, demonstrating that sex ratios represent the outcome of complex interactions between relatively strong and weak sex determination alleles  <cit> . thus, epistasis may be difficult to characterize, particularly in small families, and further work is needed to understand the phenotypic outcomes of interactions between the sex determination alleles identified.

sex ratios and penetrance
previous studies have demonstrated that polygenic sex determination systems in cichlids produce skewed sex ratios. in a survey of species from lake malawi, families with sex determined by an xy system had equal sex ratios, while those with a zw system generally had a female-biased sex ratio  <cit> . in families where both xy and zw systems segregated, a 1: <dig>  sex ratio is expected  <cit> . in some lake victoria cichlids, sex determination factors on supernumerary chromosomes also produce female-skewed sex ratios  <cit> . comparing the sex ratios of our lg5- <dig> xy families and lg <dig> zw a. burtoni families reveals an intriguing and significant pattern: xy families have a male-biased sex ratio, and zw families have a female-biased sex ratio . because we only identified a few putative lg <dig> xy families, we do not test for significant divergence in sex ratio or penetrance.fig.  <dig> sex ratios and penetrance by sex determination system. a sex ratio by sex determination system. dashed line indicates a 1: <dig> sex ratio, with values lower than the line indicating a female-biased sex ratio, and those above the line a male-biased sex ratio. . b penetrance by sex determination system, not significant




comparing penetrance of each sex determination allele, we find no significant differences , and a mean penetrance of 88 % for all sex determination alleles. incomplete penetrance could be explained by a number of factors, including incorrect phenotype data, recombination between our sex-linked markers and the sex determination polymorphism, or sex reversal. if sex reversal is the case, it presents an alternative hypothesis regarding the interpretation that both w and y alleles are present at lg <dig>  the presence of a w allele has greater support based on replication with a number of dams, but only two sires were found to have their lg <dig> alleles segregate with sex of their offspring. phenotypic males in some families with lg <dig> zw dams occasionally carry a w haplotype at tested markers. for example, see family  <dig>  where two males exhibit the w-associated haplotype at lg <dig> . uncommon males that are genetically female  would have their lg <dig> alleles co-segregate with the sex of their offspring, lending the appearance of an xy system even though a distinct, male-determining y allele might not exist at the locus.

genetic intervals for sex loci
incomplete penetrance makes it difficult to determine mapping intervals via recombination breakpoint mapping, because it is unclear if genotype-phenotype mismatch at a particular marker is due to recombination or sex reversal. though our ddradseq families included relatively few individuals, we estimate genetic intervals based on strongly associated genome scaffolds. for the lg <dig> zw locus, scaffolds spanning approximately  <dig>  mb show the highest association with sex . at lg5- <dig>  a broad plateau of association spans 43 mb of the linkage group based on data from the initial discovery family . we further interrogated the association data with a sliding window analysis on lg5- <dig>  to look for regions with the highest density of associated snps, which may correspond to the region of highest sequence divergence. sliding window analysis reveals a broad peak of the highest density of associated snps on several scaffolds that align to lg <dig> of tilapia. in one family with lg5- <dig> xy sex determination, recombination breakpoints in one individual support that the region under this peak contains the sex determination locus .

candidate genes
though precise genetic intervals are not clear, we examined gene content on the a. burtoni scaffolds with the highest association in our rad family data . notably, genes with established roles in sex determination in multiple vertebrate species  are not found on these scaffolds, suggesting the use of novel sex determination genes by a. burtoni. here we highlight intriguing candidate genes on associated scaffolds based on known roles in sexual development or fertility.

lg13
the total length of sex-associated scaffolds at lg <dig> zw is relatively small compared to those at lg5- <dig>  one strong candidate for sex determination in the region is cytochrome p <dig> 17alpha-hydroxylase , a key steroidogenic enzyme in the production of sex hormones in vertebrates  <cit> . mutations of cyp17a <dig> in humans produce low androgen levels and ambiguous or female external genitalia in xy individuals  <cit> . in amphibians , cyp <dig> has been repeatedly implicated as one of the key players in gonadal differentiation  <cit> . in the cichlid nile tilapia, strong sexually dimorphic expression of cyp17a <dig> is found during sexual differentiation  <cit> . moreover, strong changes in cyp17a <dig> expression accompany both natural sex reversal in field rice eel, a sequential hermaphrodite  <cit> , and induced sex reversal in zebrafish  <cit> . across species, activity of cyp17a <dig> is associated with male sexual development, suggesting that a deleterious mutation to the gene in a. burtoni could produce a w allele inducing feminization of the gonad.

another compelling candidate on lg <dig> is type i bone morphogenetic protein receptor , required for amh-induced regression of female gonadal tissues in mammals; targeted disruption of bmpr1a in mullerian ducts in mice leads to pseudohermaphrodite males retaining oviducts and uteri  <cit> . amh pathway members have been identified as sex determination genes in multiple fish species  <cit> , demonstrating the importance of the pathway in sex determination. an evolved bmpr1a loss-of-function mutation in a. burtoni could reasonably shift gonadal development towards ovarian development.

a few genes found in the sex-associated region of lg <dig> are involved in production or response to gonadotropins. luteinizing hormone beta  is a subunit of luteinizing hormone, a gonadotropin secreted from the pituitary to direct gonadal development in fishes  <cit> . notably, knock-out of lhb in zebrafish  produces female infertility via oocyte maturation defects, while testes and male fertility are normal, providing a sex-specific role for the gene in reproductive biology in fish  <cit> . ventral anterior homeobox  <dig>  is essential for expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, with loss of vax <dig> in mice leading to hypogonadism and infertility in both sexes  <cit> . glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha  <dig>  is expressed in spermatogonial stem cells in fishes in response to gonadotropins  <cit> .

lg5-14
the sex-associated region at lg5- <dig> xy is broad, and thus we focus consideration of candidate genes on scaffolds on the region of lg5- <dig> with the highest density of sex-associated snps . perhaps the most interesting candidate in the region is wingless-type mmtv integration site family member  <dig> , required for female development in vertebrates, and considered one of the central female-promoting factors in sex differentiation networks . while loss of wnt <dig> in mice causes partial female-to-male sex reversal  <cit> , and there has been at least one case of sex reversal in an xy human carrying a wnt <dig> duplication  <cit> , to date wnt <dig> has not been implicated as the primary sex determination gene in any species. wnt7a  is also found in the xy region on lg5- <dig> in a. burtoni, and has been implicated in sexually dimorphic gonad development in mammals  <cit> .


r-spondin  <dig>  is a member of the r-spondin gene family, where rspo <dig> is also a key member of vertebrate sex determination networks, with mutation in humans producing xx sex reversal  <cit> . while a direct role for rspo <dig> in sex differentiation has not yet been demonstrated, it exhibits sexual dimorphic expression in mammalian gonad, with higher levels in the ovary  <cit> .

multiple genes in the lg <dig> xy region modulate fundamental aspects of gonadal development. bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  regulates germ cell proliferation in mouse gonad  <cit> , and has been implicated in gonadal divergence in chickens  <cit> . further, bmp <dig> is involved in androgen-dependent development of secondary sexual characteristics in medaka  <cit> . gata binding protein  <dig>  is a zinc finger transcription factor that is expressed in a sexually dimorphic fashion during mouse gonadogenesis  <cit> , and is known to regulate the expression of gonadotropins including lhb  <cit> , found in the lg <dig> zw interval. cyp27b <dig>  encodes 25-hydroxyvitamin d <dig> 1-alpha-hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of the active form of vitamin d3; female cyp27b <dig> knock out mice have extensive reproductive defects, including delayed puberty, uterine hypoplasia, altered estrogen and gonadotropin levels, and infertility .

a second chromosome fusion
because our ddradseq haplotype data was able to resolve the linkage groups involved in one of two the a. burtoni chromosome fusions relative to other cichlids  <cit> , we attempted to identify the other known fusion by exploring linkage between markers in our rad genotype data. building an outcross linkage map with only  <dig> offspring from rad family  <dig> produced a poorly resolved linkage map, with  <dig> linkage groups containing greater than five markers. though the map was very rough, it identified candidates for linkage group fusions that were then examined by manual comparison of haplotypes. markers aligning to two tilapia linkage groups, lg8- <dig> and lg16- <dig>  were linked in our map output.  we find continuous haplotypes spanning lg8- <dig> and lg16- <dig>  with significant linkage between markers aligning to the two linkage groups , supporting the fusion of the two associated chromosomes in a. burtoni relative to other cichlids. maintaining the community naming convention based on the original o. niloticus linkage map, this linkage group would be given the rather cumbersome designation lg8-24-16- <dig>  a previous report suggested that one of the fusions in a. burtoni consisted of lg <dig> and lg <dig> relative to other cichlids  <cit> , but we find no evidence of linkage between markers mapping to those linkage groups . this discrepancy may stem from interchromosomal rearrangements more complex than simple fusions, where different portions of a particular tilapia lg map to different a. burtoni lgs. thus, use of different genetic markers could provide patterns suggesting fusion of different lgs.

comparisons among cichlid sex determination systems
a previous study inferred the mode of sex determination system in a. burtoni using hormonal sex reversal  <cit> , in a line derived from the same lab strain we use here. estradiol sex reversal of males and subsequent testcrosses strongly indicated an xy sex determination system, and ruled out a zw system  <cit> . these results are consistent with our mapping data, because it is quite possible that only the xy sex determination system was present in the four families used for sex reversal experiments. indeed, bottlenecks during transfer of the a. burtoni lab strain between labs may inadvertently lead to complete loss of some sex determination alleles. concurrent mapping experiments by another group using the same lab line as the sex reversal experiments above identified co-segregation of sex with markers on lg <dig> indicating an xy system  <cit> , completely consistent with the mapping results we describe here. while the concurrent study found no association of sex with lg <dig>  it did identify an association of sex with lg <dig> in the offspring of a pair of wild-caught individuals from a lake tanganyika estuary  <cit> . together, our differing but overlapping results support the presence of complex, polygenic, and potentially rapidly evolving sex determination in a. burtoni.

a number of sex determination loci have been identified in cichlids. in tilapia, sex determination has been associated with lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and two distinct loci on lg <dig>  depending on the species and population  <cit> . in lake malawi haplochromine cichlid species, lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and two loci on lg <dig> have been associated with sex determination  <cit> . in haplochromine cichlids from lake victoria, lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and supernumerary b chromosomes have been associated with sex  <cit> . here we identify two loci impacting sex determination in the riverine haplochromine a. burtoni, lg5- <dig> and lg <dig>  while this is the first time lg <dig> and lg <dig> have been associated with sex determination, it is intriguing that lg <dig> has now been associated with haplochromine sex determination in a. burtoni, malawi, and victoria cichlids. to provide finer scale comparison of sex association with lg <dig>  we identified a. burtoni scaffolds containing sex-associated markers from other studies , revealing overlap of sex loci among multiple species. as on-going mapping studies identify specific polymorphism underlying sex determination in each context, we should be able to distinguish reuse of ancestral polymorphism versus repeated de novo evolution of sex determination on lg <dig>  however, both w  <cit>  and y  acting alleles have been associated with lg <dig>  suggesting at least two evolutionary events. lg <dig> has been dubbed a “speciation chromosome” because of the number of adaptive and species-delineating phenotypes mapped there, including pigmentation, vision, jaw shape, and tooth shape  <cit> , and it may exhibit dynamic evolution of sex determination with both w and y alleles now clearly identified. the identification of the lg5- <dig> fusion in a. burtoni should provide additional context to consider the role of this chromosome in adaptation and speciation, particularly in comparing the evolutionary trajectory of lg <dig> among lineages with and without the fusion. indeed, the lg5- <dig> fusion in a. burtoni may represent karyotype evolution driven in part by the presence of a sex determination locus on lg <dig>  for example, if novel alleles under strong sexually antagonistic selection arose on lg <dig>  the resulting sexual conflict could have been resolved by fusion to the lg <dig> sex chromosomes, ensuring that sex-specific fitness benefits were only expressed in the appropriate sex.

evolutionary context
evolutionarily, the genus astatotilapia represents an immediate outgroup to the adaptive radiations of cichlid species in lake malawi and lake victoria  <cit> , providing important context for studies of sex determination evolution in those flocks. ongoing studies may reveal if the sex determination locus on lg5/lg5- <dig> is the first found both within and without the lake adaptive radiations, and/or shared among radiations. additionally, a recent report implicated the same region of lg <dig> as one of a handful of genomic islands of speciation in astatotilapia species, based on sequence divergence between ecomorphs . one hypothesis is that the signal of divergence at lg <dig> in that study is due to divergence related to the sex determination locus, with the lg <dig> xy system potentially present in one ecomorph and absent in the other.

ultimately, our mapping results must be confirmed in natural populations. the recent discovery that the natural sex determination chromosome in zebrafish  was lost in lab strains urges caution in interpreting genetic mapping of sex determination in domesticated fish  <cit> . more recently, large-scale changes in gene expression were identified after only a single generation of domestication in trout  <cit> , suggesting that domestication can act rapidly on the phenotypic output of the fish genome. the standard lab strain of a. burtoni we use here has been maintained in the lab for nearly four decades  <cit> , representing over  <dig> generations in captivity in which loss or gain of sex determination alleles could have taken place. indeed, recently collected stocks of a. burtoni exhibit a number of phenotypic differences from the classic lab strain  <cit> , suggesting underlying genetic differences between wild and lab strain a. burtoni.

in general, the evolutionary pressures that maintain polygenic sex determination systems remain unknown. we favor the hypothesis that the multiple sex genotypes produced by polygenic sex determination may provide alternative fitness strategies, for example, alternate sex genotypes may be associated with differences in color  or behavior  in a. burtoni  <cit> . in any case, a. burtoni should serve as an excellent model for understanding the outcomes of polygenic sex determination for primary and secondary sexual characteristics. the availability of genome editing tools in the species permits mechanistic dissection of genetic variation  <cit> , while decades of research in the species provides a wealth of information regarding sexually dimorphic behavior, physiology, and related gene expression .

CONCLUSIONS
examples of polygenic sex determination are accumulating across taxa  <cit> , and particularly among cichlid fish species. here we present evidence for polygenic sex determination in the cichlid a. burtoni, a longstanding model of sex-related physiology and behavior, and a close relative of the explosive adaptive radiations of species in lake malawi and lake victoria. our results strongly indicate an xy system on lg5- <dig> and a zw system on lg <dig>  additionally, inheritance in some families indicates a y allele on lg <dig>  which would support the presence of an xyw system; however, occasional apparently sex reversed individuals make the conclusion that both w and y alleles are present at lg <dig> tentative. the locus on lg <dig> represents a novel association with sex, while lg <dig> has been implicated in sex determination, adaptation, and speciation in a number of contexts. our results add to the evidence that lg <dig> may have played an unusual role in cichlid diversification, including fusion of lg <dig> and lg <dig> in a. burtoni. ongoing investigation of sex determination in a. burtoni aims to identify the sex determination genes and understand their action and interaction on primary and secondary sexual characteristics. understanding the complex genetics underlying sex determination in a. burtoni should provide additional insight and context to an already fundamental model of sexual dimorphism and behavioral evolution.
