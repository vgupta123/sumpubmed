BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates is lined by different epithelia that develop from the embryonic endoderm under the influences of developmental signals from the associated splanchnic mesoderm  <cit> . in the developing rodent intestine, the epithelium is initially composed of a pseudostratified layer which converts into a single-layered epithelium at around embryonic day  <dig> – <dig>    <cit> . the other cell layers of the gut are derived from the mesoderm. the epithelium, together with the underlying connective tissue  and a thin muscle layer , is referred to as the mucosa.

the adult intestinal epithelium is organized into villi, which project into the gut lumen. at the base of the villi are the crypts of lieberkuhn which contain the stem cell compartment  <cit> . there are three differentiated cell types located along the villus. these are the enterocytes, goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells. the enterocytes are absorptive and secrete enzymes such as sucrase-isomaltase  <cit> . goblet cells secrete mucus thereby providing a protective lining for the intestinal cells against the proteolytic action of the digestive enzymes. the enteroendocrine cells secrete hormones including secretin and glucagon-like peptide- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, paneth cells are found at the bottom of the crypts. these secrete antimicrobial agents such as lysozyme, cryptidins and defensins  <cit> . all four epithelial cell types are believed to differentiate from common pluripotent stem cells located in the crypt compartment of the intestine  <cit> .

study of the normal development of the intestinal epithelium has been hampered by lack of suitable model systems  <cit> , in particular ones that enable the introduction of exogenous genes. production of such a system would advance our understanding of normal epithelial development and help to shed light on the pathogenesis of intestinal neoplasia. several attempts have been made to produce culture systems that mimic normal intestinal development. the main problem is that once intestinal cells are removed from the basement membrane and underlying stroma, apoptosis is initiated within a few hours  <cit> . explants of embryonic gut will develop successfully when transplanted under the kidney capsule of syngeneic or immunocompromised hosts  <cit>  or the coelomic cavity  <cit> . however, with such in vivo cultures the tissue is then inaccessible to study. a recently developed in vitro system involves culture of embryonic intestinal explants by attachment to filters   <cit> . some morphogenesis of the tissue was observed but the authors did not look at the full complement of epithelial cell types. abud and colleagues  <cit>  reported some success introducing genes by electroporation but we have not been able to replicate these results .

we sought to develop an in vitro organ culture system in which cultures were easily established and the culture conditions supported the differentiation of the various intestinal cell lineages. the criteria for a reliable culture system include: the ability to perform real time observations and manipulations in vitro, the preparation of wholemounts for immunostaining and the potential for introducing genes. we have previously described the development of in vitro systems for mouse embryonic pancreas and oesophagus based on culture of tissue explants on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips  <cit> . we have now extended this culture system to intestine and furthermore developed a new procedure for gene introduction involving enzyme treatment and adenovirus infection. this culture system meets all of the criteria. the explants can be cultured for up to two weeks, they form the full repertoire of intestinal epithelial cell types  and the method for gene introduction into the epithelium is efficient and reliable.

RESULTS
development of intestinal embryonic tissue in vitro
e <dig> d intestinal explants were isolated and grown in culture for up to  <dig> days . intestinal tissue from younger embryos  was also used successfully . we investigated the development in vitro, initially focusing on morphology and differentiation. the explants adhere to the fibronectin substrate within a few hours and gradually flatten out over the first 1– <dig> days. the cut ends of the epithelium close and the mesenchymal cells spread rapidly out of the explant to form a monolayer of cells on the substrate, with several cell layers surrounding the epithelial tube in the centre. over the next few days, the epithelium extends and the mesenchyme continues to expand, increasing the area of the culture . the flattening of the whole culture with time is accompanied by collapse of the lumen although this remains as a virtual space, i.e. with opposing epithelial layers apposed. initially the explants did not exhibit any contractile activity but after 2– <dig> days in culture, random peristaltic movements were apparent. these are slow contractions lasting a couple of seconds and occurring once or twice a minute.

expression of intestinal markers in the epithelium
we initially anlaysed the expression of the intestinal transcription factor cdx <dig>  the cdx <dig> gene encodes a homeodomain transcription factor whose expression normally distinguishes between the upper and lower regions of the alimentary canal epithelia  <cit> . cdx <dig> is expressed in vivo by e <dig> d  <cit> . twenty-four hours after isolation, the epithelium of the e <dig> d intestinal explants still expressed cdx <dig>  and this expression persisted for the duration of the culture period .

we proceeded to examine the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in the cultures. simple columnar epithelia express cytokeratin  <dig> , a type ii acidic protein that normally heterodimerises with another intermediate filament, the type i cytokeratin  <dig>  to form the keratin intermediate filament structure  <cit> . fig 2f–h shows a specimen cultured for one day then stained for k <dig> to show the columnar epithelium and smooth muscle actin to show the mesenchyme. this concentric arrangement of epithelium and mesenchyme persisted for the duration of the culture period .

as previous studies have only described limited characterisation of differentiation, we studied the formation of all four differentiated epithelial cell types in the culture system using various markers . the enterocyte marker alkaline phosphatase was detected by day  <dig> in culture by histochemical staining and sucrase-isomaltase by day  <dig>  pas-positive goblet cells were demonstrated at day  <dig>  chromogranin a, produced by enteroendocrine cells, and lysozyme-positive paneth cells were both detected by day  <dig>  the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α , a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily important in regulating intestinal gene expression, was also seen by day  <dig> in culture. the appearance of these markers is consistent with development in vivo  <cit>  and, once present, all the markers persisted for the duration of the culture period.

ectopic gene expression in intestinal explants
we were especially interested in the potential of the intestinal culture system for ectopic gene expression. we initially tried a commercially available transfection reagent, genejuice, to introduce dsred into the intestinal epithelium. mesenchymal but not epithelial expression of dsred could be detected under epifluorescence following  <dig> hours of culture . since there was no epithelial expression we decided to examine alternative methods. electroporation has been successfully developed for manipulating gene expression in chick  <cit>  and there have been reports of electroporation of mouse tissues  <cit> . we tested a wide variety of electroporation conditions using the pcdna3nucgfp <dig> plasmid. the optimum condition was  <dig> v,  <dig> pulses of  <dig> ms, pulse interval  <dig> ms, but even with these settings only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % epithelial cells in the centre of the cultures took up the plasmid and expressed gfp . a number of gfp-positive cells were also found in the mesenchyme.

since epithelial expression was poor both with transfection and electroporation, we set out to determine whether active genes could be introduced into the epithelium of the cultures using adenoviral vectors. we infected intestinal epithelium with a first generation adenovirus expressing lacz as described in the methods. the intestinal explants were opened to ensure good access to the epithelium then exposed to high titre virus for  <dig> hours. we observed abundant expression of β-galactosidase in the mesenchyme  but only in  <dig>  ±  <dig> % cells of the epithelium . adenovirus infection requires the interaction of a viral coat protein with the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor  in the target cell. in polarised epithelial cells such as those of the intestine, car is found on the lateral membranes associated with the tight junctions  <cit> . because of this we reasoned that a light enzyme digestion might succeed in opening up the tight junctions, so allowing access of the virus to car, while not degrading the tissue so much that the epithelium broke down. a number of trials were made with enzymes including trypsin and collagenase, but the best results were obtained using dispase. as before, the intestinal segments were opened, and then treated at various times and concentrations, followed by application of the virus. the optimum regime was a 1– <dig> minute treatment with dispase at  <dig> caseinolytic units/ml. this enhanced β-galactosidase expression in the epithelium, verified by the co-expression with e-cadherin .

discussion
many previous in vitro culture systems have been utilized to investigate intestinal development. such systems include embryonic gut transplanted under the kidney capsule of syngeneic or immunocompromised hosts  <cit> , intestinal explants attached to filters  <cit>  or small slices or biopsies of fetal or postnatal intestinal tissue cultured in vitro for  <dig> days  <cit> . however, these models suffer from a number of different problems. tissue cultured using these techniques are not accessible to experimental manipulation and the medium surrounding the explants cannot be manipulated. in some of these systems  <cit> , differentiation of the cultures is poor due to reduced viability and only limited differentiation has been documented in other organ systems. in the present system, we provide evidence for the differentiation of the embryonic intestine based on the expression of markers of epithelial cell types. we therefore conclude that the differentiation program is normal.

although we tried a number of techniques for overexpression including transfection, electroporation and adenoviral infection, none of them produced significant epithelial expression. this was somewhat surprising given the previous published protocols  <cit> . we therefore sought to improve on the adenoviral system. we believe that the dispase digestion method works because it slightly separates the cells and makes accessible the lateral faces which carry the adenovirus receptor. this dispase/adenovirus method provides the first reliable technique for introducing exogenous genes into the intestinal epithelium. because the action of many genes can be specifically antagonised by dominant negative constructs or sirna, gene introduction can also enable inhibition of the action of specific endogenous genes. this new method will provide an additional resource to study changes in intestinal gene expression and differentiation, and will enable the study of intestinal development by both gene overexpression and specific ablation.

CONCLUSIONS
the current system offers a number of advantages to those previously described. it  is simple and depends largely on the presence of a suitable substrate and a simple medium  maintains the gut tube with intact mesenchymal and epithelial layers  permits differentiation of all of the normal intestinal cell types on a normal time scale  remains accessible to observation and manipulation during the culture period  is suitable for wholemount immunostaining, providing three-dimensional visualisation of anatomical features and  is suitable for ectopic gene expression.
