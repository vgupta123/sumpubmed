BACKGROUND
biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, development, and aging require elaborately orchestrated spatial and temporal gene expression, which are often under the control of cis-regulatory elements . cres, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators and locus control regions  etc., are abundant in the human genome  <cit> . characterization of cres in the genome contributes to understand the complexities of gene transcription and expression in different biological systems  <cit> . in the past decade, the project encyclopedia of dna elements  has facilitated the prediction of functional elements including cres in the human genome  <cit> . however, cre characterization in terms of gene and cell specificities as well as chromatin context dependency remains a huge challenge.

nucleosome-depleted dna regions, characterized by their sensitivity to nuclease digestion, are closely associated with almost all known classes of active cres. in contrast, dna regions tightly wrapped in nucleosomes and higher-order structures are more resistant to nuclease digestion. therefore, dnase i hypersensitive sites  mark many types of cres  <cit> . individual dhss within small regions of the genome  have been traditionally identified using southern blot analysis  <cit> . however, this labor-intensive and low-throughput approach cannot be scaled to study large chromosomal regions and entire genomes. by hybridizing dnase i-digested fragments to tiled microarrays, the dnase-chip assay provides an undirected, unbiased, highly sensitive and specific strategy to simultaneously identify thousands of dhss within any region of interest or even the entire genome, with a resolution of 200– <dig> bases  <cit> . furthermore, dnase-seq  allows genome-wide mapping of dhss with base-pair resolution  <cit> . using these high-throughput technologies, dhs mapping is emerging as a powerful tool for locating open chromatin regions that encompassing many types of cres within the genome  <cit>  and thus it facilitates the delineation of the roles of dhss in regulating tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of nearby genes  <cit> .

enhancers are the most variable cres that can regulate the expression of genes from a long distance and in a position- and orientation-independent manner  <cit> . in general, it is accepted that enhancers function by first recruiting sequence-specific transcription factors  that recognize short dna motifs within the enhancers. upon binding to enhancers, the sequence-specific tfs recruit mediator complexes, histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers to activate the transcription of target genes  <cit> . enhancers often exist in a cell- and developmental stage-specific manner  <cit> , and the distribution of cell-specific enhancers correlates well with cell-specific gene expression  <cit> , suggesting that they are the primary force driving spatial- or temporal-specific gene expression. to date, several lines of evidences have demonstrated the roles of erythroid-specific enhancers in driving erythroid-specific gene expression. lcr at the β-globin locus is the most prominent erythroid enhancer that exerts a strong effect specifically on erythroid cells. this lcr enhances the developmental stage-specific expression of globin genes and the expression of linked heterogeneous non-globin genes in erythroid cells by interacting with respective promoters  <cit> . hs <dig>  a classical enhancer located in lcr, appears to be functional in erythroid cells at both embryonic and adult developmental stages, suggesting its crucial roles in the activation of globin genes in erythroid cells throughout ontogenesis  <cit> . other erythroid-specific enhancers have also been found in the genomic regions of gata– <dig>  stem cell leukemia , l-type pyruvate kinase and 5-aminolevulinate synthase  <dig>  genes  <cit> , which may contribute to the restricted expression of these genes in the erythroid lineage. a strikingly large number of enhancers have been systematically identified in erythroid k <dig> cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by genome tiling array  analysis  <cit> . the characterization of these and other erythroid or erythroid-specific enhancers in the human genome will facilitate the understanding of regulation and functions of associated genes in erythroid cells.

krüppel-like factors  are a subfamily of zinc-finger proteins that contain three tandem cys2his <dig> zinc fingers at the highly conserved carboxyl terminus. klfs are important components of the eukaryotic cellular transcriptional machinery. by regulating the expression of several genes driven by gc-rich or caccc-containing promoters, klfs participate in many biological processes, including hematopoiesis, adipogenesis, stem cell maintenance, and tumorigenesis  <cit> . in particular, several klfs have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in erythroid differentiation. globin genes, including α-, ϵ-, γ- and β-globin genes, are prominent biomarkers in erythroid cells, and their spatial and temporal expression is closely correlated with erythroid differentiation and development  <cit> . klf <dig> , an erythroid-specific tf, activates adult β-globin gene expression  <cit>  and regulates gene switching from γ- to β-globin  <cit>  as well as definitive hematopoiesis. other klfs mainly play significant roles in primitive hematopoiesis. for example, klf <dig> activates the expression of α- and γ-globin genes  <cit> . expression of embryonic ϵ- and fetal γ-globin genes is stimulated by klf <dig>  <cit> , klf <dig>  <cit> , and klf <dig>  <cit>  but is suppressed by klf <dig>  <cit>  and klf <dig>  <cit> . in addition, klf <dig>  <cit>  and klf <dig>  <cit>  are required for primitive hematopoiesis. hematopoietic defects or anemia have been observed in several klf-knockout mice, including mice lacing klf <dig> <cit> , klf <dig> <cit> , klf <dig> <cit> , klf <dig> <cit> , and klf <dig> <cit> . interestingly, cross-regulation among klfs has been reported during erythropoiesis, erythroid differentiation, and globin gene regulation  <cit> . however, till date, few studies have been conducted to investigate the cis-transcriptional regulation of klfs by erythroid-specific enhancers, with the exception of the study on murine klf <dig> enhancers  <cit> . therefore, characterization of erythroid-specific enhancers will shed light on molecular mechanisms that regulate transcription, expression, and functions of klfs in erythroid cells.

here, we characterized gene- and cell-specific enhancers in the genomic regions of human klfs extensively by combining high-throughput sequencing data as well as biochemical and bioinformatic analyses. our mrna-seq data in human embryonic stem cells  and three primary erythroid cell types demonstrated that human klfs, including klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  and klf <dig>  were up-regulated in erythroid cells as compared to hesc. we also mapped dhss in the genomic regions of  <dig> human klfs across four erythroid and seven non-erythroid cell types and screened out  <dig> erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss. using the dual-luciferase reporter  assay, we identified  <dig>  erythroid-specific enhancers embedded in the genomic regions of klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  and klf <dig>  the nature of these identified erythroid-specific enhancers was confirmed by a series of bioinformatic and biochemical analyses, contributing to understand the mechanism by which klfs are regulated in erythroid cells. our present findings provide a feasible strategy to characterize cell- and gene-specific enhancers from dhss generated from high-throughput sequencing across various cell types, and to facilitate the illustration of transcriptional regulation and functions of genes in specific cell types.

RESULTS
expression of some klfs is up-regulated in erythroid cells
expression patterns of klfs were obtained from the mrna-seq dataset that was originally designed to explore the dynamic transcriptomes during human erythroid differentiation and development . the following cell types were examined: undifferentiated hesc, embryonic stem cells-derived erythroid cells , fetal liver-derived erythroid cells , and adult mobilized peripheral blood cd34+ cells-derived erythroid cells . as shown in figure 1a, of the  <dig> klfs examined, the expressions of klf <dig> and klf <dig> were not detected, whereas klf <dig> was poorly expressed in eser. the expressions of klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  and klf <dig> in hesc were higher than those in erythroid cells, whereas those of the remaining eight klfs were higher in erythroid cells than in hesc. the expressions of all the  <dig> klfs were further evaluated using quantitative real-time pcr. with the exception of klf <dig> and klf <dig>  the expression patterns of the remaining  <dig> klfs measured by pcr correlated well with mrna-seq results . the cause of the inconsistency in klf <dig> and klf <dig> measurement is currently not clear but it could be platform related. nevertheless, we proposed that the higher expressions of the eight klfs detected by both two platforms may be attributed to the presence of erythroid-specific enhancers.

dhss in klf genomic regions are distributed diversely in various cell types
the dnase-seq dataset used in this study was generated by the university of washington  <cit> . the dataset is composed of dnase-seq data in four erythroid cell types, including three primary erythroid cells  and erythroleukemia k <dig> cells, to cover all the possible dhss in the erythroid lineage and seven non-erythroid cell types, including hesc, gm <dig>  hth <dig>  hela, hepg <dig>  caco <dig>  and bj, to differentiate erythroid-specific dhss from non-erythroid ones. a false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig> % was used to define dhss in each cell type. dhs mapping was profiled for all the klf gene loci from 70 kb upstream of the transcription start sites  to 20 kb downstream of the poly  sites. the current coverage of gene loci was determined based on the following reasons: first, the regions covering approximately 100 kb encompassed almost all intensive dhss around the corresponding klfs in the four cell types studied . second, ctcf binding is reported to mark boundary elements between neighboring genes  <cit> . these approximate 100-kb regions contain such ubiquitous ctcf-binding sites in the various cell types employed in the present study . the diverse distribution patterns of klf dhss among the various established cell types and hesc were shown in figure  <dig>  additional file 1: figures s <dig> and s <dig>  coinciding with the varying expression levels of klf genes in these cell types. dhss were considered to be erythroid specific if they were only present in erythroid cells and were classified as putative erythroid specific if they were present in erythroid cells, while much subdued peaks were also detected in one or two non-erythroid cell types.

figure 2a illustrated the dhs profiling of klf <dig>  five prominent dhss were detected in the klf <dig> genomic region; of these klf1-i was located at > 60 kb upstream of the klf <dig> gene and was only present in three primary erythroid cells, whereas klf1-ii, iii, iv, and v were located proximal to the klf <dig> gene and were present in both primary erythroid cells and erythroleukemia k <dig> cells. klf1-v was a putative erythroid-specific site because a small peak for this site was also present in non-erythroid hela cells. the diverse cellular presentation of dhss was also observed in the profile of klf <dig> , with two putative erythroid-specific dhss—klf9-i and klf9-ii—located 70 kb upstream or in the intron of the gene respectively.

other erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific sites in the klf profiles are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  erythroid-specific dhss include dhs-i of klf <dig> , dhs-i and ii of klf <dig> , dhs-iii and iv of klf <dig> , dhs-i of klf <dig> , dhs-i and ii of klf <dig> , dhs-ii of klf <dig> , and dhs-i of klf <dig> . in addition, dhs-iii of klf <dig> , dhs-i and ii of klf <dig> , dhs-i of klf <dig> , dhs-iii of klf <dig> , and dhs-i of klf <dig>  were identified as putative erythroid-specific dhss. the features of all the  <dig> erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss located in the klf gene loci are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig>  dhs profiles of klfs without erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  it is also of interest to note that while klf <dig> has been employed as a major reprogramming factor required to reverse the highly differentiated somatic cells into pluripotent cells  <cit> , its expression in hesc was lower than that of many other klfs, consistent with encode/caltech rna-seq data available on ucsc browser. as shown in additional file 1: figure s2a, weak peaks of dhss  were found to be dispersed in the klf <dig> locus, which could account for its relatively lower expression than that of the other family members in the present and previous studies  <cit>  and its dispensable role for the self-renewal and pluripotency of es cells  <cit> . in particular, dhs peaks in the klf <dig> promoter region tend to decrease during erythroid differentiation, which may explain the down-regulation of klf <dig> expression in erythroid cells compared with that in hesc .

among the  <dig> prominent erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss,  <dig>  were located upstream of tsss or downstream of poly  sites of the klf genes. only four  dhss were proximal  to tsss, whereas  <dig>  were distal  to tsss . our data on the identified erythroid-specific dhss are comparable to those of a previous dnase-chip report on the distribution of cell type-specific dhss within 1% of the human genome from six diverse cell types  <cit> . in contrast, with the exception of the erythroid-specific dhss in the klf <dig> and klf <dig> regions , most erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss were present in the eight klf genes that were up-regulated in erythroid cells . moreover, erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss were absent in the genomic regions of several klf genes , which did not have increased expression in erythroid cells , implying that these klfs may not function in erythroid cells or that they were not activated by erythroid-specific enhancers.

approximately 65% erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss are enhancers
cell type-specific dhss have been reported to act as enhancers  <cit> . to identify which erythroid-specific dhss can serve as enhancers, dlr assay was performed to evaluate the enhancer activity of  <dig> dhss in driving tata box-containing minimal promoter   <cit> . k <dig> cells are immature erythroid cells widely used in studies of erythroid differentiation or other functions of the erythroid lineage; k <dig> is also one of the tier  <dig> cell types used in the encode project with massive data available for subsequent analyses. therefore, we selected the k <dig> cells to identify erythroid-specific enhancers in vitro. we found that enhancer hs <dig> in human β-globin lcr strongly activated minp in erythroid k <dig> cells . therefore, hs <dig> was chosen as the positive control for enhancer activity evaluation in this assay as previous reports did  <cit> . hs <dig> activated minp by approximately  <dig> fold in this study. therefore, we defined dhss that could activate minp by  <dig> fold, which was  <dig>  after log <dig> transformation as presented in figure  <dig>  or higher as enhancers. we found that  <dig>  erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss had enhancer activity, with the activity of some being much stronger than that of hs <dig> , suggesting that minp was sensitive enough and sufficient for evaluating enhancer activity. eleven  of the  <dig> enhancers were located in the intergenic regions and four  were in the introns of klf genes . the higher frequency of enhancers in the intergenic regions is consistent with previous reports concerning enhancer distribution  <cit>  and could also be explained by the fact that 83% dhss were located beyond the proximal regions  in this study . the statistical analysis for enhancer distribution  indicated that enhancers tend to be distal  <cit> . taken together, the present findings demonstrated that approximately two thirds of erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss were enhancers. indeed, the majority of the dhss were found to possess enhancer functions, supporting our original hypothesis that the high-throughput mrna-seq and dhs mapping together provided a powerful mean for the identification of potential enhancers in the genome.

more than half of erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss activate klf promoters in erythroid cells
in different cells, enhancers activate gene expression by interacting with corresponding promoters. therefore, we evaluated the enhancer activities of all the  <dig> dhss in driving their respective klf-ps  in k <dig> cells. in total,  <dig> klf-ps were cloned and their activities were examined using the dlr assay . hs <dig> only activated some klf-ps in k <dig>  hela, and hek <dig> cells, and thus was used as a positive reference in this assay . dhss that significantly  increased the activities of corresponding klf-ps were considered as enhancers. of the  <dig> dhss,  <dig>  displayed enhancer activities with respective klf-ps  in k <dig> cells. importantly, some dhss exhibited promoter specificity; for example, dhss such as klf6-i, klf10-i, klf13-ii, and klf16-i were strong enhancers on minp, but failed to activate their own promoters. in contrast, klf3-i, klf6-ii, klf6-iii, and klf13-iii demonstrated strong enhancer activities with klf <dig>  klf <dig> or klf <dig> promoters, but not with minp, indicating that klf3-i, klf6-ii, klf6-iii, and klf13-iii are gene-specific enhancers, and that their enhancer activities are independent of the tata box  <cit>  . the distribution of erythroid klf enhancers is shown in additional file 1: figure s3c.

dhs conservation  was observed across  <dig> placental mammals, including humans, chimps, mice, and rabbits. the chromatin accessibility using faire, enhancer-associated histone modifications , and tfbss for erythroid gata- <dig> and nf-e <dig> on dhss in erythroid k <dig> cells were extracted from ucsc genome browser. the enhancers characterized from the erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss were summarized in the last four columns. y: yes. *: this histone modification is k <dig> specific or putative k <dig> specific.

approximately > 67% klf enhancers are erythroid specific
to further investigate the erythroid specificity of klf enhancers, we transiently transfected constructs with klf-ps into non-erythroid hela and hek <dig> cells. dhss that activated klf-ps in k <dig> cells but not in hela and hek <dig> cells were considered as erythroid-specific klf enhancers. dlr assay  revealed that  <dig> enhancers located in the genomic regions of klf1-ii, iii, iv, and v; klf6-ii, iii, and iv; klf9-i and ii; and klf13-iii were erythroid specific. coincidentally, the mouse homologue of klf1-ii has been previously identified as an erythroid-specific enhancer  <cit> . these results provide strong evidence that the erythroid specificity of dhss determines the erythroid specificity of enhancers. the distribution of these erythroid-specific klf enhancers is shown in additional file 1: figure s3d.

the nature of erythroid-specific klf enhancers was validated by bioinformatic analyses
in general, enhancers are characterized by species conservation  <cit> , characteristic h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac enrichment  <cit> , chromatin accessibility   <cit> , and binding capacity of tfs and coactivators  <cit> . according to the ucsc genome browser, of the  <dig> erythroid-specific klf enhancers identified in this study, only five were conserved in placental mammals  <cit> , whereas all the  <dig> enhancers were enriched with h3k4me <dig> and/or h3k27ac modifications  <cit> , seven of which were erythroid specific, and six were occupied by erythroid-specific tfs gata- <dig> and/or nf-e <dig> in erythroid k <dig> cells  <cit>  , further supporting their proposed roles as erythroid-specific enhancers.

the txn factor chip track synthesizes all the available encode chip-seq data in different cell types; these data were used to build a full view of tf-binding sites  on the  <dig> dhss. the signal strength of tf occupancy was quantified as a cluster score ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  because most  tfbss on the  <dig> dhss occurred in k <dig> cells, we drew a heat map of cluster scores for this erythroid cell type after k-means clustering. as shown in figure 6a, class ii clustered four non enhancers , four minp-driving enhancers , three klf p-driving enhancers , and two minp- and klf-p-dual driving enhancers . these  <dig> dhss were bound by fewer tfs than the  <dig> dhss in class i and iii, which could account for their impaired or deficient enhancer activity in k <dig> cells. of the remaining  <dig> dhss, with the exception of 6-iii, all were enhancers on both promoters in k <dig> cells because of the binding of multiple tfs. furthermore, 11-i, 17-i, and 2-i were strong enhancers in k <dig> cells but were not erythroid specific because of the strong binding of tfs in other cell types. the remaining seven dhss were erythroid-specific klf enhancers. as shown in the vertical axis, tfs clustered to different classes: class i clustered several erythroid differentiation-related tfs   <cit> , and class ii clustered enhancer-related factors , histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers   <cit> . the features of tfs mentioned above were obtained from the ncbi reference sequence  database . in summary, in the open chromatin state, binding of tfs largely determines the enhancer activity of dhss.

the chip-seq data of the ucsc genome browser did not cover all the tfbss on the genome. therefore, we performed de-novo motif analysis using the multiple em for motif elicitation  online software and annotated these motifs based on encode-motifs by using tomtom  <cit> . encode-motifs database covers all known motifs for each factor curated from transfac, jaspar and protein binding microarray  experiments and their enrichment within corresponding tf-binding experiments, as well as novel regulatory motifs discovered by systematic application of several motif discovery tools  and evaluated based on their enrichment relative to control motifs within tf-bound regions . the conserved motifs among erythroid-specific klf enhancers are shown in figure 6b  and figure 6c ; the p-values of their occurrence in dhss were  <dig>  × 10-11– <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10-9– <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. motif  <dig>  could be the binding sites of histone modifier hdac <dig> and enhancer-related tf foxa  <cit> , and motif  <dig>  could be the motifs of enhancer-related tfs sp <dig>  foxa <dig>  pu. <dig>  <cit> , and so on. the annotated motifs of hdac <dig>  sp <dig>  stat, and pu. <dig> were consistent with the tfbss in cluster ii of the heat map .

erythroid-specificity of klf enhancers is validated using the biochemical electrophoresis mobility shift assay
because the discovered motifs were mainly enhancer related, we performed the electrophoresis mobility shift assay  to verify the erythroid specificity of erythroid-specific klf enhancers. klf9-i was selected as an example. data from the ucsc genome browser indicate that sequence conservation of klf9-i was observed in neither vertebrates nor placental mammals, but it was decorated with h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac enhancer marks  and harbored binding sites of erythroid-specific gata- <dig> in erythroid k <dig> cells . because individual tfbss can be relatively short and degenerate, they tend to be clustered to achieve precise temporal and developmental stage specificities  <cit> . factors bound to these sequences often interact with common coactivators, which, in turn, recruit the basal transcription machinery  <cit> . we used emsa to further investigate whether erythroid-specific tfs or cofactor complexes bind to klf9-i in vitro. putative tfbss in klf9-i were annotated using the txn factor chip track and encode-motifs on ucsc genome browser . sequence analysis indicated that the motif of enhancer-related protein p <dig>  <cit>  was embedded in klf9-i , which may account for the enhancer nature of klf9-i, whereas the motif of gata- <dig> may account for the erythroid specificity of klf9-i. a pair of oligos  against klf9-i were designed using the bioinformatic analysis. the emsa result  demonstrated that at least one protein complex in erythroid k <dig> cell extracts  specifically bound to the oligos, whereas no such binding was observed in non-erythroid hela and hek <dig> cell extracts, implying that an erythroid-specific tf or cofactor complex bound to klf9-i enhancer and drives klf <dig> expression in erythroid cells. the other four universal bands suggested that klf9-i may exert some universal functions in other cell types through recruitment of some basic transcriptional regulatory protein complexes. however, klf <dig> has not been shown to function in erythroid cells. the detailed mechanisms by which klf9-i mediates transcriptional regulation of klf <dig> in erythroid cells need further investigation.

discussion
mapping regulatory elements to the genes they regulate is of great importance to understand gene expression and functions. in this study, we provide a feasible strategy to extensively identify gene- and cell-specific enhancers from dhss based on a rigorous and practical high-throughput sequencing technique . first, we refined the expression patterns of human klfs from mrna-seq data and proposed that the higher expression of eight klfs in erythroid cells may be ascribed to the presence of erythroid-specific enhancers. second, we screened erythroid-specific dhss in the genomic regions of  <dig> human klfs from dnase-seq dataset from four erythroid cell types and seven non-erythroid cell types, which largely improved the accuracy of prediction. third, we extensively evaluated enhancer activities of all the  <dig> erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss using the dlr assay for promoter and cell-type specificities. lastly, we validated the enhancer nature and erythroid specificity of erythroid-specific klf enhancers through bioinformatic and biochemical analyses.

as the major contributors to cell- and developmental stage-specific gene expression, enhancers have been extensively predicted by many genome-wide approaches, including sequences conservation-, motif-, and chromatin-based computation methods  <cit> ; chip-based analysis of tf binding such as cbp/p <dig>  <cit>  or histone modifications   <cit> ; or dhss and faire mapping  <cit> . the application of these approaches indicates that enhancers have unique properties that differentiate them from other cres. however, enhancers predicted by these methods need to be validated further by using in vitro transient reporter gene system or in vivo transgenic systems. it is unrealistic to characterize all cell- and gene-specific enhancers within the whole human genome. in addition, these methods can not simultaneously take into account both cell and gene specificities of enhancers. in this study, using the next-generation high-throughput sequencing combined with multiple enhancer activity tests, we comprehensively characterized the enhancers confined to the genomic regions of a typical family of klfs to explore both cell and gene specificities. the expression data in mrna-seq may indicate the presence of enhancers, and dnase-seq data suggest the location of these enhancers. dhs mapping has higher positive rate than in-silico prediction methods and takes the advantage of unbiased property over chip-based methods, which only predict a subset of enhancers bound by one or several tfs and largely limited by the quality of antibodies. reporter assays have the advantages of saving labor and time over animal models. with respect to the identification of erythroid-specific dhss, we used cell lines originated from inner cell mass , ectoderm , mesoderm , and endoderm  as control cell types for erythroid-specific dhss screening. however, it is possible that certain erythroid-specific dhss were excluded due to the presentation of similar dhss as a result of binding by a different set of tfs in these non-erythroid cell lines. this setback may be remedied by the employment of high-resolution genome-wide in vivo footprinting  <cit> . moreover, three primary erythroid cells were used for dhss screening, which increased the validity of erythroid-specific dhss. although some subtle differences, but not specificity, were observed among dhss at different developmental stages of erythroid cells, the similarities are actually unclear . k <dig> cells are actually suitable for identifying erythroid-specific enhancers. however, there appears to be a limitation in characterizing the developmental stage specificity of enhancers using this cell line because it is at an early stage of erythroid differentiation. in the future, we wish to analyze this using appropriate erythroid cell lines at different developmental stages or animal models. in reporter assays, control cell lines hek <dig> and hela are also representatives of different germ layers, mesoderm and ectoderm. thus, the application of these non-erythroid control cell lines guaranteed the reliable and unbiased identification of cell-specific enhancers using our system. beside cell-type specificity, we also explored gene specificity of enhancers, which is of great importance in gene expression and remains a challenge in this field. furthermore, we validated the credibility of the identified erythroid-specific klf enhancers through integrated bioinformatic and biochemical approaches to determine sequence conservation, tf binding, and histone modification markers. identification of erythroid-specific klf enhancers will facilitate the understanding of transcription, expression, and associated functions of klf genes in erythroid cells and provide useful information to estimate the frequency of dhss as gene- and cell-specific enhancers within the whole genome. with proper selection of cell types used as controls for dhs mapping and also employed for reporter assays, the approach described in this study should be applicable to a wide range of cells and genes of interest.

for example, a family of klf members was selected to determine whether enhancers located in the genomic regions of klfs were associated with their expression in erythroid cells. here, we compared the expression of klf mrna transcripts in erythroid cells  with those in non-erythroid cells  using mrna-seq analysis. the present results reveal that eight klfs  show relatively higher expressions in erythroid cells than those in non-erythroid cells , which was proposed to be mainly determined by the presence of erythroid-specific cres, particularly enhancers, embedded in dhss of their genomic regions . ten erythroid-specific klf enhancers were finally identified in the genomic regions of klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  and klf <dig>  indicating that these klfs were erythroid-specific enhancers-driven genes and harbored potential biology in erythroid cells. however, despite their high expression in erythroid cells, no erythroid-specific enhancer was identified in the genomic regions of klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  and klf <dig>  the enhancers in the genomic regions of klf <dig> and klf <dig> were excluded because they demonstrated enhancer activities in non-erythroid cells as well . for klf <dig> or klf <dig>  although the identified erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss in their genomic regions activated minp in k <dig> cells, no enhancer activating klf-ps was characterized, reflecting that dhss identified in their genomic regions may work as promoter-specific enhancers. this is understandable because neither klf <dig> nor klf <dig> have been reported to be involved in erythroid differentiation and development. however, the lack of erythroid-specific enhancers in some klfs with high erythroid expression may be caused by the limitation and bias of our arbitrary cut-offs of genomic regions. some erythroid-specific klf enhancers could exist beyond these confined regions  or even on different chromosomes. these missed enhancers can be found by combining our system with the genome-wide chromosome conformation capture -base technology in the future, which may help in comprehensively understanding klf transcription in erythroid cells. dhss in the genomic region of klf <dig> and klf <dig> did not appear to show erythroid-specific enhancer activity, which may account for their abolished expressions in erythroid cells during mrna-seq analysis . in contrast, other klfs  were relatively highly expressed in non-erythroid cells , indicating that they were probably not erythroid-specific genes and that their genes expression could be driven by non-erythroid specific or universal cres . no erythroid-specific or putative erythroid-specific dhss were identified in the genomic region of klf <dig> , which could explain why its mrna transcript could not be detected in cell types examined in this study.

in this study we identified ten novel erythroid-specific enhancers in the genomic regions of human klfs , of which klf1-ii, a homolog of murine ehs <dig>  acted as an erythroid-specific enhancer  <cit> . identification of erythroid-specific klf enhancers may reveal novel mechanisms that regulate the transcription and functions of these klfs in erythroid cells. till date, klf <dig>  klf <dig>  and klf <dig> have been identified to be critical regulators in erythroid cells  <cit> . klf <dig>  is a broadly expressed tf with high expression in the developing brain, thymus, epithelia, smooth muscle of gut and bladder, vertebrae, and cartilage primordial and is implicated to play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . klf9−/− mice have a normal lifespan, but impaired specific behavioral activities and decreased small intestinal villi  <cit> . klf9−/− female mice show uterine hypoplasia, reduced litter size, increased incidence of neonatal deaths in offspring and defects in parturition  <cit> . at present, the biology of klf <dig> in erythroid cells has not been reported; thus, the identification of erythroid-specific klf <dig> enhancers implies that klf <dig> could be a novel klf member that may play critical roles in erythroid cells. future studies are warranted to investigate the functions of klf <dig> in hematopoiesis, and the mechanisms by which the two identified erythroid-specific klf <dig> enhancers regulate klf <dig> gene transcription and expression in erythroid cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the primary goal of this study is to develop a methodology to characterize enhancers from massive data generated by high-throughput sequencing technology. using the high-throughput sequencing technique, we have provided a feasible and practical strategy to extensively identify gene- and cell-specific enhancers from dhss. application of our strategy led to the identification of ten erythroid-specific enhancers in the typical klf family; their enhancer nature and erythroid specificity were confirmed using bioinformatic and biochemical analyses. identification of erythroid-specific klf enhancers indicates the relatively high expressions and some important functions of the corresponding klfs in erythroid tissues.
