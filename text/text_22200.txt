BACKGROUND
recent advances in dna microarray technology provide exciting tools for studying the expression levels of thousands of distinct genes simultaneously. a common data analysis approach is to identify a subset of key genes from the original gene set that express differentially under different experimental conditions with a goal to determine the underlying relationship between samples and genes or gene clusters. the relationship is used to identify biological functions or to predict specific biological or therapeutic outcomes from the subset of key genes. selection of differentially expressed genes can be separated into two steps. the first step is to calculate a discriminatory score that will rank the genes in order of evidence of differential expressions. the second step is to determine a cutoff  from the ranked scores to divide the genes into two lists: the differentially expressed and the non-differentially expressed genes. the genes above the threshold are selected as differential expressions. criteria for determining the threshold cutoff should depend on the objective of the experiment. for instance, if the objective is to identify a small number of truly differentially expressed genes for further study, then a stringent criterion such as controlling either the familywise or the false discovery error rate may be appropriate. however, if the purpose is to determine functional relationships among genes that have been affected by treatments or to develop a genomic biomarker classifier, criteria that do not eliminate as many genes may be more appropriate since the omission of informative genes would have a much more serious consequence than the inclusion of non-informative genes. in all applications, the first step of gene ranking is the more important of the two. fold-change and p-value are two common approaches to selecting differentially expressed genes when the experiment consists of two conditions . in the fold-change approach, a gene is said to be differentially expressed if the ratio in absolute value of the expression levels between the two classes exceeds a certain threshold, e.g., a 2-fold or 3-fold change. these genes are selected as differential expressions. this approach is deficient in some aspects as it does not account for the variability of the expression levels among genes. for example, genes with larger variances have a good chance of exhibiting larger fold-changes even if they are not differentially expressed. the p-value ranking is an alternative approach for gene ranking. the p-value is the probability outcome from a statistical testing procedure that there is no difference between two conditions for an individual gene. a small p-value is evidence of differential expressions. one common problem encountered in the use of the p-value ranking is that a gene with small fold change can have a very small p-value  because of a very small standard deviation. these two ranking criteria often result in selecting different lists of differentially expressed genes.

one important application in microarray experiments is to develop a prediction model to discriminate different biologic phenotypes or to predict the diagnostic category or prognostic stage of a patient. because thousands of gene are involved, many genes are often noisy in nature and many are irrelevant for prediction; the use of all predictors can suppress or reduce the performance of a classification algorithm. the prediction model is often based on a selected gene set from a p-value ranking criterion . alternatively, genes can be ranked according to its predictive accuracy  by performing gene-by-gene prediction. the wrapper approach is an alternative gene selection method; the wrapper approach finds a subset of genes and evaluates its relevance while building the prediction model. for example, the classification tree  constructs a binary hierarchical classifier  <cit>  through recursively partitioning parent nodes into two child nodes. in each node, ctree searches all possible predictors and selects the predictors that minimize overall true impurity. guyon et al.  <cit>  proposed a recursive feature elimination  procedure for the support vector machine  classification algorithm. the svm-rfe method uses the magnitude as a ranking criterion to select feature predictors. a strategy of applying the wrapper approach to gene ranking is to examine the frequency of selections in the cross validation  <cit> . the most frequently selected genes are presumed to be most relevant to the sample distinction. the gene ranking criteria described above for prediction purposes would result in different lists; also, these ranking criteria are different from either the fold-change or p-value ranking criterion. as discussed, there are two general objectives in gene selection. one objective is to develop a classifier or predictive model for class prediction, and the other is to identify differentially expressed genes for a follow-up study. these two objectives are not mutually exclusive. for example, the set of differentially expressed genes identified presumably for the second objective can be used to develop a classifier  for the first objective. different gene selection procedures often result in different rankings, even for the same objective such as the p-value and fold-change criteria to identify differentially expressed genes. because of thousands of genes involved and difficulty in the validation, a gene ranking procedure that strikes a balance among several ordering criteria will be useful for microarray data analysis. furthermore, many microarray experiments have involved two or more factors and/or more than two experimental conditions. in the applications section below, we consider a two-factor microarray study to identify biological effects of radiation exposure on gene expression. the experiment consists a control and dose groups. the rna samples are extracted from the control and exposed cells at  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours. statistical analysis would consist of a comparison between control and dose groups to investigate the radiation effect on gene expression, and a comparison between the two time points to investigate the time effect. each comparison will result in one gene list according to the p-values from the respective statistical test. a gene list that accounts for both ranking criterions will be useful for investigating the most important genes that respond to the treatment effect as well as time effect.

given the wide uses of microarray technology, selection of differential expressed genes is one of the most important objectives in microarray data analysis. in a simple experiment with two experimental conditions, different experimental objectives or different analysis methods can generate different lists of differentially expressed genes. for experiments with more than two experimental conditions, the analysis will generate different gene lists from different test hypotheses.

this paper proposes three layer ranking algorithms for gene ranking with multiple ranking criteria, where each individual criterion constitutes its ordering of preference for selection. the presentation is limited to two and three univariate ranking criteria.

RESULTS
example
the colon cancer data set  <cit>  consists of  <dig> human genes with highest minimal intensity across  <dig> tumor and  <dig> normal colon tissue samples. a goal of a data analysis is to select a set of genes that express differently between the normal samples and cancer samples. we consider three criteria to select the set of marker genes: fold-change, p-value, and frequency of selections by the svm-rfe classifier. the fold-change and p-value were computed for each gene. the p-values were computed based on  <dig>  permutations using the t-statistic with unequal variances. when a tie occurs, the t-statistic is used to break the tie. the svm-rfe method was used to rank the discriminatory power of a gene using a 10-fold cross-validation method. briefly, the entire data set was divided into  <dig> subsets  of roughly equal size. the svm-rfe was trained with a selection of 'eight' optimal genes on the  <dig>  subsets  together and then applied to the remaining subset as the test data set.

the classification rule is iterated  <dig> times to complete an analysis of entire data set. the entire process was repeated  <dig> times each time the  <dig> samples were randomly partitioned into  <dig> subsets. the frequency of selections for the  <dig> genes over the  <dig> replicates were calculated as the 3rd selection criterion.

the colon data set has been analyzed extensively by many researchers using various gene selection and/or classification procedures . the classification accuracy rates reported from various v-fold cross-validations, where v =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  are between 70% to 89%. the average accuracy rate in our  <dig> 10-fold cross-validations by the svm-rfe is  <dig> % for selecting  <dig> genes. the accuracy rates are  <dig> % and  <dig> % for selecting  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. these accuracy rates are comparable or better than most of reported results in the literature.

gene id, p-value , fold-change , frequency  and their univariate ranks ordered by the p-value  rank for the top  <dig> ranked genes from the  <dig>  genes in the colon data set. the p-values are computed based on  <dig>  permutations.

two-dimensional layer ranking: fold-change and p-value
the volcano plot  has been used to summarize the two ranking schemes. the volcano plot is a plot of the p-value  versus fold-change . the genes on the upper left or upper right corners represent small p-vales with large fold changes . on the other hand, the genes on the upper middle have small fold-changes, but, having small p-values, these genes will not be on the top list by the fold-change ranking. similarly, the gene on the lower left or lower right have large fold-changes, but, with larger p-values, these genes will not be on the top list by the p-value ranking. the layer-ranking algorithms take all these genes into account.

applying layer ranking procedures, the numbers of layers obtained from the point-admissible, convex, and pareto algorithms are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> genes according to the point-admissible ranking . the three layer rankings generally show good agreements except that some genes may rank one layer higher or lower. note that the differences between two adjacent gene rankings are no more than  <dig>  for the  <dig> genes, the numbers of layers for the point-admissible, convex, and pareto algorithms are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the  <dig> genes include all top  <dig> ranked genes by the fold-change ranking, top  <dig> by the p-value. table  <dig> shows some differences between the layer rankings and the p-value ranking or the fold-change ranking. gene t <dig>  which is ranked 35th by the p-value having a large fold-change  <dig>  , is ranked 8th by the point-admissible  and pareto  algorithms and is ranked 6th  by the convex algorithm. on the other hand, gene h <dig> has a small p-value  with small fold-change  <dig>  , and is ranked in the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> by the three layer algorithms.

three-dimensional layer ranking: fold-change, p-value, and frequency
the numbers of layers obtained from the 3-dimensional point-admissible, convex, and pareto algorithms are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the convex ranking produces more layers than the point-admissible due to the discreetness of the frequency that  <dig> genes  has  <dig> occurrence. in general, as the dimension increases, the number of layers decrease.

simulation experiment
we conducted a simulation experiment to compare the two-dimensional  layer rankings to the univariate p-value ranking for selection of differentially expressed genes. the top-ranked genes from the univariate p-value ranking and the three layer rankings were evaluated based on the false discovery rate  of 5%  <cit> . the experiment considered to m =  <dig> genes, in which m <dig> =  <dig> or  <dig> genes were differentially expressed with a constant effect size , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an increment of  <dig> , as well as  <dig>  and  <dig> . note that the δ of  <dig> represents a 2-fold change. the number of arrays in each group was  <dig> or  <dig>  the data were sampled from a normal distribution under an independent model or a correlated model. for the correlated model, we considered a block compound symmetry  correlation structure  <cit> , in which there were  <dig> blocks and each block consists of  <dig> dependent genes with a pairwise correlation coefficient ρ. we assumed that the first m1/ <dig> blocks corresponded to the m <dig> differentially expressed genes. therefore, the m × m variance-covariance matrix Σ of a block cs structure for the simulation model consisted of  <dig> equal blocks, and each block Σi has a cs structure with variances of  <dig> and a common correlation ρ; that is,

where ρ =  <dig>  or  <dig>  was the common correlation coefficient. in each array, expression data for the non-differentially expressed genes in each block were generated from the multivariate normal distribution n, and expression data for the differentially expressed genes in each block were generated from the multivariate normal distribution n, where  <dig> denoted a 10-dimensional unity vector. for each simulated data set, the p-values and fold changes were computed. three layer-ranked gene lists were then generated. the p-values were computed based on t-statistic from  <dig>  random permutations. the simulation was repeated  <dig> times for each combination of m <dig>  n, δ, and ρ.

we evaluated the same number of top ranked genes selected by the p-value ranking and by the three layer rankings in terms of the control of the fdr and the ability  to detect differential expression. the four ranking procedures were evaluated as follows. first, the differentially expressed genes from the p-value ranking were selected using the benjamini and hochberg  fdr-controlled procedure  <cit> . the same number of top ranked genes, then, was selected as differentially expressed genes for each layer ranking. for each selected gene set in each simulation, the numbers of false positives  and true positives  were counted, k =  <dig>  ...,  <dig>  the fdr and the power were estimated by

in practice, it is possible that multiple genes are ranked in the same layer selected for differential expression. in order to eliminate ties and select the same number of top ranked genes as the p-value ranking, we calculated a secondary score based on the average of ranks of - log <dig> and fold-change for each gene in the last layer. we then selected genes with the largest scores. the secondary score is a measure that have incorporated the magnitudes of the p-value and fold-change rankings.

the average fdr and power estimates from  <dig> simulations at the fdr level of 5%. the same number of genes is selected using the benjamini and hochberg procedure from the p-value ranking at fdr = 5%. all values are in percentages.

the average fdr and power estimates are same as in table  <dig> 

the average fdr and power estimates are same as in table  <dig> 

tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> show that all three layer rankings exhibit higher power than the p-value ranking. however, the fdr estimates from the pareto ranking often exceed the significance level when δ is greater than  <dig>  as discussed, the point-admissible ranking generally produces the most layers, while the pareto produces the fewest layers. genes with high p-value rankings or high fold-change rankings will likely be ranked higher by the pareto than by either the point-admissible or convex ranking. for example, a non-differentially expressed gene may have a large fold-change because of a large variance. this gene is likely be ranked higher, and be selected as differential expression by the pareto ranking than by the point-admissible or convex ranking. likewise, a differentially expressed gene is more likely to be selected by the pareto ranking than by either the point-admissible or convex ranking. with regard to the point-admissible and convex rankings, their fdr estimates are all below the significance level when δ ≤  <dig>  the convex ranking gives a slightly higher power than the point admissible ranking.

as seen in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  the fdr estimates from the p-value ranking can exceed the significance level for small effect sizes when the sample size is  <dig>  on the other hand, the fdr estimates from the layer rankings increase as the effect size δ increases when the sample size is  <dig>  in general, when the effect sizes are large , the power of the t-statistic approaches to  <dig>  the bh procedure would select all truly differentially expressed genes from the p-value ranking while maintaining the fdr at the significance level. that is, the p-value ranking will outperform the layer rankings in terms of the control of the fdr, particularly, when the non-differentially expressed genes have large variances. finally, we do not consider the null model of no difference between two groups. since the bh procedure controls the fdr, by selecting the same number of genes the layer ranking procedures will have the fdr controlled under the null model.

three applications
 colon data set
we further used the colon cancer data to illustrate a possible application of the layer ranking algorithms for improving predictive accuracy in classification. there were three univariate ranking criteria, three 2-dimensional layer rankings, and one 3-dimensional layer rankings. for each ranking criterion, the top  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ranked genes were used for prediction using the svm classification . in order to select a pre-specified number of genes  the gene from the last layer was randomly selected when there are ties. for each gene set, we used the 10-fold cross validation to estimate predictive accuracy. note that cross-validation performed after gene selection process is known as internal cross-validation , whereas cross-validation prior to gene selection is known the external cross-validation  <cit> . for a fixed number of genes, the internal cross-validation should have higher accuracy rates than the external cross-validation.

gene id, p-value, fold-change, and the layer assigned by the  point-admissible,  convex, and  pareto algorithms for  <dig> genes selected based on the p-value  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold as the cutoff from the  <dig>  genes in the colon data set. the p-values are computed based on  <dig>  permutations.

 ionizing radiation data set
in this example, we used the layer ranking algorithms to identify genes that show most differentially expressed in two experimental factors. the experiment was conducted to study the effects of ionizing radiation-exposed human lymphoblastoid tk <dig> cells on gene expression  <cit> . in this experiment, tk <dig> cells were exposed to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gy ionizing radiation and cultured for  <dig> and  <dig> hours after exposure. rna was hybridized to the phase- <dig> human- <dig> microarray  spotted with  <dig> human cdna probes. this two-color array was designed for detection of differential expression profiles relative to toxicological pathways. the background-subtracted intensities were normalized according to lowess methodology in the log <dig> scale, and a dye-bias correction was applied to the resulting data, as described in  <cit> .

for illustrative purpose, we only used the  <dig> and  <dig> gy ionizing radiation data. statistical analysis consisted of a comparison between the  <dig> and  <dig> gy dose groups and a comparison between the  <dig> and  <dig> hours after exposure. in each comparison, the differentially expressed genes were ranked according to the p-values using the permutation t-test. the layer ranking algorithms were applied to both p-value rankings. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> layers, according to the point-admissible algorithm, for the three layer rankings and the two p-value rankings, where p <dig> and p <dig> represent the ranking for the dose and time effects, respectively. it can be seen that dose and time effects show two distinct rankings. each p-value ranking identifies a set of genes that show differences in expression on a single biological factor. the layer rankings provide a list of 'significant' genes that account for both dose and time effects simultaneously. many of the top hits have been reported to be important in lymphoblastoid cell lines exposed to ionizing radiation provides confidence that the analysis produces meaningful results.

 dilution data set
in this example, we applied the three-dimensional layer ranking criteria to a subset of the dilution data set of gene logic and the data are available at  <cit> . this study used two sources of crna, human liver tissue and central nervous system  cell lines. samples were hybridized to hg-u95av <dig> genechips arrays from affymetrix at various dilution and mixture levels. we considered the data from the three concentrations  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg. five replicate arrays are available for each concentration with a total of  <dig> arrays. the data were extracted, normalized and summarized using the "affy" package from bioconductor. for preprocessing methods, we used mas  <dig>  for background correction and pm correction, the quantile normalization method for normalization of the probe level, and the rma method for summarization of probe intensities, which was suggested by  <cit> .

since the two samples are biologically distinct, it is expected that many genes will show differential expressions between the two samples. the relative abundance of each gene is proportional to its dilution concentration. however, the expression ratios between the pure samples  are relative and should not vary with the amount of crna. if a gene expresses differently between the liver and cns samples at  <dig>  μg concentration, then we expect the same gene would show a difference in expression at other concentrations. in this application, the layer ranking algorithm is used to provide a ranking system from a long list of differentially expressed genes generated from three dilution concentrations.

the liver and cns samples were compared for each of the three concentrations using the sam procedure  <cit> . the level of significance was set at the false discovery rate of  <dig> . let g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig> be the sets of the differentially expressed genes identified from the concentrations  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg, respectively. figure  <dig> summaries the number of differentially expressed genes selected from the three comparisons. the overlapping regions denote the number of genes that were differentially expressed in two or all three concentration concentrations. there were  <dig> genes which show consistently differential expressions in the two rna samples in all three concentrations. we then applied the three-dimensional convex layer ranking algorithm to three p-value lists obtained from the sam procedure. ninety-five layers were obtained. the layer rankings of  <dig> differentially expressed genes are shown in figure  <dig>  the other two layer ranking algorithms yield similar results .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
recently, the microarray quality control consortium suggested: "fold-change ranking plus a non-stringent p-value cutoff can be used as a baseline practice for generating more reproducible signature gene lists"  <cit> . many researchers have questioned this approach  <cit> . the p-value ranking ensures the control of significance level, while the fold-change ranking may provide a better ranking when sample size  is small. the layer-ranking algorithms provide a gene list that reconciles the p-value and fold-change rankings implied by the volcano plot. the simulation shows that for experiments with small or moderate sample sizes  and detecting a 4-fold change or less, the layer ranking selects differentially expressed genes with generally lower fdr and higher power than the p-value ranking. for large sample sizes or effect sizes, the p-value ranking will outperform the layer rankings.

we illustrate three additional applications of the layer ranking algorithms. in the colon data example, we illustrate an application of using layer rankings for improving predictive accuracy. because of a large number of genes involved, the gene selection becomes one of the most important steps in the development of a prediction model. an analysis by michiels et al.  <cit>  showed that the list of genes identified as predictors of cancer prognosis was highly unstable. the selected gene set strongly depended on the selected patients in the training set. in this example, we consider the three gene selection criteria: p-value, fold-change, and frequency of selections. table  <dig> indicates that the improvement of predictive accuracy of the layer rankings over the p-value rankings appears marginal. the simulation indicates that when the sample size is large, the layer rankings can exceed the significant level. this may not be a problem for prediction purposes, since the omission of informative genes generally has a much more serious consequence on predictive accuracy than the inclusion of non-informative genes. we are currently investigating different univariate selection criteria in conjunction with layer ranking algorithms to improve predictive accuracy. in general, the p-value can be calculated in many different ways such as the parametric t-test, permutation t-test, or sam method. frequency of selections can be calculated by other classification algorithms such as ctree  <cit>  or random forest  <cit> . in addition, instead of selecting  <dig> optimal genes in each cross validation, we may select  <dig> genes or more so that each gene has higher probability been selected. those genes that have never been selected are unlikely to be differentially expressed. the 2-dimensional p-value and frequency layer rankings may be useful to filter out a small number of non-differentially expressed genes. the genes in the bottom layers may be the candidates for filtering out.

in the ionizing radiation example, we apply the layer ranking algorithms to a two-factor experiment. the algorithms can be used in the one-factor experiment with more than two conditions. consider an experiment to study effect of p <dig> genotype on gene expression profiles. the experiment consists of three mouse genotypes: wild-type , knock-out , and heterozygous . statistical analysis typically consists of a comparison among the three genotypes. a gene list ranked according the p-values from the f-statistic can be obtained using either permutation or parametric approach. an important follow-up analysis is the comparisons between the knout-out and wild-type mouse and between the heterozygous and wild-type mouse. the dunnett's test is frequently used to generate the differentially expressed gene lists for the two comparisons. however, the investigator is often interested in the genes that show differences in both comparisons.  one approach is to select the genes that are significant in both gene lists at a given p-value cutoff. however, when the number of common genes is large, the investigator must select a subset of genes from the two criteria . the layer ranking algorithm can be used to provide a list of the most "important" genes that account for both objectives simultaneously for follow-up investigation. in the dilution example, we illustrate the strength of the three-dimensional layer ranking algorithms for combining discordant results derived from three concentration groups. the set of probes that are consistently identified at different rna concentrations is ranked according to compatibility between differential expression profiles in three concentration groups.

in summary, a microarray experiment can generate different gene lists by different filter, normalization, or analysis methods for different study objectives. the layer ranking algorithm can be useful to help investigators to select the most promising genes from multiple gene lists.
