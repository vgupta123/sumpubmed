BACKGROUND
pancreatic cancer is an exceptionally aggressive disease with the majority of its victims dying within 1 year of diagnosis  <cit> . effective early detection and screening are not available, and tumors are typically diagnosed after metastasis. systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both therapies is used; however, patients rapidly develop resistance, leading to a poor 5-year survival rate of only 6%. accumulating evidence suggests that the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  and cancer stem cell  phenotypes in pancreatic tumors is an important underlying cause for extensive local tumor invasion, early metastasis, drug resistance, and tumor recurrence  <cit> . however, the mechanisms leading to emt and csc phenotypes are not fully understood, which has hindered the development of effective targeted therapies and sensitive biomarkers to improve treatment outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer.

we focused on aurora kinase a , as it is overexpressed in a vast majority of pancreatic tumors . aurka depletion inhibits in vivo tumorigenicity, enhances taxane chemosensitivity, and induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells  <cit> . data such as these have resulted in ongoing clinical trials of more than a dozen aurka inhibitors. despite these encouraging findings, aurka remains an essential kinase required for mitosis in all dividing cells. consequently, its inhibition in phase ii clinical trials has been associated with several adverse side effects, suggesting that collateral inhibition of aurka in rapidly proliferating normal tissues is responsible for the undesirable side effects  <cit> . these findings indicate that selective therapies against oncogenic targets of aurka exploited in cancer may be a superior option for developing effective drugs and combating collateral toxicity.

to this end, we identified aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig>  as a direct substrate of aurka using an innovative chemical genetic screen that we developed. aldh1a <dig> is a pancreatic csc marker and is highly enriched in a subpopulation of cells which are extremely resistant to chemotherapy. furthermore, aldh <dig> is highly enriched in surgical specimens from patients with pancreatic cancer who had undergone preoperative chemo-radiation therapy compared to untreated patients  <cit> . however, aldh1a <dig> levels have not been analyzed in pancreatic cancer. as aurka overexpression is also associated with enhanced chemoresistance, we hypothesized that aurka may upregulate aldh1a <dig> leading to emt, csc phenotypes, and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.

human influenza hemagglutinin -tagged wild-type and mutant aldh1a <dig> were cloned into vip <dig> mammalian vector and bacterial petduet vector at ecori and xhoi sites. ha-tagged aldh1a <dig> mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis.

expression and purification of aurka, tpx <dig>  and aldh1a1
aurka was prepared using the baculovirus bac-to-bac expression system according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 6x-his-tpx <dig> and 6x-his-tagged wild-type and mutant aldh1a <dig> were expressed in escherichia coli and purified using the procedures previously described  <cit> .

transfection and retroviral infection
for generating stable cell lines, aurka and aldh1a <dig> plasmids were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate into phoenix cells. the retroviruses were harvested and used to infect bxpc <dig> cells as reported previously  <cit> .

in vitro kinase assays
for in vitro labeling, aurka-tpx <dig> complex  was pre-incubated with 100 μm of atp for 1 h in a 1× kinase buffer  to activate aurka. the beads were washed extensively with 1× kinase buffer to remove excess atp, and then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with 2 μg of 6x-his-tagged recombinant protein  in the presence of  <dig>  μci of atp for 15 min. reactions were terminated upon the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate  loading buffer and subsequently separated by sds-page gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride  membrane, and exposed for autoradiography.

aurka and aldh1a <dig> shrna
aurka short hairpin rnas  were generated in our previous study  <cit> . both aurka and aldh1a <dig> shrnas were cloned into the plko. <dig> trc vector, which was a gift from david root  <cit> . the sequences are as follows:

soft agar colony formation
bxpc <dig>  panc <dig>  and different stable cell lines were plated in rpmi ,  <dig> % agar, and 10% fbs six-well plates as reported previously  <cit> . transformed colonies were counted after 3 weeks using crystal violet staining.

western blotting
cells were lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay  buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitors. equal amounts of cell extracts were used for western blotting.

ubiquitylation assay
bxpc <dig> cells were co-transfected with aldh1a <dig> or aurka shrna along with 6x-his-ubiquitin. after 36 h, mg <dig>  was added at 10 μm final concentration for an additional 12 h. cells were then harvested, and ubiquitylated proteins were isolated using ni-nta beads. the proteins were separated by sds-page and analyzed using antibodies against aurka and aldh1a <dig> 

chemotaxis assay
cell migration was determined using boyden chambers as reported previously  <cit> . the assays were performed in replicates of three, in four independent experiments. to allow for comparison between multiple assays, the data were normalized and expressed as a percentage of the number of cells present on the membrane.

mtt assay
cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5 ×  <dig> cells per 100 μl per well and cultured for  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h. the mtt assay was conducted as reported previously  <cit> . experiments were repeated three times in triplicate wells to ensure reproducibility.

immunofluorescence
bxpc <dig> and panc <dig> cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for 24 h, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in pbs for 15 min at room temperature, and then washed three times with pbs. the cells were blocked in 1% fbs, 2% bovine serum albumin ,  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in pbs for 1 h at 25 °c. cells were labeled with antibodies  for 3 h in pbs, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or texas red-conjugated secondary antibody. cells were visualized using a nikon eclipse e <dig> microscope .

aldh1a <dig> activity assay
the aldh1a <dig> activity assay was conducted in 100 mm hepes buffer  containing 2 mm dtt, 5 mm nad+,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  and  <dig>  mm imidazole. the relative concentrations of wild-type and each mutant were determined by sds-page densitometry to ensure equal concentration in all samples. to measure the consequences of aurka-mediated phosphorylation on aldh1a <dig> activity, it was phosphorylated using aurka/tpx <dig> in kinase buffer . each reaction was then diluted with hepes-bsa buffer so that each sample contained 100 mm hepes ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  μm atp,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> % bsa, and 5 mm nad+. reactions were initiated upon the addition of propanal to a final concentration of 4 mm. the change in absorbance at 360 nm due to nadh formation was measured in a 96-well plate format . the data are shown as the fractional conversion of nad+ to nadh to highlight the relative intrinsic activity of wild-type and mutants and effect of aurka-dependent phosphorylation. for the dephosphorylation experiment, aldh1a <dig> activity was measured for 45 min, at which time 1 μl of calf-alkaline phosphatase was added to the sample and the measurements were performed for another  <dig>  h. for untreated samples, 50% glycerol in 1x cutsmart buffer  was added as a control.

for experiments coupling the percentage of aldh1a <dig> phosphorylation with a change in its dehydrogenase activity , recombinant aurka-tpx <dig> and aldh1a <dig>  were reacted on a  <dig> μl scale in the indicated combinations in 1x kinase assay buffer containing  <dig>  mm atp at 30 °c. an identical reaction mixture for samples containing atp was treated with a tracer amount  of  atp. after incubation for varying periods, the kinase reactions were terminated by adding edta. for activity measurements, each sample was simultaneously treated with freshly prepared 5 mm nad+ and the initial reaction absorbance was recorded. reactions were initiated upon the addition of propanal to a final concentration of 5 mm. the reaction progress curves were monitored at 360 nm every 10 min for 7 h. the reaction progress curves were plotted as  to reflect the relative amounts of nadh produced over time. for measuring percent phosphate incorporated into aldh1a <dig> , the radioactive reactions were terminated via trichloroacetic acid  precipitation, washed two times with 200 μl of 90% acetone, and counted. to determine the percent phosphate incorporated into aldh1a <dig>  the background signal from aurka in the absence of aldh1a <dig> was subtracted from that containing both aldh1a <dig> and aurka. as aurka phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> at three sites, we calculated the percentage mol phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> per mole of the protein accordingly.

native gel analysis of aurka-mediated aldh1a <dig> phospho-oligomeric regulation
aurka was immunoprecipitated from bxpc <dig> cells, and a kinase reaction was carried out in 50 mm tris ph  <dig> , 10 mm mgcl <dig>  50 mm nacl, and 50 mm imidazole containing ~ <dig> – <dig>  mg/ml aldh1a <dig>  notably, when high concentrations of aldh1a <dig> were used , the change from tetramer to monomer was less pronounced. the kinase reaction was initiated upon the addition of atp to a final concentration of 1 mm. the reaction was spun down, and 10 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 5 μl of 3x native running buffer containing 10 mm edta for the first time point. the reaction tube was then placed on a thermomixer  at room temperature.  <dig> μl aliquots of the supernatant were collected at each time point indicated. the samples were separated using clear-native page  with a  <dig> % resolving gel  and a  <dig> % stacking gel . following electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 1x sds-page running buffer for 5 min to denature complexes, followed by 1x transfer buffer containing 20% methanol to remove excess sds. proteins were transferred to a pvdf membrane, and aldh1a <dig> was visualized using a monoclonal anti-6x-his antibody.

in-gel aldh1a <dig> activity assay
aurka kinase was immunoprecipitated from bxpc <dig> cells and reacted for 30 min with aldh1a <dig> as previously described. aldh1a <dig> in the absence of aurka was used as a control. samples were separated using cn-page  <dig>  mm gels. following electrophoresis, the gel was soaked 2x for 5 min in 100 mm tris ph  <dig> , and for an additional 5 min in 50 ml of 100 mm tris ph  <dig>  containing 15 mg nitrotetrazolium blue chloride  and 25 mg nad+. colorimetric detection of aldh1a <dig> activity was carried out by incubating the gel in the same buffer as above with the addition of 1 mg of 1-methoxy phenazine methosulfate  and 5 mm benzaldehyde in the dark at 37oc with agitation. bands were clearly visible after 5 min and were allowed to intensify over 45 min. the reaction was terminated by soaking the gel in a 10% acetic acid solution. the enzymatic activity was visualized as a purple band due to formazan precipitation upon nad+ consumption. the gel was then fixed in 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol and stained with coomassie g- <dig> 

oligomer-specific phosphorylation of aldh1a1
aurka kinase was reacted with aldh1a <dig> as previously described for  <dig>   <dig>  and 30 min. following cn-page, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol for 20 min and washed  <dig> times for 5 min with water. phos-tag staining was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. gels were imaged using a typhoon© scanner equipped with a phos-tag filter. following fluorescent detection, total protein levels were visualized with coomassie g- <dig> staining. protein quantification was determined by sds-page densitometry. the phos-tag gel was colorized using imagej to denote it as a phosphorylation-specific signal.

luciferase assay
bxpc <dig> cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of  <dig> cells/well. after 12 h, the cells were transfected with 50 ng/well of snail, slug, cd <dig>  or e-cadherin promoter-driven luciferase plasmids using lipofectamine . cells were simultaneously co-transfected with 50 ng/well of the prl-sv <dig> renilla luciferase plasmid  as an internal control. after 48 h, firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured with the dual luciferase kit . the firefly luciferase signal was normalized to the renilla luciferase signal to account for variations in transfection efficiency. all experiments were performed in triplicate, three independent times.

statistical analysis
bar graph results are plotted as the average ± standard error of the mean . significance was evaluated using a two-tailed student’s t test and two-way analysis of variance and is displayed as follows: *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
aldh1a <dig> is a direct target of aurka
the chemical genetic approach involves an engineered kinase, which in the presence of a radioactive orthogonal atp analog  atp, n
6- atp), specifically transfers the radioactive tag  to its substrates. the modified pocket in the engineered kinase is created by replacing a conserved bulky residue in the active site with glycine. the complementary substituent on atp is created by attaching bulky groups at the n- <dig> position of atp. these atp analogs are not accepted by wild-type kinases, permitting unbiased identification of direct substrates of the engineered kinase in a global environment . using the aforementioned design criteria, we generated an aurka mutant  that efficiently accepted nphenethyl-atp  as the orthogonal atp analog. using aurka-as <dig> and  pe-atp, we previously identified several novel aurka substrates including phlda <dig> and limk <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we focused on aldh1a <dig> as the direct target of aurka. to confirm the results obtained from the chemical genetic screen, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant aldh1a <dig> and aurka, which revealed that aurka directly phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> .fig.  <dig> aurka directly phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> and regulates its subcellular localization. a aldh1a <dig> is directly phosphorylated by aurka. aurka-tpx <dig> complex was subjected to kinase assay with either atp  or with 6x-his-aldh1a <dig> and atp  for 15 min. lane  <dig> shows aldh1a <dig> incubated with atp. b, c subcellular localization of aldh1a <dig> in  bxpc <dig> and  panc <dig> cells treated with scrambled or aldh1a <dig> shrna for 30 h. d aurka localization in bxpc <dig> and  panc <dig> cells treated with scrambled or aurka shrna for 30 h. f aurka regulates aldh1a <dig> subcellular localization in bxpc <dig> cells. unsynchronized cells were either treated with scrambled  or aurka  shrna for 30 h, fixed and stained with dapi  or aldh1a <dig> antibody . more than  <dig> cells were analyzed from multiple random frames. representative data are shown. g histogram shows percentage of bxpc <dig> cells displaying cytosolic and perinuclear localization in response to aurka shrna and  mln <dig>  values shown are mean ± sem of three independent experiments. * indicate statistically significant differences with respect to controls. p <  <dig>  analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. h aurka regulates aldh1a <dig> subcellular localization using its kinase activity. unsynchronized cells were treated with either dmso or mln <dig> for 16 h, fixed and stained with dapi or aldh1a <dig> antibody. more than  <dig> cells were analyzed from multiple random frames. representative data are shown. j, l aurka ablation  or inhibition  results in somewhat perinuclear localization of aldh1a <dig> in panc <dig> cells. k, m histogram shows percentage of panc <dig> cells showing cytosolic and perinuclear localization in response to  aurka shrna and  mln <dig>  values shown are mean ± sem of three independent experiments. * indicate statistically significant differences with respect to controls. p <  <dig>  analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. data used to generate the summary statistics shown in panels g, i, k, and m are reported in additional file 2





aurka regulates the subcellular localization of aldh1a <dig> in pancreatic cancer cells
we next examined the subcellular localization of aurka and aldh1a <dig> in bxpc <dig> and panc <dig> cells. aldh1a <dig> displayed cytoplasmic localization, which is consistent with previous findings showing it to be a cytoplasmic enzyme . aurka too displayed cytoplasmic localization in both bxpc <dig> and panc <dig> cells . more importantly, when aurka levels were knocked down using aurka-shrna or inhibited using mln <dig> , aldh1a <dig> adopted somewhat perinuclear localization , suggesting that aurka regulates the subcellular localization of aldhi1a <dig> to some extent in bxpc <dig> cells . as shown in fig. 1g and i, ~35% and 22% of bxpc <dig> cells displayed perinuclear localization of aldh1a <dig> in aurka shrna-treated and mln8237-treated cells, respectively. to examine whether aurka-mediated regulation of aldh1a <dig> was common in other pancreatic cancer cells, we investigated aldh1a <dig> subcellular localization in panc <dig> cells in the absence or presence of either aurka shrna or mln <dig>  similar to the results obtained in bxpc <dig> cells, aurka depletion or inhibition resulted in moderate perinuclear localization of aldh1a <dig> . data used to generate the summary statistics shown in fig. 1g, i, k, and m are reported in additional file  <dig> 

aurka and aldh1a <dig> associate in pancreatic cancer cells
to investigate whether aurka associates with aldh1a <dig> in bxpc <dig> cells, we isolated aldh1a <dig> immune complex, which pulled down aurka . this finding was corroborated by isolating aurka immune complex, which too revealed significant association with aldh1a <dig> . similarly, we observed robust association of aurka and aldh1a <dig> in panc <dig> cells . these results confirm that both aurka and aldh1a <dig> associate with each other in pancreatic cancer cells.fig.  <dig> aurka binds aldh1a <dig> and positively regulates its protein levels. a aurka and aldh1a <dig> associate in bxpc <dig> cells. aurka  and igg  were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. b aurka and aldh1a <dig> associate in bxpc <dig> cells. c, d aurka and aldh1a <dig> associate in panc <dig> cells, as shown by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. each experiment was done at least three independent times. representative data are shown. e aurka overexpression increases aldh1a <dig> levels. f aurka ablation using three different aurka shrnas depletes aldh1a <dig> in bxpc <dig> cells. g histogram shows relative band intensities normalized to the corresponding tubulin level. data are expressed as x-fold change relative to control; values shown as mean ± sem of three independent experiments. * and # indicate statistically significant differences with respect to controls for aurka and aldh1a <dig> proteins, respectively. p <  <dig>  analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. h aurka inhibition using mln <dig>  decreases aldh1a <dig> levels in bxpc <dig> cells. i aurka overexpression increases aldh1a <dig> levels in panc <dig> cells. j histogram shows relative band intensities normalized to the corresponding tubulin level. results are mean ± sem of three independent experiments. *p <  <dig>  vs. aurka control; #p <  <dig>  vs. aldh1a <dig> control analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. k aurka ablation using three different aurka shrnas depletes aldh1a <dig> in panc <dig> cells. l histogram shows relative band intensities normalized to the corresponding tubulin level. results are mean ± sem of three independent experiments. *p <  <dig>  vs. aurka control; #p <  <dig>  vs. aldh1a <dig> control analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. m aurka positively regulates aldh1a <dig> using its kinase activity in panc <dig> cells. n histogram shows relative band intensities normalized to the corresponding tubulin level. data shown are mean ± sem of three independent experiments. *p <  <dig>  vs. aurka control; #p <  <dig>  vs. aldh1a <dig> control analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. data used to generate the summary statistics shown in panels g, j, l, and n are reported in additional file 3





aurka positively regulates aldh1a <dig> levels
our previous studies revealed that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of phlda <dig> at s <dig> degrades it, whereas aurka-mediated phosphorylation of limk <dig> at s <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> increases its protein stability  <cit> . thus, we examined whether aurka affects the protein levels of aldh1a <dig>  ectopic overexpression of aurka increased the levels of aldh1a <dig> , and its depletion using corresponding shrnas decreased it , suggesting that aurka positively regulates aldh1a <dig> levels. figure 2g shows quantification of alterations in aldh1a <dig> levels upon aurka knock-down from three independent experiments. we also inhibited aurka using mln <dig>  which too resulted in substantial decrease in aldh1a <dig> levels, suggesting that aurka regulates aldh1a <dig> using its kinase activity . we observed similar aurka-mediated positive regulation of aldh1a <dig> in panc <dig> cells, suggesting that it is a common mechanism in pancreatic cancer cells . data used to generate the summary statistics shown in fig. 2g, j, l, and n are reported in additional file  <dig> 

aurka inhibits aldh1a <dig> degradation
as aurka directly phosphorylates aldh1a <dig>  we hypothesized that aurka might increase aldh1a <dig> levels by inhibiting its degradation via phosphorylation. thus, we examined the profile of aldh1a <dig> degradation in bxpc <dig> and aurka-overexpressing bxpc <dig>  cells using cycloheximide. as shown in fig. 3a–c, aurka overexpression reduced aldh1a <dig> degradation, suggesting that it regulates the level of aldh1a <dig> by inhibiting its degradation. this study also revealed that the half-life of aldh1a <dig> was less than 2 h in bxpc <dig> cells. aldh1a <dig> degradation could be mediated by ubiquitin or non-ubiquitin mechanisms. we transfected 6x-his-ubiquitin into bxpc <dig> and aurka-depleted-bxpc <dig> cells, and analyzed the ubiquitylation of aldh1a <dig>  knock-down of aurka led to increased ubiquitylation of aldh1a <dig> , thus confirming that aurka stabilizes aldh1a <dig> levels by inhibiting its degradation by ubiquitylation.fig.  <dig> aurka stabilizes aldh1a <dig> protein levels and increases its enzymatic activity. a aurka prevents aldh1a <dig> degradation. aurka-bxpc <dig> and bxpc <dig> cells were treated with cycloheximide for  <dig> and 4 h, and aurka and aldh1a <dig> levels analyzed. b graphical representation of aurka degradation rate. the results of densitometric scanning are shown graphically with aurka signal normalized to actin signal. aurka half-life is ~2 h. the significance of the difference between means was determined by duncan’s multiple range test, *p <  <dig> . c graphical representation of aldh1a <dig> degradation rate. aldh1a <dig> half-life is ~2 h, *p <  <dig> . d aurka stabilizes aldh1a <dig> by inhibiting its ubiquitylation. each experiment was done at least three independent times. representative data are shown. e, f aurka increases aldh1a <dig> enzymatic activity. comparative spectrophotometric analysis of aldh1a <dig> activity upon phosphorylation by aurka. aldh1a <dig> activity with and without atp and aurka were used as controls. the increase in aldh1a <dig> activity observed in the presence of atp can be overcome by stringent purification of aldh1a <dig> . g stoichiometry of aldh1a <dig> phosphorylation by aurka after  <dig>  and 6 h. h, i coupling the change in aldh1a <dig> activity with stoichiometry of aldh1a <dig> phosphorylation. two identical reaction mixtures were treated with cold atp to measure aldh1a <dig> activity , or with cold atp spiked with  <dig>  μci of atp . after  <dig>  and 6 h kinase reactions, 32p incorporation  and aldh1a <dig> activity  were measured. j dephosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> by calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase  decreases its dehydrogenase activity. each experiment was done at least three independent times. representative data are shown




aurka increases the enzymatic activity of aldh1a1
increased aldh1a <dig> levels and activity are hallmarks of cancer stem cells. thus, we investigated whether aurka modulates the enzymatic activity of aldh1a <dig>  we designed a two-step approach to phosphorylate aldh1a <dig> and subsequently measure its dehydrogenase activity. due to the nature of the assay, we selected five controls to account for any phosphorylation-independent change in dehydrogenase activity. upon phosphorylation by aurka, we observed a robust increase in aldh1a <dig> activity relative to the phosphorylated controls . during our initial experiments, we observed an increase in activity when aldh1a <dig> was incubated with atp alone; however, this change was less than that observed when in the presence of aurka and atp . we hypothesized that this increase was likely due to phosphorylation by bacterial kinases co-purified with aldh1a <dig> and/or a direct interaction with atp itself. we thus carried out a high-stringency purification of aldh1a <dig> to eliminate potential impurities, which resulted in a robust increase in aldh1a <dig> activity only when aurka was able to phosphorylate aldh1a <dig> .

we observed that the increase in aldh1a <dig> activity in these experiments is highly influenced by the activity of aurka. accordingly, if the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated aldh1a <dig> was too low, the change in activity could not be observed. thus, we needed to address the stoichiometry of phosphorylation and correlate it with the observed increase in activity.

to answer this question, we measured the activity and the percent mol phosphate incorporated per mole of aldh1a <dig> . as expected, there was virtually no observable change in aldh1a <dig> activity after  <dig>  h . this was not surprising, as the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was a mere  <dig> % . however, after a 6-h kinase reaction, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation reached 38%, which was accompanied by an observable increase in aldh1a <dig> activity . this increase was prevalent in the first several hours of the aldh1a <dig> activity, as seen in the projections of each plot after 2 h .

as an additional approach to confirm that the increase in aldh1a <dig> activity was indeed due to direct phosphorylation by aurka, we treated phosphorylated aldh1a <dig> with calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase  and monitored the impact on dehydrogenase activity . as predicted, the addition of cip caused a decrease in the overall activity, supporting that the change in activity observed following the kinase assay was the result of direct phosphorylation by aurka. combined, these findings serve to validate that aldh1a <dig> enzymatic activity is regulated via phosphorylation.

aldh1a <dig> also positively regulates aurka levels, triggering a feedback activation loop
interestingly, several aurka substrates are known to regulate the levels or activity of aurka in a feedback mechanism. thus, we examined whether aldh1a <dig> exhibits a similar impact on aurka levels. we overexpressed aldh1a <dig>  which revealed a concomitant increase in aurka levels, suggesting that a positive feedback activation loop exists between the two proteins . this finding was confirmed by depleting aldh1a <dig> using two different aldh1a <dig> shrnas, which led to a robust decrease in aurka levels . figure 4c shows quantification of alterations in aurka levels upon aldh1a <dig> knock-down from three independent experiments. similar results were obtained using panc <dig> cells, suggesting that the aurka-aldh1a <dig> feedback activation loop is a common mechanism in pancreatic cancer cells . data used to generate the summary statistics shown in fig. 4c, e, and g are reported in additional file  <dig>  we next examined aurka and aldh1a <dig> levels in cycloheximide-treated bxpc <dig> and aldh1a1-overexpressing bxpc <dig> cells. aldh1a <dig> overexpression significantly reduced the degradation of aurka, suggesting that aldh1a <dig> stabilizes aurka protein levels . to further corroborate this finding, we investigated the ubiquitylation of aurka in bxpc <dig> and aldh1a1-depleted bxpc <dig> cells, which showed increased ubiquitylation of aurka upon aldh1a <dig> depletion . together, these results confirm that aldh1a <dig> increases aurka levels by preventing its degradation, thereby triggering a positive feedback activation loop.fig.  <dig> aldh1a <dig> positively regulates aurka protein levels by preventing its degradation. a aldh1a <dig> overexpression increases aurka levels. wild-type ha-tagged aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells were generated by infecting the corresponding retrovirus. b aldh1a <dig> knock-down using two different aldh1a <dig> shrnas depletes aurka in bxpc <dig> cells. cells were transfected with scrambled shrna , aldh1a1-shrna <dig> or  <dig> , and aurka and aldh1a <dig> levels were analyzed after 30 h. c histogram shows relative band intensities normalized to the corresponding tubulin level. data shown are mean ± sem of three independent experiments. * and # indicate statistically significant differences with respect to controls for aldh1a <dig> and aurka proteins, respectively. p <  <dig>  analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. d aldh1a <dig> overexpression increases aurka levels in panc <dig> cells. e histogram shows relative band intensities normalized to the corresponding tubulin level. data shown as mean ± sem of three independent experiments. * and # indicate statistically significant differences with respect to controls for aldh1a <dig> and aurka proteins, respectively. p <  <dig>  analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. f aldh1a <dig> depletion decreases aurka levels in panc <dig> cells. g histogram shows relative band intensities normalized to the corresponding tubulin level. data shown as mean ± sem of three independent experiments. h aldh1a <dig> inhibits aurka degradation. i graphical representation of aldh1a <dig> degradation rate. the significance of the difference between means was determined by duncan’s multiple range test, *p <  <dig> . j graphical representation of aurka degradation rate, *p <  <dig> . k aldh1a <dig> stabilizes aurka by inhibiting its ubiquitylation. each experiment was done at least three independent times. representative data are shown. data used to generate the summary statistics shown in panels c, e, and g are reported in additional file 4





aurka phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> at t <dig>  t <dig>  and t493
aurka preferentially phosphorylates the r/k/n-r-x-s/t-Φ consensus sequence, where Φ denotes a hydrophobic residue except for pro  <cit> . this preference suggested t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> as potential aurka sites on aldh1a <dig>  we generated the corresponding phosphorylation-resistant mutants, t267a, t442a, and t493a and analyzed their phosphorylation using aurka in vitro. aurka phosphorylates all the three sites on aldh1a <dig> . to investigate whether aurka phosphorylates any additional sites, we generated the corresponding phosphorylation-resistant triple mutant  and conducted an in vitro kinase assay. aurka did not phosphorylate the 3a mutant, confirming that t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> are the only aurka sites on aldh1a <dig> .fig.  <dig> aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> at t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> regulates its protein stability and subcellular localization. a aurka phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> at t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  phospho-dead single mutants of aldh1a <dig> were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using aurka/tpx <dig> and atp. b t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> are the only aurka sites on aldh1a <dig>  as the 3a-aldh1a <dig> mutant is not phosphorylated by aurka. c aurka regulates the subcellular localization of aldh1a <dig> via phosphorylation. ha-tagged wild-type and 3a-aldh1a1-expressing stable cells were fixed and immunostained with dapi  and antibody against ha . more than  <dig> cells were analyzed from multiple random frames. representative data are shown. d double staining of total aldh1a <dig> and ectopically expressed aldh1a <dig> in wild-type and 3a-expressing bxpc <dig> cells. e aurka regulates the subcellular localization of aldh1a <dig> via phosphorylation of all three sites. more than  <dig> cells were analyzed from multiple random frames. representative data are shown. f aurka promotes aldh1a <dig> levels by phosphorylation. bxpc <dig> cells were infected with ha-tagged wild-type aldh1a <dig> or 3a-aldh1a <dig> retrovirus. after 30 h, protein levels were analyzed using aurka, ha, and actin antibodies. g aurka inhibits aldh1a <dig> ubiquitylation by phosphorylating t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  h aurka increases aldh1a <dig> levels by phosphorylation at t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  i graphical representation of aldh1a <dig> levels in bxpc <dig> cells expressing either wild-type or mutant aldh1a <dig>  average values of wild-type and mutant aldh1a <dig> levels from three independent experiments are depicted in the graph. **p <  <dig> , compared to control analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. j aurka inhibits aldh1a <dig> ubiquitylation by phosphorylating t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> sites. bxpc <dig> cells expressing either wild-type aldh1a <dig>  t267a-aldh1a <dig>  t442a-aldh1a <dig>  t493a-aldh1a <dig>  or 3a-aldh1a <dig> were co-infected with aurka shrna along with 6x-his-ubiquitin. ubiquitylated proteins were isolated and analyzed as described in methods. each experiment was done at least three independent times. representative data are shown




aurka regulates the subcellular localization of aldh1a <dig> via phosphorylation
to investigate the significance of aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig>  we initially investigated the subcellular localization of ha-tagged wild-type and mutant 3a-aldh1a <dig>  in bxpc <dig> cells. while wild-type aldh1a <dig> displayed cytoplasmic localization similar to the endogenous enzyme, the 3a mutant revealed perinuclear localization, showing that aurka-mediated phosphorylation contributes to the cytoplasmic residence of aldh1a <dig> . we further analyzed total aldh1a <dig>  and ectopically expressed wild-type and mutant aldh1a <dig> in the corresponding cell lines using aldh1a <dig> and ha antibodies, respectively. while wild-type aldh1a1-expressing cells showed diffused cytoplasmic staining of both endogenous and ectopically expressed aldh1a <dig>  3a mutant-expressing cells showed distinct perinuclear staining of the 3a mutant but cytoplasmic staining for the endogenous enzyme . together, these results underscore a role of aurka in maintaining the cytoplasmic localization of aldh1a <dig> 

to investigate the contribution of each of the aldh1a <dig> phosphorylation sites in regulating its subcellular localization, we generated ha-tagged wild-type and phospho-resistant single mutants of aldh1a1-expressing bxpc <dig> cells, and examined their subcellular localization. surprisingly, all single phospho-resistant mutants of aldh1a <dig> showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization, suggesting that inhibition of phosphorylation at all sites is required for its perinuclear localization .

aurka increases aldh1a <dig> levels via phosphorylation at all three sites
we next examined the consequences of aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> on its expression levels in bxpc <dig> cells. these cells were transfected with wild-type aldh1a <dig> and the 3a-aldh1a <dig> allele for 30 h, and their protein levels analyzed. as shown in fig. 5f, while wild-type aldh1a <dig> was highly expressed, 3a-aldh1a <dig> was expressed at a much lower level, suggesting that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> is required to stabilize its protein levels. furthermore, as 3a-aldh1a <dig> was expressed at a lower level, it led to a concomitant decrease in the aurka level, presumably due to the feedback activation loop.

our data revealed that aurka increases aldh1a <dig> levels by inhibiting its ubiquitylation; thus, we examined whether 3a-aldh1a <dig> was impervious to aurka-mediated protein stability. we transiently depleted aurka from wild-type aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells and examined the relative ubiquitylation levels of aldh1a <dig>  while wild-type aldh1a <dig> was significantly degraded via ubiquitylation upon aurka depletion, 3a-aldh1a <dig> showed slight ubiquitylation, confirming that aurka-mediated phosphorylation is responsible for increased aldh1a <dig> stability .

aurka-mediated stabilization of aldh1a <dig> via phosphorylation prompted us to analyze potential degron sites in the aldh1a <dig> sequence, which revealed t <dig> within a d box motif . although apc-cdh1-mediated degradation of d-box-containing proteins can occur independently of any modification, we hypothesized that aurka-mediated stabilization of aldh1a <dig> is likely due to the phosphorylation at t <dig>  thus, we generated stably expressing t267a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. as controls, we also generated the other two single-mutant expressing cells . aldh1a <dig> levels were analyzed in wild-type, the three single mutant expressing bxpc <dig> cells, and 3a-bxpc <dig> cells. as hypothesized, the aldh1a <dig> level was reduced in t267a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells compared to wild-type aldh1a1-expressing cells; however, interestingly, it was also reduced in t442a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> and t493a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, with the triple mutant showing minimal protein levels, suggesting that phosphorylation of each of the three sites contributes to increased aldh1a <dig> levels .

as our data showed that aurka increases aldh1a <dig> levels by inhibiting its ubiquitylation, we analyzed the contribution of each of these three sites in affecting protein stability. the mutant aldh1a1-expressing cell lines displayed a similar steady state decrease in aldh1a <dig> levels compared to wild-type aldh1a1-expressing cells, as shown in fig. 5h and i. we then transiently knocked down aurka in these cells using aurka shrna, which resulted in robust ubiquitylation of wild-type aldh1a <dig>  followed by each of the three single mutants with relatively less ubiquitylation . the 3a-aldh1a <dig> mutant displayed minimal ubiquitylation upon aurka depletion, confirming its independence from aurka-mediated phosphorylation. these results demonstrate that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> at each of the three sites  contributes to increased protein stability.

aurka increases aldh1a <dig> activity predominantly via phosphorylation at the t <dig> site
aldh1a <dig> has an nad+ binding pocket , a catalytic site  and an oligomerization domain . t <dig> is within the nad+ binding pocket . the neighboring e <dig> residue in the active site is essential for catalysis, suggesting that phosphorylation at t <dig> may have a direct impact on the catalytic activity of aldh1a <dig>  t <dig> is within the catalytic domain and t <dig> is part of the oligomerization domain, which is involved in oligomer formation . thus, we hypothesized that all the three phosphorylation sites may participate in regulating aldh1a <dig> enzymatic activity. although all single mutants exhibited a robust decrease in activity relative to the wild-type enzyme, the t <dig> mutant showed no activity, suggesting that phosphorylation at t <dig> primarily governs aldh1a <dig> activity .fig.  <dig> aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> modulates its oligomeric state and dehydrogenase activity. a monomeric aldh1a <dig> and three aurka phosphorylation sites . t <dig> is within the nad+ binding pocket, t <dig> is within the catalytic site, and t <dig> is within the oligomerization domain. b aldh1a1-phosphorylation-resistant mutants have diminished enzymatic activity. c phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> by aurka triggers aldh1a <dig> oligomers to dissociate to the monomeric form. the same membrane is shown as a short  and long  exposure for clarity. d average relative changes in tetramer and monomer abundance derived from three independent experiments. the intensities of tetramer and monomer at each time were normalized independently against time  <dig>  quantification of tetramer and monomer intensities was derived from the short exposure  from three independent experiments. e average ratio of normalized monomer to tetramer as a function of time. to account for the large difference in tetramer and monomer abundance, the intensity of each band was normalized against the tetramer intensity at time zero and the ratio of monomer to tetramer was plotted as a function of time. after 30 min, a significant increase in the monomer to tetramer was observed . f activity staining of phosphorylation-induced aldh1a <dig> monomer harbors high dehydrogenase activity. purple color is used to denote it as activity-based staining. g coomassie g- <dig> stain of panel f. h quantification of oligomer-specific aldh1a <dig> activities from three independent experiments  analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. specifically, monomer and tetramer intensities of activity and coomassie stain at 30 min of phosphorylation were normalized against the unphosphorylated tetramer control , then the normalized activity of each oligomer was divided by its respective normalized coomassie signal to generate the plot shown. i phos-tag staining of phosphorylated aldh1a <dig>  j coomassie g- <dig> stain of panel i. k quantification of normalized phos-tag intensities with respect to total protein levels from three independent experiments. protein quantification was carried out in the same way as described for the activity assay . the red color denotes it as a phosphorylation-specific signal. data used to generate the summary statistics shown in panels d, e, h, and k are reported in additional file 5





aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> regulates its oligomeric states
aldh1a <dig> can exist in monomeric, dimeric or tetrameric forms; however, their relative activities remain unknown. as phosphorylation is known to regulate the oligomeric distribution of several proteins, we hypothesized that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> alters its oligomeric state, and that this change was coupled with the observed change in activity. similar to most multimeric proteins, aldh1a <dig> exists predominantly as a tetramer at high concentrations; however, as the dilution increases, the equilibrium becomes more dynamic and begins to populate the monomeric form. surprisingly, very little dimer was observed at all concentrations, suggesting that the tetramer and the monomer are its most abundant forms.

we monitored the abundance of each species upon phosphorylation as a function of time to analyze the kinetics of the phosphorylation-dependent oligomeric redistribution of aldh1a <dig>  to this end, we chose a concentration which contained both tetrameric and monomeric species. as the phosphorylation progressed, the aldh1a <dig> oligomeric distribution drastically shifted to the monomeric form . the concomitant decrease in tetramer abundance serves as an internal control to validate that it is indeed dissociating upon phosphorylation. while fig. 6d shows average relative changes in tetramer and monomer abundance, fig. 6e displays the average ratio of normalized monomer to tetramer as a function of time derived from three independent experiments.

we then sought to explore which oligomeric species had the highest activity with and without phosphorylation. to this end, we conducted a similar kinetic analysis and measured the dehydrogenase activity using a native in-gel activity assay . upon phosphorylation the monomeric species that formed harbored the highest activity , whereas the tetramer showed little to no change. figure 6h shows quantification of oligomer-specific aldh1a <dig> activities from three independent experiments. this is the first example to identify the oligomer-specific catalytic activities of aldh1a <dig> complexes following phosphorylation.

we next sought the oligomeric species that was most phosphorylated to examine a potential correlation between phosphorylation and activity. as predicted, the monomeric population that formed was highly phosphorylated . collectively, these data suggest that phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> triggers the dissociation of the tetramer into its monomeric form and that this highly phosphorylated monomer harbors the highest enzymatic activity among all of the oligomeric species. data used to generate the summary statistics shown in fig. 6d, e, h, and k are reported in additional file  <dig> 

aldh1a <dig> and aurka feedback activation loop promotes highly aggressive pancreatic cancer phenotypes
since aurka is crucial for mitosis, we examined whether aldh1a <dig> impacts the cell cycle. a fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analysis was conducted using unsynchronized stable scrambled shrna-expressing bxpc <dig> and stable aldh1a1-depleted bxpc <dig> cells. both cell types showed a similar distribution of cells in different cell cycle phases and no aneuploidy, which suggests that aldh1a <dig> does not affect the cell cycle . we next investigated the effect of aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> on cellular proliferation. as expected, ectopic expression of either aurka or wild-type aldh1a <dig> increased cellular proliferation in both bxpc <dig>  and panc <dig> cells . in contrast, expression of 3a-aldh1a <dig> showed a significantly impaired proliferation rate, which was lower than either bxpc <dig>  or panc <dig> cells . more importantly, depletion of aurka in bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells significantly reduced proliferation in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, suggesting that the aldh1a1-triggered increase in cell proliferation is predominantly due to an aurka-mediated feedback activation loop . we further tested this hypothesis by overexpressing aurka in bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. in agreement with our previous result, aurka overexpression increased cell proliferation in wild-type aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  thereby confirming that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> is crucial for an enhanced growth rate . similar results were obtained in panc <dig> cells, where aurka depletion significantly reduced proliferation in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells , whereas the aurka overexpression mediated increase in cell proliferation in wild-type aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells .fig.  <dig> aldh1a <dig> is a key oncogenic effector of aurka. a scrambled shrna-expressing bxpc <dig> and aldh1a <dig> knock-down-bxpc <dig> cells were analyzed by facs analysis. b aldh1a <dig> promotes cell proliferation in bxpc <dig> cells. bxpc <dig>  aurka-bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h. at the end of the incubation, an mtt assay was performed. c aldh1a <dig> promotes cell proliferation in panc <dig> cells. d aurka depletion decreases cell proliferation in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in phospho-resistant 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. mtt assay was performed after 48 h of transfection. the statistical significance was analyzed using two-independent-sample t test, *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  compared to scrambled shrna controls. e aurka overexpression increases cell proliferation in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. mtt was performed after 48 h of transfection. *p <  <dig>  compared to vector-infected controls analyzed using two-independent-sample t test. f aurka depletion decreases cell proliferation in aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells, but not in phospho-resistant 3a-aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells. g aurka overexpression increases cell proliferation in aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells. h, i aldh1a <dig> promotes colony formation in a soft agar assay in  bxpc <dig> and  panc <dig> cells. *p <  <dig>  compared to vector-expressing control analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. j aldh1a <dig> promotes cell motility in bxpc <dig> cells. **p <  <dig>  compared to vector-expressing control by two-tailed student’s t test. k aurka depletion inhibits cell motility in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in phospho-resistant 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. **p <  <dig>  compared to scrambled shrna control by two-tailed student’s t test. l aurka overexpression increases cell motility in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. m aldh1a <dig> promotes cell motility in panc <dig> cells. chemotaxis assay was performed in aldh1a1-panc <dig> and 3a-aldh1a1-panc <dig> using boyden chambers. these experiments were performed three independent times. representative data are shown. magnification, 200×. n histogram shows mean ± sem of three independent experiments. **p <  <dig>  compared to vector-expressing control analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. o, p aurka depletion inhibits cell motility in aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells, but not in phospho-resistant 3a-aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells. q, r aurka overexpression increases cell motility in aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells. data used to generate the summary statistics shown in panels c, f, g, i, n, p, and r are reported in additional file 6





the impact of aldh1a <dig> was further evaluated in bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells under anchorage-independent conditions. aldh1a <dig> expression led to a robust increase in colony formation in bxpc <dig> cells compared to parental bxpc <dig> cells. by contrast, expression of 3a-aldh1a <dig> acted as dominant negative and exhibited minimal number of colonies in the soft agar assay . similar results were also obtained in panc <dig> cells . these findings show that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> is crucial for promoting cell proliferation both under attached and anchorage-independent conditions in pancreatic cancer cells.

aldh1a <dig> and aurka feedback activation loop enhances cell motility
we next determined the contribution of aldh1a <dig> in promoting chemotaxis using serum-starved bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. a robust increase in cell motility was observed upon wild-type aldh1a <dig> expression . however, expression of 3a-aldh1a <dig> significantly impaired cell motility compared to vector-expressing bxpc <dig> cells, suggesting that 3a-aldh1a <dig> may act as a dominant negative and inhibit cell motility. to further explore the impact of aurka on aldh1a1-mediated motility, we depleted aurka in bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, which considerably reduced cell motility in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, suggesting that the aldh1a1-triggered increase in cell motility is due to aurka-mediated positive regulation . we further tested this hypothesis by overexpressing aurka in bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. aurka overexpression increased cell migration in wild-type aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells . this result was further validated in panc <dig> cells, where wild-type aldh1a <dig> expression showed a drastic increase in cell motility while 3a-aldh1a <dig> showed significant inhibition when compared to wild-type panc <dig> cells . similarly, aurka depletion significantly reduced cell motility in aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells , while aurka overexpression increased cell migration in wild-type aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells, but not in 3a-aldh1a1-panc <dig> cells . data used to generate the summary statistics shown in fig. 7c, f, g, i, n, p, and r are reported in additional file  <dig>  together, these results corroborate that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> plays a key role in increasing cell motility. as chemotaxis plays a key role in cancer metastasis, these results underscore a crucial oncogenic role of the aurka-aldh1a <dig> feedback activation loop in pancreatic malignancy.

aldh1a <dig> upregulation is a key mechanism by which aurka increases emt and csc phenotypes
a pivotal role of aldh1a <dig> in inducing emt and csc is well delineated. a recent study has also reported that aurka leads to emt using mln8237; however, the mechanism remains unclear  <cit> . our data suggest that aldh1a <dig> upregulation may be a key mechanism by which aurka leads to emt and csc. thus, to test this hypothesis, we examined potential modulation of e-cadherin, snail, slug, and cd44p using corresponding luciferase plasmids which measure their promoter activities. as shown in fig. 8a, expression of wild-type aldh1a <dig> led to a robust increase in the activities of snail, slug, and cd44p, but had minimal effect on e-cadherin activity. more importantly, ectopic expression of the phosphorylation-resistant triple mutant not only prevented the increase in promoter activities of cd <dig>  slug, and snail, but in effect resulted in even less activity compared to parental cells, thereby underscoring a crucial role of aurka in aldh1a1-induced aggressive oncogenic phenotypes.fig.  <dig> aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> is crucial for aldh1a1-induced emt, csc, and drug resistance. a aldh1a <dig> expression increases cd <dig>  slug, and snail promoter activities, whereas 3a-aldh1a <dig> expression decreases cd <dig>  slug, and snail promoter activities. bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells were plated in 96-well plates overnight and then transfected with cd <dig>  slug, snail, and e-cadherin promoter-driven luciferase plasmids as described in methods. after 48 h, luciferase activities were measured with the dual luciferase kit . all experiments were done in triplicate, three independent times. *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig> , compared to control bxpc <dig> cells analyzed by two-way analysis of variance. b aldh1a <dig> expression increases the levels of emt and csc markers while decreasing e-cadherin levels, whereas 3a-aldh1a <dig> expression decreases the levels of emt and csc markers while increasing e-cadherin levels. c aurka inhibition using mln <dig> decreases the levels of emt and csc markers, but increases e-cadherin levels. d aldh1a <dig> overexpression increases sphere-forming ability in bxpc <dig> cells. bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells were incubated in ultralow attachment plates as described in methods. pancreatospheres were counted after 5 days. e aldh1a <dig> overexpression increases drug resistance in bxpc <dig> cells. bxpc <dig>  wild-type aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells were plated in 96-well plates overnight, doxorubicin  was added, and cells cultured for another  <dig>   <dig>  or 72 h. cell viability was calculated by mtt assay. f aurka ablation sensitizes bxpc <dig> cells to aldh1a <dig> inhibition using n,n-diethylaminobenzaldehyde . bxpc <dig> cells were either incubated with deab  or with vehicle . after 48 h, cell viability was analyzed. *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  compared to scrambled shrna control by two-tailed student’s t test. g aldh1a <dig> inhibition sensitizes bxpc <dig> cells to aurka inhibition. bxpc <dig> cells were treated with 100 μm deab and varying concentrations of mln <dig>  for 24 h and cell viability analyzed. h same data as in g but shown as line graph. i proposed model showing aurka-aldh1a <dig> axis in promoting emt, csc, and chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer




to further confirm these results, we analyzed the protein levels of n-cadherin, cd <dig>  slug, snail, and e-cadherin in bxpc <dig>  wild-type aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells. e-cadherin is an epithelial cell marker, which is downregulated upon emt, while snail, slug, and cd44p are increased in cells undergoing emt and csc. similar to the promoter activation assays, n-cadherin, cd <dig>  slug, and snail levels increased considerably upon aldh1a <dig> expression, but were prevented in the presence of 3a-aldh1a <dig> in bxpc <dig> cells, confirming that the phosphorylation-resistant mutant serves as a dominant negative . in addition, e-cadherin levels decreased in aldh1a1-overexpressing cells, but showed a significant increase in 3a-aldh1a <dig> cells. we also analyzed the levels of vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> , levels of which are known to increase in emt-undergoing cells and promote tumor invasion. aldh1a <dig> overexpression increased both vimentin and mmp- <dig> levels in bxpc <dig> cells, whereas phospho-resistant mutant expression abolished their expression. collectively, these results validate that aurka-mediated phosphorylation plays a key role in aldh1a1-mediated aggressive phenotypes.

in parallel, we also analyzed the levels of e-cadherin, n-cadherin, cd <dig>  vimentin, mmp- <dig>  slug, and snail in bxpc <dig> cells treated either with dmso control or mln <dig>  aurka inhibition reduced the levels of n-cadherin, cd <dig>  vimentin, mmp- <dig>  slug, and snail, but increased e-cadherin levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines . these findings further underscored a key role of aurka in promoting emt in pancreatic cancer, presumably by modulating aldh1a <dig> levels and activity.

we next conducted a sphere-forming assay to gauge the self-renewal capacity of bxpc <dig>  aldh1a1-bxpc <dig>  and 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells using ultralow attachment conditions. under these conditions, cancer stem cells grow in suspension and form independent spheres or colonies. as shown in fig. 8d, parental bxpc <dig> mainly formed aggregates of cells with no pancreatosphere formation. in contrast, overexpression of aldh1a <dig> induced large pancreatosphere formation, confirming that aldh1a <dig> overexpression causes the csc phenotype. importantly, 3a-aldh1a1-bxpc <dig> cells also showed no pancreatosphere formation, thereby confirming that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> is crucial for inducing the csc phenotype.

aldh1a <dig> phosphorylation contributes to drug resistance
as both emt and csc contribute to drug resistance, we examined doxorubicin sensitivity in bxpc <dig> cells, which revealed about 50% loss in cell viability in 72 h at 1 μm concentration . expression of wild-type aldh1a <dig> in bxpc <dig> rendered these cells significantly resistant to doxorubicin , whereas 3a-aldh1a <dig> expression conferred high sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced toxicity  . these findings suggest that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> considerably contributes to the drug resistance observed in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . these results led us to investigate whether ablation of aurka sensitizes bxpc <dig> cells to aldh1a <dig> inhibition. we used n,n-diethylaminobenzaldehyde  to inhibit aldh1a <dig>  although it is not very selective and inhibits other aldh isozymes as well. as shown in fig. 8f, aurka-depleted cells exhibit higher sensitivity to aldh1a <dig> inhibition compared to scrambled shrna-expressing cells, suggesting that targeting the aurka-aldh1a <dig> axis is likely to be more effective than individually targeting either aurka or aldh1a <dig> 

to test this hypothesis, we treated bxpc <dig> cells with 100 μm deab for 24 h, which showed minimal toxicity, suggesting inhibition of aldh1a <dig> alone does not confer toxicity to cells . in contrast, aurka inhibition showed ~32% and ~35% loss in cell viability at  <dig> and  <dig>  μm mln <dig> concentrations, respectively. more importantly, co-inhibition of aldh1a <dig> and aurka was highly effective, particularly, at  <dig>  μm mln <dig> concentration, which showed more than 65% loss in cell viability. these findings underscore the significance of the aurka-aldh1a <dig> feedback activation loop in pancreatic carcinoma and suggest that concurrent inhibition of aurka and aldh1a <dig> is likely to be highly effective in targeting highly chemoresistant pdac .

discussion
aldh1a <dig> is a cytosolic enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of various aldehydes including trans- and cis-retinal to their corresponding less reactive acids, thereby aiding the cell in detoxifying these compounds. aldh1a <dig> also binds to endobiotics and xenobiotics and possesses antioxidant activity  <cit> . aldh1a <dig> is highly expressed in normal stem cells, but is also widely used as a marker to identify and isolate various types of cscs. aldh1a <dig> level and activity are upregulated in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are associated with extreme chemoresistance and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer and beyond. thus, there is a critical need to develop therapies that target aldh1a <dig> alone or in combination to eliminate these “stem cell-like” tumor cells in pancreatic and other types of cancer.

while several studies have shown increased mrna or protein levels of aldh1a <dig> in different cancers, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. there is no report that shows phosphorylation-dependent regulation of aldh1a <dig> to date. we show that aurka directly phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> at t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  which stabilizes aldh1a <dig>  aldh1a <dig> also stabilizes aurka levels by inhibiting its ubiquitylation, thereby triggering a reciprocal feedback activation loop. interestingly, each of the three sites contributes towards aldh1a <dig> stability. furthermore, ectopic expression of phospho-resistant aldh1a <dig> prevents the promoter activation of slug, snail, cd <dig>  and n-cadherin while simultaneously failing to repress e-cadherin promoter, suggesting that inhibition of aurka-mediated phosphorylation impairs its transcriptional activity. importantly, ectopic expression of phospho-resistant aldh1a <dig> not only fully inhibits aldh1a1-mediated oncogenic pathways, but even reduces the basal levels of snail, slug, n-cadherin, vimentin, mmp- <dig>  and cd <dig> in bxpc <dig> cells, highlighting a vital role of aurka in aldh1a1-mediated signaling in cancer cells.

we also show that aurka-mediated phosphorylation at the t <dig> site increases aldh1a <dig> activity. recent global phospho-proteomics analysis studies indeed observed increased phosphorylation at the t <dig> site on aldh1a <dig> in human colorectal cancer and non-small lung cancer tissues  <cit> ; however, the kinase responsible remains unknown. similarly, han et al. reported increased phosphorylation at t <dig> on aldh1a <dig> in human liver tissues  <cit> . aldh1a <dig> is highly expressed in the liver and is crucial for the prevention of dietary retinol-induced liver toxicity  <cit> , suggesting that aurka-mediated increase in aldh1a <dig> levels and activity may also be essential for normal tissues which require high aldh1a <dig> activity. thus, these studies not only underscore the clinical significance of aurka-mediated regulation of aldh1a <dig> in several cancers, but also highlight that the aurka-aldh1a <dig> axis may have an important role in normal tissue homeostasis.

furthermore, our study showed that aurka phosphorylates aldh1a <dig> at t <dig>  which is located within its oligomerization domain. aldh1a <dig> exists as a tetramer, which is a dimer of a dimer . however, the relative enzymatic activities of its monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric forms still remain unclear. one study reported that heating of aldh1a <dig> increases the conversion of the dimeric form to the monomeric form, which is associated with decreased activity, although this study did not analyze the activity of the tetrameric form of aldh1a <dig>  <cit> . class ii aldh enzymes, such as aldh <dig>  display half-of-the-sites reactivity in tetrameric form, which can assume full reactivity depending on the ph or in the presence of divalent cations. accordingly, increasing the mg2+ concentration from  <dig> to  <dig>  mm resulted in a two-fold increase in horse liver aldh <dig> activity which was accompanied by the dissociation of tetrameric enzyme into dimers  <cit> . similarly, with increasing ph, the tetrameric aldh <dig> enzyme dissociated to the more active dimeric state even in the absence of mg2+ ions  <cit> . these findings suggest that class ii aldhs display higher activity in the dimeric state; however, it is not known whether aldh1a <dig>  displays similar kinetics in the dimeric and tetrameric states. furthermore, the activity of a class i aldh such as aldh1a <dig> is inhibited in the presence of mg2+, suggesting that class i and class ii aldhs are regulated differently. to date, no study has investigated phosphorylation as a potential mechanism which governs these reported changes in aldh1a1’s oligomeric state and enzymatic activity.

our data show that aurka-mediated phosphorylation of aldh1a <dig> shifts the total population to its monomeric form, which harbors higher dehydrogenase activity relative to the tetramer. surprisingly, unlike class ii aldh, we did not observe substantial dimeric species in either the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated state. it is likely that in cells, the monomeric phosphorylated form may be re-incorporated into high order oligomers to form the active tetramer when aldh1a <dig> levels are high. alternatively, the cells may keep aldh1a <dig> activity in check by storing excess enzyme in the less active tetrameric form, which is capable of readily dissociating to form the highly active phospho-monomer for rapid temporal response. while future studies are needed to uncover this mechanism, the phospho-oligomeric regulation of aldh1a <dig> could be exploited as a novel therapeutic intervention.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we unraveled a novel mechanism of aldh1a <dig> regulation that is triggered by aurka. while extreme chemoresistance and csc formation are the defining features of pancreatic cancer, the mechanism by which aurka may be involved in these processes has not been examined. our discovery of aldh1a <dig> as an aurka substrate provides a novel mechanism by which aurka promotes chemoresistance and stem cell formation in pancreatic cancer via aldh1a <dig> and vice versa. thus, targeting aurka and aldh1a <dig> in combination is expected to be highly effective in inhibiting tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, and metastasis in highly lethal pancreatic carcinoma. furthermore, analysis of aldh1a <dig> phosphorylation levels should aid in the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for identifying patients with suitable molecular phenotypes for maximal therapeutic benefit, avoiding treatment of unresponsive patients and improving overall quality of life.
