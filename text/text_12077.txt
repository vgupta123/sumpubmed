BACKGROUND
the development of dna microarrays or "chips" has greatly increased the rate at which genomic data can be gathered. this highly-parallel technology has enabled thousands of genes or tens of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms  to be recovered in a single experiment  <cit> . most such arrays have been designed to assay variation within single species, such as drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  or humans, either among tissues . variant detector arrays  measure not gene expression, but rather to variation in single-nucleotide polymorphism  among samples of interest  <cit> . vdas rely on the ability of a ssdna in the experimental sample to recognize and bind to its perfect oligonucleotide complement. a refinement of vda microarrays is to evaluate, not just known snps, but all potential snps within a particular gene region. as developed by affymetrix for their "genechip" protocols  <cit> , a reference dna sequence is represented on the microarray as a series of overlapping 25-base oligonucleotides , one for each position in the sequence. for each oligo, three additional variant oligos are included, each of which varies the central  base. all possible snp variants of a reference sequence of length n are thus represented on the microarray by a set of  <dig> × n oligonucleotides. an experimental sequence with any particular snp variant in this quartet will hybridize with greatest fidelity to its exact complement, as indicated by the relative intensities of each of the probes bound at that position  <cit> . this procedure has been dubbed "resequencing," since it re-reads multiple homologous sequences in comparison with the reference sequence.

over the past  <dig> years, studies of mtdna have been extraordinarily successful in clarifying evolutionary relationships within and among species, due to a number of useful properties, including maternal inheritance, high rate of sequence evolution, and lack of recombination  <cit> . gene order is broadly conserved across diverse vertebrate taxa. recent comparative studies of multiple complete mtdna genomes, both within  <cit>  and among species  <cit> , have demonstrated the power of genomics to investigate phenomena of intra- and interspecific population biology and evolution based on well-resolved, highly-corroborated gene trees  <cit> . the mtdna genome has also been implicated in a number of human biomedical conditions  <cit> .

one of the first applications of mtdna to the study of evolution was an evaluation of the tempo and mode of molecular evolution of higher primates  <cit> . studies of mtdna and other genetic macromolecules have now established that the closest relatives of humans  are chimpanzees  and the pygmy chimp or bonobo ), with which we share a common ancestor ~ <dig> mybp  <cit> . the next closest relatives of chimps and humans are gorillas , from which the chimp/human lineage diverged perhaps  <dig> mybp  <cit> . levels of mtdna genome diversity vary among hominoid primate species, and are apparently lowest in homo  <cit> , due in part to our quite recent emergence "out of africa." common chimpanzees have a more polymorphic mitochondrial genome than humans, and variability within the mountain gorilla is as high as that between the two pan species  <cit> . the greater diversity of apes in comparison with humans may be due to their historically more fragmented populations, differences in male and female migration, or directional selection  <cit> . there is now extensive interest in comparing the genetic material of humans and their closest relatives. the nuclear genome sequences of chimps and humans are more than 98% similar, and the focus of investigation is those differences that contribute to the uniqueness of the human species  <cit> .

we investigated the efficiency and accuracy of microarray resequencing where experimental and microarray reference sequences are from different species, and the influence of the degree of sequence divergence on that performance. we use a human-specific mitochondrial dna array  <cit>  to resequence the homologous genomes of another human, as well as our two closest relatives, chimpanzee and gorilla, and a distant relative, atlantic cod . we compare these results to those obtained by conventional dideoxy sequencing. these experiments explore the limits of interspecies in silico hybridization, and in so doing contribute to the design and use of resequencing arrays for the study of intra- and interspecific population genomic evolution  <cit> .

RESULTS
dideoxy reference sequences
the reference microarray included  <dig> bp of the revised cambridge reference sequence   <cit> , without the d-loop region. dideoxy sequencing identified  <dig> interspecific snps in the chimpanzee sequence as compared to this sequence. the sequence divergence is  <dig> % between the two genomes. snp density varied from  <dig> to  <dig> polymorphisms per  <dig> bases over the genome . in the gorilla, there were  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms, for an sequence divergence of  <dig> % between the two genomes. as in the chimpanzee genome, snp density was not uniform and varied from  <dig> to  <dig> per  <dig> bases . snp densities per  <dig> bp  are given in table  <dig>  these range from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a mode of  <dig> in both species.

for the human comparison, we used an individual whose mtdna genome sequence was known to differ from the tiled reference sequence by  <dig> snps  in the region sequenced here  <cit> .

comparison with microarray sequencing
results of the chimpanzee and gorilla microarray sequencing experiments are presented as  <dig> ×  <dig> tables in which calls of "snp" or "non-snp" by the microarray are classified as correct or incorrect in comparison with the known dideoxy reference sequence, which is taken as canonical. in the small number of cases where the dideoxy sequence traces might be regarded as ambiguous, the microarray confirmed the calls made a priori. we define efficiency as the overall proportion of bases called correctly by the microarray with respect to the canonical sequence, whether variable or not. we define accuracy as the proportion of known interspecific snps correctly identified with respect to the tiled microarray reference sequence each of these four classes of calls may be further classified as of high or low confidence, for a total of eight classes . confidence in any call can be described as the ratio of the highest signal intensity to alternative signals, calculated as a differential signal-to-noise ratio  as defined in methods. we describe as "high-confidence" calls those made at ds/n greater than a designated cut-off. these may be either correct or incorrect . for "low-confidence" calls, made with respect to a canonical sequence taken as a "null hypothesis", those that match that sequence are counted as correct, and those that do not are counted as "n". considered without respect to such a sequence, all low-confidence calls are counted as "n".

efficiency is the proportion of snp and non-snp sites identified correctly as compared with the canonical dideoxy sequence, either at high or low efficiency. accuracy is the proportion of snps identified correctly. correct and erroneous calls may be made at either high or low confidence, differentiated by ds/n=  <dig>  . the table is equivalent to a conventional  <dig> ×  <dig> contingency table, with the categories on the second line transposed. this arrangement emphasizes the column totals of correct versus incorrect calls, and the assignment of low-confidence incorrect calls as ns, in tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

the content and arrangement of the cells in these tables therefore differs from conventional  <dig> ×  <dig> contingency tables, so as to emphasize the computation of correct, incorrect, and 'n' calls. the inclusion of an 'n' category also makes a conventional roc analysis problematic. it is important to appreciate that accurate identification of snps sites  is a more important criterion of success than the total number of correct calls, including non-snp sites , because the latter do not contribute informative data to phylogenetic analysis. for example, given  <dig> sites with  <dig> snps, the correct identification of all  <dig> snps along with  <dig> invariant sites and  <dig> 'n's is a more desirable outcome than correct identification of  <dig> snps along with  <dig> snp erros,  <dig> invariant sites, and  <dig> 'n's, even though the conventional accuracy rates are 90% and 99%, respectively.

among six human mtdna genomes resequenced on a human-specific microarray, an empirical cut-off rule of ds/n =  <dig>  allowed exclusion of all spurious snps, and correct identification of all known snps  <cit> . for the two primate resequencing experiments, we plotted the number of incorrect snp calls made with various ds/n cut-offs between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . in pan, error rates are < 1% at ds/n =  <dig>  or greater, and are markedly greater at ds/n =  <dig>   than at ds/n =  <dig>  . we therefore use ds/n =  <dig>  as the cut-off for high- and low-confidence calls in this study.

efficiency and accuracy of microarray sequencing
with reference to the known dideoxy sequence, resequencing efficiency of the human mtdna was  <dig> %, including  <dig> % and  <dig> % of calls at high and low confidence, respectively . all  <dig> known snps were identified,  <dig> at high confidence .

with reference to their known sequences, resequencing efficiencies of the chimpanzee and gorilla mtdnas were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . of  <dig> known chimpanzee snps,  <dig> % were correctly identified , and  <dig> % were errors at low-confidence that were counted as "n" s. there were  <dig> % high-confidence errors. of  <dig> known gorilla snps,  <dig> % were called correctly , and  <dig> % were "n" s. there were  <dig> % high-confidence errors.

without reference to the known dideoxy sequences, as would be the case for de novo microarray sequencing of an unknown genome, low-confidence calls cannot be assigned a priori as either correct or incorrect. then, in the chimpanzee,  <dig> % of calls were correct at high-confidence,  <dig> % were "n" s. there were  <dig> % errors as before, and only  <dig> % of snps were identified with high confidence. in the gorilla,  <dig> % of calls were correct at high confidence,  <dig> % were "n" s. there were  <dig> % errors, and only  <dig> % of snps were identified with high confidence.

the lower absolute efficiency and rate of snp detection in the chimpanzee experiment as compared to that with the gorilla reflect lower probe intensities in the former. to compare interspecies efficiency and accuracy more directly, analysis of  <dig> homologous positions called at high confidence in both species indicated a  <dig> % error rate in the chimpanzee as compared with  <dig> % in the gorilla. of  <dig> chimpanzee snp sites in this subset,  <dig> % were correctly identified, as compared with  <dig> % of  <dig> snp sites in the gorilla genome tables .

effect of snp density on efficiency, accuracy, and probe intensity
in the chimpanzee experiment, correct high-confidence calls were made at a mean snp density of  <dig> % . incorrect, high confidence calls occurred at snp densities of  <dig>  ~ <dig>  %. correct, low-confidence calls occurred in regions with approximately 11% snp density, above which, low confidence, incorrect calls occurred . snp densities in the gorilla followed the same general trends: correct high-confidence calls occurred at snp densities <  <dig> %. incorrect, high-confidence calls occurred at snp densities of  <dig>  to  <dig> %. low confidence, correct calls occurred in regions with  <dig>  to  <dig> % snp density, above which, low confidence, incorrect calls occurred .

miscall rates ranged from  <dig> ~ <dig> per  <dig> bps in the chimpanzee and from  <dig> ~ <dig> per  <dig> bps in gorilla, the majority of which were found at low confidence in both experiments . the density of snps between the chimpanzee or gorilla and human genomes is positively correlated with the number of miscalls between these pairs. that is, as interspecific sequence divergence increases, so does the degree of miscalling and the errors observed in the microarray resequencing relative to the dideoxy sequencing.

resequencing of atlantic cod mtdna
resequencing of mtdna from atlantic cod  on the human microarray generally produced extremely low probe intensities and ds/n values . the experiment identified  <dig> regions of >  <dig> contiguous bases called at high confidence, including one region of  <dig> bp that differed by only three mismatches between human and cod. the  <dig> bp correctly resequenced in these regions correspond to  <dig> % of the cod genome.

discussion
efficiency and accuracy of interspecies resequencing
microarray resequencing of human mtdna sequences that differ by << 1% from the tiled human reference approach 100% efficiency and accuracy. microarray resequencing of chimpanzee and gorilla dna sequences, which differ by  <dig> and 10% from the tiled human sequence, recovers ~85% of those sequences, with < 2% error. considered without respect to the known reference sequences, as would be the case if these were new individuals from the same species sequenced for the first time, efficiency of high-confidence sequence recovery falls to 67% in chimpanzee and to 50% in gorilla. within this subset, overall error rates remain < 2%, however, accuracy of snp identification falls from > 98% in chimpanzee to < 80% in gorilla.

in resequencing closely-related humans whose pairwise sequence differences are << 1%, it is possible to adopt the null hypothesis that any site is invariant with respect to the tiled reference sequence, unless there is good evidence to the contrary. for example, among persons of european ancestry studied by ingman et al.  <cit> , the greatest pairwise difference in the  <dig> bp region studied is  <dig> snps and is typically less than  <dig> . the ds/n can then be calculated as the difference between the strongest combined probe intensity and the reference base at any position  <cit> . under these constraints, overall efficiency is extremely high, and high-confidence false-negative errors are rare to non-existent. low-confidence false-positive errors are more common, the rate being determined by the ds/n criterion adopted. in contrast, there are  <dig> and  <dig> snp differences, respectively, between the experimental chimpanzee and gorilla genomes sequenced here and their corresponding ncbi references  <cit> , such that those references do not provide reliable null hypotheses. then, one must rely on a confidence criterion to include or exclude putative snps, with consequent loss of information and/or accuracy

decline in efficiency is log-linear with respect to sequence divergence . extrapolation of the curve indicates that efficiency of sequence recovery would approach zero at ~20% observed sequence divergence. such a divergence is typical of inter-ordinal or inter-class comparisons among vertebrate animals  <cit> . some regions of the mtdna are highly conserved evolutionarily, e.g., the 12s and 16s rdna genes  <cit> . the cod resequencing experiment identified one contiguous tract of  <dig> bp in the 16s rdna locus, within which there are only three nucleotide substitutions between primates and fish. these regions appear to be monomorphic within species or among closely related species  <cit> .

thus, microarray resequencing of experimental dna genomes that diverge on average less than ~10% from the reference is able to recover a large part of the target sequence correctly. however, many of these calls are made at low confidence. the error rate is relatively low, but errors are more common at interspecies snp sites than elsewhere, and the error rate increases sharply with the small added sequence divergence from chimpanzee to gorilla. errors occur more or less uniformly over a wide range of probe intensities and confidence values. an increase in the stringency of the confidence criterion beyond a certain point does not increase accuracy, and only excludes more of the data .

influence of snp density on efficiency and accuracy
in a microarray experiment, the presence of a snp in an experimental sequence affects not only its binding to the oligo quartet tiling the corresponding position, but also to the  <dig> additional quartets in the  <dig> bp on either side of the snp position. among these  <dig> oligos, only one will match the target perfectly,  <dig> will mismatch at one position , and  <dig> will mismatch at two positions. thus, reduced probe binding strength is expected on either side of a snp, even at invariant sites. we typically observed ns within a few bp of isolated snps. in human mtdna, snps are typically spaced at 100s of bp with respect to the tiled reference, and are frequently associated with runs of lower-confidence ns  <cit> . regions in the ape genomes where snps are spaced >  <dig> bp apart are also associated with ns, and are typically called correctly and at high confidence. runs of ns are associated with interspecific snps among higher primates resequenced on a human nuclear brca-specific microarray  <cit> , where the snp density is much lower than in mtdna  <cit> .

where two snps occur within the  <dig> bp region covered by a particular snp-specific oligo quartet, probe binding is affected at intermediate invariant positions. the pattern is specific and predictable. consider two snps at an interval of  <dig> b, where one oligo quartet tiles one invariant position exactly  <dig> bp from either snp. all four oligos in this set will have mismatches at their terminal  positions, and three of four have an internal mismatch at the central  position. binding and probe intensity will be severely reduced by these two or three mismatches, in comparison to the two adjacent positions, where only one or two mismatches occur. where snps are spaced  <dig> <n # 25b apart, the interference will extend to  oligo quartets tiling the intermediate positions . in the ape data, we typically observe low probe intensity at all positions between two snps that occur within 25b. precise patterns for any given oligo will be influenced by other factors, such as  content and distribution.

multiple snps in the 25b region tiled by the oligo quartet further destabilize binding, and extensive tracts of ns and miscalls are common. the data in tables  <dig> & <dig> suggest some general guidelines, when snp densities are expressed as expected numbers of snp differences between experimental dna and tiled oligo target, as in table  <dig>  high-confidence, accurate calls occur where the experimental sequence differs from the tiled array by  <dig> ~ <dig> snps per 25b oligo, as is the case for about 67% and 54% of chimpanzee and gorilla genomes, respectively. at differences of  <dig> ~ <dig> snps/oligo, high-confidence incorrect calls are common, which result in positive misidentification of snps; 28% and 34% of the chimpanzee and gorilla genomes fall in this category. at these densities, there is still sufficient sequence similarity for some probe-target hybridization to occur, although not always with accurate results. where there are  <dig> snps/oligo or more , the decreased homology prevents binding with sufficient fidelity to discriminate accurately among snp-specific oligos and generate high-confidence calls. this matches the prediction from figure  <dig>  the remaining 6% and 12% of the two ape genomes are at least as divergent as this from human. in cod, where an average of >  <dig> snps/oligo are expected, more than 95% of the cod mtdna genome binds weakly if at all to the human-specific microarray.

CONCLUSIONS
multi-species resequencing: implications for the "arkchip"
for the primate genomicist, the optimum result of these experiments would have been efficient and accurate interspecific probe-target annealing with performance identical to that obtained within species. however, the goal of the present experiments was not to recover the chimpanzee, gorilla, or cod sequences, but rather to ascertain the limits of specificity of the human microarray. for the non-primate genomicist, the desirable result would be a complete failure of heterologous dna to anneal to the human microarray. in the case of fish mtdna, this is very nearly achieved . this "failure" indicates that it should be possible to tile both mammal and fish mtdna genomes on the same microarray, apply a mixed pool of both species= dnas to the chip, obtain species-specific annealing, and generate efficient and accurate sequences of both, simultaneously.

this is the essential idea behind the arkchip. using the new generation of microarrays that accommodates >  <dig> kbp of reference sequence, we have designed a multispecies tiling that includes the complete forward and reverse sequences of the mtdna genomes  of three mammal species in different orders, three ray-finned fish species in different subclasses, and one bird species. minimum interspecific divergence for these comparisons is > 23% .

although the gorilla was only ~2% more divergent from human than the chimpanzee, the corresponding  <dig> ~4-fold increase in snp identification errors indicates that this degree of divergence is at or beyond the limit the useful limits of interspecies microarray sequencing. the log-linear trend line suggests extinction of usable probe annealing at  <dig> ~20% divergence. it will be useful to define this empirically. for this purpose, our next closest primate relatives are orang-utans  and gibbons   <cit> , followed by old world monkeys   <cit> . at the other end of the scale, mtdna from our ancient cousins, such as homo neanderthalensis  <cit> ), might provide information as to how microarrays perform at less than 8% divergence. alternatively, given the multispecies arkchip, the three species of atlantic wolffish   <cit> , caribou and reindeer   <cit> , and various cod species   <cit>  all provide pairs that are only a few percent divergent.
