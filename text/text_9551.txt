BACKGROUND
the question of how ducks can survive challenge by all low pathogenic avian influenza  and most highly pathogenic avian influenza  infections, yet chickens can only survive lpai, remains an important question due to the economic losses experienced by the poultry industry, the human health implications and the continuing threat of pandemic disease posed by avian viruses. most avian influenza strains are able to infect and replicate in ducks, and are usually asymptomatic and seldom cause disease. of the  <dig> haemagglutinin subtypes of influenza viruses infecting migratory waterfowl, the h <dig> and h <dig> subtypes are unique. after transmission to gallinaceous poultry the h <dig> and h <dig> viruses can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. in ducks and other aquatic birds the low pathogenic h <dig> and h <dig> influenza viruses replicate predominantly in the intestinal tract without any outward clinical signs of infection. after transmission to gallinaceous poultry and acquisition of multiple basic amino acids in the connecting peptide of the haemagglutinin, the viruses become highly pathogenic and replicate systemically in the chicken  <cit> . hpai has proven to be deadly to chickens within a very short time frame post-infection, although lpai only produces mild or no signs of clinical disease  <cit> . ducks on the other hand are able to mount a robust inflammatory response against most hpai  <cit> , although they have shown increased susceptibility to some emerging strains of h5n <dig>  with death resulting in some cases . the difference in pathogenesis seen between ducks and chickens could also be due to the fact that a rapid induction of apoptosis in hpai-infected ducks may be beneficial to the host, whereas delayed apoptosis in chickens may be an advantage for the virus  <cit> .

hpai h5n <dig> remains a concern, with new strains continually evolving and increasing the pandemic threat from this subtype. worryingly, the recently emerged h7n <dig> subtype also poses a risk of being the vector by which a human influenza epidemic occurs. the first human infections by this virus were reported early in  <dig>  and by june  <dig>  the mortality rate was over 30 % - a level still being seen as cases continue to be reported. the world health organization  has identified h7n <dig> as "…an unusually dangerous virus for humans”  <cit> . although not posing an imminent threat, h10n <dig> has also recently been identified as having the potential to spread from birds to humans if the necessary viral mutations occur  <cit> .

viral haemagglutinin binds to cell surface receptors in susceptible host cells. in humans, virus binds to sialic acid α <dig>  6-galactose  linked receptors whereas avian viruses preferentially bind to sialic acid α <dig>  3-galactose  linked receptors  <cit> . saα <dig>  6-gal linked receptors are the predominant type in the trachea of chickens, while duck tracheas contain more saα <dig>  3-gal linked receptors  <cit> . this may be one reason why chickens have the potential to act as an intermediate host for human infection.

the avian response to infection compared to that of humans is also determined by their immune gene repertoire. it is known that birds have a much more compact set of immune-related genes than mammals  <cit> . with the increasing availability of avian genome sequences, it is also becoming apparent that key genes are reportedly missing in some birds, which will affect their host responses to viral infections. these include toll-like receptors  <dig> and  <dig>  that, in humans, recognize ssrna and cpg, respectively  <cit> . interferon-stimulated gene  <dig> , interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  and tnfα are all genes which have not yet been identified in birds  <cit> . when we compare the genomes of chickens and ducks we can also see differences in their immune gene complement. crucially, chickens  appear to be lacking the intracellular receptor for viral ssrna, rig-i   <cit>  and the gene for an important rig-i binding protein, rnf <dig>  <cit> . these differences may also partly explain the differences seen between chickens and ducks in their responses towards avian influenza infections  <cit> .

one family of genes which are known to have a role in limiting influenza infection in mammals is the interferon induced transmembrane protein  family  <cit> . these genes are part of a larger family called the dispanins which have a common double transmembrane domain configuration  <cit> . in humans, ifitm <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been identified. the gene cluster ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are known to have anti-viral function , ifitm <dig> may be involved in bone mineralization and the role of ifitm <dig> is less clear  <cit> . although exactly how they function has not been fully elucidated, ifitm proteins have been found to be enriched in late endosomes and lysosomes and are thought to act before viral membrane fusion occurs  <cit> . human ifitm <dig> has been shown to block viral entry into the host cell  <cit> , with a requirement of the cd <dig> domain for inhibition of the influenza virus  <cit> . until now, most of these genes remained unannotated in the chicken and duck genomes and their role in avian influenza infections was unknown.

to examine the role, if any, of the ifitm gene family we searched for members in the genomes of the chicken, duck and other avian species, performed an in depth molecular phylogenetic analyses to detect positive selection acting on specific codons and then compared the expression of host genes following infection by low and high pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses in ducks and chickens. in this study we examine and compare the expression of innate immune related genes in chickens and ducks after infection with both lpai  and hpai ; these being avian species showing high  and low susceptibility , respectively. we looked at the host immune response and viral replication in the ileum and lung  <dig> and 3 days post infection . hpai viruses replicate primarily in the respiratory tract prior to systemic spread with generalized replication and death, while low pathogenic viruses replicate primarily in the intestinal tract and to a limited extent in the respiratory tract with no apparent disease signs  <cit> . dramatic differences in host responses to avian influenza infection were found in chickens and ducks. in ducks ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are strongly up regulated in response to hpai virus, where little response is seen in chickens. clustering of gene expression profiles suggests ifitm <dig> and  <dig> have an anti-viral response and ifitm <dig> may act before viral membrane fusion occurs and thus blocks viral entry. we also show through molecular phylogenetic analyses that avian ifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. specifically, avian ifitm <dig> shows evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at a site known to restrict avian influenza virus  infection. overexpression of this gene in vitro has been shown to increase the resistance of avian cells to aiv infection  <cit> , probably by a block in membrane fusion, crucial to the entry and further replication of this virus. taken together these results support a model where the ifitm <dig> family and rig-i play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to high and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken and other galliformes.

RESULTS
characterisation of the ifitm genes in the genomes of chicken and duck
the ifitm response to influenza infection has not been examined in vivo in any avian species. we therefore resolved to identify and annotate these genes in the chicken and duck genomes, examine their evolution in vertebrates and determine their expression after infection with either lpai or hpai viruses. this would allow the evolution of the ifitm gene family and their response to influenza infection to be compared with mammals and between chickens and ducks. this analysis would highlight similarities and differences that may be correlated with susceptibility to infection by this group of viruses.

with only the ifitm3-like, ifitm <dig> and part of the ifitm <dig> genes annotated in the chicken genome we had to first identify the genomic locations of other chicken ifitm genes  and identify the orthologous genes on the relevant scaffolds in the sequenced duck genome. the locations of the genes in the chicken genome  were determined to be clustered on chr <dig> as follows: cifitm1: 1592913–1593904; cifitm2: 1598390–1599631; cifitm3: 1596326–1597707; cifitm5: 1600790– <dig> and cifitm10: 13520526– <dig>  the chicken ifitm locus was previously described by smith et al.  <cit>  although the true orthology with mammals was uncertain. with respect to the avian gene nomenclature, ifitm <dig> has been annotated as ‘chifitm3’ by these authors and ifitm <dig> was called ‘chifitm1’.

aside from ifitm <dig>  only partial duck ifitm gene sequences could be identified in the duck genome  using the chicken sequences as probes in any blast homology searches. the complete ifitm <dig> gene was identified in the duck genome using the chicken sequence based on a genewise prediction and the full coding sequence was confirmed by 5’-race. the complete cdna sequences for duck ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> required cloning by 5’-race experiments to complete the 5’-end of each sequence. the ifitm <dig> gene was also confirmed by sequencing of the genomic locus. analysis of the protein sequences using the smart algorithm showed that both the chicken and duck proteins share the same double transmembrane domain structure and the highly conserved cd <dig> domain, as found in other species  <cit>  . comparison of duck and chicken ifitm protein sequences shows varying degrees of sequence identity: ifitm <dig> 40 %, ifitm <dig> 68 %, ifitm <dig> 75 %, ifitm <dig> 92 % and ifitm <dig> 92 %. .

evolutionary relationships of ifitm genes in birds, mammals and amphibians
in mammals the highly conserved ifitm <dig> and  <dig> proteins cluster into distinct evolutionary groups, while a large number of lineage and species-specific gene duplications were observed in the ir-ifitm sub-family; made up of ifitm <dig>   <dig> and 3-like proteins  <cit> . for example, these authors were able to define expansions specific to rodent and primate clades. gene conversion was previously reported in a few species including dog, cow and horse but is not a factor in other species, including birds  <cit> .

in order to study the evolution of the avian ifitm gene family and elucidate gene orthologs with other vertebrates, ifitm coding sequences were collected from avian species based on previously annotated genes or homology searches of the  <dig> avian genomes analysed by the avian phylogenetics consortium using the chicken and duck ifitm sequences as probes . in addition, ifitm sequences from mammals, non-avian reptiles and amphibians were downloaded from genbank  and used to compare with avian homologs.

using conservation of gene order we were able to define 1: <dig> orthologs between the avian and mammalian ir-ifitm gene cluster, and the ifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes. these three groups of ifitm sequences were used to create a multiple sequence alignment  and in the construction of a phylogenetic gene tree . as expected, the ifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes cluster into distinct clades in birds, other non-avian reptiles, mammals and amphibians but the picture for the ir-ifitm gene family was more complex. in birds, the three ir-ifitm genes cluster into three distinct groups of ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences. in mammals, however the genes tend to cluster together within their own species or clades, indicating more recent clade-specific gene expansions, as shown before by zhang et al.  <cit>  making it impossible to define 1: <dig> orthologs between avian and mammalian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and 3-like genes. in an attempt to resolve this issue and define the gene duplication events that gave rise to this family, we prepared a multiple sequence alignment of the ir-ifitm protein family. to increase the power of our analysis we collected ifitm <dig>   <dig> and 3-like peptide sequences from a wide range of vertebrates including birds, non-avian reptiles, mammals and amphibians. after multiple sequence alignment  using muscle, we removed partial, duplicated or highly divergent  peptide sequences, after which  <dig> peptide sequences remained in the final multiple sequence alignment . mrbayes, a bayesian package for inference  <cit> , was used to infer phylogenetic trees from the msa of ifitm1/2/3-like peptide sequences . there appeared to be a single clade of ifitm1-like genes in the amphibians , which suggested an independent origin from birds and mammals. the xenopus sequences were therefore used to root the gene tree. the tree showed strong support for independent ifitm gene duplications in mammals and reptiles. in mammals, as zhang et al.  <cit>  have shown previously, there were a number of clade-specific expansions of this gene family. however in birds, there were only two gene duplications that gave rise to the avian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes. the ifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes appear to have arisen from an avian-specific gene duplication, with only a single ifitm2/3-like gene in non-avian reptiles. the ifitm <dig> gene appears to have arisen from an earlier gene duplication in all reptiles. this bayesian analysis was supported by similar analyses based on maximum likelihood, neighbour-joining and parsimony methods, as implemented in the mega <dig> package  using the jtt + g_i model predicted as the most likely substitution model . these results also show that the structure and function of the avian ifitm <dig> protein family is most likely to share elements of all the human ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins of the ir-ifitm gene cluster.fig.  <dig> bayesian tree of the vertebrate ifitm <dig>   <dig> and 3-like gene family. a bayesian tree was constructed using mrbayes  with  <dig> million generations. branch confidence values are shown at the nodes and coloured using the probability scale on the left. scale bar corresponds to  <dig>  substitutions per site. ifitm <dig> represent the mammalian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and 3-like genes and for simplicity are shown as a triangle. details of the mammalian tree are shown in additional file 7: figure s5d. all the other ifitm genes are derived from avian, non-avian reptiles and amphibians. the species abbreviations are shown on additional file 3: table s <dig>  the dotted circle indicates uncertainty in the split near the root of the tree



positive selection acting on the ifitm subfamilies
in mammals, it is known that the ifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes are highly conserved and the genes of the ir-ifitm gene cluster are more divergent and predicted to be under positive selection  <cit> . we used methods implemented in datamonkey  <cit>  and codeml to investigate whether positive selection has also driven the evolution of the avian ifitm gene family. gene conversion was found in some mammals under species-specific duplication, including dog, cow, horse, etc.  <cit> . these sequences were removed from all subsequent analyses. no gene conversion was found in the avian ifitm gene family members  <cit> .

meme was used to seek evidence of positive selection at sites in the coding sequences of the ifitm gene family . meme is a method implemented within the datamonkey package  <cit>  that can identify both episodic and persistent positive selection because it allows the distribution of the dn/ds ratio to vary from site to site and from branch to branch at a site. in birds, only two genes - ifitm <dig> and  <dig> show sites with strong evidence of positive selection. for ifitm <dig>  most sites  were found in the second transmembrane domain . in addition, one site was found in each of the n-  and c-  termini of the ifitm <dig> peptide. only two sites  were predicted to show persistent positive selection in all avian branches. most sites showed evidence of episodic positive selection in one  or a few species . these results were supported by fubar  <cit> , which detected persistent sites of positive selection at codons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  also detected by meme . no significant sites were found using codeml for ifitm <dig> , suggesting most were episodic sites. the other gene, ifitm <dig>  was predicted to have fewer positively selected sites , in one  or more species . again, the transmembrane tm <dig> domain contained most sites . codeml predicted two additional sites of persistent positive selection in both ifitm <dig> and  <dig>  . these results suggest that the tm <dig> domain is likely to be important in recognition of pathogen-associated lipids. of great interest was positive selection at codon  <dig>  in ducks, at a site known to restrict influenza viruses  <cit> .table  <dig> positively selected sites in ir-ifitm genes detected using meme method implemented in datamonkey

this summary table reports the distribution of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates over sites inferred by the meme model, where the proportion of branches with β > α is significantly greater than 0; p-value is derived using a mixture of χ <dig> distributions, **p-value <  <dig> ; *p-value <  <dig> 



transcriptomic analysis of host-responses to lpai and hpai viruses
with a view to analysing the in vivo expression of the ifitm genes after influenza infection in chicken and in duck, transcriptomic sequencing experiments were undertaken. this not only allowed us to determine the profile of ifitm gene expression, but also defined the host innate immune response after influenza infection in each species and allowed a comparison between species to be made. since lpai viruses from ducks are the ultimate source of hpai viruses in chickens we used a lpai h5n <dig> and a hpai h5n <dig> strain to examine the host response to each class of influenza virus. this study involved the use of two different tissues known to be targets of viral infection  in three different conditions  at two different time points , which would allow us to study the host response in each species. differential expression of genes was thus determined for  <dig> different experimental scenarios in each of duck and chicken, as outlined in table  <dig>  with the main interest being on the differences that would be seen between duck and chicken. the numbers of genes regarded as significantly differentially expressed, fdr < <dig>  and which have a fold-change > <dig>  are listed. additional file 11: table s <dig> presents the significantly differentially expressed  genes in the  <dig> comparisons for each of chicken and duck tissues.table  <dig> number of differentially expressed genes in duck and chicken in each condition tested

virology and pathogenesis of host-responses to lpai and hpia viruses
the lpai h5n <dig> virus  was not adapted to chickens and required  <dig> egg infectious doses of virus to infect 50 %  of birds. nevertheless in the infected chickens the virus replicated to moderate titres in the lungs  and higher titres in the ileum  and caused no disease signs. in ducks the lpai h5n <dig> replicated to low titres in the lungs  and higher titres in the ileum  with no disease signs. in contrast, as little as  <dig> eid <dig> of the hpai h5n <dig>  killed all inoculated chickens between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. despite 100 % mortality we detected virus in only 1/ <dig> birds  <dig> dpi. ducks were infected with 106eid <dig> of hpai h5n1; the virus replicated to high titres in the lungs and ileum and 6/ <dig> ducks died between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. viral doses were chosen to reflect earlier studies  <cit> .

the chicken host response to avian influenza infection
knowing that chickens react very differently to lpai  and hpai  viruses, it was expected that very different gene expression profiles would be seen after each infection. from the numbers of de genes , it can be seen that the chicken mounts a large response to h5n <dig> in the ileum by  <dig> dpi . however, this is short-lived and is gone by  <dig> dpi. this response against h5n <dig> is not reflected in the lung. the highly pathogenic h5n <dig> appears to prove too much for the chicken - the response seen early in the ileum is not sustained, and the birds succumb to the disease. a strong response is seen in the lung by  <dig> dpi, after h5n <dig> infection. the ileum is not particularly affected by h5n <dig> infection and the robust response seen in the lung is obviously able to counter the effects of the virus, stop further spread, and the chicken is able to survive the lpai infection.

in order to examine which biological pathways are involved during the chicken response, the de genes in ileum at  <dig> dpi during h5n <dig> infection and in the lung at  <dig> dpi during h5n <dig> infection were analysed. additional file 12: tables s7a and 7b show pathways which are significantly enriched in de genes from ileum and lung, respectively. along with processes such as antigen processing and phosphatidylinositol signalling, it can be seen that genes involved in axon guidance are perturbed during h5n <dig> infection in the ileum and b- and t-cell receptor signalling is activated in the lung against h5n <dig>  additional file 13: figure s <dig> shows the genes being activated/inhibited in these pathways. the highlighted genes are also involved in natural killer cell activation, which is a process which will be occurring during the early response.

the molecular function of the genes involved during the early response to h5n <dig> infection in the ileum is seen to be significantly represented by genes involved in lipid concentration and transport . host cell lipids are important during influenza infection as they make up the bilayer of the virus carrying the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins and the matrix protein. lipid rafts play an important role in the life cycle of the virus, including infection, assembly and budding. lipid rafts are also important in the transport and assembly of viral components as well as in budding and virus release  <cit> . the significance of the t- and b-cell response in the chicken can be seen during the host response to h5n <dig> infection in the lung at  <dig> dpi. some of the most up-regulated genes include t-cell markers, cd8b, cd <dig>  cd3e and cd <dig>  along with cd79b which codes for part of the b-cell receptor complex and cxcr <dig> which is involved in b-cell migration. fig. 2b shows the canonical pathways significantly affected during the chicken host response to h5n <dig>  one of the most perturbed biological networks  is that of cell death, cell signalling and the inflammatory response.fig.  <dig> ingenuity pathway analysis of the chicken response to hpai infection in the ileum at  <dig> dpi and lpai infection in the lung at  <dig> dpi. a molecular functions of genes responding to hpai in the ileum at 1dpi. b biological pathways which are significantly altered during the host response to lpai in the lung at 3dpi. in each case p <  <dig> . c differential gene regulation in a biological network concerned with lipid metabolism . d genes differentially expressed in the cell death, cell signalling and inflammatory response network . up-regulated genes  and down-regulated genes . the deeper the colour, the higher the level of differential expression



the data was also analysed for enrichment of biological parameters such as gene ontology  terms, chromosomal location and the presence of transcription factor binding sites . examination of the genes up-regulated in response to h5n <dig> in the ileum at 1dpi shows a significant representation of genes involved in metabolic processes and lipid binding . genes being down-regulated are over-represented by genes involved in axon guidance, generation of neurons and in the regulation of neurogenesis . this effect on genes involved in neuron development confirms earlier reports of alzheimer-like effects in mice infected with h5n <dig>  <cit>  and possible association with parkinsonism  <cit> . it also ties in with recent reports of brain damage caused by h7n <dig> in humans  <cit> .

in response to h5n <dig> infection in the lung, significantly represented go terms within up-regulated genes include protein binding, immune system processes, signal transduction, leukocyte activation, and cytokine binding. the up-regulated genes also show an enrichment of binding sites for the transcription factors elf <dig> and etv <dig>  elf <dig> is known to be required for the t-cell-receptor-mediated trans-activation of hiv- <dig> gene expression. it also activates the lyn and blk promoters. lyn and blk both play important roles in the b-cell response. etv <dig> is known to bind to the enhancer of the adenovirus e1a gene, activate matrix metalloproteinase genes and be associated with invasion and metastasis of tumour cells.

interestingly, within the  <dig> chicken lung replicates which were infected with h5n <dig>  only  <dig> samples showed the presence of virus when tested. all  <dig> samples showed a vigorous, tightly-correlated immune response. we therefore compared the  <dig> samples showing viral titre with the other sample, which was able to clear the virus. clustering the data allowed us to highlight a particular group of genes which were more strongly expressed in the non-viral samples. functional analysis of these genes showed them to be very immune-specific. many of the genes were immunoglobulin genes and genes found on the surface of immune cells . this would indicate that these particular birds were able to prevent virus from actually entering the lung tissue by means of increasing expression of genes such as ptprc, cd <dig>  cd3e, cd8b, ctla <dig>  tnfrsf13c, cd79b, il2rg, cd <dig>  itga <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> 

the duck host response to avian influenza infection
the response to influenza infection in the duck is seen to be quite different from that of the chicken. the low pathogenic h5n <dig> virus barely elicits much of an immune response at all with the peak number of genes expressing at  <dig> dpi in the ileum . this reflects how ducks are unperturbed by lpai infection and suggests they may be able to somehow block the virus before it enters the cell. upon infection with h5n <dig>  the duck mounts a robust innate response, with large numbers of genes significantly differentially expressed in both lung and ileum. the response in the ileum increases from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi whereas in the lung, a large response is already underway  <dig> dpi and is maintained through  <dig> dpi. this differential response to h5n <dig> and h5n <dig> viruses confirms previous results by vanderven et al.  <cit> .

the biological pathways involved in the duck response to h5n <dig> infection  were examined as described above for the chicken. during the early response to hpai infection in the ileum, the tlr pathway is seen to be significantly activated . in the lung at  <dig> dpi, genes involved in the extra-cellular-matrix, focal adhesion, and adherens junctions are highly down-regulated, while genes involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration are up-regulated. interestingly, genes associated with cancer-related processes are also seen to be activated/inhibited . additional file 16: tables s8a and b show all the pathways responding significantly in the duck ileum and lung respectively.

pathway analysis also shows the effect of hpai on hepatic stellate cells or lipocytes. the role of rig-i   <cit>  is highlighted along with that of pattern recognition receptors , indicating activation of tlr1la, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  we have previously shown tlr1la to be activated during the host response to marek’s disease virus  <cit> . levels of tlr <dig> are increased by heat shock proteins and various cellular factors produced during infection, while the ligand for tlr <dig> is ssrna, of which the h5n <dig> genome is comprised. irf, il <dig>  il <dig> and il17a signalling are all also up-regulated, indicating a robust cytokine response . some of the most highly up-regulated genes seen during the duck host response to h5n <dig> include rsad <dig>  which encodes an interferon-inducible antiviral protein involved in tlr7-dependent production of ifnb, mx <dig> which is known to have antiviral activity against avian influenza and ddx <dig>  which encodes a pattern recognition receptor for viruses. the two main biological networks observed in the duck host response are those concerned with inflammatory response  and haematopoiesis .fig.  <dig> ingenuity pathway analysis of the duck response to hpai infection in the ileum at  <dig> dpi and in the lung at  <dig> dpi. a biological pathways which are significantly altered during the host response to hpai in the ileum at 1dpi. b biological pathways which are significantly altered during the host response to hpai in the lung at 3dpi. in each case p <  <dig> . c differential gene regulation in a biological network concerned with the inflammatory response network . d differential expression of genes involved in haematopoiesis . red represents up-regulated genes and green down-regulated genes. the deeper the colour, the higher the level of differential expression



enrichment analysis of the genes involved in the duck response to h5n <dig>  shows that the over-represented go terms within up-regulated genes include signal transduction, response to stimulus, and cell communication while the down-regulated genes represent those involved in ion binding and cell structural organization. examination of chromosomal location indicated a strong representation of genes from chr <dig> amongst those up-regulated. an enrichment of the nf-κb tfbs was also identified within the up-regulated genes. nf-κb is known to have a central role to regulation of the immune response.

comparison of chicken and duck host responses to lpai and hpai viruses
in the ileum at  <dig> dpi, both chickens and ducks mounted a fairly large response to infection with h5n <dig>  in chicken there were  <dig> unique, annotated genes which were up-regulated in response to h5n <dig> and  <dig> genes which were down regulated . in duck there were  <dig> unique, annotated genes up-regulated in response to h5n <dig> and  <dig> genes down-regulated . fig. 4a shows how these genes overlap in each response. only  <dig> genes were commonly up-regulated in both duck and chicken , and only  <dig> commonly down-regulated .fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing shared and unique responses to ai infection in duck and chicken. a chicken response to h5n <dig> infection in the ileum at  <dig> dpi is compared to that of the duck. b chicken response to h5n <dig> infection in the lung at  <dig> dpi is compared with the duck response to high path infection in the lung at  <dig> dpi



with the largest immune response in the lung being against h5n <dig> in chicken and against h5n <dig> in duck, it was decided to compare the genes being expressed in the lung at  <dig> dpi for each infection scenario. in chicken there were  <dig> unique, annotated genes which were up-regulated in response to h5n <dig> and  <dig> genes which were down regulated . in duck there were  <dig> unique, annotated genes up-regulated in response to h5n <dig> and  <dig> genes down-regulated . fig. 4b shows how these genes overlap in each response. as can be seen, only  <dig> genes were commonly up-regulated in both duck and chicken and only  <dig> commonly down-regulated. both these comparisons show that the largest part of the early response to influenza infection is unique to each species.

the genes responding uniquely in each host were examined further. comparing the host-specific responses to h5n <dig> infection in the ileum at  <dig> dpi we see that the chicken response focuses on b-cell activation and lipid metabolism. the duck, on the other hand, is expressing genes involved in the differentiation of t-cells, cell death, and the activation of interferon’s and cytokines. in the lung at  <dig> dpi, the unique chicken response to h5n <dig> is overwhelmingly concerned with t- and b-cell development and activation and cell death, whereas the genes expressed uniquely in duck upon h5n <dig> infection are all concerned with pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the rig-i and tlr pathways .

gene expression profiles of ifitm subfamily members suggest specific roles in host responses towards avian influenza infections
availability of transcriptomic data now allowed investigation of the ifitm gene expression response during lpai and hpai infection in both duck and chicken. study of ifitm gene expression after both h5n <dig> and h5n <dig> infection has allowed us to see a completely different host response in each species . in chicken there is a very limited ifitm response. the only gene expression seen is in the ileum  <dig> dpi after h5n <dig> infection, where ifitm <dig> is seen to decrease slightly  and ifitm <dig> increases 2-fold. the duck, on the other hand, is seen to mount a robust ifitm reaction to influenza infection. in response to low path infection, the duck increases expression of both ifitm <dig> and  <dig>  in both lung and ileum. an early response at  <dig> dpi is obviously sufficient, with expression seen to diminish by  <dig> dpi. the duck is also clearly able to raise a strong interferon response against the highly pathogenic virus, with large increases in expression seen from ifitm <dig> and  <dig> in both lung and ileum. there are also very large increases in expression of ifitm <dig>  in lung.table  <dig> expression of ifitm genes in response to ai infection in chicken and in duck. numbers refer to fold-change in gene expression



to confirm these differences in gene expression seen between the species, qrt-pcr experiments were performed using rna samples from the lungs of birds at 1 day post h5n <dig> infection . samples from  <dig> infected birds were compared to  <dig> uninfected controls and normalized against eukaryotic 18 s rrna expression. large differences in ifitm expression were confirmed, with virtually no response in the chicken and significant up-regulation in the duck . the very large ifitm <dig> response seen in the duck  is most probably an over-exaggerated estimate due to the wide variability seen in uninfected ducks . if the outlier bird is removed, then up-regulation is approximately 16-fold, which is similar to the relative ratios of expression seen with the rnaseq data.table  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of the ifitm genes in chicken and duck

in order to examine the potential role of the avian ifitm genes in the global host response to avian influenza from lpai and hpai viruses the expression data  was clustered using clustergram  and the functional profile of genes grouping with ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were examined using david and ipa . in this way we could identify genes that are co-regulated with the ifitm genes and thus infer correlated gene functions . avian ifitm <dig> and  <dig> were seen to cluster with genes highly enriched with roles in anti-viral responses  while ifitm <dig> was very different and clustered with genes involved with organelle membranes and apoptotic processes . avian ifitm <dig> is also co-expressed with genes involved in phosphorylation. interestingly, phosphorylation of ifitm <dig> is thought to be important in determining its sub-cellular location and anti-viral function  <cit> . the results of this study confirm the involvement of avian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the host response to avian influenza lpai and hpai viruses.fig.  <dig> co-expression clusters associated with the duck ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes. a

structural, functional and evolutionary constraints on amino acid residues within chicken, duck and human ir-ifitm proteins
the gene expression results suggest that the avian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins play a role in the host’s antiviral response towards avian influenza virus strains. the phylogenetic analysis revealed codons under positive selection in the ifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes. this would suggest that these proteins may have been subjected to selection pressure from pathogen infection, possibly ssrna viruses like avian influenza. multiple amino acid sequence alignments of the proteins encoded by these avian ifitm <dig> and  <dig> genes reveals a number of conserved motifs, shown to be functional in the homologous regions of the human ir-ifitm proteins . all these proteins share the highly conserved tm1-cil-tm <dig> structure, core to the ifitm protein family. the tm1-cil or cd <dig> domain is the most conserved region. the tm <dig> domain is more variable with most of the sites under pervasive or episodic positive selection mapping to this region. this domain is likely to recognise lipid motifs on the surface of viral and other pathogens.fig.  <dig> domain analysis and sequence characteristics of the ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene family. the sequence alignment of chicken , duck  and human  ifitm peptides was created using t-coffee and displayed using jalview, which was also used to create secondary structure  and conservation tracks. sites predicted to be under positive selection  are shown as triangles . the transmembrane , conserved intracellular loop  and other domains were predicted using smart, sosui and expasy. motifs, mark amino acid residues as triangles and are discussed in the main text: yellow cysteine, green phenylalanine, purple lysine. sequence logos were generated using weblogo and based on the alignment of the duck, chicken and human ifitm sequences. for details of methods see materials and methods



the alignment also reveals that other functionally significant amino acids are conserved in some or all of the avian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins. in huifitm <dig> conserved cysteines  are palmitoylated and are required for viral restriction  <cit> . mutagenesis studies of these cysteines in huifitm <dig>  <cit>  show they are required for protein clustering in membranes and antiviral activity. only the cysteine equivalent to huifitm <dig> c <dig>  is conserved in all avian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins, which is likely to be the core palmitoylation site required for membrane position. the more n-terminal cysteine c <dig> in huifitm <dig>  is only conserved in avian ifitm <dig> but not ifitm <dig> or  <dig> 

in huifitm <dig> the four lysine residues in the n-terminal and cil domains are ubiquinated, control ifitm <dig> protein degradation and antiviral activity  <cit> . two of these lysine residues, equivalent to huifitm <dig> k <dig> and  <dig>  are conserved in avian ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins. the third lysine equivalent to huifitm <dig> k <dig> is conserved in avian ifitm <dig> and  <dig>  but not  <dig> 

the n- and c-termini are poorly conserved and of variable length in both birds and mammals. in huifitm <dig> and  <dig>  a conserved tyrosine  in the n-terminal domain may determine cellular location  <cit> , with huifitm <dig> mostly at the plasma membrane and huifitm <dig> and  <dig> located mostly in intracellular compartments. in birds this tyrosine  is conserved in avian ifitm <dig> and  <dig>  but not ifitm <dig>  this would predict an intracellular location for avian ifitm <dig> and  <dig>  and plasma membrane for ifitm <dig> proteins.

john et al.  <cit>  has shown that huifitm <dig> can interact with ifitm <dig> and  <dig> and itself through specific phenylalanine residues . the formation of these homo- and hetero-oligomers may determine their cellular location  <cit> . the n-terminal phenylalanine equivalent to huifitm <dig> f <dig> in tm <dig> is conserved in birds  in most ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins, except chifitm <dig>  a non-conserved leucine  is found in chifitm <dig> and may have functional consequences, which remains to be tested. finally, valine  <dig>  is under positive selection in the duck and is located in a region known to restrict influenza virus entry in huifitm <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
the elucidation of why ducks and chickens show very different tolerances to avian influenza infection will help underpin research into prevention of the economic damage to the poultry industry and a potentially devastating human pandemic. investigation of the host responses to infection in these species thus has important implications for not only avian well-being, but also human health. in this study we use transcriptomic sequencing to analyse gene expression differences in the two avian species. we show very different in vivo ifitm responses in ducks and chickens matched by differences in selection pressures and evolutionary history of the ifitm gene family.

identification of ifitm genes in various avian species has allowed us to compare the pattern of evolution of these genes in birds with that of mammals. interestingly, two completely different evolutionary patterns seem to have taken place within the two groups. in mammals the ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes tend to cluster together within species-specific lineages, suggesting independent gene duplication events within species to create paralogous genes. in birds, however, each member of the ifitm family clusters into an independent clade . we have shown that these genes are rapidly evolving and highlighted particular amino acids which appear to be under positive selection in certain species. amongst the bird species, we also see that ifitm <dig> appears to be evolving more rapidly in the duck lineage.

transcriptomic sequencing of chicken and duck tissues infected with h5n <dig> and h5n <dig> influenza viruses has allowed us insight into differences in the host immune response in each species and provided us with information on the different biological pathways which are induced in each response. the chicken immune system is able to counter lpai h5n <dig>  but unable to respond effectively to the hpai h5n <dig>  b- and t-cells are induced in response to h5n <dig>  but an initial early immune response in the ileum against h5n <dig> is ultimately insufficient to clear the virus and the animal succumbs to infection. the response seen in the ileum primarily involves lipid metabolism genes. the duck, on the other hand, is barely required to produce a response against h5n <dig> since lpai is not seen as pathogenic and is able to initiate a robust host response to h5n <dig> infection. a strong cytokine response along with induction of the tlr and rig-i pathways ensure that the duck is able to survive or delay infection with the more pathogenic h5n <dig> virus. rig-i is involved in the initial cytosolic detection of virus in the host cell and tlrs are responsible for the induction of signalling cascades leading to the production of type-i interferons. when the chicken response to h5n <dig> was compared to the h5n <dig> response in the duck, two unique host-specific responses were seen.

enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that genes involved in protein binding and various immune-associated processes were highly represented in the duck. the duck host response to h5n <dig> also showed the down-regulation of many genes involved with metabolic systems and metal-ion binding. in the chicken ileum response to h5n <dig> at  <dig> dpi, many genes involved in lipid metabolism and binding are also up-regulated, while neuronal-associated genes were notably down-regulated. the effect on neural processes during influenza infection has been reported in recent studies . analysis of the presence of transcription factor binding sites amongst down-regulated genes highlighted an enrichment of genes with binding sites for elf <dig>  and etv <dig>  in chicken.

specific examination of the role of the ifitm genes during avian influenza infection was also made. ifitm <dig>   <dig> and 3-like proteins are already known to have anti-viral function in mammals  <cit> , with ifitm <dig> specifically shown to restrict the effects of influenza in a mouse knockout model  <cit> . the sequence data presented in this study was therefore used to determine their activity in birds. a recent report by smith et al.  <cit>  demonstrates that over-expression of chicken ifitm <dig>  restricts influenza in vitro. we show that in vivo chickens mount a nearly non-existent ifitm response, with an ineffectual early induction of ifitm <dig> in the ileum against h5n <dig> infection, which is not maintained. conversely, the duck is able to mount and sustain an effective induction of ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in both the lung and ileum during h5n <dig> progression. chickens are seen to show an early up-regulation of lipid metabolism genes in the ileum against hpai. this is most likely a reflection of the viral/host membrane fusion and subsequent viral replication which is occurring. this lipid response is not seen in the duck. ifitm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to block viral membrane hemifusion . the ifitm proteins alter the lipid composition of the membrane and decrease membrane fluidity, thus restricting viral fusion  <cit> . so, the differential response of lipid-associated genes seen between chicken and duck is most probably due, in part, to the hugely different ifitm response seen between these two species.

CONCLUSIONS
along with the presence/absence of various immune genes and the differing affinities of the influenza virus for host sialic acid receptors, the different ifitm responses we have seen in chickens and ducks are very probably, one of the reasons contributing to the duck’s ability to mitigate hpai where it proves lethal to the chicken. the evolutionary selective forces also acting upon the ifitm genes will, in turn, promote mutation of the influenza viruses themselves as part of the on-going ‘arms race’ of which viruses and hosts find themselves a part. the apparent absence of rig-i in galliform birds  <cit>  along with the poor ifitm expression we have seen during infection in chickens may also be contributory factors as to why certain h <dig> and h <dig> viral subtypes are able to become highly pathogenic in these birds. why only h <dig> and h <dig> strains  are evolving in their pathogenic potential remains to be determined. the emergence of the h7n <dig> influenza subtype and its recent infection of humans, along with the developing susceptibility of ducks to some highly pathogenic h5n <dig> viruses  <cit>  highlight the ever-increasing need to identify and understand the resistance mechanisms deployed by hosts against these viruses.
