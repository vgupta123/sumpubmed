BACKGROUND
plants consistently suffer from various environmental challenges, including drought, high salinity and low temperatures  <cit> . in response to these stresses, plants have developed a series of survival mechanisms. among them, calcium , the second messenger in cells, plays an essential role in various signaling transduction pathways  <cit> . transient changes in ca2+ concentration are sensed by several ca2+ sensors or ca2+-binding proteins. to date, three major classes of ca2+-binding proteins, including calcium dependent protein kinases , calmodulins  and cam-like proteins  and calcineurin b-like proteins , have been characterized in higher plants  <cit> .

the cdpk are one of the well-known ca2+-sensor protein kinases involved in environmental stress resistance, and these kinases are found in plants and some protozoans  <cit>  but not in animals. the cdpk protein has four characterized domains: an n-terminal variable region, a ser/thr kinase catalytic domain, an autoregulatory/autoinhibitory domain and a calmodulin-like domain  <cit> . the calmodulin-like domain contains ef-hands for ca2+ binding.

accumulating evidence indicates that cdpks play important roles not only in response to a broad variety of abiotic and biotic stresses, such as drought, cold, salinity, wounding and pathogen infection, but also in the signaling of plant hormones  <cit> . atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> are two positive regulators involved in cdpk/ca2+-mediated aba signaling through the phosphorylation of two aba-responsive transcription factors, abf <dig> and abf <dig>  <cit> . atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> were shown to regulate guard cells ion channel activity and were shown to be involved in aba-regulated stomatal signaling  <cit> . moreover, plants over-expressing atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> showed enhanced tolerance to salt/drought stresses, whereas atcpk <dig> mutant plants displayed no obvious phenotypes  <cit> . atcpk <dig> also positively regulated methyl jasmonate  signaling in guard cells  <cit> . atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> mutants showed increased tolerance to hyperosmotic stress, drought and salt stresses  <cit> . atcpk <dig> overexpression enhanced aba and salt sensitivities during germination through the phosphorylation of abf <dig>  <cit> . arabidopsis cpk5/cpk <dig>  cpk5/cpk6/cpk <dig> and cpk5/cpk6/cpk11/cpk <dig> mutants compromised an flg22-induced response, including ros production and defense-related gene expression  <cit> . in rice, the overexpression of oscdpk <dig> has been shown to enhance resistance to cold, drought and salt stress  <cit> . oscpk <dig> positively regulated aba signaling and salt stress  <cit> . more recently, oscpk <dig> overexpression resulted in increased tolerance to salt stress and increased susceptibility to both compatible and incompatible blast fungi  <cit> .

cdpks are encoded by a large family. there are  <dig> cdpk genes in the arabidopsis genome,  <dig> genes in rice and  <dig> genes in wheat  <cit> . tobacco , soybean  and tomato  also have multiple cdpk genes  <cit> . however, little is currently known about the cdpk family in maize. maize  is one of the oldest and most important crops worldwide. so far, only seven zmcpks  have been characterized in maize. it was reported that low temperatures induce zmcdpk <dig> expression in maize leaves  <cit> . the transcript levels of zmcdpk <dig> and zmcdpk <dig> were higher in roots and etiolated leaves than in green leaves, suggesting these two genes may be down-regulated in response to light  <cit> . zmcdpk <dig> expression occurred during the growth and development of the maize seedling in response to fungal infection and treatment with fungal elicitors  <cit> . recently, the expression and enzymatic activity of zmcdpk <dig> were shown to be regulated by linolenic acid  and meja, and zmcdpk <dig> participated in ja-dependent wound signaling pathways  <cit> .

in this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis of the entire maize genome and identified  <dig> cdpk genes. these  <dig> maize cdpks have been grouped based on their phylogenetic relationships and are anchored to specific chromosomes. the expression levels of twelve cdpk genes in maize roots were measured to assess the responses to cold, drought, salt, aba and h2o <dig> 

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of zmcpk gene family members
it is possible to identify all cdpk gene family members in maize because the maize genome has been completely sequenced  <cit> . blast searches of the maize genome were performed using arabidopsis and rice cdpk sequences as query sequences; this analysis identified  <dig> putative cdpk genes including  <dig> known cdpks, designated as zmcpk1-zmcpk <dig> according to the proposed nomenclature for cdpk genes  <cit>  . because alternative splice variants are closely related to each other based on the results of the multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we selected only a single variant for further analysis. although the size of maize genome  was much larger than the genomes of arabidopsis  and rice , the total number of maize cdpk genes was similar to the number of these genes in arabidopsis and rice. moreover, the difference in the total number of cdpk genes was mainly due to the expansion of group i;  <dig> genes from this group were found in maize,  <dig> in rice and  <dig> in arabidopsis .

a b c and d genbank accession numbers; - represents no alternative splice variants.

all  <dig> of cdpks had conserved cdpk domains, including an n-terminal variable domain, a protein kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain, and a calmodulin-like domain. in arabidopsis, rice and wheat, many cdpks have potential n-myristoylation motifs for membrane association at the beginning of their highly variable n-terminal domain, with a gly residue at the second position. seventeen of the forty maize cdpks were predicted to have n-myristoylation motifs for membrane association. among them, fifteen cdpks had at least one cys residue at positions  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>  which are potential palmitoylation sites . in many systems, n-myristoylation and palmitoylation promote protein-membrane interactions. atcpk <dig>  atcpk <dig>  atcpk <dig>  tacpk <dig> and tacpk <dig> were predicted to have an n-myristoylation motif and have been shown to be associated with plasma membranes  <cit> . in addition, oscpk <dig> has been experimentally shown to be myristoylated and palmitoylated and then targeted to the membrane fraction  <cit> . although atcpk <dig>  atcpk <dig>  tacpk <dig> and tacpk <dig> lacked myristoylation motifs, these genes were also shown to be associated with the membranes  <cit> . in maize, both zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> had an n-myristoylation motif and were predominately localized to the plasma membrane ; however, although zmck <dig>  was predicted to have an n-myristoylation motif, a zmck1::hgfp fusion protein was recently found to localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . these results suggest that other motifs may affect the membrane association of these genes.

in arabidopsis, rice and wheat, most of the calmodulin-like domains of cdpks contain four ca2+ binding ef hands, allowing the protein to function as a ca2+ sensor. sequential deletion of the ef hands demonstrated that the number and position of ef hands may be important for determining the ca2+ regulation of cdpk activity. more recently, franz et al.  showed that n-terminal ef <dig> and ef <dig> motifs of atcpk <dig> were more important for ca2+-regulated enzyme activity when compared to the c-terminal ef <dig> and ef <dig> motifs and suggested that the ef <dig> and ef <dig> motifs may function as a switch for the protein kinase activity mediating abiotic stress signaling  <cit> . most maize cdpks contained four ef hands; zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> each had three ef hands . interestingly, zmcpk <dig> had only one ef hand, which was also found in its homologs, oscpk <dig> and atcpk <dig>  <cit> . it would be of interest to explore differences in the biological functions of zmcpk <dig> and other zmcpks.

phylogenetic analysis of the cdpk gene family
to study the evolutionary relationships between different cdpk members, an unrooted tree was constructed from alignments of the full cdpk amino acid sequences and the phylogenetic analysis indicated that  <dig> zmcpks can be divided into four groups . it was reported that crks, ppcks and peprks were closely related to the cdpks. as shown in figure  <dig>  zmcpks, atcrks, atppcks and atpeprks were clustered into  <dig> distinct groups, which indicated that all  <dig> zmcpks actually belonged to the cdpk family. group i contained  <dig> cdpks from maize,  <dig> from rice and  <dig> from arabidopsis. zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> showed a high degree of similarity with oscpk <dig> , which was shown to be associated with cold, drought and salt stress responses  <cit> . this similarity indicates that zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> might be involved in abiotic stress. group ii contained  <dig> maize cdpks, eight rice cdpks and  <dig> arabidopsis cdpks. zmcpk <dig> shared 76% similarity with oscpk <dig>  a positive regulator of salt tolerance and a negative regulator of blast resistance  <cit> . group iii contained  <dig> maize cdpks, eight rice cdpks and  <dig> arabidopsis cdpks. the amino acid sequence identity between zmcpk <dig> and oscpk <dig> approached 75%. oscpk <dig> was shown to confer salt tolerance in rice  <cit> . group iv contained  <dig> cdpks from maize, three from rice and  <dig> from arabidopsis. zmcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> shared 75% similarity at the amino acids level. recently, atcpk <dig> was reported to regulate plant stem elongation and vascular development by altering the expression of nac transcriptional and gibberellic acid homeostasis regulators  <cit> . zmcpk <dig> showed the highest similarity with oscpk <dig>  and oscpk <dig> was shown to be transiently activated in g. intraradices-inoculated rice roots  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis showed that there were  <dig> closely related maize-rice orthologs  , suggesting that an ancestral set of cdpk genes existed prior to the maize-rice divergence. furthermore, most of the maize-rice orthologs had similar n-myristoylation motifs, numbers of ef hands and gene structures .

structural organization of genes and chromosomal localization
the exon-intron structure of the maize cdpk genes was determined based on the predicted sequences. as shown in figure  <dig>  most members in the same group had similar exon-intron structure. there were 2– <dig> exons in maize group i - iii cdpks, whereas group iv cdpks contained 11– <dig> exons, which is consistent with the exon numbers of arabidopsis and rice cdpks. this conserved exon-intron structure in each group among all three species supports their close evolutionary relationship and the introduced classification of groups. in addition, our bioinformatics analysis showed that  <dig> of the zmcpks had alternatively spliced mrnas .

in silico chromosomal localization of cdpks indicated that all  <dig> of the cdpks were distributed among all  <dig> chromosomes in maize . in the case of arabidopsis and rice, the  <dig> and  <dig> cdpk genes were also distributed among all  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes of their respective genomes, indicating that cdpk genes are widely distributed in plant genomes. however, the distribution of cdpk genes on each maize chromosome was non-random. several of the cdpks appeared to be clustered together on specific chromosomes, including chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, chromosome  <dig> had two cdpk genes, whereas chromosome  <dig> only encoded one cdpk gene.

several rounds of genome duplication events have been detected in the maize genome. a total of ten segmental duplication events  and four gene pairs as tandem repeats  were found in the maize genome . these results indicate that both segmental and tandem duplications play an important role in cdpk gene expansion in the maize genome. in arabidopsis, each of the  <dig> gene paralogs  has the same number of ef hands and n-myristoylation motifs. moreover, both atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> regulate aba signaling through the phosphorylation of abf <dig> and abf <dig>  in the present study, all of the close paralogs, except zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig>  had similar characteristics, which included n-terminal, n-myristoylation motifs and the number of ef hands . these results suggest that the genes that are close paralogs may also have similar functions.

expression pattern of the maize cdpk genes in different tissues and developmental stages
to investigate the expression profiles of cdpk in maize development, we analyzed the expression of the cdpk genes in different tissues and developmental stages using published microarray data. thirty-three of the  <dig> maize cdpk genes have the corresponding probe sets in the dataset, and probes for the other  <dig> cdpk genes were not found. a heatmap representation of the expression profile for  <dig> cdpk genes during maize development is shown in figure  <dig>  based on hierarchical clustering, the expression patterns of the cdpk genes could be divided into four groups: groups a, b, c and d. group a cdpk genes had lower expression in leaves than in other organs, whereas group d cdpk genes were expressed most highly in leaves and primary roots. interestingly, group c genes were expressed most highly in anther, suggesting that group c cdpk genes may play an important role in pollen development. in addition, group b genes had higher expression in early developmental stages but lower expression in endosperm and seed development, suggesting that group b cdpk genes may negatively control seed development. furthermore, cdpk duplicated gene pair expression patterns were also investigated, and most gene pairs  shared similar expression patterns in nearly all of the organs and developmental stages analyzed; however, this was not the case for zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig>  these results suggest that most of the cdpk genes could play an important role in maize development.

next, quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis was performed to examine the cdpk gene expression patterns in roots, leaves and stems. most of our qrt-pcr data were consistent with the microarray data. zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> were predominantly expressed in stems. for example, zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> showed a 6-fold and 16-fold increase, respectively, in their expression in stems relative to their expression in roots . ntcdpk <dig> is also highly expressed in stems  <cit> . three of the  <dig> zmcpks  were predominantly expressed in roots. in contrast, the zmcpk <dig> transcript levels in leaves were higher than in roots and stems . intriguingly, four maize-rice orthologs  exhibited similar tissue-specific expression patterns  <cit> .

expression profiles of the maize cdpk genes under abiotic stress
increasing evidence indicates that cdpks are involved in various physiological adaptations in response to environmental stimuli, and the expression of cdpk genes are also regulated by various stimuli, including hormones, salt, cold, drought, heat and wounding. in wheat,  <dig> out of  <dig> cdpk genes appeared to respond to abiotic stress including drought, nacl and aba  <cit> . to identify the effects of cdpk gene expression on maize stress responses, 14-day-old maize seedlings were treated under conditions of  <dig> mm nacl , 20% peg  and 4°c . we examined the expression levels of  <dig> maize cdpks by qrt-pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  nacl treatment caused a marked decrease in the transcription levels of  <dig> cdpk genes  in roots. the zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> transcript levels increased  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, at  <dig> h after nacl treatment , whereas nacl slightly up-regulated zmcpk <dig> expression . in rice, eight cdpks transcripts were down-regulated in response to salt stress. the expression levels of zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> showed a high degree of similarity with the expression levels of their orthologs in rice , which were also down-regulated in response to nacl treatment  <cit> . although multiple studies have reported that many plant cdpks positively regulate salt/drought stress, our data suggest that these zmcpks may negatively control salt stress as well as their oscpks homologous genes. however, zmcpk <dig> was down-regulated by nacl treatment , whereas the transcripts of its paralogous gene, zmcpk <dig> , accumulated greatly in response to salt stress  <cit> , thus indicating the divergence of cdpk functions of this gene paralogs in maize family. furthermore, two duplicated cdpk genes in wheat, cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> displayed the opposite expression patterns in response to abiotic stress or hormone treatments  <cit> . these results show that although the duplicated genes are highly similar at the amino acid level, they may actually possess different gene functions.

many cdpk genes identified in various plant species have been proven to play crucial roles during drought stress. under peg treatment, zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> were found to be up-regulated between  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> h, whereas zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> were up-regulated between  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold when compared to the untreated roots . conversely, two genes, zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig>  were obviously down-regulated after peg treatment. in addition, zmcpk <dig> had similar expression profiles after peg treatment, as shown in figure  <dig>  peg treatment caused a decrease in transcription levels at  <dig> h in roots, followed by a quick recovery to untreated levels at  <dig> h before decreasing again.

ca2+-mediated early cold induction of the cbfs is crucial for cold tolerance. in rice, oscdpk <dig> has been shown to enhance cold stress without inducing stress-inducible genes, such as rab16a and salt <cit> . the overexpression of oscdpk <dig> also confers cold resistance  <cit> . in alfalfa, the expression of msck <dig> and msck <dig> was induced by cold stress  <cit> . however, the molecular functions of cdpks during cold stress signaling remain to be explored. in maize, six genes  shared similar expression profiles under 4°c treatment conditions. in particular, 4°c treatment conditions induced a biphasic response in which the first peak  occurred after 1– <dig> h, and the second peak  appeared within  <dig> h . however, there were some differences in the cold-induced expression levels of these zmcpks. the cold-induced expression of zmcpk <dig> in phases i and ii was slight, and the expression of zmcpk <dig> in phases i and ii was the highest among the zmcpks genes, which showed more than a 20- and 40-fold change in response to the 4°c treatment conditions, respectively . these results suggest that zmcpk <dig> may play an important role in cold stress and that zmcpk <dig> is a good candidate for developing our understanding the mechanisms of cold tolerance in maize. the 4°c treatment caused a decrease in the transcription levels of zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> within  <dig> h, which then increased at  <dig> h, whereas the transcription of zmcpk <dig> was down-regulated within  <dig> h but increased at  <dig> h after 4°c treatment . under cold conditions, zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> transcripts gradually accumulated .

expression profiles of the maize cdpk genes in response to exogenous aba and h2o2
the phytohormone abscisic acid  plays important roles in many aspects of plant growth and development, particular in the physiological response to environmental stressors that include salinity, drought and cold  <cit> . an increasing body of evidence has shown that cdpks regulate aba-mediated signal transduction in plants  <cit> . to investigate the possible involvement of cdpks in aba- mediated signaling, we examined the expression of  <dig> cdpk genes in response to aba treatment. for most of the  <dig> cdpk genes, aba treatment led to an increase in transcript levels within  <dig> h, and then decreased . in contrast, aba treatment caused a decline in the expression of zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig>  and zmcpk <dig> . in addition, zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> transcript levels were slightly increased and then quickly decreased in response to aba treatment . in arabidopsis, atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> have been implicated as two important positive regulators in the cdpk-mediated aba signaling pathway  <cit> . by contrast, atcpk <dig>  the closest homolog of atcpk4/atcpk <dig>  negatively regulates aba responses by phosphorylating abi <dig>  a negative regulator of aba signaling  <cit> . in maize, zmcpk <dig>  the homolog of atcpk4/atcpk <dig>  was clearly down-regulated after aba treatment , suggesting that zmcpk <dig> might act a negative regulator in aba signaling.

various environmental and developmental stimuli induce the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide , which acts as a signaling molecule that regulates plant development, stress adaptation, hormone signaling and programmed cell death. in rice, oscpk <dig> regulates ros homeostasis in response to salt stress by inducing the expression of the ros scavenger genes osapx2/osapx <dig> and by repressing the nadph oxidase gene osrbohi, thereby leading to increased salt tolerance  <cit> . however, stcdpk4/ <dig> induces an oxidative burst by phosphorylating nadph oxidase  <cit> . to determine whether maize cdpk genes play a role in h2o <dig> signaling pathways, we analyzed the expression of  <dig> zmcpk genes in response to h2o <dig>  the transcript levels of six cdpk genes  and four cdpk genes  were significantly increased at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, after h2o <dig> treatment . in response to h2o <dig> treatment, the expression of zmcpk <dig> increase slightly and then quickly decreased . the expression of zmcpk <dig> was obviously down-regulated after h2o <dig> treatment . these results suggest that maize cdpks are most likely involved in the h2o <dig> signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have conducted a genome-wide analysis of the cdpk gene family, one of the largest protein kinases families in plants, in maize for the first time. in silico analysis of the maize genome database resulted in the identification of  <dig> cdpk genes from maize, and among these genes,  <dig> were fond to be novel. our analyses suggest that genome duplications may have contributed to the expansion of zmcpks. the phylogenetic analysis of cdpks from maize, rice and arabidopsis has facilitated the classification of these genes into four groups. members within each group may have recent common evolutionary origins, as they shared common protein motifs and exon-intron structures. our microarray analysis showed that most maize cdpk genes exhibited different expression levels in different tissues and at different developmental stages, suggesting that cdpk genes play different roles in maize development. salinity and oxidative stresses in maize roots have shown a maximum transcript abundance of zmcpk <dig>  and zmcpk <dig>  zmcpk <dig> and zmcpk <dig> demonstrated the highest expression levels in response to drought, cold and aba, respectively. our results also suggest that most gene family members may be negative regulators in salt stress signaling pathways. overall, we have identified a novel cdpk family, and the results presented here provide a solid foundation for further functional investigation of the cdpk gene family in maize.
