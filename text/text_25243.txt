BACKGROUND
common wheat is a hexaploid species  with a large genome size  and abundant repeat sequences   <cit> . comparative genomics proved the existence of genomic colinearity among cereal crops  <cit> . as a model plant of cereals, the rice genomic sequence completed in  <dig>  <cit> , and several yield-related genes  <cit> , such as gs <dig>  gw <dig>  gw <dig>  gw <dig>  tgw <dig>  ghd <dig> and gif <dig>  have been isolated  <cit> , providing opportunities for homology-based cloning of yield-related genes in other cereals. the availability of a draft wheat genome sequence  <cit>  will promote genome-based research of this extremely important crop. cloning yield-related genes, exploring the favored alleles and developing functional markers will be important for yield improvement in that crop. this will be the next major focus of wheat genetics and genomics.

among yield-related genes, current studies on gene function and allele discovery of gw <dig> are the most in-depth and extensive in cereal crops. firstly, song et al. <cit>  isolated a major yield qtl from rice, which was mapped on short arm of chromosome  <dig> and designated as osgw <dig>  it encoded a ring-type protein with e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity that negatively regulated grain width, and loss-of-function mutations enhanced grain weight and yield. in maize, li et al.   <cit>  found two homologs of osgw <dig>  viz. zmgw2-chr <dig> and zmgw2-chr <dig>  and a snp in the promoter region of zmgw2-chr <dig> was significantly associated with kernel width  and hundred kernel weight  in maize. we cloned tagw <dig> from chromosome 6a of wheat, and found snps in its promoter region, that were significantly associated with kw and tkw. a caps marker was developed based on the - <dig> a/g polymorphism and association analysis indicated that hap-6a-a increased tkw by more than  <dig>  g  <cit> . recently, a tagw2-6a-caps marker was used to detect variation in a bc2f <dig> ril population, as well as a natural population, further demonstrating that tagw2-6a was significantly associated with grain weight  <cit> . yang et al. <cit>  identified a single-base insertion in the eighth exon of tagw2-6a causing premature termination in landrace lankaodali, which ultimately led to increased grain width and grain weight. however, bednarek et al. <cit>  showed that the patterns of tagw <dig> regulation of grain development might be more complex after studies on rna interference  of expression of tagw <dig> in wheat. in consideration of the characteristics of the wheat genome, further dissection of the regulation and expression patterns of the three tagw <dig> homoeologous genes on grain weight could have important biological and breeding implications.

in this study, further research focused on sequencing and diversity studies of the promoter regions of tagw2-6b and tagw2-6d, functional marker development, and an expression pattern comparison of the three homoeologous tagw <dig> loci. hence, the major objectives were to  reveal sequence diversity and distribution characteristics of the three gw <dig> homoeologous genes by sequence alignment of their ~ <dig>  kb promoter regions;  develop functional markers for tagw2-6b and tagw2-6d to distinguish various haplotypes, and discover favored haplotypes for yield improvement through association analysis;  evaluate the distributions of different haplotypes in global wheat major production regions, including north america, europe, australia, russia, mexico and china, and understand the selection intensity and geographical distribution of tagw2s in different wheat ecological regions;  assess the relationships between the expression levels of the three tagw <dig> homoeologues and grain size by real-time pcr analysis, and preliminarily evaluate the genetic effects of tagw2s based on phenotypic variation  for grain traits; and  examine interactions among the three tagw <dig> loci on chromosomes 6a, 6b and 6d through haplotype combination analysis. it was expected that the study would identify important genes and functional markers for wheat yield improvement.

RESULTS
major variations in tagw2s occur in the promoter regions
in the coding sequence of tagw <dig> homoeologous genes,  <dig> wheat accessions  were used to study the nucleotide polymorphism and no divergence was found. genome walking was used to clone the sequences of the promoter regions of tagw2-6b and tagw2-6d, and ~ <dig>  kb upstream sequences from the atg start codons were obtained. the core elements of the promoters were predicted with the tssp program , and the tata box and sts  were identified at -159 bp and -127 bp upstream from the atg codon of tagw2-6b. for tagw2-6d, the corresponding locations were located at -162 bp and -130 bp, respectively. generally, more variations in tagw2s occurred in the promoter regions, but the diversity of tagw2-6b was higher than that of tagw2-6a, in which eight snps forming two haplotypes were found earlier  <cit> . no divergence was detected in the tagw2-6d promoter region . four haplotypes were formed by  <dig> snps within the  <dig>  kb upstream sequence of tagw2-6b; these were designated hap-6b- <dig>  hap-6b- <dig>  hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> .

haplotypes in promoter region of tagw2-6b have strong effects on tkw
tagw2-6b marker development
in the  <dig> snps detected in the tagw2-6b promoter region , the nucleotide polymorphism at -1709 bp created a restriction enzyme recognition site for bstni  . this was employed to develop a cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence  marker to distinguish hap-6b- <dig> from the other three haplotypes. no restriction enzyme recognition site was found in hap-6b- <dig> , whereas it existed in the other three haplotypes . in addition, acas-pcr primer sets designed for snp-83 t/c worked well and were co-dominant . the forward primer for acas-pcr was genome-specific, and the reverse was allele-specific with artificial mismatches in the 3′-end. hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> amplified a fragment of 626 bp, whereas hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> amplified a 464 bp fragment. thus, the acas-pcr primer sets reliably discriminated hap-6b- <dig> and the other two haplotypes. finally, only one snp difference was found at -721 bp for discriminating hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig>  the dcaps marker was designed with a specific mismatch in the primer to introduce a restriction enzyme hpy166ii recognition site  using an available program dcaps finder  <dig>  . this marker effectively discriminated hap-6b- <dig>  and hap-6b- <dig> . thus, three markers, tagw2-6b-caps, tagw2-6b-dcaps and tagw2-6b-acas, were developed to distinguish these haplotypes.

tests on a set of chinese spring  nullisomic-tetrasomic lines confirmed that the three markers were chromosome 6b-specific . the tagw2-6b gene was mapped between the markers xmag <dig> and xwmc <dig> on chromosome 6b in the recombinant inbred line  population derived from nanda  <dig> and wangshuibai . based on the wheat consensus ssr genetic map  <cit> , tagw2-6b was very close to the 6b centromere.

strong differences in tkw and heading date exist between tagw2-6b haplotypes
all three molecular markers, distinguishing the four tagw2-6b promoter haplotypes were used for genotyping the  <dig> entries in the chinese wheat mini-core collection. previous studies had demonstrated that these accessions were clustered into two sub-populations comprising  <dig> landraces and  <dig> modern cultivars  <cit>  by structure v <dig>  software  <cit> . therefore, association analysis between haplotypes of tagw2-6b and grain traits took population structure into account.

there were significant differences in tkw between hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> in the landraces , and phenotypic differences between them were  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . this might be caused by differences in kl between hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> . among modern cultivars, significant differences were again detected in tkw between hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> , and the mean tkw differences of hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> were  <dig>  g and  <dig>  g. these differences were due to large differences in kw and kt . kw differences between the two groups were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, the kt differences were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively. the significant negative effect of hap-6b- <dig> may be the major reason for its elimination in breeding. compared with the other three haplotypes, hap-6b- <dig> was the favored one that increased grain weight. it was noteworthy that hap-6b- <dig> was quite close to hap-6b- <dig> in effect on grain weight in modern chinese cultivars.

in addition to kernel weight, haplotype association analyses of heading and maturity dates were also performed . there were no significant differences between hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> among the landraces for the two traits, but among modern cultivars heading and maturity date differences between hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> in both growing seasons were significant. the heading dates in  <dig> and  <dig> differed by  <dig> and 9 days and the corresponding differences for maturity date were  <dig> and 6 days, respectively. similarly, hap-6b- <dig> was also  <dig> and 6 days earlier than hap-6b- <dig> in heading in the two seasons. for maturity, hap-6b- <dig> was  <dig> and 4 days earlier than hap-6b- <dig> in the two seasons respectively. therefore, it seemed that hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> were associated not only with larger grain, but also earlier maturity.

geographic distribution and frequency changes among haplotypes of tagw2-6a, and tagw2-6b in global wheat breeding
geographic distribution of tagw2-6b haplotypes in chinese wheats
wheat production in china is divided into ten ecological zones based on cultivar ecotypes, growing season, and cultivar response to temperature and photoperiod  <cit> . the distribution of tagw2-6b haplotypes was evaluated in both landraces and modern cultivars from each zone . among landraces, selection pressure on haplotypes in the different zones was not as strong as expected, and the frequency of the favored haplotype hap-6b- <dig> was generally low. in the winter wheat zones iii, iv, v and ix, the frequency of hap-6b- <dig> was highest, whereas in spring wheat zones vi and x, hap-6b- <dig> was more frequent, and hap-6b- <dig> was relatively frequent only in zone vii. however, in modern cultivars, hap-6b- <dig> frequencies were higher across all zones , indicating it had undergone strong positive selection during wheat improvement. in detail, hap-6b- <dig> was the most frequent haplotype in zones ii, v, vi and vii, whereas hap-6b- <dig> was most frequent in iv, viii, ix and x. association analysis showed that grain size and component parameters of hap-6b- <dig> were significantly higher than those of hap-6b- <dig>  although they were lower than those of hap-6b- <dig> . compared with landraces, hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> frequencies were higher across the ecological zones, presumably due to selective breeding, hence becoming the most frequent haplotypes. in contrast, the frequencies of hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> significantly decreased and even disappeared in zones ix, vi and vii .

further evidence showing that tagw2-6b underwent strong selection in chinese wheat breeding is provided in figure  <dig>  the frequency of hap-6b- <dig> showed an increasing trend, especially in the 2000s . thus this haplotype tended towards fixation during modern breeding. in contrast, hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> disappeared from cultivars released after the 1980s.

global distributions of haplotypes for tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b
previous study showed that hap-6a-a was favored in china, whereas hap-6a-g was favored in europe  <cit> . in order to evaluate the distribution of all tagw <dig> haplotypes in global wheat cultivars, the frequencies of haplotypes at the tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b loci were determined in cultivar collections from north america, australia, china, cimmyt, europe and russia .

obvious geographic differences in haplotype frequencies for tagw2-6a were found among the different groups. hap-6a-a was more frequent in australian, chinese and russian cultivars, whereas hap-6a-g predominated in u.s., cimmyt and european collections . at tagw2-6b, the superior haplotype hap-6b- <dig> was more frequent in all regions, and hap-6b- <dig> was virtually absent in all groups. selection pressure on hap-6a-a in north america and europe was apparently very low, in contrast to china, and hap-6a-g tended to dominate . the favored haplotype hap-6b- <dig> at tagw2-6b showed a slow growth trend, while hap-6b- <dig> gradually decreased or disappeared in all continents . therefore, an obvious consistency of globally favored haplotypes was detected at tagw2-6b, but not at tagw2-6a.

tagw <dig> genes negatively regulate wheat grain weight
the average expression level of tagw2-6a reached a peak at  <dig> dpf and was significantly higher than that of either tagw2-6b or tagw2-6d in all six sampling stages of seed development . the average relative expression of tagw2-6b peaked at  <dig> dpf, and that of tagw2-6d was  <dig> dpf. the average relative expression level of tagw2-6b was higher than that of tagw2-6d in all six stages except  <dig> dpf.

differences in average relative expression of tagw <dig> genes were detected between the  <dig> higher-tkw cultivars and  <dig> lower-tkw genotypes. relative expression of all tagw2s in the lower-tkw group peaked at  <dig> dpf. in the other group, tagw2-6a and tagw2-6d also peaked at  <dig> dpf, but tagw2-6b peaked at  <dig> dpf . interestingly, the average relative expression level of the three tagw <dig> homoeologous genes in cultivars with lower tkw was higher than that of higher-tkw genotypes in developing seeds, whereas only small differences occurred in mature seeds . this further confirmed that all three tagw <dig> homoeologous genes negatively regulated grain weight.

association analysis showed that haplotypes hap-6a-a and hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> at tagw2-6b were significantly associated with higher tkw, whereas hap-6a-g and hap-6b- <dig> were associated with lower tkw  <cit>  . the same set of  <dig> cultivars was used for further analysis of the relationship between relative expression levels of various tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b haplotypes and kernel traits . as shown in , the average relative expression level of hap-6a-g was higher than that of hap-6a-a at all periods except  <dig> dpf, and was also very obvious at  <dig> dpf . the average relative expression of hap-6b- <dig> was lower than other haplotypes , especially at  <dig> dpf. all of these results further suggested that tagw2s negatively regulate grain weight by controlling the gene expression level during seed development.

additive genetic effects between favored haplotypes at tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b
to reveal combination effects between haplotypes at tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b, an analysis was carried out on the  <dig> accessions mainly coming from the chinese wheat mini core collection . eight combinations of tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b haplotypes were detected in landraces, but there were only seven in modern cultivars, the exception was hap-6a-a/hap-6b- <dig> . no significant phenotypic differences were detected among these combination types in landraces . in modern cultivars, there were significant differences between a/ <dig>  and g/ <dig>  on kt, kw and tkw, and combination a/ <dig> was a favored type, consistent with the earlier results  <cit>  . combination a/ <dig>  was close to a/ <dig>  and much higher in tkw than g/ <dig>  comparative analysis of phenotypic effects among the favored combination and superior single and other haplotypes  further revealed that these homoeologous genes had a strong additive effect on kw and tkw. moreover, the favored haplotype combination a/ <dig> occurred at a higher frequency in the modern cultivars than in landraces, whereas small grained g/ <dig> was the opposite . these results indicate that combination a/ <dig> had undergone strong positive selection in wheat breeding due to its positive effect on grain size.

tagw2-6b has a stronger effect than tagw2-6a on tkw
based on the haplotype polymorphisms of tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b, the phenotypic explanation rates  for grain traits was calculated in the same set of  <dig> accessions . in landraces, r <dig> for grain traits in tagw2-6b was higher than that in tagw2-6a, and the value of the combination of tagw2-6a/tagw2-6b was higher than that of either tagw2-6a or tagw2-6b alone in both growing seasons . as for modern cultivars, the r <dig> of the combination of these two genes was still the highest, tagw2-6b followed and tagw2-6a was the lowest. although they had the similar r <dig> trends in these two subpopulations, r <dig> of these haplotypes in the modern cultivars was significantly higher than in landraces, especially for kw and tkw. this further indicated that these grain trait-related genes had undergone strong positive selection in modern breeding, and that tagw <dig> controlled grain weight in terms of regulating grain width during development. in addition, the r <dig> values of the tagw2-6a/tagw2-6b combination were higher than those of tagw2-6a plus tagw2-6b for all grain traits in two environments in the landraces. however, in modern cultivars, the phenotypic effect of the combination of these two haplotypes was less than that of their simple sum.

discussion
natural diversity in cereal yield genes usually occurs in promoter and intron regions that influence gene expression levels
the isolation of genes controlling grain weight in wheat and development of functional markers are desirable for marker-assisted-selection  breeding. on the basis of genetic information, several successful examples of mas combined with phenotypic measurement have been accomplished, and these have mainly focused on improvement of discontinuous traits such as resistance to pests/disease, stress tolerance, and grain quality  <cit> . liu et al. <cit>  recently reviewed progress in functional marker development in wheat, including the  <dig> markers associated with processing quality, agronomic traits and disease resistance. in this review, three markers for wheat grain weight genes were also mentioned; they were tasus2-2b, tagw2-6a and tacwi-a <dig> <cit> , respectively. among them, the caps marker of tagw2-6a distinguished hap-6a-a and hap-6a-g with higher accuracy and repeatability, making it an effective marker for selection of kernel weight  <cit> .

in some cereal yield genes, natural diversity usually occurred in promoter or intron regions, which influenced gene expression levels. for example, the differences in expression levels of gs <dig> in rice are attributable to polymorphisms in the promoter region, leading to grain width variation  <cit> . another good example is that one polymorphism in the promoter region of zmgs <dig> was found to affect hkw in two environments  <cit> . it is also found that one snp in the promoter region of zmgw2-chr <dig> was significantly associated with kw and hkw, and the expression level of this gene was negatively correlated with kw  <cit> . further analysis of polymorphism in the tagw2-6b and tagw2-6d diversity in this study showed that most of the diversity existed in the promoter region of tagw2-6b, with no diversity in tagw2-6d . this is consistant with findings for yield gene diversity in rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . in addition, the diversity of wheat yield gene tadep <dig> and tasus1-7b were also found in intron regions, which influenced gene expression levels  <cit> .

association analysis of grain traits suggested that hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> were favored haplotypes , and the tagw2-6b-caps markers could distinguish the favored haplotypes from other haplotypes, indicating that they could be used as diagnostic markers in mas for increased grain weight.

the average tkw of hap-6a-a was about  <dig>  g higher than that of hap-6a-g in chinese modern cultivars  <cit> . moreover, genotypes with the hap-6a-a allele had earlier heading and maturity dates of about  <dig>  and  <dig>  days than hap-6a-g genotypes. in this study, the favored haplotype hap-6b- <dig> also affected wheat maturity, with earlier heading and maturity dates compared to other haplotypes . this may be caused by:  a hitchhiking effect of a developmentally-related gene during selection of hap-6b- <dig> in domestication and breeding; genes affecting maturity have been mapped near the chromosome group  <dig> centromere regions  <cit> , or  a pleiotropic effect of tagw <dig>  the additive effect of tagw2-6a combined with tagw2-6b showed that hap-6a-a/hap-6b- <dig> was a superior combination conferring high tkw in modern cultivars , although is effect in landraces was not. the combination effect of the two favored haplotypes was significantly higher than that of any single haplotype , indicating an obvious additive effect.

strong selection of tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b haplotypes occurred in global wheat breeding
in most domesticated crops, genetic diversity differs under conditions of continuous natural and artificial selection. in this process, about  <dig> to 4% of maize genes  throughout the genome were targeted for selection during domestication and improvement  <cit> , and many genes, such as the waxy gene in rice  <cit> , height-reduction genes rht-b <dig> and rht-d <dig> in wheat  <cit> , and the tomato fruit size gene fw <dig>  <cit>  had retained a selection trace. grain weight is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes and is also positively selected during domestication and breeding. in modern wheat breeding, genes controlling yield traits have undergone strong artificial selection and the frequency distributions of their variations are extremely uneven, and the alleles associated with ecological adaptation and favored agronomic traits are present at high frequency  <cit> .

our previous study investigated the distribution of tagw2-6a haplotypes in chinese and european wheat cultivars  <cit> . in this study, the distribution of tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b haplotypes are systematically described for six major regional wheat production regions worldwide, viz. china, us, canada, russia, australia, europe and mexico . haplotype hap-6a-a at tagw2-6a was favored in cultivars released in china, australia and russia, whereas hap-6a-g was frequent in other areas. in addition, hap-6a-a was mainly distributed in spring and weak-winter wheat cultivars with early maturity, which was favorable to increasing the multi-cropping index, whereas in winter and strong-winter wheat cultivars hap-6a-g was more frequent. this geographic difference in tagw2-6a haplotypes may be related to the breeding and planting environment. in contrast, the distribution of favored tagw2-6b haplotypes tended to be more consistent across global wheat cultivars, and favored haplotypes hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> have undergone strong positive selection and accumulation in breeding programs.

tagw <dig> negatively regulates grain weight, genotypes with lower expression were positively selected in breeding
in recent years scientists have been searching for key genes controlling kernel weight in cereals because it is a major component of yield. in rice, gs <dig>  gw <dig> and qsw <dig> negatively regulate grain size  <cit> . in contrast, gw <dig> and gs <dig> were isolated as positive regulators of grain size, and their higher expression levels could be involved in promoting cell division and ultimately increasing grain yield  <cit> . a comparative genomics study found that the expression level of the zmgw2-chr <dig> gene was negatively correlated with grain weight in maize  <cit> , and shared the same regulation pattern as gw <dig> in rice. gene tagw <dig> regulated grain size in wheat through variation in expression level  <cit> . snps in the tagw2-6a promoter region may be related to expression of different alleles, such as hap-6a-a and hap-6a-g. the regulation pattern of tagw2-6a was consistent with osgw <dig>  both of which negatively regulated grain width and weight  <cit> . yang et al. <cit>  identified a 1 bp insertion at the 977th base pair of tagw2-6a in cultivar lankaodali and a derived snp marker was used to genotype an f <dig> population derived from a cross of lankaodali  and chinese spring . compared with the tt genotype, the average increase in tt genotypes was  <dig>  mm for kw and  <dig>  g for tkw, indicating that tagw2-6a regulated grain width and grain weight. however, bednarek et al. <cit>  showed that rnai resulted in down-regulation of tagw <dig> expression in wheat, inducing significant decreases in grain parameters . they concluded that tagw <dig> positively regulated grain size in wheat. for relative expression analysis rt-pcr was performed at different seed development periods after flowering in the present study , in order to objectively evaluate the relationship between gene expression and grain size/weight. our results showed that the relative expression levels of the tagw2-a/b/d orthologs in developing seeds were all negatively correlated with grain width/weight.

the cis-elements in promoter regions of tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b were predicted by plantcare. more cis-elements were found on hap-6a-a than on hap-6a-g. due to the snp at -2070 bp, there is an endosperm tissue-specific expression element gcn4_motif in hap-6a-a, but in corresponding region of hap-6a-g, it is an aba response element, abre . for tagw2-6b locus, at -929 bp, a g-box was detected in hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig>  an auxin responsive element  was found in hap-6b- <dig> at -1709 bp, an abre was detected in hap-6b- <dig>  hap-6b- <dig> and hap-6b- <dig> . the influence of these cis-elements on tagw <dig> expression need to be further elucidated in the future.

moreover, the average relative expression level of tagw2-6a was higher than that of tagw2-6b and tagw2-6d, and the phenotypic explanation rate  for grain traits explained by tagw2-6b was higher than that of tagw2-6a in both landraces and modern cultivars . therefore, the lower the relative expression level of a tagw <dig> gene, the higher its r <dig> value, indicating that grain size is negatively regulated by tagw <dig> genes. thus among the three tagw <dig> homoeologous genes, the average expression of tagw2-6a during the grain development was the highest, but its r <dig> was the lowest. tagw2-6d gene was the most conservative with the lowest mean expression among the three homoeologous genes, and its r <dig> was estimated to be the highest. there are three possible reasons for lack of diversity at tagw2-6d locus. firstly, during evolution from tetraploid to hexaploid wheat, the increase in kw was larger than that in kl. secondly, the d genome has much lower diversity than the a- or b- genomes in common wheat  <cit> . thirdly, tagw2-6d has the strongest effect on tkw, and it underwent strong positive selection and fixation in early domestication of hexaploid wheat   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
haplotypes, expression, genetic effects and geographic distribution of wheat yield gene tagw <dig> were analyzed. major variations occurred at their promoter regions in the three homoeologous genes. expression levels of tagw2s were negatively correlated with tkw, which further supported earlier conclusion that the gw <dig> negatively regulates grain size in cereals. haplotype interaction analysis exhibited the additive effects between favored haplotypes at tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b. we also found that haplotypes at tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b underwent strong selection in one century of global wheat breeding. therefore, there are major genes even though yield is a complex quantitative trait. it illustrated that association based on haplotypes is more effective than single marker in dissection of complex traits. this study provided important genes and functional markers for mas in wheat yield improvement.
