BACKGROUND
shikonins are red naphthoquinone pigments, which possess anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour activities  <cit> . these are active ingredient in several pharmaceutical and cosmetics preparations, and used as dye for fabrics and food items  <cit> . commercially, shikonins are extracted from roots of lithospermum erythrorhizon with  <dig> - <dig> % yield  <cit> . arnebia  is another plant species that yields  <dig> - <dig> % shikonins from roots  <cit> . the plant is naturally distributed in drier regions of asia and northern africa  <cit> . in india, it is well distributed in cold desert areas of lahaul and spiti district of himachal pradesh  at an altitude of > <dig> m above mean sea level  <cit> .

shikonins are composed of p-hydroxybenzoate  and an isoprenoid moiety derived from geranyl pyrophosphate . phb is synthesized through phenylpropanoid  pathway, whereas gpp can be synthesized through cytosolic mevalonate   <cit>  and plastid 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate   <cit>  pathway. in mva pathway , three molecules of acetyl-coa couple to yield 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa , which is reduced by the enzyme hmg-coa reductase  to yield mva. in the next two steps, mevalonate kinase  and mevalonate 5-phosphate kinase  catalyses conversion of mva to form mevalonate 5-diphosphate , which in turn is decarboxylated to yield isopentenyl pyrophosphate . ipp is converted into geranyl pyrophosphate  using the enzyme geranyl diphosphate synthase .

mep pathway involves condensation of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to yield 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate  using the enzyme dxp synthase . dxp yields 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  by a reaction catalysed by dxp reductoisomerase , and mep is then transformed into ipp  <cit>  followed by its conversion into gpp, as in the mva pathway.

supply of gpp is critical in realizing the yield of isoprenoids  <cit> , therefore, study on regulation of gene expression in gpp biosynthesis is of immense significance. depending upon the metabolite and species under consideration, the preference for the route to gpp biosynthesis might differ. for example, natural rubber relies on mva pathway, whereas stevioside is derived through mep pathway  <cit> .

gpp and phb are coupled through a reaction catalysed by p-hydroxybenzoate-m-geranyltransferase  to yield m-geranyl-p-hydroxybenzoate , which later leads to the biosynthesis of shikonins  <cit> . earlier work on shikonins biosynthesis was carried out in l. erythrorhizon using one gene of the mva pathway , three genes of pp pathway , and pgt. hmgr and pgt were shown to be regulatory genes in l. erythrorhizon  <cit> . information on other genes in relation to shikonins biosynthesis, however, has not been reported for l. erythrorhizon. arnebia is an important source for shikonins with no molecular data on any of the genes involved in shikonins biosynthesis. also, the relative importance of mva or mep pathway in relation to shikonins is not yet reported. therefore, the present research was carried out in arnebia to  identify the major gpp synthesizing pathways  contributing to shikonins biosynthesis,  clone various genes of the pathway, and  understand expression regulation of the genes of the identified pathway. the knowledge so generated will help to understand molecular basis of shikonins biosynthesis in arnebia and would lay basis of metabolic engineering for this important moiety.

RESULTS
inhibitor studies suggested mva as a preferred pathway for shikonins biosynthesis
to facilitate inhibitor studies, protocols for cell suspension culture were developed wherein shikonins content could be modulated. shikonins content was recorded in traces  in suspension cultures maintained in growth medium . the content, increased to  <dig>  mgl- <dig> at day  <dig> of transfer of cultures from growth medium into production medium m <dig> . shikonins content increased to  <dig>  mgl- <dig> at day  <dig> of the transfer to production medium m <dig> and declined thereafter, possibly due to senescence. the shikonins content remained in traces in lsps during the entire period of experimentation.

at day zero , when shikonins content was negligible, mevinolin  and fosmidomycin  were added separately at three different concentrations  and the samples were harvested at day  <dig> and day  <dig> of the treatment.

lower concentration  of mevinolin was found to be less effective as compared to the higher concentrations  to inhibit shikonins production . a similar level of inhibition observed in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> μm of mevinolin suggested  <dig> μm to be optimal concentration for further experimentation. of the day  <dig> and day  <dig> of the treatment, maximum inhibition was observed at day  <dig> of the inhibitor treatment wherein shikonins content was lower by  <dig> % of the control . however, shikonins content was not reduced so drastically in the presence of fosmidomycin and the value was  <dig> % of the control at day  <dig> of the treatment. these results suggested the predominant role of mva pathway in shikonins biosynthesis in arnebia.

twelve genes associated with mva pathway, pp pathway and ghb biosynthesis were cloned
since mva was a predominant pathway for gpp supply for shikonins biosynthesis, all the genes of the pathway were cloned along with those associated with pp pathway and ghb biosynthesis. degenerate primers for aeacth, aehmgs, aemvk, aepmvk, aemvdd, aegdps, aeippi, aepal, aec4h and ae4-cl yielded  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp sized amplicons, respectively . though in polymerase chain reaction  several amplicons were obtained in some of the cases, but the amplicons mentioned above were the ones which exhibited strong homology with the reported genes in the database. partial gene sequences allowed designing of primers for rapid amplification of cdna ends  to clone full-length genes. as mentioned in methods section, availability of expressed sequence tag  for aehmgr and aepgt in the est databank, facilitated designing of primers of these two genes for race.

size and accession number of all the partial and full-length cdnas are mentioned in additional file 2: supplementary table s <dig>  ten full-length cdnas namely, aeacth , aehmgr , aepmvk , aemvdd , aeippi , aegdps , aepgt , aepal , aec4h  and ae4-cl  could be cloned. in spite of several attempts, full-length cdnas of aemvk and aehmgs could not be cloned. nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cloned genes are provided in additional file 3: supplementary figure s <dig>  whereas sequence alignment with the respective reported sequences from other plants is provided in additional file 4: supplementary figure s <dig>  characteristics domains in deduced amino acid sequences of the genes are mentioned in additional file 5: supplementary figure s <dig>  sopma  analysis for prediction of secondary structures in terms of helices, β turns, extended strands and random coils is provided in additional file 6: supplementary figure s4).

deduced amino acid sequence of all the genes possessed the required motifs and secondary structures , which are essential to render characteristic functionality, as described previously in other plant systems. these examples include acth from raphanus sativus  <cit> ; hmgs from brassica juncea  <cit> ; hmgr  <cit> ; mvk  <cit> , mvdd  <cit> , ippi  <cit> , 4-cl  <cit> , and pal  <cit>  from arabidopsis thaliana; gdps from abies grandis  <cit> ; c4h from populus trichocarpa × populus deltoides  <cit>  and pgt from l. erythrorhizon  <cit> .

down-regulation of all the twelve genes in response to mevinolin treatment
amplicons of aeacth, aehmgs, aehmgr, aepmvk, aemvdd, aegdps, aeippi, aepgt, aepal, aec4h and ae4-cl exhibited down-regulation starting from day  <dig> of the mevinolin treatment. at day  <dig>  amplicons were hardly visible in mevinolin treated cells. the genes expressed well in untreated control throughout the experimentation period suggesting extreme down-regulation of the genes in response to mevinolin treatment. unlike mevinolin, fosmidomycin did not affect expression of these genes throughout the experimentation period . at day  <dig> of the treatment, correlation coefficient between shikonins content and idv of the amplicons was found to be  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   indicating a positive correlation between the shikonins content and gene expression .

correlation coefficient was calculated using integrated density value  of gene expression and the shikonins content in response to the inhibitor  and hsps , separately. idv is mentioned in additional file 7: supplementary figure s <dig> and additional file 8: supplementary figure s <dig>  for figure  <dig> linear portion of increase in shikonins content, i.e. day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig> and day  <dig>  were considered and accordingly the idv of gene expression

kinetics of gene expression vis-à-vis shikonins content in lsps and hsps identified critical genes
shikonins content in hsps was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mgl- <dig> at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively of sub-culturing of suspension culture into production medium. however in lsps, shikonins content at above days was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mgl- <dig>  respectively . analysis of all the twelve genes in hsps and lsps on the above days showed evident up-regulation of aehmgr at day  <dig> onwards and the expression was 94-148% in hsps as compared to lsps.

aepgt showed up-regulation by 141- <dig> % in hsps as compared to lsps. the genes of pp pathway namely, aepal, aec4h and ae4-cl also exhibited higher up-regulation of gene expression in hsps as compared to lsps at day  <dig> onwards. expression of aeacth, aehmgs, aemvk, aepmvk, aemvdd, aeippi and aegdps was very similar in lsps and hsps during the entire period of experimentation . the correlation coefficient between shikonins content and idv of the amplicons in hsps had a value of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and,  <dig>  for aehmgr, aepgt, aepal, aec4h and ae4-cl, respectively .

discussion
the pp and isoprenoid pathways synthesize array of secondary metabolites, which perform diverse functions in plants ranging from growth and development to defense. some of these compounds have economic values and also have implications to human health. red coloured, bioactive shikonins are such molecules which are used in food, fabric and pharmaceutical industries  <cit> .

chemically, shikonins are composed of isoprenoid  and phb moieties, which are also referred to as yield determining moieties  <cit> . plants have single pp pathway for the synthesis of phb, whereas gpp is synthesised through mva and mep pathways. the preference for mva versus mep pathway depends upon the metabolites and the plant species under consideration  <cit> . coupling of the two moieties, gpp and phb, is mediated through the enzyme pgt encoded by pgt.

biosynthesis of shikonins predominantly uses mva pathway for gpp supply
relative contribution of mva versus mep pathway towards shikonins biosynthesis was assessed by using mevinolin and fosmidomycin, which are inhibitors of hmgr  and dxr , respectively  <cit> . for such a study, a cell suspension culture-based system was developed wherein shikonins content increased from negligible quantity by  <dig>  fold from day zero to day  <dig> of transferring the suspension cultures from lsps to hsps . inclusion of mevinolin produced a severe inhibition  in shikonins accumulation , whereas fosmidomycin produced a comparatively milder  inhibition. data thus implies a prominent role of mva pathway in shikonins biosynthesis, though a role of mep pathway can not be completely ruled out. the results are slightly different from l. erythrorhizon in which mevinolin inhibited the shikonins biosynthesis by 98%  <cit>  suggesting that gpp for shikonins biosynthesis was derived from the mva pathway. involvement of both mva and mep pathway in terpenoid biosynthesis has been reported for dolichols biosynthesis in coluria geoides  <cit> , which might also be the case in arnebia.

mevinolin down-regulated expression of all the twelve genes involved in gpp and ghb biosynthesis
mevinolin is a known inhibitor of the enzyme hmgr. down-regulation of expression of hmgr mrna was reported in l. erythrorhizon in response to mevinolin treatment  <cit> . information on the effect of mevinolin on expression of other genes of shikonins biosynthesis pathway is not available in l. erythrorhizon. our data showed that mevinolin down-regulated expression of all the eight genes involved in mva pathway, all the three gene of pp pathway and aepgt . application of fosmidomycin had no effect on expression of these genes. data suggested a substrate/product mediated feed-back and feed-forward regulation of the genes under study. for hmgr, its post-transcriptional and post-translational feedback regulation was suggested in the experiments using arabidopsis treated with lovastatin   <cit> . previously, dixon et al.  <cit>  reported that endogenous cinnamate  caused inhibition of both transcription and enzymatic activity of pal. rani et al.  <cit>  reported catechin-mediated down-regulation of several genes of pp pathway. in animal system, mva pathway involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, has long been known to be regulated by end-product feedback inhibition and this regulation has been attributed to direct regulation of the expression of several cholesterol biosynthetic genes by the sterol sensing sterol regulatory element  binding protein- <dig>   <cit> . in yeast and higher plants, mvk was subjected to feed-back inhibition by gpp and fpp  <cit> , suggesting feed-back inhibition by prenyl phosphates as a general regulatory mechanism to modulate the activity of mvk.

existing literature thus supports the view of substrate mediated feedback inhibition, possibly that has been observed for hmgr, mvk and pal. overall down-regulation of other genes in response to mevinolin and fosmidomycin needs further investigations on substrate/product mediated feed-back and feed-forward regulation of the genes.

not all genes exhibited up-regulation in hsps
lsps and hsps provided a convenient system to study the possible regulatory genes in shikonins biosynthesis. analysis of all the twelve genes showed that aehmgr , and aepgt  exhibited evident up-regulation in hsps as compared to lsps from day  <dig> onwards. generally an up-regulation of all the genes of pp pathway was noticed in hsps as compared to the lsps. earlier reports suggested hmgr enzyme to play a key role in the control of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants  <cit> . lange et al.  <cit>  proposed the importance of hmgr as an early enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis to control the metabolic flux into the mva pathway, in contrast to the stringently regulated later enzymes controlling the biosynthesis of specific end products. our data also suggested that aehmgr could be an important regulatory gene in shikonins biosynthesis, since a strong positive correlation  was obtained between its expression and the shikonins content .

a requirement of higher pp pathway appeared to be general feature for shikonins biosynthesis in arnebia as evidenced by higher expression of the three genes . pp supplies phb which is a substrate involved in shikonins biosynthesis  <cit> . while in l. erythrorhizon genes of pp pathway did not exhibit any specific trend in relation to shikonins biosynthesis  <cit> , data on arnebia appears to be in line with the previous reports on tea  <cit>  wherein all the three genes of pp pathway were reported to be regulatory.

aepgt encodes for pgt enzyme involved in ghb biosynthesis. this gene also showed up-regulation  in hsps and was positively correlated  with shikonins content. heide and tabata  <cit>  reported high  activity of pgt enzyme in shikonins producing culture extracts of l. erythrorhizon as compared to the non-shikonins producing system suggesting pgt to be important in regulating of biosynthesis of shikonins.

CONCLUSIONS
arnebia prominently uses mva pathway for the synthesis of gpp to be utilized in shikonins biosynthesis. analyses of all the twelve genes suggested the importance of aehmgr, all the genes of pp pathway and aepgt in realizing the shikonins yield in arnebia. this is the first report wherein twelve genes of shikonins biosynthesis pathway have been analysed to identify the regulatory genes and hence have implications in synthetic biology for shikonins production.
