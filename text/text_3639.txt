BACKGROUND
the term 'inflammatory bowel disease'  refers to a heterogeneous collection of conditions characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, and includes crohn's disease  and ulcerative colitis   <cit> . while there is some overlap in disease pathology, cd and uc also have distinct pathologic features; cd can, for example, affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas uc is confined to the colon and rectum, often causing diarrhea. the inflammation seen in cd is typically discontinuous, segmental and involves all layers of the intestinal wall. in uc, inflammation tends to be continuous and superficial, only affecting the mucosal layer of the colonic wall  <cit> .

the exact etiology and pathogenesis of ibd is still unclear, although there is strong epidemiological evidence for a genetic contribution to disease susceptibility. several candidate genes for ibd susceptibility have been identified, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing  <dig>   <cit> , tumour necrosis factor   <cit> , members of the toll-like receptor  family  <cit> , il- <dig>  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit> , and a number of genes encoding transporter molecules, such as the atp-binding cassette, sub-family b , member  <dig>   <cit>  and solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig>  genes  <cit> .

the il- <dig> gene deficient  mouse has been used as a model of ibd  <cit> . these mice, when bred onto a c57bl/6j  background, have been reported to develop cd-like colitis by  <dig> weeks of age when raised under conventional conditions  <cit> , while female  <dig> ola × c57il10-/- mice have been shown to develop colitis from  <dig> weeks of age under specific pathogen free  conditions  <cit> .

the precise mechanism that results in inflammation in il10-/- mice is unclear, although, as is the case in human ibd, there is evidence of an inappropriate inflammatory response to normal intestinal flora  <cit> .

clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis have been shown to induce ibd-like symtoms in germ-free il10-/- mice  <cit> . enterococcus species are a common component of the intestinal flora of healthy humans and animals  <cit> , comprising up to 1% of the adult microflora  <cit> . enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are the two species most commonly detected in the human bowel  <cit> , and both are known to carry a variety of virulence factors  which may play a role in the establishment of inflammation.

based on these published studies, and on our own observations of only mild inflammation in  <dig> week old il10-/- mice  that were raised under conventional conditions , we decided to establish bacterially-inoculated il10-/- mice as a model of ibd in order to test food-gene interactions associated with ibd. we tested two hypotheses:  that oral inoculation of il10-/- mice with a mixture of pure enterococcus isolates , alone or combined with conventional intestinal flora derived from healthy and conventionally raised c <dig> mice, would result in greater and more consistent intestinal inflammation than that observed in il10-/- mice not receiving this inoculation, and  that this inflammation would be associated with changes in colon gene expression levels in key pathways similar to those previously observed in human studies, and these mice would therefore be an appropriate model for human cd  <cit> .

we have previously published body weight, histology and preliminary gene expression data using this mouse model  <cit> . here we describe in detail gene expression changes in colonic tissue in response to bacterial inoculation in il10-/- on a c <dig> background, measured using high density oligonucleotide microarrays.

RESULTS
animal body weight
there was no difference in mean body weight between il10-/- and c <dig> mice at the start of the experiment . as reported previously  <cit> , il10-/- mice in the conventional conditions  and ef·cif groups gained less weight during the course of the trial, both when compared to similarly-inoculated c <dig> mice, and when compared to il10-/- mice in the other three treatment groups.

intestinal histology
total intestinal histology results have been reported elsewhere, in which colon was shown to be the intestinal section most susceptible to inflammation  <cit> . a more detailed analysis of the colon histology results showed that inflammatory cell infiltration was the most prominent feature of the observed inflammation in inoculated il10-/- mice , and was significantly higher in these animals, when compared with c <dig> mice in the same group, or when compared with non-inoculated il10-/- mice . furthermore, il10-/- mice inoculated with ef inocula  showed significantly higher tissue destruction, both when compared with similarly-inoculated c <dig> mice, and when compared with il10-/- under spf and c conditions .

plasma serum amyloid a 
overall, plasma saa levels were higher in il10-/- mice compared with c <dig> mice , and this difference between mouse strains was also significant in each of the treatment groups . the interaction between strain and group was not significant , and no overall significant within-strain effect of treatment group was detected . while the lack of a significant between-strain difference in mice inoculated with ef·cif seems to be due to the presence of two outliers , there is no data from any other observations which would justify the removal of these values. these data are summarized in table  <dig> 

data represent mean ± sd of plasma levels of saa and il- <dig> for  <dig> mice  fed ain-76a diet, and in treatment groups described in the legend to table  <dig>  p-values are for across-group comparisons between il10-/- and c <dig> mice under the same treatment conditions . superscript letters denote mice with values significantly different  from mice of the same strain in different treatment groups as follows:  ef-inoculated il10-/- mice showed significantly higher il-1α levels than il10-/- mice in the c and cif groups;  il- <dig> in the ef groups was significantly lower than in the spf and c groups in both mouse strains;  il- <dig> in the ef·cif group was significantly lower than that in the spf group in both mouse strains;  across the c <dig> mice, those receiving the ef·cif inoculation had significantly lower il- <dig> levels than either ef or spf;  il10-/- mice in the ef inoculation group had significantly higher il- <dig> than all other il10-/- treatment groups except for ef·cif.

a small number of saa values were negative . because these data were log transformed , a constant was added to all values before transformation. this constant was  <dig> , being the absolute value of the minimum recorded value  plus  <dig> .

plasma cytokines
for five of the cytokines measured , and il-17), there were four or fewer non-zero values across the dataset, thus no statistical analysis was performed. data from analysis of the remaining five plasma cytokines are summarized in table  <dig> 

microarrays
we have previously described microarray data from these experiments comparing il10-/- mice with c <dig> mice in each of the five treatment groups  <cit> . the total number of probes differentially expressed in any of the within-treatment  comparisons was  <dig> , and this set was used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering. this analysis grouped the array slides into two main clusters: inoculated il10-/- in one cluster, and c <dig> mice and non-inoculated il10-/- mice in the other cluster .

we therefore decided to focus on genes differentially expressed when comparing inoculated il10-/- mice  with il10-/- mice not receiving an inoculation, in order to better understand interactions or relationships between genes which may be leading to the increased inflammation observed in the inoculated mice , and to compare these changes with those previously observed in human ibd .

there were no significant differences in expression  of any probes between il10-/- mice in the c or spf groups at  <dig> weeks of age, thus subsequent analysis of gene expression changes in inoculated il10-/- mice was with those in the c group. il10-/- in the cif group had approximately  <dig>  gene probes differentially expressed compared to those in group c, while il10-/- mice inoculated with ef or ef·cif had over  <dig>  differentially expressed probes when compared with il10-/- mice in group c .

data represent numbers of differentially expressed genes for each comparison, calculated using bioconductor 'limma analysis' package. false discovery rate control of q <  <dig>  was used as a filtering criterion, and the fold-change cut-off listed applied to each group to reduce the network eligible genes for ingenuity pathways analysis to  <dig> ±  <dig>  the most significant functions were identified using ingenuity pathway analysis software. total rna from colon tissue was used for microarray hybridization to agilent technologies  <dig> k  mouse  <dig> mer oligonucleotide arrays. data represent mean values from two pools of rna for each mouse strain, with rna from either two or three mice in each pool.

comparison with human ibd
thirty two genes are known to undergo changes in transcriptional activity in ibd  <cit> . in order to assess the relevance of the inoculation protocols used in our study to that of human disease, we compared changes in expression of these thirty-two genes across each of the treatment groups. these results, summarised in table  <dig>  show that the two inoculations containing ef strains were most effective in mimicking human ibd on the basis of gene expression changes, in particular with respect to changes in gene expression levels of cytokines and chemokines and their receptors.

data represent differentially expressed genes for each comparison in common with the  <dig> genes shown to be differentially expressed in human ibd, with the "transfer" column showing data from a cd45rb transfer colitis model previously published by te velde et al  <cit> . total rna from colon tissue was used for microarray hybridization to agilent technologies  <dig> k  mouse  <dig> mer oligonucleotide arrays. data represent mean values from two pools of rna for each mouse strain, with rna from either two or three mice in each pool. in the case of significantly differentially expressed genes, the text is shown in italics, and denoted by superscript letters where p <  <dig>  is represented by a, p <  <dig>  by b, and p <  <dig>  by c. the total number of differentially expressed genes in each comparison  is shown at the bottom of the table.

ingenuity pathways analysis
in order to examine those molecules directly interacting with il- <dig> , the neighbourhood explorer function of ipa was used. the network neighborhood of il- <dig> consists of  <dig> molecules which have been identified as directly interacting with il- <dig>  the number of differentially expressed genes  within this network as a result of the treatments was as follows: spf ; c ; ef ; cif ; ef·cif . two genes of interest in this comparison were regenerating islet-derived  <dig> beta   and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor , as these were the only genes which showed significantly higher expression in il10-/- mice in the spf, c and cif groups , but for which there was no difference in the ef and ef·cif groups. the expression of reg3b mrna was between 4- and 8-fold higher in the colon of il10-/- mice in the spf and c and cif groups when compared to c <dig> mice in the same groups, but there was no differential expression of this molecule in the ef and ef·cif groups . in the case of the related reg3g gene, while its expression was higher in il10-/- mice in all experimental groups, the difference was greatest in the c and cif groups , less in the spf and ef·cif groups  and lowest in the ef group . in the case of pigr, expression was higher in the spf , c  and cif  groups when comparing il10-/- mice with c <dig> mice, but there was no difference in the ef or ef·cif groups.

in order to better understand the effect of the ef·cif inoculation in il10-/- mice compared with the same inoculation in c <dig> mice, genes from the top five canonical pathways on the basis of ipa p-value  were combined with those from the top five on the basis of calculated ratio . a network was built by connecting these molecules according to their interactions, as determined by the ipa knowledge base . a similar analysis was performed for ef·cif-inoculated il10-/- mice compared to il10-/- mice which were not inoculated , figure 4).

genes or gene products are represented as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line . all edges are supported by at least  <dig> reference from the literature. red and green colored nodes indicate genes with up- and down-regulated expression, respectively. the intensity of the colors specifies the degree of up- or down-regulation. greater intensity represents a higher level of differential expression. nodes and edges are displayed with various shapes and labels that present the functional class of genes and the nature of the relationships between the nodes, as shown in legend below the figure.

key molecules in the il10-/-  comparison were: ifnγ, tnf, stat <dig>  il-1β and suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  and socs <dig>  these molecules also appear to be important when comparing ef·cif-inoculated il10-/- with c <dig> receiving the same inoculation , as do peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha  and tlr <dig>  conversely, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory il- <dig> gene were reduced in the il10-/-  comparison, and in figure  <dig>  il- <dig> is shown to interact directly with five other molecules in the network; in contrast, this molecule does not feature in the ef·cif  comparison .

quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
for the three xenobiotic metabolism genes selected for qrt-pcr validation  the reduced expression in inoculated il10-/- mice observed in the microarray analysis was confirmed  by qrt-pcr. in the case of the immune response genes ifng and ncf <dig>  the direction of the gene expression change  was confirmed, but the magnitude of the change for ifng was higher in the pcr analysis compared to the microarray results .

discussion
our study clearly shows that oral inoculation of  <dig> week old il10-/- mice  with a bacterial preparation  results in consistent and increased colon inflammation at  <dig> weeks of age, compared with il10-/- mice which were not inoculated . these tissue changes were similar to those seen in human ibd, and were accompanied by significant changes in expression of genes involved in 'immune response', 'inflammatory diseases' and 'antigen presentation'.

histological analysis
several studies have reported the development of intestinal inflammation in il10-/- mice when raised under either spf or conventional conditions in the absence of bacterial inoculation  <cit> . it has been also reported that the induction of ibd-like colitis  in the il10-/- mouse is dependent on the background mouse strain  being more resistant to the development of intestinal inflammation  <cit> ) and the commensal bacteria to which the mice are exposed  <cit> . we observed no significant difference in intestinal inflammation between il10-/- mice  and c <dig> control mice when kept in either spf or conventional conditions. in addition, comparison of colon gene expression levels between il10-/- and c <dig> mice in these two treatment groups showed relatively few changes in the current study. the il10-/- mice in these studies were brought in from the jackson laboratory , were free of all tested viruses, bacteria and mycoplasma and other opportunistic organisms, and were maintained under quarantine during the trial. it therefore seems likely that the failure of these mice to develop inflammation under conventional conditions is due at least in part to insufficient exposure to commensal intestinal bacteria. our results clearly demonstrate that, in the absence of such bacterial exposure and in the conventional conditions used in our study, the il10-/- mouse on a c <dig> background at  <dig> weeks of age is not a suitable model for human ibd.

relevance of bacterial inoculation
all of the inoculation protocols we tested resulted in increased intestinal  inflammation in il10-/- mice, both when compared with similarly-inoculated c <dig> mice and when compared with il10-/- mice which received no inoculation . although the cif inoculation showed some evidence of colon inflammation, based on his the two inoculation preparations containing enterococcus species  were more effective in the induction of inflammation. in particular, the ef·cif inoculation resulted in a significant increase in overall his, with the greatest effect observed in the colon. the nature of the inflammation within the colon was transmural and discontinuous, affecting different layers of the intestinal wall, similar to human cd  <cit> . our findings for the il10-/- mice inoculated with enterococcus species are in agreement with those of other studies where these bacterial species have been shown to induce inflammation in il10-/- mice  <cit> . our results support observations that inoculation of il10-/- mice with enterococcus species gives rise to characteristics of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as a dysregulated immune response acting in combination with inflammatory mechanisms that may lead to tissue damage.

this study used enterococcus strains isolated from calves and poultry, and there were several reasons for this. first, these strains were readily available, and there is clear evidence in the literature that enterococcus species induce inflammation in this mouse model  <cit> ; establishing a relevant mouse model of ibd within our laboratory was the key goal of these studies. furthermore, enterococci are ubiquitous as a gastrointestinal bacterium in warm-blooded animals, and using those strains isolated from calves ensured that we included enterococci from a mammalian host. lastly, all strains were fecal isolates, and therefore derived from an appropriate environment.

we do not have specific information on the relationship of these isolates to those derived from mice. it is possible that some virulence factors in poultry may be different from calves, which may be different from mice. however, we have shown that the enterococci, either alone or in combination with cif derived from control mice, trigger inflammation regardless of the fact that they are from a different host. thus the original host may be immaterial, and there is some factor  common to enterococcus strains which triggers inflammation in a genetically predisposed host. other studies have used human oral enterococcus isolates in il10-/- mice  <cit> , which also suggests that there is no host specificity.

finally, while the ability of the bacteria within the various inocula to colonize, and to persist, within the murine gut was not established in this study, neither colonisation nor persistence is necessarily a pre-requisite if the appropriate inflammatory response is observed even from transiently dosed enterococci. thus, although the long-term fate of the inoculated bacteria within the murine gut was not established, the consequences of the inoculation in terms of intestinal inflammation, which was the key outcome of the study, have been clearly established.

gene expression profile in inoculated il10-/- mice
each of the inoculation procedures induced changes in the expression levels of a large number of genes, both when comparing il10-/- mice with similarly inoculated c <dig> mice and when comparing the inoculated il10-/- mice with those raised under conventional conditions.

it is apparent from the unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of all differentially expressed genes  that the various groups of mice fall into two main clusters, with c <dig> mice and il10-/- mice in the spf and c groups  in one, and inoculated il10-/- mice in the other. the il10-/- mice that did not receive any inoculation were clustered more closely with the c <dig> mice than with those il10-/- mice which did receive a bacterial inoculation. this confirms the histological observation that, in the absence of bacterial inoculation, the il10-/- mouse on a c <dig> background at  <dig> weeks of age is not a suitable model for human ibd in the conditions used for our study. furthermore, bacterial inoculation led to many more changes in the expression of genes that would normally interact with il- <dig> 

of the three inoculation protocols, cif appears to be the least effective in triggering intestinal inflammation, showing the lowest number of relevant differentially expressed genes. this is in agreement with published studies showing enterococcus species to be particularly effective in triggering inflammation in the il10-/- mouse model.

expression levels of mrna encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-γ, tnf-α, and il- <dig> in colon tissue were higher in inoculated il10-/- mice compared with c <dig> mice, regardless of the inoculation, although mrna expression of the pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> was lower in the colon of ef·cif-inoculated mice. the pro-inflammatory il- <dig> was detected in plasma samples at higher levels in both ef and ef·cif-inoculated il10-/- mice compared with similarly inoculated c <dig> mice and  compared with non-inoculated il10-/- mice, although there was no difference in the colon mrna levels of il- <dig> for these two inoculations as determined by microarray analysis. il- <dig>  a pleiotropic cytokine, has been shown to play a crucial role in the chronic inflammatory process in ibd  <cit> . this cytokine is produced by macrophages, lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells in response to intestinal microflora  <cit>  and stimulates t-cell expansion via anti-apoptopic signaling  <cit> . t-cell accumulation increases il- <dig> levels and thereby a vicious cycle is induced, leading to chronic inflammation. while there were also some differences in the concentrations of other plasma cytokines both within and across strains , the levels of th1/th <dig> cytokines measured in plasma samples were generally low or undetectable. in future studies, inflammatory markers such as these th1/th <dig> cytokines could be measured at the site of inflammation to confirm observed gene expression changes, and further verify the relevance of this model of ibd. our findings are in agreement with observations that the pathogenesis of ibd in humans is mediated in part through an imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . our inoculated il10-/- mice showed a cytokine profile  that is characteristic of the cd inflammatory response. cd is thought to be dominated by a t-helper - <dig> response  <cit> , with increased production of ifnγ  <cit>  and il- <dig>  <cit> . tnf-α has been identified as a key pathogenic cytokine for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as cd  <cit> .

as shown in table  <dig>  this is further supported by the fact that inoculation of il10-/- mice with enterococcus strains led to differential expression  of many of the thirty two genes  previously identified in the literature as being relevant to ibd in human studies  <cit> , including the atp-binding cassette  transporter abcb1a. our study is also in agreement with other studies using il10-/- mice, in which mhc class ii mrna expression levels in cecal samples was increased, and cytochrome-p <dig> expression was decreased  <cit> . we observed up-regulation of mhc class ii molecule mrna  and down-regulation of mrna expression of several cytochrome p <dig> genes , as well as a sulfotransferase , a carboxylesterase  and the atp-binding cassette  transporters abcb1b, abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> in the colon of ef·cif-inoculated il10-/- mice. other xenobiotic metabolism genes such as aldo-keto reductases , a flavin containing monooxygenase , and three of the genes selected for rt-pcr validation  were also down-regulated. a decrease in the expression of detoxification enzymes and transporters may be an effect secondary to the occurrence of inflammation; both inflammation and infection are known to down-regulate the activity and expression levels of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters  <cit> .

our results clearly show that expression of mrna encoding the cd <dig> protein, a receptor expressed on the surface of macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils which is essential for lps-dependent signal transduction via tlr <dig>  <cit> , was up-regulated in il10-/- mice as a result of bacterial inoculation, particularly associated with ef inoculation . this could be a mechanism by which inflammation is initiated in our mouse model of ibd. quantitative trait loci and microarray analyses of intestinal tissues of two il10-/- strains with divergent susceptibility to developing inflammation, c3h/hejbir il10-/- mice  and c <dig> il10-/- mice , identified cd <dig> as a candidate gene associated with this difference in susceptibility  <cit> . in addition, a polymorphism in the human cd <dig> promoter  was shown to be associated with both cd  <cit>  and uc  <cit> . both of these studies refer to genetic susceptibility to inflammation associated with cd <dig>  while our study shows a change in the expression of cd <dig> mrna in inflamed mice, possibly caused by increased cell influx, thus they are not directly comparable. all of these studies do, however, highlight the potential importance of cd <dig> in the initiation of intestinal inflammation.

in the current study, reg3b mrna levels were higher in the colon of il10-/- mice in the spf and c  and cif  groups when compared to c <dig> mice in the same groups, but not in the ef and ef·cif groups, which showed more severe signs of inflammation ; a similar pattern was observed for the reg3g gene. reg3b and reg3g are expressed in mouse intestine  <cit> , and encode murine orthologues of human pancreatitis-associated proteins  which may be involved in the innate immune response to bacterial colonisation of the intestinal tract  <cit>  and can inhibit the inflammatory response by blocking nfκb activation  <cit> .

the reg3b and reg3g genes are induced after development of intestinal inflammation in germ-free severe combined immunodeficiency  mice colonised with commensal bacteria  <cit> , and bacterial-epithelial contact may drive reg3g expression as a mechanism to limit microbial penetration and maintain mucosal surface integrity  <cit> . in our study, the fact that expression levels of both reg3b and reg3g were lower in il10-/- mice inoculated with enterococcus strains relative those in the c and cif groups may reflect an inability of these mice to appropriately respond to this inoculation, and a failure to effectively deal with the additional enterococci introduced via inoculation  <cit> . alternatively, lower overall expression levels of these two reg <dig> genes in response to enterococcus inoculation may result in insufficient suppression of the immune response, potentially a crucial early step in the initiation and development of intestinal inflammation in these mice. this is in agreement with studies in the il2-/- mouse model, where increased expression levels of reg3b and reg3g genes might be associated with prevention of colitis triggered by colonization with commensal e. coli  <cit> . while the levels of reg3b may be sufficient to explain the lack of phenotype in the spf/c groups , the absence of il <dig>  in the il10-/- mice may mean that insufficient reg3b is expressed to suppress inflammation induced by enterococci. it is not clear from the literature what constitutes a 'suppressive' amount of reg3b in a colitic phenotype, and further studies would be required to establish this, and to clarify functional roles of either reg3b or reg3g in enterococcus-induced inflammation in this model.

the decreased expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor  mrna in il10-/- mice in the ef and ef·cif groups showed a similar pattern of expression to reg3b in our study. the protein product of the pigr gene is a glycoprotein expressed on the basolateral surface of secretory columnar and crypt epithelial cells, and is responsible for active transport of secretory antibodies such as iga across the secretory epithelium that lines the mucosal surfaces. studies with pigr knockout  mice have produced strong evidence that innate secretory antibodies protect against invasion by pathogenic bacteria via immune exclusion; these mice are unable to bind and actively transport dimeric iga to the mucosa and thus are more susceptible to infection with virulent strains such as salmonella  <cit> . furthermore, pigr-/- mice exhibit profound immunopathological changes and clinical disease in response to induction of colitis with dextran sulfate sodium, suggesting that pigr may play an important role in modulating inflammatory responses in the mucosa during active colitis  <cit> . the low pigr gene expression in our il10-/- mice receiving an inoculation with enterococcus strains suggests a reduced capacity to prevent induction of a systemic immune response, a possible mechanism by which otherwise harmless commensal bacterial strains may have initiated the chronic inflammation observed in these two treatment groups.

in the current study, antigen presentation genes such as major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules  family members - h2-ab <dig>  h2-aa, h2-eb <dig> and cd74) showed higher expression levels in colon in il10-/- mice in all treatment groups  compared with c <dig> mice in the same treatment groups. the up-regulation of antigen presentation genes in our study is consistent with increased expression of hla class ii molecules that typically occurs in ibd in humans  <cit> . in addition, mhc class ii antigen expression has been observed in the colon epithelial cells of il10-/- mice as early as three weeks of age, with higher expression levels observed in mice at three to six months of age  <cit> . it has also been reported that ifnγ appears to play a role in development of intestinal colitis, but that neither ifnγ nor mhc class ii expression are required for sustaining disease once it has become established  <cit> . in our study, in contrast to antigen presentation gene response, there was no difference in expression levels of colon tnf or ifng genes between il10-/- and c <dig> mice in the c or spf groups, but both of these genes were up-regulated in il10-/- mice as a result of bacterial inoculation. this occurs when compared with similarly-inoculated c <dig> mice, and with il10-/- mice in the c group. these results are further evidence that ifnγ does play a role in the development of intestinal colitis, whereas mhc class ii expression alone is not sufficient to trigger an inflammatory response in this model.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our findings indicate that inoculation of il10-/- mice with solutions containing intestinal bacteria increases colon inflammation, and that the use of enterococcus strains in particular results in a more appropriate model of ibd compared with non-inoculated il10-/- mice. high density oligonucleotide microarrays have identified gene expression changes in il10-/- colonic tissue in response to bacterial inoculation that are consistent with the current knowledge of mechanisms responsible for human ibd. in addition, there is preliminary evidence for the inflammatory response in this model being initiated by a failure of the normal mechanisms which recognize commensal bacterial, through molecules such as pigr and reg3a/reg3g. our data suggest that in particular the ef·cif inoculation, which results in exposure to a highly complex bacterial environment, gives an appropriate and relevant mouse model of human ibd in which a variety of food components could be tested to establish potential ameliorating effects, and to understand the mechanisms by which these effects may occur.
