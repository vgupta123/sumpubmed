BACKGROUND
the development of the mammalian central nervous system  is a remarkable phenomenon. since the cns is composed of millions of distinct neural cells, its complex and accurate functions must depend on the highly organized architecture of the cells that assemble in precise circuits. these distinct classes of cells composing the functional networks, are positioned at specific coordinates, in a precise number, with a spatial and temporal hierarchy. researchers working in developmental neuroscience are still seeking to answer certain questions involving the control of diversity, migration, and connection of neural cells  <cit> . following this direction, investigators believe that the way to understand these mechanisms requires the analysis of differential gene expression in different developmental stages of the brain.

among the large number of differential genes identified as important factors for regulating brain development at certain stages, we have found that the gene for insulin-like growth factor binding protein- <dig>  is expressed more highly in mature neurons than in neural precursors, indicating that igfbp- <dig> may potentially act as a proneuronal differentiation factor  <cit> . it is already known that igfbp- <dig> is one member of the igfbp family, which is mainly composed of six highly homologous proteins that bind insulin-like growth factors  with high affinity to regulate its activity  <cit> .

igfbp- <dig> is the smallest igfbp and is unique in having two extra cys residues in the variable l-domain encoded by exon  <dig>  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> also contains an n-linked glycosylation site and commonly exists in biological fluids as a doublet: a 24-kda nonglycosylated form and a 28-kda glycosylated form  <cit> . authentic rat igfbp- <dig> was a mixture of about 20% glycosylated and 80% non-glycosylated forms, and the glycosylation of igfbp- <dig> does not affect its binding to igfs  <cit> . the physiological significance of the glycosylation in igfbp- <dig> is unknown.

igfbp- <dig> is an important physiological regulator of igf actions in bone cells and other cell types as well  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> usually inhibits igfs effects, but igfs can decreased igfbp- <dig> levels by activating an igfbp-4-specific protease-papp-a, so igfbp- <dig> may act as a potent inhibitor of the anabolic effects of igf-i or -ii by regulating igf bioavailability  <cit> . previous data showed that igfbp- <dig> is a pro- or anti-apoptotic factor that binds to an unknown membrane receptor and negatively or positively regulates apoptosis-induced factors. igfbp- <dig> also may act by modulating the expression and secretion of other igfbps, such as igfbp- <dig> and igfbp- <dig>  <cit> . although still preliminary, until now, igfbp- <dig> is the only igfbp that, when deleted, alters cell growth  <cit> .

igf-igfbp system is already recognized as central to processes of cell growth, differentiation, and migration  <cit> . the clear importance of igfs in the cns development underscores the need for examining the expression and action of molecules, which are capable of regulating and mediating igf activities. igfbp- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are the most predominant igfbps in the brain  <cit> . in general, igfbp- <dig> and - <dig> were detected in same cells, whereas igfbp- <dig> and - <dig> were expressed mainly in different cells, which suggests igfbp- <dig> may have a specific function  <cit> .

in view of the predominantly local activity of various proteins, the distribution of expression of igfbp- <dig> may have a particular significance.

in the rat embryos of embryonic day  <dig> , igfbp- <dig> transcripts are expressed widely in non-neural areas of the head  <cit> . in e <dig> rat embryos, igfbp- <dig> transcripts are undetectable in other regions of brain except in the choroid plexus primordium and the meninges; the appearance of igfbp- <dig> in brain parenchyma is observed from e <dig>  and its expression is more widespread with increasing age  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> was found in all gross anatomical divisions of rat brain from e <dig> until adulthood , p <dig>  adult), and igfbp- <dig> mrna tends to be more abundant at the youngest ages  <cit> .

in the mouse embryo, igfbp- <dig> transcripts can be detected as early as e <dig> in different regions, including the telencephalon, mesencephalon, snout, tongue, and differentiating sclerotomes; its mrna is undetected in the brain after e <dig>  but clearly detectable in the lung, liver, kidneys, intestine, and vertebrae . at e <dig>  igfbp- <dig> transcripts cannot be detected in choroid plexus and meninges  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> mrna and protein are detected in the telencephalon, mesencephalon of e <dig>  mouse embryos, and the consistence of localization patterns between igfbp mrna and protein may suggest that the igfbp- <dig> functions in an autocrine or paracrine manner  <cit> .

previous findings suggest that igfbp- <dig> expression may be regulated during brain development, but unfortunately, the precise contributions of igfbp- <dig> to brain development are still not clear, since previous studies only selected limited time-points of igfbp- <dig> temporal expression, and/or did not quantify igfbp- <dig> expression. the present study therefore, aimed to examine precisely the temporal expression of igfbp- <dig> at different developmental time-points in the rat brain, by using immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time pcr, and western blot. we hope this observation could provide a foundation for understanding the role of igfbp- <dig> in brain development.

RESULTS
expression pattern of igfbp- <dig> in the embryonic brain
immunofluorescent staining showed a clear immunoreactivity of igfbp- <dig> in almost the whole embryonic brain, the forebrain , midbrain , hindbrain , and in the meningeal cells, from e <dig>  to e <dig> , although a relatively higher level of igfbp- <dig> expression was seen in the forebrain. the intensity of igfbp- <dig> immunoreactivity was relatively stronger at e <dig>  than that at other time-points . from e <dig> , however, the intensity decreased gradually. similar immunoreactivity distribution of igfbp- <dig> in the brain was observed using goat anti- and rabbit anti-igfbp <dig> antibody.

the expression pattern of igfbp- <dig> changed from e <dig> . more specifically, igfbp- <dig> cannot be detectable in the ventricular zone at this stage, and the signal intensity displayed a gradient distribution in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles . at e <dig>  the fluorescent intensity decreased significantly, although it was still detectable widely in brain regions . fluorescent signals were not apparent in the cells near the ventricle at e <dig> .

igfbp- <dig> mrna level in rat embryonic brain
real-time pcr was used to analyze changes in mrna level of igfbp- <dig> in embryonic rat brain from e <dig>  to e <dig>  . the level of igfbp- <dig> mrna at e <dig>  was  <dig>  times that at p <dig> and then began to increase gradually and reached a peak at e <dig>  and e <dig>  . the expression decreased gradually from e <dig> , at e <dig>  it was only  <dig> times that at p <dig> 

igfbp- <dig> protein level in rat embryonic brain
the level of igfbp- <dig> protein was determined by western blotting, and the result was consistent with those by real-time pcr . it was shown that the protein level increased gradually from e <dig> , and reached a peak at e <dig>  . the level then decreased gradually from e <dig> , and at e <dig>  it was only  <dig> % of p <dig>  glycosylated form of igfbp- <dig> was detectable from e <dig>  to e <dig> , but not seen after e <dig> .

igfbp- <dig> mrna expression in postnatal rat brain
the expression of igfbp- <dig> mrna was analyzed in three areas of postnatal rat brain, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and midbrain. anova statistical analysis revealed significant differences in mrna levels of igfbp <dig> in each region of the brain at different time-points and in different regions at each time-point .

in the cerebral cortex, the expression of igfbp- <dig> mrna increased gradually after birth , and reached a peak at p <dig> . then it remained at a relatively high level till p <dig>  it should be pointed out that the level at p <dig> was still lower than that in the embryo. in the cerebellum, igfbp- <dig> mrna level decreased gradually from p <dig>  and reached the lowest level at p <dig>  and then increased again and reached its highest level at p <dig> . in the midbrain, the level of igfbp- <dig> mrna also decreased gradually from p <dig>  and reached its lowest level at p <dig> . it then increased and remained at a medium level at p <dig> .

in order to emphasize the area specificity of igfbp- <dig> mrna expression in the brain, we further analyzed the differences between the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum and the midbrain at each time-point using the same data as shown in figure 5a. at p <dig>  the level of igfbp- <dig> mrna in the midbrain was higher than that in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum . at p <dig>  the level was highest in the cerebral cortex, moderate in the midbrain, and lowest in the cerebellum . afterwards, the levels of igfbp- <dig> mrna remained the highest in the cortex, and lowest in the midbrain at p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> , which were also seen at p <dig> .

igfbp- <dig> protein level in postnatal rat brain
igfbp- <dig> protein was detected using western blot .

the amount of protein was determined densitometrically using quantity one . in the cerebral cortex, the level of igfbp- <dig> protein showed little change in the early stages after birth , but it decreased significantly at p <dig>  in the cerebellum, the level increased gradually from p <dig> to p <dig> and remained at a significantly high level at p <dig>  in the midbrain, however, it remained relatively constant from p <dig> to p <dig> .

in order to emphasize the area specificity of igfbp- <dig> protein expression in the brain, the differences between the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum and the midbrain at same time-points were further analyzed by using the same data as shown in figure 7a. there was no significant difference in the level of igfbp- <dig> protein among three brain regions, cortex, cerebellum, and midbrain, at p <dig>  at p <dig>  the level in the midbrain was significantly lower than that in the cortex and cerebellum . at p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  the cerebellum expressed a higher level of igfbp- <dig> than did the cerebral cortex and the midbrain . at p <dig>  the expression of the protein remained at the highest level in the cerebellum, moderate in the midbrain, and lowest in the cortex  .

discussion
spatiotemperal expression patterns of igfbp- <dig> in the rat brain
igfbp- <dig> was initially purified from rat serum and human bone cell-conditioned medium in  <dig>  <cit> , and there have been several studies about igfbp- <dig> expression during development. transcripts for igfbp- <dig> were detectable in the most mesodermally derived tissues of the mid- and late gestational mouse   <cit>  and rat   <cit> , as well as in the telencephalon and mesencephalon of the mid-gestational mouse   <cit> . igfbp- <dig> expression is also easily detectable in the choroid plexus, meninges  <cit> , cerebrum, olfactory bulb, cerebellum  <cit>  in the e <dig> rat embryo, and the basal ganglia in the e <dig> rat embryo  <cit> . it is undetectable in the choroid plexus and meninges in the late gestational mouse fetus   <cit> . in the present study in the rat, igfbp- <dig> expression was seen in the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and also in the meningeal cells from e <dig> , peaked at e <dig>  to e <dig> , and reached to its lowest level at e <dig>  and e <dig> . our data have confirmed the findings thet igfbp- <dig> expresses in ratforebrain   <cit>  and hindbrain   <cit>  at mid- and late gestation , and in the midbrain at e11- <dig>  <cit> , but were inconsistent with the data that igfbp- <dig> expression is not detectable in the rat brain at e <dig>  <cit>  and neither in the mouse brain after e <dig>  <cit> .

postnatally, igfbp- <dig> mrna is found in the meningeal cell layer surrounding the developing cerebellum, the hippocampal formation  <cit> , and the olfactory bulb  <cit> . in the adulthood, the expression of igfbp- <dig> mrna is detectable in the cerebral cortex , olfactory peduncle , limbic system , thalamus and basal ganglia, as well as choroid plexus and meninges  <cit> .

the expression of igfbp- <dig> in the postnatal cerebral cortex in present study using real time pcr is in part similar to that by chernausek et al., using rna blot hybridization  <cit> , the mrna level of igfbp- <dig> is relatively low in the adult cerebral cortex, but shows a raising phase before p <dig>  whereas the protein level of igfbp- <dig> remains relatively constant from p <dig> to p <dig>  the different locations of igfbp- <dig> between the mrna and protein in the brain may be due to transportation of igfbp- <dig> protein from its synthesized and secreted cells, where the igfbp- <dig> mrna is located, to the other regions.

in the caudate-putamen, igfbp- <dig> expression displays a medial to lateral distribution gradient that is away from the neuroepithelium along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles, the site of active neurogenesis  <cit> . this finding is similar to the ours that fluorescent signals of igfbp- <dig> are not apparent in the cells near the ventricle from e <dig> .

our data showed a relatively lower level of igfbp- <dig> mrna in the cerebellum after birth, but a strikingly higher abundance of the protein during the first  <dig> postnatal weeks, compared with that in the cerebral cortex and midbrain. the level of igfbp- <dig> protein increases gradually with the maturation of the postnatal cerebellum and remains at a high level until adulthood.

the roles of igfbp- <dig> in the brain development
development of the brain starts early in the embryo and continues after birth. growth factors usually have a wide variety of actions during the brain development, including survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of neural cells.

in the rat, neurogenesis, generation of neurons, begins from progenitor cells within ventricular zone  at e <dig>  reaches a peak at e <dig> and stops at e <dig> when the subventricular zone  continues to generate neurons. glial cells are also produced in the svz at e <dig>  <cit> . most of the astrocytes are generated during p <dig> to p <dig>  and the generation of oligodendrocytes reaches a peak at p <dig>  <cit> .

the separate timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis in the brain has been described for many years, but the mechanisms underlying these changes in progenitor fate determination remain largely unknown. some investigators believed that the mechanisms must include both changes in the intrinsic properties of neural progenitors and in their signaling environment  <cit> . two ligands of the igf system, igf-i and igf-ii , have been shown to exert a wide variety of actions during development, promoting the brain growth, neuronal proliferation, and neuron number, while igfbps have inhibitory effects on the brain growth  and neuron number   <cit> . no reports are available on roles of igfbp- <dig> in the brain development.

igfbp- <dig> is known as a secreted peptide, and has been identified in almost all biological fluids  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> expression is found to be selectively localized in mature differentiated neurons of the caudate-putamen  <cit> . our earlier findings also indicated that igfbp- <dig> expression was higher in mature neurons than in neural precursors  <cit> . in the present study, the temporal expression patterns of igfbp- <dig> in the developing rat brain are coincident with the neurogenesis phases in the vz and its expression is widespread in the forebrain other than the cells restricted near the ventricle at e <dig> .

formation of neuronal processes, formation and maturation of synapses in the cerebral cortex, are all postnatal events which occur mainly during the second and third postnatal weeks  <cit> . since igfbp- <dig> protein expression in the adult cortex is significantly lower than that during the first four weeks after birth, it can be speculated therefore, that igfbp- <dig> may play a role in cortical neuron maturation. the neurons in the cerebellum emerge not only from the vz before birth, but also from a secondary germinal zone, the external granular layer  after birth, with the maturation occurring at about 4 weeks of age  <cit> . it is reported that the immature egl express igf- <dig> receptor, whereas igf- <dig> mrna is reported in the purkinje cells  <cit>  and in the migrating, differentiating neurons of the developing cerebellum in the rat  <cit> . thus, the replicating cells of the egl are sandwiched between cells presumably secreting igf- <dig> on one side and igfbp- <dig> on the other. our data have shown a less mrna level of igfbp- <dig> in the cerebellum than in the cerebral cortex but a strikingly higher abundance of protein level in the cerebellum from p <dig> to p <dig>  suggesting that igfbp- <dig> could play a role in the maintenance of cerebellar plasticity.

all of these findings, together with the data that igfbp- <dig> has been shown to promote myocardial differentiation of embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and adult mesenchymal stromal cells  <cit> , suggest that igfbp- <dig> can be quite strongly regarded as one important factor in those signaling environment for neurogenesis. it is reported that igfbp- <dig> mrna increases markedly in the ipsi-lateral cortex after hypoxic-ischemic insult  <cit> , suggesting that igfbp- <dig> may also play a role in neurogenesis during brain injury and repair.

accumulating data strongly indicate that igfbp- <dig> exerts inhibitory effects on igf-promoted growth  <cit> . igfbp- <dig> knockout mice are smaller than their wild-type littermates   <cit> . down-regulation of igfbp- <dig> is associated with abnormal mitogenesis, such as in wilms’ tumor  <cit> . immunoelectron microscopy has revealed that igfbp- <dig> is localized at the centrioles, and also it has a direct interaction with microtubules in primary astrocytes in the rat and human  <cit> , as shown by an intracellular macromolecular complex of igfbp- <dig> with four other proteins including miz- <dig>   <cit> . miz- <dig> appears to be regulated by association with microtubules  <cit> , indicating an involvement of igfbp- <dig> in microtubule functions. connexin- <dig>  a junction protein, is known to interact directly with microtubules  <cit> . overexpression of connexin- <dig> in c <dig> glioma cells results in decreased levels of igfbp- <dig> and increased levels of igfbp- <dig> and it may be responsible for the reduced proliferative capacity  <cit> . interestingly, inhibition of igfbp- <dig> expression in prostate cancer cells also lead to the suppression of cancer cell growth which may be caused by greatly increased levels of igfbp- <dig> and - <dig> in these cells  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the igf-independent effects of igfbp- <dig> may involve the regulation of cell motility and proliferation through the instability of microtubule dynamics.

certainly, the possible effects of igfbp- <dig> in neurogenesis and proliferation during brain development mentioned above need to be further elucidated via gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches and this is our ongoing research.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of present study, together with other previous data, indicate that igfbp- <dig> may have a significant role during cns development, although some further research is required.
