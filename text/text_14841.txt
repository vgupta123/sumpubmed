BACKGROUND
the use of entomopathogenic microorganisms to combat insects is currently considered to be a viable supplement or alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides, which are known to have toxic effects on non-target organisms  <cit> . strains of metarhizium have been shown to efficiently control several insect species  <cit> . the most common species is m. anisopliae, initially described as a pathogen of the wheat cockchafer anisoplia austriaca. this fungus is commonly known as "green muscardine fungus"  <cit>  and can infect the larvae and adults of more than  <dig> host species  <cit> . once m. anisopliae spores have come into contact with the outer surface of the insect, they germinate. after penetrating the insect exoskeleton, they rapidly grow inside the insect and cause its death.

traditionally, the classification and typing of anamorphic entomopathogenic fungi have mainly been based on morphological characteristics  <cit> . nevertheless, such tools are insufficient for distinguishing between species of metarhizium  <cit>  or for monitoring the establishment and spread of a given strain released into the field, since these characters are modified by environmental and physiological conditions  <cit> .

the application of molecular techniques in mycology has shed new light on the systematics, biochemistry, and ecology of entomopathogenic fungi  <cit> . molecular markers have been used to assess the genetic variation among isolates of m. anisopliae and other entomopathogenic fungi in order to identify strains of interest, determine the origin of the isolates, study populations, or carry out phylogenetic analyses. thus, a useful polymorphism for fingerprinting m. anisopliae isolates was detected using restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis of mitochondrial  dna  <cit> . a high degree of polymorphism was also detected in coding regions of small and large subunits of nuclear ribosomal rna genes  as well as in intergenic spacers , whereas the internal transcribed spacers  were extremely conserved among the m. anisopliae isolates tested  <cit> . this rdna polymorphism has been attributed to small insertions/deletions, multiple duplications, or -mainly- to the presence of group i introns  <cit> .

group i introns are autonomous genetic elements characterized by their ability to "self-splice", or to splice due to their particular topology. these introns are found in eukaryotic and bacterial domains  <cit> . in entomopathogenic fungi, the first report of a group i intron was described by neuvéglise and brygoo  <cit>  for beauveria brongniartii. rflp analysis of pcr products revealed the presence of insertional elements of about 350– <dig> bp within the lsu rdna. several authors have reported the usefulness of group i introns, inserted after specific sites in ssu or lsu rdna genes for genotyping species and strains in genera such as beauveria or cordyceps  <cit> . the presence of group i introns in m. anisopliae has been identified at three different positions within the lsu rdna  <cit> .

the present study was undertaken to determine any genetic diversity existing in an autochthonous collection of m. anisopliae isolates selected as biocontrol agents against insects. twenty-six biocontrol isolates, most of them obtained from different locations in the iberian peninsula, were examined, based on the analysis of sequence data from group i introns in the lsu rdna genes. the usefulness of group i introns in lsu rdna genes for the characterization and identification of m. anisopliae strains was evaluated.

RESULTS
identification of group i introns
dna fragments from lsu rdna genes of  <dig> m. anisopliae isolates  were amplified with primers i29/e <dig>  the pcr products were purified and sequenced with a view to identifying whether multiple insertion sequences might be responsible for the length diversity in this region. the intron-less lsu sequence size was  <dig> bp. sequence analysis revealed that nine isolates -designated ma <dig> ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig>  ma <dig> and ma25- had no introns. in the other seventeen isolates, the presence of introns inserted at one or more of the four possible conserved positions was observed. intron insertion sites were refered to the i <dig> primer and located after positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . these insertion sites were named according to numbering of their nucleotide position in escherichia coli j <dig>  inserted intron sequence sizes were 440-bp at ec1921;  <dig> bp at ec2066;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> bp at ec2449; and  <dig> or  <dig> bp at ec <dig> 

among the  <dig> intron-containing isolates, ten of them showed a length of  <dig> -kb with three introns inserted at positions ec <dig>  ec <dig> and ec <dig>  one isolate was  <dig> bp in length, with two introns at positions ec <dig> and ec <dig>  another two were  <dig> bp long, with two introns at positions ec <dig> and ec <dig>  another isolate was  <dig> bp long, with an intron at position ec <dig>  only one isolate, with an amplicon of  <dig> bp long, exhibited an intron at position ec <dig>  two isolates from cantabria  were  <dig> bp long, with one intron at position ec <dig> 

the presence/absence of introns at the 3'-end of the nuclear lsu rdna of the twenty-six m. anisopliae isolates analyzed allowed a distribution into the following genotypes: a1b2a3a <dig>  b1b2a3a <dig>  a1b2a3b <dig>  b1b2a3b <dig>  b1a2b3b <dig>  a1b2b3b <dig> and b1b2b3b <dig>  letters a and b indicate the presence and absence of introns, respectively, and the insertion sites are numbered from  <dig> to 4; that is, ec <dig> , ec <dig> , ec <dig>  and ec <dig> . these genotypes and their distribution frequencies are shown in table  <dig>  nine  out of the twenty-six strains had no introns; four  contained one; three  had two, and ten  had three introns. the most frequent insertion sites - <dig> % of the isolates studied- occurred at nucleotide positions ec <dig> and ec <dig>  followed by position ec <dig> , whereas only one strain had an intron at ec <dig> .

intron characterization and variability
a 440-bp intron was identified in fourteen isolates at position ec <dig>  alignment of these sequences revealed the existence of two variants with a few bp differences for this intron. the divergences were due to nucleotide substitution at different positions. blast analysis of these sequences revealed high sequence identity with an intron inserted at the same position in the lsu from m. anisopliae  <dig>   <cit>  and with another intron also inserted at the same position in the lsu from m. anisopliae imnst  <dig> .

isolate ma <dig> from seville was the only one of the twenty-six isolates selected for study that showed evidence of an intron,  <dig> bp long, at position ec <dig>  this intron had  <dig> and  <dig> % identity with two sequences previously detected at the same position in the lsu of m. anisopliae isolates  <dig> and  <dig> .

fourteen isolates displayed one intron at position ec <dig>  five sequence variants, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in size, were identified at this site. these five sequences were very similar and showed a 96– <dig> % identity with the ec2449-position intron sequence reported for m. anisopliae  <dig> .

two sequence types, very different in length, were detected at position ec <dig> of eleven of the m. anisopliae isolates. one of them was 1754-bp in size sequence and was detected in ten of these isolates. a 161-bp fragment at the 3' end of this sequence showed a blastn identity of 83% with a cordyceps intron sequence from position  <dig> to  <dig> . the rest of this 1754-bp sequence did not show either blastn or blastx identity with any of the genome sequences deposited in the public databases. an open reading frame  coding for  <dig> amino acids, located at position 49-1084-bp, was identified in this sequence. no homing endonuclease  motifs were detected. the second type was observed in only one isolate, ma <dig>  corresponding to a 435-bp long intron showing a sequence of 172-bp with a 84% of identity, from position  <dig> to  <dig>  with the same intron sequence of cordyceps .

in order to explore the different intron sequences obtained in the present work in greater detail, a comparative study with elements p, q, r and s, previously reported in group i introns  <cit> , was carried out . since the ec <dig> insertion site had not been described previously in m. anisopliae, the comparison was performed with the b. bassiana sequence a. n. af <dig>  p, q and r elements were conserved at the four insertion sites. however, the element s was also identical in introns located at the ec <dig>  ec <dig> and ec <dig> sites, but was not conserved for introns inserted at position ec <dig>  at ec <dig> site the four elements were located in the 1754-bp intron at the following positions:  <dig> to  <dig> ,  <dig> to  <dig> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> . in the 435-bp intron, these elements were located at positions  <dig> to  <dig> ,  <dig> to  <dig> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis
the mp tree obtained after the alignment of  <dig> distinct intron sequence types identified from  <dig> isolates and genbank-deposited sequences, that represent intron sequences from three entomopathogenic genera metarhizium, beauveria and cordyceps, and the subsequent phylogenetic analysis is shown in figure  <dig>  the mp tree shows the separation of four independent groups corresponding to introns located at positions ec <dig>  ec <dig>  ec <dig> and ec <dig>  supported by high bootstrap values . clusters grouping intron sequences located at ec <dig> and ec <dig> were closer although with a support of  <dig> %.

discussion
the variability in group i introns from lsu rdna genes can be used as a robust molecular tool for the identification of polymorphisms in entomopathogenic fungi such as beauveria and metarhizium  <cit> . the primers previously described to amplify the 3'-end of the lsu rdna region in beauveria by pcr were used to characterize our m. anisopliae isolates. the polymorphism observed in this region of m. anisopliae genome was high, due to the presence/absence of introns at the four conserved sites. in the  <dig> isolates of m. anisopliae, we identified a total of  <dig> group i introns, which were inserted at any of the four specific sites in the lsu rdna. this degree of polymorphism is in agreement with the high number of group i introns detected in cordyceps, in which  <dig> representative members of this genus have been studied  <cit> . the latter authors suggested that if sequence comparisons are carried out between closely related taxa, one would expect to find a high variety of insertion patterns. thus, considering the presence/absence of introns, due to intron vertical transmission and intron loss events, it was not unexpected that we found six genotypes when we analysed the  <dig> isolates belonging to the same species. the eight insertion sites described in rdna genes of entomopathogenic fungi are not always occupied by introns and this could be related to the genus or species considered. when lsu introns were explored,  <dig> isolates of b. brongniartii and  <dig> of b. bassiana were distributed within  <dig> and  <dig> genotypes, respectively. a high number of introns inserted at the four specific sites was detected for both species, and only 7% of isolates tested did not display intron insertions  <cit> . however, in other studies of m. anisopliae a low intron number was detected; only  <dig> and  <dig> introns were described from  <dig> and  <dig> strains studied, respectively  <cit> . bearing in mind the taxa sampled, those m. anisopliae results were surprising since a high degree of polymorphism, due to vertical transmission events, would be expected, and an even higher degree if the high polymorphism discovered in the rdna genes of cordyceps, the teleomorph of these species, was considered  <cit> .

phylogenetic studies have been used to explain the sporadic distribution of these elements in cordyceps, proposing a cyclic model of invasion, degeneration, loss, and reinvasion  <cit> . however, genotypes  <dig>  and  <dig>  were predominant in our study, with a frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig>  %, respectively. moreover, introns were more frequent at positions ec <dig> and ec <dig> . additionally, only one intron inserted at ec <dig> was discovered . in our hands, and light of these distribution frequencies, it seems that there is some kind of preference for certain positions. lsu sites where intron insertion is more frequent  have also been detected in b. bassiana strains and isolates with three-, two- and one-intron insertions, representing 16%, 48% and 28% frequency, respectively  <cit> .

a phylogenetic analysis based on intron sequences in the lsu rdna was carried out with the  <dig> different m. anisopliae sequences obtained in this work and some other metarhizium, beauveria and cordyceps representative sequences from public databases. in general, the mp tree shows that introns inserted at the same site are closely related. this is expected, considering that horizontal transmission is one of the pathways along which group i introns can move  <cit> . this is also in agreement with the results obtained in other entomopathogenic fungi, in which phylogenetic analyses of group i introns suggest that transposition between different insertion sites is uncommon  <cit> . at the ec <dig> insertion site, m. anisopliae isolates are separated in an independent clade  from the beauveria and cordyceps isolates. in spite of the sequence polymorphism observed at this insertion site, the five variants of m. anisopliae grouped together. in this sense, a sequence comparison of the p, q, r and s motifs in introns inserted at the four specific sites was carried out . compared with af <dig> sequence of m. anisopliae, only p, q and r motifs were conserved.

an intron at insertion point ec <dig> was identified in eleven isolates. nevertheless, the intron of the ten isolates grouped in genotype  <dig> had an uncommon size of 1754-bp. this intron type is usually small, ranging in size from 250– <dig> bp  <cit> . introns with similar lengths containing an open reading frame  encoding a highly specific homing endonuclease  have been reported previously in both the ssu of b. bassiana  <cit>  and the lsu rdna of naegleria sp.  <cit> . he conserved motifs were not detected in the  <dig> amino acid sequence of the m. anisopliae orf, suggesting the orf is not an he.

species and strains of metarhizium and beauveria have been differentiated by rapd analysis, but little evidence of a correlation between rapd groups and the geographical origin or host has been gathered  <cit> . other studies carried out in m. anisopliae have described that similar rapd profiles tend to be obtained from isolates of the same geographic area  <cit> . lsu introns have shown a tenuous dependence upon geographical origins or specific insects with rdna intron genotype distribution in  <dig> strains of b. bassiana  <cit> . in the present study, the number of isolates was much lower and those obtained from insects were only two. then, no comparisons between genotypes and habitat/host could be made. in the present work we failed to observe any correlation between the distribution of genotypes and the geographical origins of the isolates.

the genus metarhizium includes entomopathogenic isolates used as bcas. to predictably and successfully apply bcas to combat insects in the field, it is essential that their biology and ecology should be well understood. the release of biocontrol agents into the environment demands the development of methods to monitor their presence or absence in the field  <cit> . using a molecular marker such as an lsu rdna intron, two b. bassiana strains were discriminated in co-formulation studies  <cit> . in this study, the twenty-six isolates analyzed were distributed into seven genotypes considering the presence/absence of group i introns at the 3'-end of the lsu rdna genes. thus, three of the seven genotypes established  have a single component; and a high degree of polymorphism was also observed in the s motif of intron sequences inserted at ec <dig>  primers have been designed in these genes and their specificity is currently being tested with both mixed mycelia from different m. anisopliae strains and soil samples with a view to generating scar markers and developing quantitative real-time pcr assays.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> group i introns related to four insertion sites detected at the 3' end in lsu rdna genes have been identified in  <dig> biocontrol isolates of m. anisopliae. these introns exhibited various insertion patterns and this small and selected collection of  <dig> isolates was distributed into  <dig> genotypes. phylogenetic analysis of these intron sequences demonstrated a general correlation between specific insertion sites and sequence homology. p, q, r and s elements were conserved at insertion positions ec <dig>  ec <dig> and ec <dig>  and only p, q and r elements were conserved at ec <dig> site.
