BACKGROUND
wheat  is one of the major staple crops for the human diet. with the increase in the global population, the shortage of foods has become more and more serious. therefore, wheat yield and quality improvement has always been the most important target in wheat breeding programs. although conventional breeding approaches via manipulating genetic variation have been very successful in improving the agronomically important traits of cereals, the next wave of crop improvement will require much greater knowledge of gene function  <cit> .

the rapid advance in genomics  <cit>  has greatly facilitated gene isolation and manipulation, generating huge quantities of transcript and putative gene sequences . in addition, genomes of major crops including rice, maize, and wheat have been or are being sequenced. as a result of rapid advance in structural genomics, the availability of powerful tools for gene function analysis has become a bottleneck, especially for important crops beyond the few model plant species.

in model plants such as arabidopsis and rice, two methods, i.e. t-dna knockout libraries  <cit>  and t-dna activation libraries  <cit> , have significantly accelerated the speed of gene functional identification. large collections of plants that contain t-dna insertions have been generated. once plants have been identified with the desired phenotypes, isolation of relevant genes is readily accomplished by finding the genomic location of the t-dna associated with the mutant phenotype  <cit> . however, none of these techniques can be used in wheat due to the large genome size and very low transformation efficiency which pose a technical challenge to produce the number of transformants needed to saturate the wheat genome. an additional complication for determining gene function through the analysis of loss-of-function mutations in wheat is the fact that all cultivated varieties are polyploid; therefore in most cases, expression of homeologous genes could mask loss-of-function phenotypes resulting from the disruption of the other homeologous alleles  <cit> .

in recent years, virus-induced gene silencing  has been developed as an effective genetics tool for assessing gene functions in a range of dicot plant species including nicotiana spp. , pisum sativum , arabidopsissolanum lycopersicum   <cit> , and some monocot species hordeum vulgare , triticum aestivum , and zea mays   <cit> . vigs was a mechanism of defense response naturally present in plants and other organisms through rna-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing  to fight pathogens  <cit> . in vigs, viruses trigger defense machinery of the hosts related to post-transcriptional gene silencing, where double stranded rna is converted into short interfering rnas . a gene of interest can be introduced into a virus vector and the recombinant virus will trigger the host defense response and both the virus genome and the endogenous mrnas homologous to the inserted target sequence become the targets for degradation  <cit> . silencing initiated by vigs will spread systemically along with the sirna  <cit> , and by this method, it is possible to knockdown almost any gene of interest if a suitable vector is present for the plant species under investigation.

many viral vectors for vigs have been developed for various plant species  <cit> . however, so far, most vigs protocols are established for gene silencing in vegetative tissues, with very limited success in reproductive and other tissues  <cit> . gene silencing techniques for developing seeds will be very useful for studying gene functions in seed development and for seed quality improvement. for monocotyledons, two vectors, the barley stripe mosaic virus -based vector for barley and wheat  <cit>  and the brome mosaic virus -based vector for barley, rice and maize  <cit> , have been developed and are being widely used for gene silencing in seedlings  <cit> . more recently, pacak et al.  <cit>  presented the first evidence of bsmv induced gene silencing  in the roots of a monocotyledonous plant species. to date, however, no reports have been published on bsmv-vigs in spikes or grains of monocotyledonous species. genes expressed in spikes or grains are likely involved in important agronomic traits such as yield, quality and disease resistance, and therefore, revealing the functions of these genes will greatly facilitate the improvement of yield, quality and pathogen resistance in cereals  <cit> . accordingly techniques for analyzing gene functions in spikes or grains are needed for functional analysis.

high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits  are a group of endosperm storage proteins in wheat encoded by a multi-gene family. members in this gene family possess highly homologous sequences, as found in glu-a1glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci on the long arm of chromosome 1a, 1b and 1d, respectively  <cit> . the genes at the three loci share a high percentage of homologous sequences. at each locus, one x-type and one y-type subunits are encoded. the composition and amount of hmw-gss have a profound influence on the baking quality of wheat  <cit> . hmw-gs 1bx <dig> is encoded by the gene at the glu-b <dig> locus. several studies have shown that the 1bx14 + 1by <dig> subunit pair has a positive influence on the end use quality of wheat varieties  <cit> . more recently, the 1bx <dig> gene has been isolated and sequenced . a 1bx <dig> knockout mutant derived from an elite chinese wheat variety xiaoyan  <dig> through chemical mutagenesis was generated and characterized, providing an opportunity for identifying the biological function of 1bx <dig> <cit> . we tried to generate transgenic lines with a 1bx <dig> over-expressed construct by microprojectile bombardment to assess the gene function, but introduction of this gene led to silence of several other homologous endogenous genes in the common wheat cv. mianyang  <dig>  <cit> .

our long term goal is to elucidate the effect of specific proteins on wheat grain quality and end use. in this study, we first tested the possibility of employing bsmv vector to silence genes in wheat spikes or grains with the marker gene pds encoding phytoene desaturase, an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of carotenoid pigments that protect chlorophyll from photobleaching. silencing of pds can be visualized as white streaks resulting from photobleached chlorophyll  <cit> . after optimizing the locations and stages for vigs in wheat spikes and grains, we chose to silence the hmw-gs 1bx <dig> gene because the protein products have been shown by our group to participate in forming larger glutenin polymers and greatly contribute to dough strength  <cit> . we also chose to silence the entire family of hmw-gs genes related to wheat gluten quality for testing the feasibility of bsmv-vigs for functional analysis in wheat grains . the results in this study indicate that bsmv-vigs system is a useful tool for functional analysis of genes expressed in wheat spikes and grains.

RESULTS
bsmv is able to induce gene silence in wheat spikes/grains
to examine whether bsmv vector can induce gene silencing in wheat spikes and grains, we used the bsmv vectors carrying a 185-bp fragment of barley pds gene   <cit>  for the initial silencing experiment. two winter wheat, cvs xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig>  and a spring wheat, cv. ningchun  <dig>  were used in this experiment. to test the infectivity and the efficacy of bsmv-vigs in all three wheat cultivars, we conducted a preliminary experiment at the seedling stage to silence the pds gene. we inoculated ten seedlings of each wheat cultivar with bsmv:pds and bsmv: <dig> , respectively, onto the 2nd fully expanded leaves of 10-day-old seedlings. mosaic and chlorotic stripes were observed on the tip portions of the third leaves of all inoculated plants about 7 days post inoculation . only the bsmv:pds inoculated plants  showed photobleaching starting from the base areas of the third leaves and extending throughout the length of the fourth leaves during 10 ~  <dig> dpi. photobleaching was very rarely seen in the fifth leaves of all three cultivars . no photobleaching was observed in the plants infected with bsmv: <dig>  these observations indicated that the bsmv:pds construct could systemically induce gene silencing in all three cultivars and efficiently induce pds gene silencing in these cultivars.

in order to investigate the effectiveness of bsmv-vigs in wheat spikes, endogenous pds was again selected as a target to silence. we inoculated ten plants of each wheat cultivar on their spikes at heading stage by rubbing each spike five times with bsmv:pds and bsmv: <dig>  respectively. unlike the progress of bsmv:pds infection observed on leaves of wheat seedling, no mosaic symptoms and chlorosis were observed on wheat spikes by  <dig> dpi; only some ring-like or stripe symptoms were visible on the awns of some infected spikes. the symptoms of wheat spikes infected with bsmv:pds were indistinguishable from those infected with bsmv: <dig> at  <dig> dpi or earlier. however, photobleaching on the spikes infected with bsmv:pds appeared after 13dpi, and persisted until 30dpi, while the spikes inoculated with bsmv: <dig> remained green during the same period . nine of the ten plants  inoculated with bsmv:pds showed photobleaching throughout the entire wheat spike , and the photobleaching persisted until  <dig> dpi .

a this experiment was conducted with three independent biological replicates, ten plants were inoculated for each condition.

b numbers of plants with partial or complete photobleaching were reproducible in three biological replicates.

to confirm that the observed photobleaching was the result of pds silencing, we conducted quantitative real-time pcr  to measure the pds transcript abundances in the spikes inoculated with bsmv:pds at different time points. surprisingly, a 25% reduction in pds transcript abundance was detected as early as  <dig> dpi, but a remarkable reduction of pds was detected between 8– <dig> dpi. from 4– <dig> dpi, the pds mrna level in spikes treated with bsmv:pds was only about 60%, or lower than the level in spikes with bsmv: <dig> treatment . the most significantly bleached spikes were seen at  <dig> dpi, much later than the reduction of the pds transcript level.

the effectiveness of vigs in wheat grains was then investigated. grains from bsmv:pds infected spikes appeared photobleached only when their glumes were taken off and the grains were exposed directly under bright light. the phenotypes of the grains from the heads infected with bsmv:pds or bsmv: <dig> at  <dig> dpi are shown in figure 3a with cultivar xiaoyan  <dig> as a representative. chlorosis occurred in the grains of bsmv:pds infected heads at  <dig> dpi, while the grains of bsmv: <dig> inoculated control plants remained green, suggesting photobleaching of these seed coats was due to the silencing of the pds gene. to confirm this, transcript abundances of the pds gene in the photobleached and non-photobleached grains were measured by qrt-pcr. the level of pds transcript abundance in the chlorotic grains was reduced by 92% , compared with the green ones .

optimal conditions for efficient gene silencing in wheat spikes and grains
similar to leaf-rub inoculation applied to wheat seedlings  <cit> , spike-rub inoculation on the spikes at heading stage was also effective for gene silencing in spikes and grains. syringe-injection inoculation onto the spikes at heading stage was also tested, but this method failed to get results as consistent as spike-rub inoculation. therefore, spike-rub inoculation was used in all silencing assays later. because photobleached phenotypes of the spikes or grains in bsmv:pds inoculated plants exhibited a consistent correlation with the reduction of pds transcript abundances in our experiments, photobleaching was used as an indicator of pds gene silencing in wheat spikes and grains.

to optimize conditions for efficient and stable silencing of genes in wheat spikes and grains, inoculation location and stage were determined by inoculating bsmv on flag leaves or spikes of ten plants for each wheat cultivar at three different development stages, i.e. booting, heading and flowering, respectively, by rubbing the in vitro synthesized bsmv rnas three times on a flag leaf or five times on a spike. for simplicity, only the winter wheat cv. xiaoyan  <dig> and the spring wheat cv. ningchun  <dig> were tested at three different stages, and at each stage, the experiment included three independent biological replicates. as shown in figure  <dig>  at  <dig> dpi, photobleached spikes were observed in bsmv:pds infected xiaoyan  <dig> plants if bsmv:pds was inoculated onto spikes at booting, heading or flowering stages. but if bsmv:pds was inoculated onto flag leaves, photobleaching spikes appeared only in wheat plants inoculated at heading stage. these results were reproducible in three biological replicates. figure  <dig> shows three reproducible phenotypes with different degrees of photobleaching, i.e. green spikes , partially photobleached spikes  and uniform highly photobleached spikes . effectiveness of bsmv-induced pds silencing in wheat spikes was strongly influenced by the location of the inoculation and the stage of the plant when the inoculation was done. from heading to flowering stage, 90% ~100%  of plants inoculated with bsmv:pds onto spikes exhibited highly uniform photobleaching . similar results were also observed in wheat cv. ningchun  <dig> . we also attempted inoculation onto wheat spikes 10 days after flowering, but failed to achieve silenced phenotypes.

taken together, inoculation onto wheat spikes from heading to flowering stage was optimal for efficient silencing of pds in wheat spikes.

evaluation of biological function of the 1bx <dig> gene in gluten network formation in wheat grains using bsmv-vigs
after optimizing the bsmv-based vigs system in wheat spikes/grains, we tried to explore the usefulness of the system for functional analysis of genes expressed in wheat grains. the 1bx <dig> gene  was chosen as a gene of interest tested in two wheat cultivars carrying 1bx <dig>  xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig>  to make gene silencing as specific as possible, a 176-bp fragment of 1bx <dig> from the coding region  was inserted into the ta cloning site of the bsmv γ vector to generate the construct bsmv:1bx <dig> . the 176-bp insert fragment possesses approximately 60–82% identity to the dnas of the hmw-gs gene 1ax <dig>  1by <dig>  1dx <dig> and 1dy <dig> in wheat cvs xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig> .

ten plants of each wheat cultivar were inoculated with bsmv: <dig> and bsmv:1bx <dig> respectively on the spikes at flowering stage. the grains in the middle of the infected spikes were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi for rna isolation. transcript abundances of 1bx <dig> were measured in all the grain rna samples by qrt-pcr. the data showed that the transcript levels of 1bx <dig> decreased by about 97% at  <dig> dpi and 85% at  <dig> dpi in the grains of bsmv:1bx <dig> infected spikes compared with that of the bsmv: <dig> infected control. actin was used as an internal control. the reduction persisted until at least  <dig> dpi . these data were similar to the results of pds silencing described above. the amount of hmw-gs 1bx <dig> of the 1bx14-silenced grains of xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig> was detectably decreased on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  . the scanning profiles of the sds-page gels shown in figure  <dig> a and 6b shows the quantitative reduction of protein level; i.e. the peak of hmw-gs 1bx <dig> in the 1bx14-silenced grains was about 64% reduced in cultivar xiaoyan  <dig>  and 67% in shaanyou  <dig>  compared with that in the controls, respectively. the protein levels of 1bx <dig> were not reduced as much as the mrna levels .

to evaluate the impact of 1bx <dig> knockdown in the formation of wheat gluten network, total proteins , total glutenin polymer and glutenin macropolymeric protein  of the grains from bsmv:bx <dig> and bsmv: <dig> infected spikes were extracted and quantified by micro-kjeldahl method, respectively. the quantity of gmp, tgp or tp in the grains of 1bx14-silenced plants were significantly decreased, compared with that in bsmv: <dig> infected controls in both xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig>  the ratio of gmp to tp or the percentage of gmp in tp was significantly reduced , indicating that hmw-gs 1bx <dig> is one of the major components participating in the formation of glutenin macropolymers in wheat grains. these results are consistent with our previous conclusion, suggesting the usefulness of bsmv-vigs system for the functional analysis of genes expressed in wheat grains.

the mean values resulted from three independent biological replicates.

tp, tgp and gmp indicate total proteins, total glutenin polymers, and glutenin macropolymeric proteins, respectively.

means with different capital letters indicate significantly different at p <  <dig>  level.

means with different small letters are significantly different at p <  <dig>  level.

silencing of all hmw-gs gene family members in wheat grains via bsmv-vigs system
the successful silencing of the 1bx <dig> gene by the bsmv-vigs system encouraged us to silence all the hmw-gs gene family members in wheat grains. a bsmv-derived construct carrying a 184-bp fragment of artificially assembled sequence  was developed and named as bsmv:hmw. the 184-bp fragment contained one 85-bp sequence highly homologous to most of the x-type glutenin subunit genes  and one 99-bp sequence identical to most of the y-type glutenin subunit genes  . nucleotide sequence alignment of the asx or the asy with the corresponding elements in other x-typeor y-type hmw-gs genes in wheat was shown in additional file  <dig> 

all three wheat cultivars mentioned above were tested in this experiment. ten plants of each wheat cultivar were inoculated with bsmv:hmw or bsmv: <dig> on the spikes at flowering stage. silencing of hmw-gs genes was monitored by sds-page on protein levels due to the lack of primers specific to individual target genes for real-time pcr. as shown in figure  <dig>  the amount of each x-type or y-type hmw-gs extracted from the seeds of the bsmv:hmw infected spikes of ningchun  <dig> showed detectable decrease compared with the bsmv: <dig> treated spikes, indicating that all the hmw-gs genes 1ax2*, 1bx <dig>  1by <dig>  1dx <dig> and 1dy <dig>  were down-regulated in the seeds of bsmv:hmw infected spikes of ningchun  <dig>  however, in the seeds of bsmv:hmw infected spikes of xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig>  no apparent reduction in amount of hmw-gs was observed, suggesting that all the hmw-gs gene family members were not efficiently silenced.

discussion
despite the widespread use of vigs in seedling plants, its application in reproductive tissues of plants is rather limited. in the review by scofield & nelson  <cit> , the authors mentioned that vigs could be achieved in the flag leaves and floral organs by inoculating upper leaves of older wheat plants with the bsmv rnas, citing unpublished data without further details or documentation. in wheat, to date, there is no report of the application of vigs in developing seeds. in this study, we report, for the first time, the successful application of bsmv-based vigs for gene knockdown in wheat spikes and grains and its application in functional analysis of hmw-gs-encoding gene 1bx <dig>  unlike cucumber mosaic virus - or apple latent spherical virus -vector for vigs in soybean , with which inoculation onto the first leaf at the seedling stage or two cotyledons at emergence stage of soybean plants could effectively lead to gene silence in seeds  <cit> , inoculation with bsmv:pds recombinant virus onto the first leaf of wheat or barley plants at the seedling stage led to the most efficient pds silencing in the third leaf, but the silence effect largely disappeared before the onset of flowering in nearly all plants. occasionally, some degree of photobleaching was observed in the flag leaf and some of the heads  <cit> . when barley or wheat were infected with the bsmv:pds construct, the duration of silencing lasted only about 4 weeks post-inoculation  <cit> .

considering both the duration of effective bsmv-based vigs and the temporal and spatial expression of some genes related to wheat quality or yield, the optimal inoculation conditions for vigs in wheat spikes and grains are needed to be determined for efficient gene silencing in wheat productive organs. in this study, we established a protocol for effective knockdown of genes expressed in wheat spikes and developing seeds using bsmv-based vigs. we found that efficiency of bsmv-induced gene silencing varied greatly with the locations and the stages of inoculation, and inoculation with bsmv on wheat spikes from heading to flowering stage by spike-rubbing five times showed the most effective silencing of pds in wheat spikes . since gene silencing with bsmv-based vigs vector is generally transient, inoculation on spikes at the appropriate time is crucial for knockdown of genes expressed only in developing seeds.

compared with bsmv-vigs experiments with barley or wheat seedlings, the main visual differences distinguishing bsmv-vigs in wheat spikes are viral symptoms, the phenotypes of plants with gene silencing, and the time period of the effect. wheat plants inoculated with bsmv:pds at the seedling stage exhibited patches of lesion in the leaf above the inoculated one <cit> . however, for wheat plants infected with bsmv:pds onto spikes, only ring-like or stripe symptoms appeared on the awns of infected spikes. as for the phenotype of pds silencing, both leaves and spikes showed apparent photobleaching. however, photobleaching in the leaf often did not cover the entire width of the leaf and was often confined to narrow stripes parallel to the leaf veins  <cit> , while photobleaching in the spike extended to the entire spike . with regard to the effective time period of bsmv-vigs, evident photobleaching initially appeared in the third and fourth leaves of the barley seedlings by  <dig> dpi, and leaves that emerged after  <dig> dpi were unlikely to have photobleaching when bsmv:pds inoculation was done on the first leaves  <cit> . however, our results showed that, when wheat spikes were infected with bsmv:pds, visual photobleaching appeared on the spikes after  <dig> dpi, and persisted until  <dig> dpi. the qrt-pcr data revealed that pds transcript abundances in bsmv:pds infected spikes reduced by about 25% at  <dig> dpi, 95% between 8 ~  <dig> dpi, and 45% at  <dig> dpi, compared with those in spikes inoculated with bsmv: <dig> . but the most remarkable photobleaching was observed at  <dig> dpi, much later than the reduction of pds transcript. the reduction in pds mrna levels began earlier and lasted longer than the period of photobleaching . notably, pds transcript abundances in bsmv:pds infected spikes were prone to increase at  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi. this is due to the instability of recombinant bsmv:pds leading to deletion of pds sequences from the virus vector . these conditions were also reported previously by bruun-rasmussen et al.  <cit> .

after optimization of conditions, we also successfully silenced the gene 1bx <dig> that encodes storage protein in wheat endosperm. the correlated reduction in the levels of the mrna and the protein of hmw-gs 1bx <dig> suggested vigs-treatment can effectively knockdown genes expressed in developing seeds . notably, the reduction in mrna-level and in protein level of 1bx <dig> in figure  <dig> was not comparable. we speculate that the reason is that the protein abundances shown in figure 6a and 6b were the consequence of about a 10-day-accumulation because hmw-gs genes initially expressed 9~12 days after flowering, while the transcript abundances shown in figure 6e and 6 f were the mrna level of 1bx <dig> in the 1bx14-silenced grains at 20dpi due to the short lifetime of mrna. the peak of gene silencing induced by bsmv was at 20dpi according to qrt-pcr results in the bsmv:1bx <dig> time course study .

however, when silencing the entire hmw-gs gene family in wheat grains with the bsmv:hmw construct, the results were not the same among the three wheat cultivars. all the hmw-gs genes 1ax2*1bx171by181dx <dig> and 1dy <dig> in spring wheat cv. ningchun  <dig> were detectably down-regulated in the seeds of bsmv:hmw infected spikes, but no apparent reduction was detected in the seeds from bsmv:hmw infected spikes of cultivars xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig>  scofield et al.  <cit>  also reported that only 21% of the wheat plants and 16% of the barley plants displayed any detectable photobleaching when infected with the bsmv:pdsas construct carrying an 80-bp pds4as derivative fragment, and no photobleaching was observed in any of the plants infected with the 40-bp pds4as derivative. the sizes of the inserts greatly affect the efficiency of bsmv induced gene silence. therefore, we think that the inconsistency among the three wheat cultivars for silencing hmw-gs gene combinations may be due to the sizes of inserts--asx  plus asy  were not long enough for induction of efficient silencing.

it has been postulated based on early genetic studies  <cit>  that the composition and the amount of hmw-gs in the grains can greatly affect gluten strength and thereby the end use qualities of both tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. the observation of significant alteration in the structure of gluten complex and the processing properties of wheat grains in a transgenic line that over-expresses a single hmw glutenin subunit reinforces this postulation  <cit> . however, more systematic analyses of the direct effects of hmw-gs genes on grain properties are difficult due to technical difficulties in development of an ideal transgenic line that has the target hmw-gs gene over-expressed without affecting other endogenous genes’ expression in wheat grains. there have been many efforts in developing transgenic wheat lines to confirm the function of hmw-gs genes, but most of them could not reach the final stage due to very low transformation efficiency and un-intended side effects in the transgenic wheat lines generated. for example, introduction of a construct overexpressing the gene 1ax <dig> into a commercial spring bread wheat resulted in the inactivation of the 1ax2* allele. transformation of constructs overexpressing both 1ax <dig> and 1dx <dig> resulted in the silencing of all other hmw glutenin subunits  <cit> . the technical difficulties and phenotypic complication associated with transgenic approaches make the development of vigs-based techniques to silence genes in grains more useful and urgent. in this study, we successfully silenced the 1bx <dig> gene, which is highly expressed in seeds of wheat cvs xiaoyan  <dig> and shaanyou  <dig> . silencing of 1bx <dig> led to a significant decrease in the quantity of gmp and the percentage of glutenin macropolymeric protein in total proteins  of the grains , indicating that hmw-gs 1bx <dig> plays very important roles in the formation of glutenin macropolymers . by using purified hmw-gs 1bx <dig> as a supplement to base flour to make dough and test its functional properties, our group found that incorporation of the hmw-gs increased the quantity of glutenin macropolymeric protein  in the dough and enhanced the dough strength  <cit> . the present results further support this conclusion. unexpected was that a reduction of 7%~9% in the total protein content was detected in grains of 1bx14-silenced plants, although an individual glutenin subunit accounts for only about 2% of total grain proteins. the effect of 1bx <dig> silencing on total proteins needs to be further investigated. to our knowledge, this is the first report of knockdown genes expressed in wheat developing seeds with recombinant bsmv. the establishment of this effective approach for gene knockdown in developing seeds will allow us to dissect the genetic pathways that control seed development, grain quality and pathogen defense in grain tissue of hexaploid wheat; it will also provide an important reference for silencing genes in spikes or grains of other monocotyledonous species by vigs.

CONCLUSIONS
we first demonstrated the feasibility of using bsmv for gene silencing in wheat spikes or grains with pds as a marker gene. we determined that inoculation with bsmv onto wheat spikes from heading to flowering stage by spike-rub five times was the optimal condition for silencing pds in wheat spikes. in addition, we successfully silenced hmw-gs gene 1bx <dig> expressing in the developing seeds through the established bsmv-vigs approach. the bsmv-vigs system in spikes and grains will be very useful in future research on functional identification of genes contributing to grain quality and controlling the metabolic networks in seed development of wheat.
