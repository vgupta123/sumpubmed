BACKGROUND
schizophrenia is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and deficits in cognitive function. over the years, epidemiologic studies have accumulated significant evidence that many genetic factors play important roles in both symptomatology and etiology. recent genetic studies, including genome-wide association  studies, have identified several promising candidate genes and loci. one of the most consistent findings in gwa studies is the major histocompatibility  region in 6p  <cit> . this finding strongly implicates the immune system as being involved in the development of schizophrenia. other findings include candidate genes functioning in cell adhesion  <cit> , migration  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit> . except the findings from rare copy number variations  <cit> , the effects of individual genes overall are modest or weak. these results suggest that many genes with moderate or small effects may be involved in schizophrenia  <cit> . it is difficult to identify these genes without increased sample sizes and better analysis of phenotype. integration of other functional studies or utilization of high throughput technologies may increase the power to detect other schizophrenia candidate genes.

whole genome mrna sequencing  allows for the comprehensive survey of all the mrnas in a sample. this platform is the fruit of recently developed high-throughput dna sequencing technology  <cit> , and has produced exciting results in the study of various diseases  <cit> . in this experiment, we applied the rna-seq technology to study schizophrenia. specifically, we aimed to understand the dysregulation in schizophrenia at higher levels of biological structure and to integrate gene expression data to facilitate the identification of promising candidate genes. to accomplish these goals, we sequenced the blood mrnas isolated from  <dig> schizophrenic patients and  <dig> matched healthy controls. we verified the differentially expressed genes  in  <dig> independent pooled samples. we further examined the association of the discovered degs using gwa data from the molecular genetics of schizophrenia  study. two differentially expressed genes, s100a <dig> and tyrobp, reached nominal significance in gene-based association analysis.

materials and methods
subjects, sample preparation and sequencing
schizophrenia patients were recruited from the pool of diagnosed schizophrenia patients of the inpatient unit of the va medical center of western new york  and from the buffalo psychiatric center inpatient unit. all enrolled patients met the dsm-iv criteria for schizophrenia based on the examination of psychiatric case records and clinical interviews by at least two experienced psychiatrists. the healthy individuals were recruited though va employees and advertisements in the local media. individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or other major psychiatric disorders were excluded. a total of  <dig> subjects were included in this study. all subjects gave informed consent to participate in the study. the protocol and consent form were approved by the institutional review boards at the va wny health care system and new york state office mental health.

blood samples were collected with a  <dig> ml vacutainer, acid citrate dextrose  tube. lymphocytes were prepared using isolymph . each  <dig> ml of isolymph contains  <dig>  grams of ficoll  <dig> and  <dig>  grams of diatrizoate sodium) in a density gradient  <cit> . ten ml of whole blood was diluted with equal volume rpmi and mixed by pipetting. three milliliter of isolymph was transferred to a  <dig> ml falcon conical bottom tube and  <dig> ml of diluted blood was carefully layered on top of the isolymph. the samples were centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> minutes. lymphocytes were collected at the interface between the two layers by a sterile  <dig> ml pipette. the lymphocytes were mixed with  <dig> volumes of rpmi and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> minutes. the supernatant was then removed. the lymphocytes were re-suspended in cold freeze medium  at a lymphocytes density of 6- <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. the lymphocytes were distributed to nunc plastic cryopreservation vials for long term storage. the vials were first placed in the cryo freezing container and stored at -80°c for at least  <dig> hours and then transferred to liquid nitrogen for final storage.

rna was prepared from the frozen lymphocytes. total rna was extracted using the mico-to-midi total rna purification system  according to the manufacturer's instructions. the total rna concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm in the functional genomics shared resource  in vanderbilt university.

mrna capture, cdna conversion, sizing, and library construction were performed using kits from the illumina company and by following the manufacture's recommended procedures. for rna-seq application, individual libraries were constructed for  <dig> schizophrenia patients,  <dig> controls, and  <dig> pools  of schizophrenia patients and controls. each library was loaded into a single lane of the illumina genome analyzer ii flow cell. for  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls, we performed paired-end sequencing while for pooled samples, we performed single-end sequencing. image analysis and base-calling were performed by the genome analyzer pipeline version  <dig>  with default parameters  <cit> . library construction and rna sequencing was performed in the genome technology core  in vanderbilt university.

data process and analysis
after obtaining the short reads, we performed a series of quality checks, including quality score evaluation using program htseq  <cit>  and marking duplicate reads by using software samtools  <cit> . all reads were independently aligned to a single reference file consisting of all human transcripts and the human genome in the ucsc genome assembly hg <dig>  by using tophat   <cit> . the aligned sequences were evaluated with samtools for capture efficiency in order to ensure no artificial fragment representation . we ran tophat in the 'paired-end mode' with the minimum distance between paired-end reads of  <dig> bp, a maximum distance of  <dig>  bp, and default settings of other parameters  of the read).

to obtain an accurate measure of transcript abundance, we only used the reads that were uniquely mapped to the human genome. since the sequence reads were paired-end, we quantified expression levels of all transcripts in each subject according to the fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped , which was calculated by the software cufflinks  <cit> . fpkm is a similar measurement to rpkm, which measures gene expression in reads per exon kilobase per million mapped reads . rpkm has been used to normalize measurement of exon read density and allows transcript levels to be compared both within and between samples  <cit> .

considering that rna-seq mainly estimates exon expression and that most genes have multiple transcripts, it is necessary to determine how to estimate gene expression level based on transcript expression data. in our study, we employed a simple strategy: we first identified the differentially expressed transcripts  and then considered the unique genes of these transcripts as differentially expressed genes  for further functional analysis.

to improve the reliability and comparability of differential expression analysis, we only examined the expression difference of those transcripts with fpkm value >  <dig> in all individually sequenced patients and controls  <cit> . using these transcripts, we performed fisher's exact test to identify transcripts with significantly differential expression between patients and controls  <cit> . for each transcript, we constructed a  <dig> ×  <dig> contingency table, which included four fpkm values: n, n-n, r, r-r where n is the sum of fpkm values of a given transcript in  <dig> cases, n is the sum of fpkm values of all transcripts in cases, r is the sum of fpkm values of the given transcript in  <dig> controls, and r is the sum of the fpkm values of all transcripts in controls. to determine the expression change direction, we used "greater" or "less" parameters in the one-tailed fisher's exact test to find the up-regulated transcripts or down-regulated transcripts respectively. next, we controlled the type  <dig> errors by bonferroni correction for the number of tests performed. a transcript was considered differentially expressed if the bonferroni adjusted p-value was less than  <dig> .

for data generated from pooled samples, we performed the same data processing and analysis as the individually sequenced samples except for using single-end mode to perform mapping of the reference sequence.

functional analysis
to assess the function of the degs that we identified, we conducted pathway enrichment tests for the degs using the online tool webgestalt   <cit> . we used all pathways in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database. we selected those pathways having adjusted p-values of less than  <dig>  calculated by the hypergeometric test followed by the benjamini-hochberg method  <cit> , which was implemented in webgestalt. to make the analysis biologically meaningful, we considered only those kegg pathways containing  <dig> or more deg genes.

to further systematically determine canonical signaling pathways and molecular networks that the degs might involve, we performed the pathway/network enrichment analysis using the ingenuity pathway analysis  tool from the ingenuity systems  <cit> . for canonical signaling pathway analysis, given a list of genes, a right-tailed fisher's exact test was performed for the enrichment of these genes in its hand-curated canonical pathway database. here, the p-value calculated for a pathway measures the probability of being randomly selected from all of the curated pathways. to control the error rate in the analysis, ipa also provided a corrected p-values to identify the most significant results in ipa's canonical pathways based on the benjamini-hochberg method  <cit> . this tool allowed us to identify the signaling pathways in which the degs were enriched. in our study, we used a cut-off of the corrected p-value less than  <dig>   to define the significant pathways. for network enrichment, the degs were overlaid onto a global molecular network  developed based on the ingenuity pathways knowledge base, in which functional relationships such as activation, chemical-protein interaction, expression, inhibition and regulation of binding were manually curated. subnetworks of genes were then extracted from the gmn based on their connectivity using the algorithm developed by ipa  <cit> . for each subnetwork, a likelihood score, which measures the probability of the degs being found in the same subnetwork by chance, was transformed from the p- values calculated by fisher's exact test. additionally, the ipa assigned the top  <dig> biological functions for each network it identified.

gene-based genome-wide association analysis
the rna-seq application produced a list of differentially expressed genes in schizophrenia. we examined whether genetic variants in these degs harbored association signals. we conducted a gene-based gwa analysis using the mgs dataset for schizophrenia. we obtained this dataset from dbgap under the protocol of "genetic study of schizophrenia, nicotine dependence and other comorbid psychiatric disorders" by x.c. for each gene, its association p-value with schizophrenia was estimated using the vegas  software package  <cit> .

RESULTS
an overview of rna-seq data
in this study, we conducted genome-wide rna sequencing for  <dig> individual samples and  <dig> pooled samples. the data from individually sequenced subjects was used for the initial identification of degs, while the pooled data was used to validate these degs.

for the  <dig> individually sequenced samples, after filtering by quality score, we generated an average of  <dig>  million pairs of 43-bp paired-end reads per sample. the quality scores of the reads were satisfactory , of which  <dig> % of the called bases had a phred score ≥  <dig>  table  <dig> shows the mapping statistics of the fragments. for each subject, an average of approximately  <dig> % of the reads could be mapped to the human reference genome. among the mapped sequences, ~ <dig> % of the read pairs were uniquely mapped to the human genome as properly aligned fragments. this is similar to the output of other rna-seq sequencing studies  <cit> .

aeach fragment has two short sequence reads.

bfor uniquely mapped fragments, both of the two reads could be uniquely mapped to a unique location in the reference genome.

cfor singleton fragments, only one of the two reads could be mapped to the reference genome.

dfor spliced fragments, at least one of the two reads could be mapped across a splicing junction.

these reads were used to estimate transcript expression of all  <dig> samples. table  <dig> shows the transcripts detected by rna-seq in subjects and mapped genes with fpkm values and coverage. of the  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  genes annotated in the ucsc hg <dig>  we detected  <dig>   transcripts , which mapped to  <dig>   unique genes. among these transcripts, on average,  <dig>  had their fpkm values higher than  <dig> 

afor individually sequenced dataset, we used fpkm  to estimate transcript expression.

bthe coverage was calculated based on the unit of transcript.

for the pooled samples, we generated a total of  <dig>  million reads for the cases, of which  <dig> % were mapped to the human reference genome, and  <dig>  million reads for the controls, of which  <dig> % were mapped. the resulting expression on transcription level and gene level were summarized in table  <dig> 

identification of differentially expressed genes
to identify the degs between the cases and controls, we used only those transcripts with fpkm values >  <dig>  in all the  <dig> subjects. with this criterion,  <dig> transcripts were included for differential expression analysis. using fisher's exact test, a total of  <dig> transcripts reached significance after bonferroni correction . among these transcripts,  <dig>  were significantly down-regulated and  <dig>  were significantly up-regulated. in addition to transcripts expressed in both cases and controls, there were transcripts detected only in the cases or controls. based on the fpkm distribution , transcripts exclusively expressed in either cases or controls with fpkm >  <dig>  were included in the pathway and functional analyses. there were  <dig> transcripts exclusively expressed in cases  and  <dig> transcripts exclusively expressed in controls  . thus, we obtained a total of  <dig> genes differentially expressed among the  <dig> sequenced subjects.

validation and functional enrichment analysis of the degs
to validate the degs discovered from the individually sequenced dataset, we conducted similar differential expression analyses for the pooled dataset . there were  <dig> transcripts reaching nominal significance, of which  <dig> were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated . of the  <dig> degs identified from the individually sequenced dataset,  <dig> were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated genes  that were found differentially expressed between cases and controls in the pooled dataset .

we conducted kegg pathway profiling of these  <dig> degs. the results are shown in table  <dig>  of the pathways enriched in these  <dig> genes, the most noticeable ones are involved in the immune and inflammation systems . interestingly, the cell adhesion molecules pathway  was the only pathway that was found to be significantly associated with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in a recent pathway analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder gwas datasets  <cit> . it was also highlighted in our recent pathway analysis using a generalized additive model for correction of gene length biases and other two methods  . upon our further examination, we found  <dig> deg genes in the cams pathway. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were down-regulated  and two were up-regulated . among the  <dig> down-regulated genes, three  were in the mhc region  .

anominal p-value was calculated by hypergeometric test.

badjusted p-values was corrected of nominal p-values by benjamini-hochberg multiple testing correction.

for the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in both datasets, four are involved in immune systems . in our kegg pathway enrichment analysis, we found several pathways overrepresented in these genes including "chemokine signaling pathway" and "cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction," both of which were found significantly overrepresented in the  <dig> genes . we further examined the pathways that were significantly overrepresented in these genes using ipa tools. the most significant pathways were "mif-mediated glucocorticoid regulation," "mif regulation of innate immunity," "trem <dig> signaling," and "induction of apoptosis by hiv1". mif  is a unique counter-regulator of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities of glucocorticoids. consistent with the results of  <dig> genes, all of these pathways are related to immune and inflammation systems. furthermore, we conducted network analysis using ipa. figure  <dig> shows the top network overrepresented in these genes, in which the top three functions are "molecular transport," "cellular movement," and "hematological system development and function." note that several genes in figure  <dig> are potentially interesting like cd <dig>  s100a <dig>  akt, il <dig>  tyrobp, hbb and hba <dig>  among them, cd <dig> encodes a type ii transmembrane protein, which is a binding protein for mif and an essential protein for mif-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2map kinase cascade, cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> .

gene-based association analyses of degs
one of the objectives of our rna-seq experiments was to test whether differentially expressed genes were enriched for association signals in gwa studies. towards this goal, we conducted gene-based gwa analysis using the mgs dataset and the vegas method  <cit> .this analysis produced a p value for each gene by considering gene's linkage disequilibrium information from the hapmap populations. we matched the  <dig> degs with those genes from the association analysis. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> had their p values less than  <dig>  . this was 2-fold enrichment than the expected . five genes  from the matched list had been previously studied for schizophrenia with positive association signals, the rest of the genes were involved in immune responses or other neuronal diseases. two genes, s100a <dig> and tyrobp, were differentially expressed in both the individual and pooled sequencing datasets.

athe association was examined using the mgs gwas dataset  by the vegas method.

discussion
recent studies have shown that most genetic factors predisposing to schizophrenia have only a modest effect. gwa studies alone seem insufficient to identify the majority of these genetic factors. expression level is an index of function of genes and may be useful for identifying risk genes for schizophrenia at the transciptomic level. in this study, we took advantage of recently available next generation sequencing technologies  to sequence poly-a tailed mrnas from blood samples of  <dig> individuals and  <dig> pools of schizophrenia patients and controls. in the  <dig> individually sequenced samples, we found  <dig> genes showing differentially expression between cases and controls. among these genes,  <dig> were nominally significant at the expression level in the  <dig> pooled samples. in our ipa analysis, we found that mif regulation of innate immunity and trem <dig> signaling were highly enriched in these  <dig> genes. furthermore, of the  <dig> degs,  <dig> reached nominal significance in gene-based association analysis of the mgsgwas dataset. nineteen of these  <dig> genes are directly involved in immune response/diseases, or have been studied for candidates for schizophrenia and other neuronal diseases. two genes, s100a <dig> and tyrobp, showed the same direction of expression changes in the individual and pooled sequencing datasets, and they also reached nominal significance in gene-based association analysis.

s100a <dig>  also called mrp- <dig>  encodes a calcium binding protein involved in inflammatory responses. it has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit>  and cancers  <cit> . intriguingly, rheumatoid arthritis may be correlated with schizophrenia  <cit> . tyrobp, also known as dap <dig>  encodes an immunoreceptor adaptor protein that plays a key role in osteoclast differentiation and maturation  <cit> . mutations in this gene lead to the nasu-hakola disease  <cit> , a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone cyst and presenile dementia. in addition to their functions in the immune system, both genes are expressed in human brain. s100a <dig> shows elevated expression in cerebral ischemia  <cit>  and posttraumatic brain injuries  <cit> . in a mouse model study, s100a <dig> expression increases significantly after chronic treatment with the antipsychotic drug olanzapine, which is used primarily to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients. tyrobp is implicated in the developmental neuronal death in hippocampus  <cit> , impaired glutamatergic synaptic functions  <cit>  and brain myelination  <cit> . all of these factors have been suspected to be involved in schizophrenia. tyrobp knockout mouse studies reveal deficits in cognitive functions and prepulse inhibition  <cit> , symptoms that have been manifested in many schizophrenia patients. however, neither gene has been studied directly for schizophrenia. they may be novel candidates for the disease.

glatt et al  <cit>  applied microarray techniques to compare gene expression of peripheral blood cells  and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  of the brain to identify risk factors for schizophrenia. they detected  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the blood samples. among our  <dig> degs,  <dig> genes had the same direction of expression changes as reported by glatt et al. specifically, eight genes were down-regulated  and five were up-regulated . the overlap of  <dig> genes with same direction of expression change is unlikely by chance considering they were selected from a genome-wide gene pool . interestingly, among the eight down-regulated genes, cd <dig> was consistently found down- regulated in three gene expression data sets . gene cd <dig> encodes a protein in mhc and is located in a region implicated by genome-wide linkage meta-analyses  <cit> . additionally, the mhc locus on chromosome 6p was the most consistent finding from gwa studies  <cit> . another gene, hla-drb <dig>  also located in the mhc locus, was found to be differentially expressed in three data sets . hla-drb <dig> has been reported for positive association with schizophrenia  <cit> . we also found that snps influencing the expression of hla-drb <dig>  were significantly associated with schizophrenia in the catie and mgs datasets . this result provides empirical evidence that a combination of gwa data and eqtl analysis may be effective to identify risk genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this exploratory study aims at evaluating how rna-seq can be used to facilitate the identification of risk genes for complex diseases such as schizophrenia. limitations include 1) the small number of subjects sequenced in this study and 2) only one pair of pooled samples was available to confirm the degs discovered in the individually sequenced dataset. note that many rna-seq studies published in the past three years were based on a small number of samples   <cit> . due to these limitations, many genes potentially involved in schizophrenia could not be detected in the individually sequenced dataset and none of the genes in the pooled sample dataset reached significance after bonferroni or false discovery rate correction. for these reasons, we selected to use those genes that reached nominal significance  to verify the degs from the individually sequenced dataset. this may lead to the inclusion of some false positives in the  <dig> genes. at this time, we are unable to distinguish the true positives from the false ones. since we observed  <dig> overlapping genes for the  <dig> degs, exceeding the expected number by chance, collectively, a majority of these  <dig> genes are unlikely to be false positives. the pathways and processes identified based on these  <dig> genes are likely reliable, and should provide important insights on the genes whose expression might be involved in the development of schizophrenia. based on the same rationale, the list of genes identified by gene-based analysis may have false positives, but most of the genes could be considered promising candidates for schizophrenia. these promising candidates warrant further validation.

in summary, by combining high throughput rna sequencing and gwa data, we have identified a list of candidate genes for schizophrenia despite our small sample size. these genes are enriched in the pathways and processes of the immune system. our study demonstrates that integration of gwas and gene expression can provide valuable information to prioritize candidates for future studies.
