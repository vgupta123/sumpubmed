BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  is a member of the family arteriviridae, order nidovirales  <cit>  causing major economic losses in the pig industry worldwide  <cit> . prrsv infection may result in reproductive failure in sows and is involved in the porcine respiratory disease complex   <cit> .

in vivo, the virus infects a subpopulation of tissue macrophages  <cit> . in vitro, efficient prrsv replication is only observed in primary pig macrophages   <cit> , differentiated monocytes  <cit>  or african green monkey kidney derived cells, such as marc- <dig>  <cit> . infection of macrophages, the natural host cell of prrsv, occurs via a few similar but also different receptors compared to infection of marc- <dig> cells  <cit> . prrsv first attaches to macrophages via heparan sulphate  <cit> , then the virus is internalized via sialoadhesin   <cit> . cd <dig> is also involved in infection of macrophages, probably at the stage of virus disassembly  <cit> . prrsv infection of marc- <dig> cells occurs via binding to a heparin-like molecule as a first step  <cit> . the nucleocapsid of prrsv is described to bind to the intermediate filament vimentin, which is suggested to mediate transport of the virus to the cytosol  <cit> . cd <dig> may be involved in fusion of the viral envelope and the endosome, but the precise mechanism is yet unknown  <cit> . cd <dig> is also essential for prrsv infection of marc- <dig> cells, but its role in this process is still unclear  <cit> .

currently, prrs vaccine virus is produced in marc- <dig> cells. however, since virus entry in marc- <dig> cells is different compared to entry in primary macrophages  <cit>  and because adaptation is needed for growth on marc- <dig> cells  <cit> , it is possible that specific epitopes associated with virus neutralization are lost or modified. although virus production in primary macrophages would be ideal to avoid adaptation, these cells cannot be used because of batch variation, risk of contamination with other pathogens present in the macrophages isolated from pigs and high production costs. previous results in our lab showed that non-permissive cells transiently transfected with sn only sustained internalization, but not infection  <cit> . non-permissive cells transiently transfected with cd <dig> allow a low level of infection depending on the cell type used  <cit> . co-expression of both sn and cd <dig> is the most efficient for prrsv infection in different cell lines evaluated  <cit> .

to avoid the problems associated with prrs vaccine virus production in other cell types, the aim of this study was to construct cell lines that recombinantly express sn, the receptor that mediates prrsv attachment to and internalization into macrophages  <cit>  and cd <dig>  which is most probably involved in virus disassembly in macrophages  <cit> . both sn and cd <dig> are needed to make a prrsv susceptible cell line for virus production that mimics the natural entry pathway in macrophages.

methods
cells, viruses and plasmids
cho-k <dig> cells were cultivated in f <dig> medium and pk <dig> cells in dulbecco modified eagle medium . both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig> mm non-essential amino acids,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate and a mixture of antibiotics. the cells were maintained in a humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere at 37°c. macrophages cultivated in medium containing rpmi- <dig>  10% fbs,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig> mm non-essential amino acids,  <dig> mm sodium pyruvate and a mixture of antibiotics were used for titration. a pcdna <dig> d/v5-histopo plasmid containing sn cdna and geneticine resistance gene  <cit>  and a pbud plasmid with cd <dig> cdna and zeocin resistance gene were used for transfection. to construct the pbud plasmid containing cd <dig>  cd <dig> from a pcdna <dig> d/v5-histopo plasmid containing cd <dig>  <cit> , was cloned into a pbud plasmid via restriction site hindiii and xbai. the european prototype prrsv strain lelystad virus , grown on marc- <dig> cells and macrophages  <cit> , the american prototype prrsv strain vr- <dig> grown on marc- <dig> cells  <cit> , and three recent belgian isolates, belonging to the european type, grown on macrophages  were used for inoculation.

transfection and selection
cho-k <dig> and pk <dig> cells were transfected with fugene  <dig>  or lipofectamine plus  respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. cho-k <dig> and pk <dig> cells were first transfected with a plasmid containing the sn cdna and geneticine resistance gene. the cells were single cell cloned and selected for sn expressing cho and pk <dig> cells with geneticine . afterwards, the obtained chosn and pk15sn cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the cd <dig> cdna and zeocin resistance gene and single cell cloned. for the selection of chosn and pk15sn cells expressing cd <dig>  zeocin  was used.

screening of cells expressing sn and cd <dig> by immunofluorescence staining
transfected cho-k <dig> and pk <dig> cells were fixed with methanol and stained with primary monoclonal antibodies  against sn   <cit>  and cd <dig>   <cit> . as a secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate -conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulins  were used. screening of cells expressing sn and/or cd <dig> was performed with a fluorescence microscope .

analysis of prrsv infection of chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells by immunoperoxidase staining
chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells were seeded in 96-well plates and inoculated with virus. at different time points post inoculation , the cells were fixed with methanol and an immunoperoxidase staining was performed  <cit> . briefly, viral antigen positive cells were stained with primary mab anti-nucleocapsid p3/ <dig>  <cit>  and secondary antibody peroxidase labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin  . afterwards, 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole  substrate  was added. the amount of infected cells was counted with a light microscope .

to determine attachment, internalization, disassembly and infection of chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, the cells were seeded at  <dig>  <dig> cells/ml and after  <dig> days of cultivation they were inoculated with virus. the cells were fixed with methanol after  <dig> hour incubation at 4°c to investigate attachment, since virus is not able to internalize at 4°c. the cells were fixed after  <dig> hour incubation at 37°c to determine the internalized particles. after  <dig> hours incubation at 37°c, the cells were fixed to analyze disassembly . to analyze infection, the cells were fixed after  <dig> hours incubation at 37°c. the virus was stained with a primary mab anti-nucleocapsid p3/ <dig>  <cit>  and a secondary fitc-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulins . virus particles were counted on images acquired with a tcs sp <dig> laser scanning spectrum confocal system .

chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells were seeded at  <dig>  <dig> cells/ml in tissue culture  flasks. after  <dig> days of cultivation, the cells were initially inoculated with  <dig> tcid <dig> of each virus strain. after  <dig> and  <dig> days post inoculation , the supernatant was collected and centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> × g at 4°c. the supernatant was stored at -70°c and titrated. virus titration was performed on  <dig> hours cultivated alveolar macrophages following the standard procedure  <cit> . after  <dig> days of incubation at 37°c, the occurrence of cytopathic effect  was investigated. macrophages were fixed at  <dig> dpi and an immunoperoxidase staining was performed to identify infected cells. the 50% tissue culture infective dose  was calculated.

virus sequencing after passaging virus in pk15sn-cd <dig> cells
rna was extracted from prrsv passaged  <dig> times on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells using a rneasy protect mini kit  and reverse transcribed using random hexamers and multiscribe reverse transcriptase  according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

the primers orf2a-fw  and orf2a-rev , orf3-fw  and orf3-rev , orf4-fw  and orf4-rev , orf5-fw <dig>  and orf5-rev <dig> , orf6fw  and orf6rev , orf7-fw  and orf7-rev  were used to amplify the different orfs with taq polymerase . pcr products were treated with exonuclease i and antarctic phosphatase  and used directly for cycle sequencing with a big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit v <dig>   and prrsv primers. cycle sequencing reaction products were purified by ethanol precipitation and separated on an abi genetic  <dig> .

the sequences were analyzed and compiled by blastn and blastp http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, and sixframe, clustalw, align . the genbank accession number are for 07v <dig> , 08v <dig>  and for 08v <dig> .

RESULTS
construction of chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cell line
cho-k <dig> and pk <dig> cells were transfected with sn and cd <dig> and selected for cells expressing both receptors as shown in figure 1a. the presence of sn and cd <dig> was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining .  <dig> cho and  <dig> pk <dig> clones co-expressing sn and cd <dig>  were selected.  <dig> cho and  <dig> pk <dig> clones were obtained, in which 100% of the cells retained stable expression of sn and cd <dig> for at least  <dig> passages. the other  <dig> cho clones lost either sn or cd <dig> expression after a few passages. after a preliminary screening for prrsv susceptibility,  <dig> cho clones  and  <dig> pk <dig> clones  were retained for further analysis.

to construct a cell line co-expressing sn and cd <dig>  cho-k <dig> or pk <dig> cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the sn cdna and a geneticine resistance gene. the cells were single cell cloned and clones were screened for sn expressing cells. after selection for geneticine resistance, the obtained chosn or pk15sn cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the cd <dig> cdna and a zeocin resistance gene, which allowed selection of cells expressing both sn and cd <dig>

some chosn-cd <dig> clones  and pk15sn-cd <dig> clones  are represented with their sn and cd <dig> expression.

effect of cell density and cultivation time of chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells on the susceptibility to prrsv infection
to determine the effect of cell density and cultivation time of the cells on susceptibility to prrsv infection,  <dig> chosn-cd <dig> cell clones  and  <dig> pk15sn-cd <dig> cell clones  were seeded at different cell densities  and inoculated with  <dig> μl containing  <dig> tcid <dig> marc- <dig> grown lv, marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig> or macrophage grown lv at different days post seeding . after  <dig> dpi, the cells were fixed and stained.

for marc- <dig> grown virus infection of chosn-cd <dig> cells, little difference was observed between different cell densities and days post seeding, although a density of  <dig>  <dig> cells/ml and inoculation at  <dig> days post seeding seemed a little more efficient. the vr- <dig> strain infected the chosn-cd <dig> cells more efficiently than the lv strain. for pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, the infection rate for marc- <dig> grown lv as well as vr- <dig> was approximately 80%, independently of densities and cultivation time. chosn-cd <dig> clones ic <dig>  id <dig> and if <dig> were equally sensitive to virus infection. there was no difference in sensitivity for infection between pk15sn-cd <dig> clones ixh <dig> and ixa <dig>  the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells could be infected more efficiently than the chosn-cd <dig> cells .

both chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells showed a low infection rate with macrophage grown virus. the cell density had no influence on infection. there were no differences between clone ic <dig>  id <dig> and if <dig> for chosn-cd <dig> and between ixh <dig> and ixa <dig> for pk15sn-cd <dig> cells . overall, marc- <dig> grown virus strains could infect the cells more efficiently than macrophage grown virus strains tested.

effect of neuraminidase treatment of chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells on the susceptibility to macrophage grown prrsv infection
the previous section showed that macrophage grown prrsv infection rate is very low. previously, it was however shown that infection of macrophages can be enhanced after removal of sialic acid from the cells with neuraminidase, as observed in our lab  <cit> . desialylation of macrophages enhances sialoadhesin-mediated lectin activity  <cit> . since the interaction between sialic acids on prrsv and sialoadhesin is important for infection of cells  <cit> , desialylation of the chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells can probably enhance the amount of infected cells by macrophage grown virus. therefore, to increase the infection rate of macrophage grown virus infection,  <dig> chosn-cd <dig> cell clones  and  <dig> pk15sn-cd <dig> cell clones  were seeded at different densities  and were infected at different days post seeding  with  <dig> μl containing  <dig> tcid <dig> macrophage grown lv, after treatment of the cells with neuraminidase to remove cis-acting sialic acids. after  <dig> dpi, the cells were fixed and stained. the results showed that treatment of the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells at  <dig>  <dig> cell/ml with neuraminidase before inoculation enhanced infection of the cells with macrophage grown virus .

analysis of prrsv attachment, internalization, disassembly and infection of chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells
to investigate if virus attachment, internalization, disassembly and infection occurs in the chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, chosn-cd <dig> clone ic <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> clone ixh <dig> were inoculated with marc- <dig> grown lv , marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig>  and macrophage grown lv . the virus was stained by immunofluorescence at different stages of the viral replication cycle. first, the virus particles were clearly shown to attach to the cells. then, virus particles were internalized into the cells, with macrophage grown virus being less efficient than marc- <dig> grown virus. after internalization, the particles were uncoated to release the genome. finally, infection occurred . in general, marc- <dig> grown virus infected the cells more efficiently than macrophage grown virus. further, marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig> infected the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells more efficiently than marc- <dig> grown lv, while this was equal for the chosn-cd <dig> cells. infection of the cells with macrophage grown virus was very low. treatment of the cells with neuraminidase before inoculation enhanced the infection rate of pk15sn-cd <dig> cells. the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells were infected most efficiently in all cases .

prrsv infection kinetics on chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells
to investigate the susceptibility of chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells to prrsv infection, cells were seeded at  <dig>  <dig> cells/ml and infected with marc- <dig> grown lv, marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig> or macrophage grown lv at a moi of  <dig>  at  <dig> days post seeding. for macrophage grown virus infection, a comparison was made between infection of cells treated with neuraminidase and untreated cells. the cells were fixed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi and stained by immunoperoxidase. figure  <dig> shows that marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig> could infect more chosn-cd <dig> cells than marc- <dig> grown lv, while both strains infect pk15sn-cd <dig> cells for approximately 80%. macrophage grown virus did infect a low number of cells for the two cell lines . if the chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells were treated with neuraminidase, infection of the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, but not the chosn-cd <dig> cells, with macrophage grown virus was increased . at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, the highest amount of virus infection was achieved, with up to 20% for marc- <dig> grown lv and up to 40% for marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig> on chosn-cd <dig> cells and up to 80% for both marc- <dig> grown strains on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells. the infection rate of cells infected with macrophage grown virus did not reach 5% in both cell lines. after treatment of the cells with neuraminidase, infection with macrophage grown virus increased on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells. in summary, marc- <dig> grown lv and marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig> could infect the cell lines most efficiently. macrophage grown virus gave little infection, but if the cells were first treated with neuraminidase, infection was slightly better in the case of pk15sn-cd <dig> cells.

virus production in chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells
to determine virus production in chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, the cells were inoculated with marc- <dig> grown vr- <dig>  macrophage grown lv, macrophage grown 07v <dig>  macrophage grown 08v <dig> and macrophage grown 08v <dig>  when the virus was passaged for several times, the virus titer increased, especially in pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, to reach a stable level starting from passage  <dig>  a titer of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  tcid50/ml was obtained after  <dig> passages in chosn-cd <dig> cells for vr- <dig> and 07v <dig> respectively. lv, 08v <dig> and 08v <dig> did not grow on chosn-cd <dig> cells. a titer of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  tcid50/ml was achieved after  <dig> passages in pk15sn-cd <dig> cells for lv, vr- <dig>  07v <dig>  08v <dig> and 08v <dig> respectively. all virus titers of virus produced in both cell lines till passage  <dig> are represented in figure  <dig>  as a comparison, also virus yield obtained after  <dig> passages in marc- <dig> cells was determined via titration on macrophages, revealing a titer of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  tcid50/ml for lv, vr- <dig>  07v <dig>  08v <dig> and 08v <dig> respectively. similar virus titers are thus produced in pk15sn-cd <dig> and marc- <dig> cells.

virus sequencing after passaging virus in pk15sn-cd <dig> cells
as most virus strains grow better on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, this cell line was more interesting to grow vaccine virus than chosn-cd <dig> cells. to produce vaccine virus for inactivated vaccines mutation of structural proteins should not occur. therefore, pk15sn-cd <dig> grown virus was sequenced and compared to the sequence of the original virus. vr- <dig> and 07v <dig> grown on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells showed no differences after  <dig> passages compared to the original virus strain. pk15sn-cd <dig> grown lv showed  <dig> amino acid , 08v <dig>  <dig> aa and 08v <dig>  <dig> aa differences compared to macrophage grown virus. for lv the aa change was in orf <dig> . the aa differences of 08v <dig> were located in orf <dig>  and in orf <dig> . for 08v <dig> the aa differences were situated in orf <dig> , orf <dig>  and orf <dig> .

discussion
prrsv replicates efficiently in ex vivo cultivated primary macrophages, which are the natural host cells. for vaccine virus production however, this cell type cannot be used, because of batch variation, risk of contamination with other pathogens and high production costs. prrsv susceptible cell lines, such as the african green monkey derived cell lines, like marc- <dig>  have the potential to overcome problems associated with the use of primary macrophages, such as up-scaling and safety. however, prrsv infects marc- <dig> cells via a different entry pathway compared to macrophages, which results in adaptation of the virus for growth on marc- <dig> cells  <cit> .

several non-permissive cells transfected with rna of prrsv could produce infectious virus. it is therefore suggested that the susceptibility of cells for prrsv infection is determined by membrane-associated components  <cit> . in a previous study, it was shown that non-permissive cells transiently transfected with sn only sustained internalization, but not infection  <cit> . non-permissive cells transiently transfected with cd <dig> may allow a low level of infection depending on the cell type used  <cit> . van gorp et al. showed that co-expression of both sn and scavenger receptor cd <dig> are needed for an efficient prrsv infection  <cit> . a virus titer ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  tcid50/ml could be obtained upon prrsv infection of cells transiently transfected with recombinant sn and cd <dig>  <cit> . since only a part of the cells were transfected upon transient transfection, it was expected that the virus titer would be higher if stably transfected cell lines could be used. in this study, cell lines that express both recombinant sn and cd <dig>  were made, as both receptors are involved in infection of the natural host cell, the macrophage  <cit> . the constructed chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cell lines were first analyzed for their prrsv susceptibility. they were both susceptible for prrsv, because lv and vr- <dig> virus attachment, internalization, disassembly and infection occurred in both cell lines.

when analyzing the prrsv susceptibility, it was shown that primary infection of the cell lines was more efficient with marc- <dig> grown virus than macrophage grown virus. the infection rate of macrophage grown virus was very low, most likely because binding and internalization of macrophage grown virus particles into the cell lines was not efficient. the interaction of macrophage grown prrsv with sn, the receptor mediating binding to and internalization into the cells, is probably not efficient. this can be due to sialic acids present on the cells interfering with sn, resulting in competition with sialic acid on prrsv. this hypothesis is based on the observation that cd <dig>  also a member of the sialoadhesin family, transfected in cos cells were not able to bind to red blood cells, containing sialic acid, unless the cos cells were first treated with sialidase to remove endogenous ligands  <cit> . also chosn cells showed no binding of red blood cells unless they were treated with neuraminidase  <cit> .

to investigate if neuraminidase could improve macrophage grown prrsv infection, the chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells were first treated with vibrio cholerae neuraminidase  to remove potential cis-acting sialic acids that could interfere with the sialic acid binding capacity of sn  <cit> . this resulted in an increased amount of macrophage grown virus infected cells. these results suggest that the low virus titers are related with a low binding capacity of prrsv to sn, because of sialic acid present on the chosn-cd <dig> and pk15sn-cd <dig> cells. marc- <dig> grown prrsv will most likely also contain sialic acids that can interfere with sn. our hypothesis is that also the production of marc- <dig> grown virus can be improved by neuraminidase treatment of the cells and needs to be further investigated.

however, using an expensive product like vibrio cholerae neuraminidase is not ideal for vaccine production. to avoid this problem, virus is grown via several passages on the cell lines. normally, titers of 105- <dig> tcid50/ml can be obtained on marc- <dig> cells after  <dig> to  <dig> passages  <cit> . the results show that the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells give similar results as a recent macrophage cell line transfected with cd <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells also express sn, which is important to facilitate virus entry. the macrophage cell line transfected with cd <dig> also expresses sn  <cit> , which confirms that both receptors, sn and cd <dig>  are important for an efficient virus production. virus growth on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells resulted in higher titers than growth on chosn-cd <dig> cells and the virus titer achieved on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells was equal to the titer on marc- <dig> cells, which makes the pk15sn-cd <dig> cell line an interesting tool for virus production.

it is reported that due to adaptation of prrsv to marc- <dig> cells, mutations in non-structural, but also structural viral proteins may occur  <cit> . for the production of an inactivated virus vaccine, mutations in orfs encoding viral structural proteins are not desired, since this can influence the induction of a virus neutralizing antibody response. the virus grown on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells is expected to show less mutations than after growth on marc- <dig> cells, since the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells express sn and cd <dig>  two receptors important in the entry of the virus in macrophages and the entry-associated domains are probably involved in the induction of a neutralizing antibody response. to investigate if virus grown on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells showed mutation in orfs encoding viral structural proteins, orf2a,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were sequenced. 07v <dig> and vr- <dig> grown on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells showed a 100% aa identity with 07v <dig> grown on macrophages and vr- <dig> grown on marc- <dig> cells. lv grown on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells had  <dig> aa changed in orf  <dig> compared to macrophage grown lv, which resulted in a loss of a putative glycosylation site. the mutation, however, was not situated in a known neutralizing epitope  <cit> . pk15sn-cd <dig> grown 08v <dig> had  <dig> aa difference compared to macrophage grown 08v <dig>  there was  <dig> aa changed in orf <dig>  this resulted not in a loss of a glycosylation site, but the glycosylation site moved to another place. the mutation was not situated in a known neutralizing epitope  <cit> . the second aa change was located in orf2a, however a change from e to d is supposed to have no effect on the protein structure since those aa are similar. for 08v <dig> grown on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells, there was  <dig> aa changed in orf2a,  <dig> aa in orf <dig> and  <dig> aa in orf <dig>  the mutation in orf <dig>  however was a change from i to v, which are comparable aa and will not have an influence on the protein structure. the mutation in orf <dig> results in a loss of a putative glycosylation site, but is not located in a known neutralizing epitope  <cit> . the mutation in orf <dig> of 08v <dig> and 08v <dig> are both on position  <dig>  this position varies among different prrsv strains and is a not well conserved glycosylation site  <cit> . these results indicate that the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells are useful for production of vaccine virus, but each strain should be investigated for aa changes in the structural proteins before use in inactivated vaccine production. experiments are ongoing to test the immunogenicity of inactivated prrsv grown on pk15sn-cd <dig> cells and the effect of the minor aa changes on the induction of a protective immunity towards challenge virus.

the observation that all tested strains grow well on the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells also suggests that these cells might be useful for virus isolation. currently marc- <dig> cells are used for diagnostics, but it has been shown that not all prrsv strains can be detected on those cells  <cit> . macrophages, the natural host cell of prrsv, are more efficient for virus isolation  <cit> . the difference in isolation efficiency between marc- <dig> cells and macrophages is suggesting that another receptor next to cd <dig> is involved in infection as marc- <dig> cells and macrophages both express cd <dig>  <cit> . the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells can be useful for virus isolation, because of the expression of both cd <dig> and sn, but needs to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
a prrsv susceptible cell line expressing two major receptors for infection in macrophages, namely sn and cd <dig>  was constructed. it is shown that virus production from genotype  <dig>  and genotype  <dig>  on the cell line is possible with virus titers being equal to the virus titers achieved on marc- <dig> cells. no or only a few mutations occur in the orfs encoding viral structural proteins and the mutations that occur for some viruses are not situated in known neutralizing epitopes. therefore it is assumed that an inactivated prrsv vaccine based on virus grown on the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells will be able to induce a proper immune response, but this is currently under investigation. in addition, the pk15sn-cd <dig> cells can probably also be used for virus isolation, because of the expression of both sn and cd <dig>  but this also needs to be confirmed.
