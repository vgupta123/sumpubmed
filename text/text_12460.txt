BACKGROUND
sars is a new infectious disease that emerged in the guangdong province of china in november  <dig>  it caused  <dig>  infection cases including  <dig> deaths worldwide during its epidemic  <cit> . the causative pathogen of sars was identified as a novel strain of human coronavirus, named as sars-cov, and its complete genome was sequenced in march  <dig>  <cit> . in may  <dig>  sars-covs were also isolated from a few himalayan palm civets  and a raccoon dog  in a food market in shenzhen   <cit> . these isolations provided the first evidence that wild animals could be reservoirs for sars-cov, and that the virus might be transmitted from animals to humans. the re-emergence of sars in 2003– <dig> in guangdong, china confirmed that sars-cov was independently transmitted from animals to humans  <cit> .

the s protein of sars-cov is composed of  <dig>  amino acids, and is responsible for viral attachment and entry into host cells  <cit> . it is also a major antigenic determinant that induces generation of neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity at least in human host  <cit> . unlike some coronaviruses, in which s protein can be cleaved into two functional subunits, s <dig> and s <dig>  the s protein of sars-cov is not cleavable due to the absence of the proteolytic cleavage site. however, two domains, s <dig>  and s <dig>  were identified in sars-cov s protein in the light of their homology with the s <dig> and s <dig> subunits  <cit> . domain s <dig> is responsible for binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme- <dig> , which serves as the functional receptor of sars-cov  <cit> . domain s <dig> mediates viral entry into host cells  <cit> . previous works indicated that interspecies transmission may be due to the acquisition of mutations in s protein which allows human infection, suggesting that s protein ought to be a major target of selective pressure  <cit> .

a criterion for the determination of selective pressure is to compare nonsynonymous  with synonymous  substitution rates in protein-coding genes. the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio  provides a straightforward measurement of selective pressure at the protein level. the ω values of >  <dig>   <dig> and <  <dig> indicate positive  selection, random drift and negative  selection, respectively. the pairwise analysis showed that s protein, which has an average ω ratio for all amino acid sites greater than  <dig>  is under overall positive selective pressure  <cit> . however, the process of adaptation of s protein to human receptors and the positively selected sites associated with this process remain unclear. because previous epidemic phases  <cit>  are unable to adequately reflect the process of animal-to-human transmission and of viral adaptation to human host, we therefore reclassified the sars groups in the present study. we found that the s protein of sars-cov experiences variable positive selective pressures and the positively selected sites are changeable in different epidemic groups. these observations provide a good evidence for understanding the molecular adaptation of sars-cov from animals to humans.

RESULTS
positive selection on s genes of sars-cov during the whole outbreak from  <dig> to 2004
the likelihood values and parameter estimates of  <dig> s gene sequences from six models implemented in program codeml are listed in table  <dig>  the average ω values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  among all models, showing the evidence of purifying selection. although the one-ratio model  showed that all sites of s gene have a ω ratio of  <dig> , it was easily rejected as a result of the lowest likelihood value  and the likelihood ratio test  statistic  . three models  that allow for selection indicated the presence of  <dig> – <dig> % positively selected sites with similar ω values . lrt statistic showed that the three selection models fitted the data significantly better than the null models without selection, supporting the presence of  <dig> – <dig> % amino acid sites of s gene under strong positive selection . at the level of posterior probability >  <dig> , four, twelve and eight sites of s protein were identified to be under positive selection  by selection models m2a, m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively . twelve positively selected sites detected by m <dig> were also identified by m2a and m <dig> at the level of posterior probability >  <dig>  . the number of positively selected sites discovered in the present study was similar to the number of the sites identified in previous reports  <cit> .

detection of recombination and positive selection on s genes of sars-cov in different epidemic groups
recombination can influence the detection of positive selection  <cit> , and previous studies had proposed that recombination occurs in the origin of sars-cov  <cit> . in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group, human sequence gz03- <dig> split 03-pcsars-covs from 04-pcsars-covs, whereas other 04-husars-covs clustered with 04-pcsars-covs , suggesting that gz03- <dig> may be a recombinant between 03-pcsars-covs and 04-pcsars-covs. however, the bootscan analysis of gz03- <dig> using simplot software showed that majority of gz03- <dig> s gene had the percent of permuted trees less than  <dig> , indicating that they possess similar identity to other sequences, and suggesting that no recombination occurred in this strain  <cit> . in addition, viral recombination requires the co-infection of different virus strains  <cit> , and there was little chance for gz03- <dig> patients to be co-infected with 03-pcsars-cov and 04-pcsars-cov during  <dig> epidemic  <cit> , further supporting the view that no recombination occurred in s gene of gz03- <dig>  <cit> .

three selection models  showed that positive selection occurred in both 02– <dig> interspecies and 03-early-mid epidemic groups . for instance, m <dig> showed that  <dig> % of the sites in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group were under positive selection with ω values between  <dig> – <dig> , and  <dig> % of the sites in 03-early-mid epidemic group were under positive selection with ω =  <dig> . lrt statistic revealed that three selection models fitted the data better than three null models in both groups of 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic and 03-early-mid epidemic, which supports further the presence of amino acid sites under positive selection in s protein . in contrast, we were unable to identify any site under positive selection with any of the six models in the 03-late epidemic group. instead, the results for this group were consistent with purifying selection  .

comparison of positively selected sites on s genes in different epidemic groups
the positively selected sites in both groups of 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic and 03-early-mid epidemic were identified using codeml program. although three selection models: m2a, m <dig> and m <dig> detected same positively selected sites on s genes, only the results from m <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  four positively selected sites  in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group and four sites  in 03-early-mid epidemic group were identified at the level of posterior probability >  <dig> , respectively. in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> sites were detected under positive selection  in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic and 03-early-mid epidemic groups at the level of posterior probability >  <dig> , respectively. by rel method, completely identical  <dig> sites in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group and  <dig> sites in 03-early-mid epidemic group were identified under positive selection at significant level of bayes factor >  <dig> . when fel and slac methods were used, these sites were also identified under positive selection in despite of not reaching the significant level of p <  <dig> . no positively selected site was identified in 03-late epidemic group by three selection models  implemented in codeml program and three methods implemented in datamonkey package , indicating that this group was experiencing purifying selection.

in order to investigate the association of positively selected sites with the function of s protein, we compared their location between groups of 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic and 03-early-mid epidemic. the results show that apart from the site  <dig>  the two groups had completely different sites , suggesting for the first time that positively selected sites are variable in different epidemic groups. it was found that 72%  positively selected sites in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group were located in s <dig> domain, which is greater than 50%  of that located in s <dig> domain in 03-early-mid epidemic group  . moreover, 24% of positively selected sites in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group were concentrated in the region of receptor-binding domain , only 4% in heptad repeat 1-hr <dig> region , but 0% in hr <dig> region . contrarily, 25% of positively selected sites in 03-early-mid epidemic group were concentrated in hr1–hr <dig> region ,  <dig> % in hr <dig> region , but only  <dig> % in rbd region . these results suggest that positive selection tends to selectively influence certain functions of s protein, but not others in each epidemic group.

lineage fixation of positively selected sites on s genes for the adaptation of sars-cov to human host
four positively selected sites  identified in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group were fixed in 03-early-mid epidemic group . the 04-pcsars-covs diverged from 03-pcsars-covs after the split between 03-pcsars-covs and 03-husars-cov   <cit> . the comparison of amino acid sequences between 03-pcsars-cov and 03-husars-cov suggested that variants n479k and t743a play a dominant role in transition of viral host tropism from animals to humans . the comparison between 03-husars-cov and 03-pcsars-cov sequences discovered two additional variants, l609a and v765a, which may favor viral adaptation to palm civet. four sites  identified under positive selection in the 03-early-mid epidemic group were fixed in the 03-late epidemic group . the fixation of these amino acids suggests that they are likely to contribute to the adaptation process of s protein to human receptors.

discussion
the s protein of sars-cov is responsible for the receptor binding and membrane fusion  <cit> . it is also a major antigen to stimulate humoral immunity of its host  <cit> . the amino acid variation of s protein affects virus entry, tissue tropism and host range of sars-cov  <cit> . here, we confirmed that the s gene undergoes strong positive selection  <cit> , and identified twelve positively selected amino acid sites, including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> during the whole sars outbreak . among these sites, positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> appeared to be exposed on the surface of s protein  <cit> , suggesting that they are likely to play a key role in viral transmission and survival. in addition, it was worth pointing out that sars-cov is a rapidly evolving rna virus with a mutation rate of  <dig> – <dig>  × 10- <dig> nucleotide substitution per site per year  <cit> . the s gene sequences used in the present study were sampled during a year period, and some mutations might be accumulated in late-sampled sequences  <cit> . however, whether the accumulation of these mutations influences the detection of positive selection and the identification of positively selected sites remains unclear  <cit> . this requires further investigation to confirm.

adaptation of an animal virus to a new human host usually faces two crucial bottlenecks: the receptor adaptation of viral surface protein to its new host, followed by the adaptation of key enzymes  associated with viral replication to new cellular components that possibly support poorly productive infection   <cit> . the latter is not always the step that limits host expansion and most viruses can establish productive infection after their entry of host cells  <cit> . we found that two key replicases of sars-cov, rna-dependent rna polymerase  and helicase, were not under positive selection , which suggests that receptor adaptation of s protein to human host determines the animal-to-human transmission of sars-cov  <cit> . the receptor adaptation of an animal virus to a new human host usually requires two key steps: initial breakthrough of receptor barrier , followed by the molecular adaptation to human cellular receptors . the two steps together result in eventual establishment of stable infection necessary for efficient spread within human hosts.

in order to better reflect the course of viral trans-species transmission and subsequent adaptation to human hosts, the collection of sars isolates was reclassified into three epidemic groups: 02– <dig> interspecies, 03-early-mid, and 03-late epidemic groups in the present study. the 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group reflects the process of viral trans-species transmission, and 03-early-mid epidemic group represents the crucial phase of sars-covs to adapt to human host. the two groups correspond with the two key steps described above for a virus to be adapted by a new cellular receptor.

we found that s genes underwent strong positive selection in both groups of 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic and 03-early-mid epidemic, whereas no positive selection was observed in 03-late epidemic group . it suggests that s protein experiences a step-by-step adaptation process to human cellular receptors. on the other hand, the amino acid sites under positive selection in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group differed clearly from those in 03-early-mid epidemic group, suggesting for the first time the changes in positively selected sites in different epidemic groups. it was reported previously that two functional domains s <dig> and s <dig> of sars-cov s protein are responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion, respectively  <cit> . in domain s <dig>  rbd has been demonstrated to concentrate in a 193-amino acid fragment , which is adequate for binding to human ace <dig>  <cit> . in domain s <dig>  two highly conserved regions hp <dig>  and  <dig>  are crucial for membrane fusion  <cit> . importantly, a larger proportion of positively selected sites was located in rbd than in hr1–hr <dig> or hr <dig> regions in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group, and a greater percentage of these sites occurred in hr1–hr <dig> region than in rbd in 03-early-mid epidemic group  . these differences suggest that positive selection prefers influencing the receptor-binding function in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group, and then associates with the membrane fusion function in 03-early-mid epidemic group.

in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group, four positively selected sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> appeared to be fixed in 03-early-mid epidemic group. comparing the amino acid sequences of s genes from 03-husars-cov and 03-pcsars-cov, we discovered that two positively selected amino acid substitutions  are likely to play a role in viral receptor switch. previous in vitro experiments proved that the residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are important determinants for sars-cov cell tropism and animal-to-human transmission  <cit> . residue 479n  increases the affinity of s protein to human receptor by specifically interacting with the residue 34h  of ace <dig>  which is present in human but not in palm civet ace <dig>  <cit> . recently, zheng et al. reported that active peptide  of s protein which contains residue 743t  effectively inhibited the entry of husars-cov into human cells  <cit> . the corresponding peptide with residue 743a  from 03-pcsars-cov appeared less potent against husars-cov  <cit> . these observations suggested that residue  <dig> may influence viral receptor tropism via a way different from ace <dig> binding  <cit> . besides ace <dig>  human dc-sign and dc-signl were also shown to be able to enhance sars-cov infection by a non-receptor mechanism  <cit> . however, the influence of residue  <dig> on potential interaction between s protein and dc-sign or dc-signl remains unknown. on the other hand, of the four positively selected sites, two variants l609a and v765a, were observed in most 04-pcsars-covs, but not in 03-pcsars-covs, suggesting that they may contribute to viral adaptive evolution from 03-pcsars-cov to 04-pcsars-cov.

the sequence comparison between groups of 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic and 03-early-mid epidemic allowed us to find additional three special substitutions , which lead to three replacement  . of particular importance was that all three sites were monomorphic for serine in the 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group, and utterly monomorphic for phenylalanine at site  <dig>  threonine at  <dig> and leucine at  <dig> in the 03-human epidemic group  . previous studies revealed that the replacement t487s benefits the receptor switch of sars-covs from palm civets to human  <cit> . however, both codeml program and datamonkey package did not detect positive selection on this site. therefore, the best explanation should be that the selective sweep also drives the adaptive evolution of s gene from animals to humans, despite of little experimental evidence supporting the advantageous mutations in sites  <dig> and  <dig> 

after breaking through the interspecies receptor barrier, sars-cov spread quickly among human hosts and formed the 03-early-mid epidemic group, a very important period for viral adaptation to human host. during this stage, four major sites  of s protein were identified under positive selection. among them, sites  <dig> and  <dig> were located in the s <dig> domain of s protein, suggesting that they should associate with membrane fusion, less probability with receptor recognition  <cit> . the s <dig> domain contains two highly conserved heptad repeats hp <dig> and hp <dig>  both of them form a six-helix bundle structure via hydrophobic interaction, facilitating membrane fusion  <cit> . at site  <dig> of hr <dig> region, the positively charged residue lysine replaced the negatively charged residue glutamic acid in 03-early-mid epidemic group, suggesting that residue lysine may be advantageous for s protein adaptation to human cellular receptors. the antiviral research showed that active peptide  with residue1163e derived from animal virus possesses less inhibitory activity against human sars-covs than its human virus counterpart of 1163k  <cit> , which supports the view that the substitution k1163e contributes to adaptation of sars-cov to human cellular receptors. on the other hand, a strong neutralizing epitope containing residues 1055– <dig> also implicated the possible role of residue  <dig> in induction of neutralizing antibodies despite of little evidence available for its action on antibody escape  <cit> . as for residue  <dig>  uncharged amino acid tyrosine was fixed in the 03-late epidemic group by replacing the negatively charged residue aspartic acid. the importance of residue  <dig> cannot be assessed until further site-directed mutagenesis research is conducted. with respect to residues  <dig> and  <dig>  they are unlikely to participate in the viral adaptation process due to their location outside rbd and s <dig> domain regions.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> sites  in s protein were detected under positive selective pressure. among them,  <dig> sites are exposed on the surface of s protein. it was also found that the s protein of sars-cov experiences variable positive selective pressures before reaching stabilization, and the positively selected sites are changeable in different epidemic groups. more importantly, a larger proportion of positively selected sites identified in 02– <dig> interspecies epidemic group was located in rbd region of s protein, suggesting that receptor binding function is predominant at this stage. on the other hand, more positively selected sites were located in hr1–hr <dig> region in 03-early-mid epidemic group, suggesting that the membrane fusion function becomes a major task in association with positive selection at this period. the variation of positive selective pressures and positively selected sites of s protein provide a valuable evidence for understanding the molecular adaptation of s protein from animals to humans.
