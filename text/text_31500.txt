BACKGROUND
the methionine sulfoxide reductases enzymes  family contains proteins that can reduce both free and protein-linked oxidized methionine residues. to date, the two msr enzymes that reduce the epimeric forms of methionine sulfoxide met in proteins are referred to as msra and msrb: they catalyze the reduction of methionine-s-sulfoxide  and methionine-r-sulfoxide , respectively  <cit> . several authors reported that msra and msrb require reduced thioredoxin as the natural reducing system, although dtt can be used in vitro  <cit> . as reported by sagher et al., thioredoxin is a poor reducing agent for both hmsrb <dig> and hmsrb <dig>  <cit> . however, in the presence of selenocystamine, the thioredoxin reducing system is very effective with msrb enzymes. a cysteine residue in the n-terminal region of the msrb <dig> is important for the thioredoxin-recycling process of the msrb <dig>  <cit> . recently, a thionein derived from metallothionein and identified in bovine liver was shown to support msr activity in absence of either thioredoxin or dtt .

oxidation of methionines may affect protein function and was implicated in several processes, such as oxidative stress, accelerated aging, and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . msra has been studied in detail for several years and is well characterized structurally and functionally. the importance of this enzyme was highlighted by several studies. escherichia coli msra mutant seemed to be more sensitive to oxidative damage than the parent strain  <cit> . abolishing the msra gene in yeast caused enhanced accumulation of methionine oxidation, while shortening their survival rate in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . msra-knockout mice had a shorter life span, were more sensitive to hyperbaric oxygen, and had a neurological defect that resulted in abnormal walking  <cit> . overexpression of msra nearly doubled the life span in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . moreover, msra activity, as well as gene and protein expression, decreased as a function of age  <cit> .

human genome contains one single msra gene and three separate genes named msrb <dig>  msrb <dig>  and msrb3: the latter codifying for msrb3a and msrb3b. these proteins have a specific sub-cellular localization: msrb <dig> is located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, msrb <dig> and msrb3b in mitochondria and msrb3a in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> .

msrb <dig> is a selenoprotein also known as selenoprotein r or selenoprotein x. selenocysteine  plays a crucial role in msrb <dig> enzyme activity  <cit> . msrb <dig> possessed a 100-fold higher activity than its cysteine mutant form. moreover, substitution of catalytic cysteine with sec resulted in more than 100-fold increased activities in the non-selenoprotein msrb <dig> and msrb <dig> <cit> . among the msrb proteins, msrb <dig> possessed the highest specific activity and was considered, together with msra, the enzyme that contributed significantly to the reduction of methionine sulfoxides in cells  <cit> .

the overproduction of reactive oxygen species  can result in various deleterious effects. aerobic organisms have developed a number of cellular defences as a protection against these harmful ros  <cit> . the classical cellular defence against ros includes enzymes such as catalase , superoxide dismutases , and glutathione peroxidase . in recent years, the msr system, which can repair oxidative damage to proteins, has been added to this important "antioxidant triad". the msr system is based on enzymes that can reduce both free and protein-linked oxidized methionine residues; thus this system is now considered an important defence mechanism against oxidative damage  <cit> .

despite the importance of msr enzymes in the defence system against oxidative damage, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of their genes. moskovitz et al. reported that mrna and protein levels of msrb <dig> were associated with msra expression, as well as to selenium supply  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which msra might have a role in msrb <dig> regulation has not been elucidated.

we recently reported the identification and analysis of the promoter region of the human msra gene  <cit> . the msra expression appeared to be different in several human cancer cell lines and msra gene promoter analysis showed a cell-specific transcriptional regulation of this gene  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the msrb <dig> gene in human breast cancer cells. we found different msrb <dig> expression levels in cancer cell lines derived from the same tissue. we determined the transcription start site  and isolated the 5'-flanking region of the msrb <dig> gene. we showed that multiple sp <dig> binding sites were required for promoter activity and the observed difference in msrb <dig> gene expression could be explained as a consequence of epigenetic modifications.

RESULTS
msrb <dig> transcript and protein are differentially expressed in breast cancer cell lines
in order to evaluate the relative levels of msrb <dig> transcript in both mda-mb <dig> and mcf <dig> cells, rt-pcr was conducted using  <dig> μg of total rna samples obtained from these cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  a lower level of msrb <dig> transcript was detected in rt-pcr products obtained using total rna extracted from mda-mb <dig> cells compared to those obtained from mcf <dig> cells. levels of msrb <dig> protein detected by western blot analysis were consistent with the msrb <dig> transcript data . in fact, a lower level of msrb <dig> protein was detected in crude extracts obtained from mda-mb <dig> cells versus mcf <dig> cells, suggesting a different msrb <dig> transcriptional regulation in these human breast cancer cell lines.

identification of transcription start site
to identify the transcription start site  of the msrb <dig> gene, we performed 5' race analysis using total rna isolated from mcf <dig> cells. the analysis was performed using two reverse oligonucleotides derived from the 5'-utr region  and two adapter primers provided with the kit for the primary and nested pcr. a weak smear on agarose gel was observed in the first pcr with outer primer generacer™ 5' primer and reverse primer race- <dig>  using the total rna from mcf <dig> cells. the primary pcr products were used as templates for nested pcr using generacer™ 5' nested primer and race- <dig> nested primer. agarose gel electrophoresis resolved the 5'-race-nested reaction product into a single dna fragment  which was then cloned. the sequencing of six different randomly-selected clones showed the same sequence . the tss was identified by sequence analysis and mapped  <dig> bp upstream of the first atg translation codon.

msrb <dig> promoter activity in transient transfection of different cell types
on the basis of the tss position, a  <dig> bp fragment of human genomic dna  was obtained by pcr. the sequence of the 5'-flanking region of the msrb <dig> gene was analysed using tfsearch software for the presence of transcription binding sites. the msrb <dig> 5'-flanking region revealed no canonical tata and/or caat boxes, but did contain several putative binding sites for sp <dig> and showed a high content of cpg islands. to map promoter activity of the 5'-flanking region of the msrb <dig> gene, various 5' progressive deletions excluding each sp <dig> binding site starting from - <dig> were prepared. the  <dig> bp dna fragment was subcloned, sequenced and used as template to make pcr products of lengths between -1276/+ <dig>  and -38/+ <dig> . these dna-fragments were subcloned into the promoterless pgl <dig> basic reporter plasmid and the resulting p- <dig>  p- <dig>  p- <dig>  p- <dig>  and p- <dig> constructs were analysed by sequencing to ensure fidelity of amplification. the human mcf <dig> and mda-mb <dig> cells were chosen as breast cancer cell models for the analysis of the msrb <dig> promoter activity. figure  <dig> shows the relative luciferase activities of reporter constructs transfected in these cells. maximal promoter activity was detected, using the p- <dig> construct,  <dig> bp  from the tss. constructs longer than  <dig> bp had reduced activity suggesting the presence of possible cis-elements recognized by transcription factors. however, computational analysis  of the msrb <dig> promoter did not show the presence of distinct upstream inhibitory elements. we detected very low levels of msrb <dig> mrna in mda-mb <dig> cells and in accordance a very low promoter activity detected in these cells .

site-directed mutagenesis of the msrb <dig> promoter
the contribution of sp <dig> transcription factor in msrb <dig> regulation was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis of their binding sites within the msrb <dig> promoter-reporter gene constructs . on the basis of the transient transfection experiments reported above, we focused our attention on the sp <dig> sites named sp1e and sp1c . reporter constructs containing mutated sequence for sp1e site, p- <dig> sp1emut, as well as p- <dig> clone wild-type, were transfected into mcf <dig> cells. mutating sp1e site brought the promoter activity down to basal level, suggesting that this site is important for the promoter activity detected using p- <dig> construct . our experiments also revealed that both the sp <dig> sites regulated the msrb <dig> transcription. the mutation of either sp1e or sp1c sites produced a decrease in promoter activity . moreover, transfection experiments using p- <dig> sp1c/emut construct, containing mutations of both sp <dig> binding sites, produced a dramatic decrease in the maximal promoter activity .

chromatin immunoprecipitation locates sp <dig> to the msrb <dig> promoter in vivo
chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays were performed in mcf <dig> and mda-mb <dig> cells to further elucidate the mechanisms of msrb <dig> promoter regulation. a promoter msrb1-specific pcr was performed on sheared chromatin, which was immunoprecipitated with an sp1-specific antibody. as shown in figure  <dig>  a specific pcr product was obtained using primers encompassing msrb <dig> promoter region - <dig> to + <dig>  it is interesting to note that this region contained three sp <dig> binding sites . the msrb <dig> promoter pcr fragment was obtained from both breast cancer cell lines. these results indicated a direct in vivo interaction of sp <dig> with the msrb <dig> promoter in both mcf <dig> and mda-mb <dig> cells. similar sp <dig> levels were detected by western blot analysis in both cell lines .

msra does not seem to be involved in msrb <dig> expression in breast cancer cells
since msra could have a role in msrb <dig> transcription  <cit> , we compared both the msra mrna and protein levels in high-expressing msrb <dig> mcf <dig> cells and low-expressing mda-mb <dig> cells. as reported in figure  <dig>  comparable levels of msra transcript were detected in both the breast cancer cells tested. in addition, similar levels of msra protein were observed. these results suggested that msrb <dig> expression was not influenced by the msra expression levels.

effects of dna demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibition on msrb <dig> expression
in order to evaluate epigenetic modifications of the msrb <dig> promoter as a possible mechanism of msrb <dig> silencing, mda-mb <dig> cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine . this compound generally showed reduced levels of dna methylation and increased expression of genes silenced by dna methylation  <cit> . the treatment of mda-mb <dig> cell line lead to an increase in msrb <dig> mrna from basal levels as detected by rt-pcr . interestingly, treatment with 5-aza-dc of mcf <dig> cells did not have significant effects on the msrb <dig> expression . the effect of 5-aza-dc on msrb <dig> protein levels was then determined. an induction of msrb <dig> protein by 5-aza-dc was detected in low-expressing msrb <dig> mda-mb <dig> cells . several studies suggested a synergistic effect of demethylation and histone deacetylase inhibition in re-expression of genes silenced by de novo methylation  <cit> . mda-mb <dig> cells were treated with both 5-aza-dc and trichostatin a , the last compound increased the levels of histone acetylation and expression of at least some target genes  <cit> . in our experimental conditions, tsa failed to reactivate msrb <dig> in mda-mb <dig> cells and did not potentiate the effect of 5-aza-dc . these findings suggested that dna methylation of the msrb <dig> promoter could be a mechanism responsible for the msrb <dig> gene silencing observed in mda-mb  <dig> cells. sequencing analysis of bisulphite-modified dna confirmed the increase of msrb <dig> promoter methylation in mda-mb <dig> compared to mcf- <dig> cells, msrb <dig> gene promoter was indeed hypermethylated at the cg dinucleotide within the consensus sp1-e binding site .

discussion
in the recent years, the interest in msr system has focused on studies demonstrating the importance of this enzymatic system on the defence mechanism against oxidative damage. in particular, recent studies have reported the role of the msr system in protecting lens and retinal cells against oxidative damage  <cit> . the existence of an association between increased levels of reactive oxygen species  and disturbed activities of enzymatic antioxidants in tumour cells  <cit>  is well known; thus we began to study the msr system in cancer cells.

only a few reports were available on the transcriptional regulation of msra/b genes. recently, we reported that human msra gene expression appeared to be different in several human cancer cell lines and gene promoter analysis showed a cell-specific msra transcriptional regulation  <cit> . in the present study, we reported evidence indicating a differential msrb <dig> expression in two human cancer cell lines derived from the same tissue and we elucidated the mechanisms responsible for the msrb <dig> gene expression. first we cloned the human msrb <dig> 5'-flanking promoter region and we provided evidence that this promoter fragment drives expression of luciferase-reporter constructs. the lack of tata or caat boxes and a high content of cpg islands in the msrb <dig> promoter are typical features of house-keeping genes. interestingly, we found five sp <dig> binding sites in the msrb <dig> promoter and sp <dig> was shown to be important for the transcription of genes with promoters that do not contain tata boxes  <cit> . indeed, we demonstrated the importance of sp <dig> sites for msrb <dig> promoter activity by site-directed mutagenesis. three sp <dig> binding sites located in the  <dig> base pair dna fragment from the tss showed the highest promoter activity. the progressive rise in the promoter activity seems to be directly correlated with the number of recognition sites for sp <dig>  suggesting its functional importance in msrb <dig> gene expression. the longest fragment contains five sp <dig> boxes but did not retain the highest activity suggesting the presence of possible cis-elements recognized by negative modulators.

in the present study, we showed evidence indicating a differential pattern of msrb <dig> expression in breast cancer cell lines. because of ubiquitous expression of sp <dig>  these sites, while involved in promoter activity, were not sufficient to explain the differences in endogenous content of the msrb <dig> gene expression. moreover, similar levels of sp <dig> were detected in these cells by western blot experiments.

recently, it was reported that msra might have a role in msrb <dig> transcription. in fact, a decrease of msrb <dig> in the msra knockout mouse was observed  <cit> . however, we found comparable msra transcript and protein levels in both mda-mb <dig> and mcf <dig> cells, suggesting that msrb <dig> expression was regulated in a different way in our experimental system.

overall, these findings suggested additional transcriptional mechanisms implicated in the msrb <dig> silencing in mda-mb <dig> cells.

changes in dna methylation patterns were identified in cancer and resulted in the silencing of important tumour suppressor genes involved in differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, dna repair and metastasis  <cit> . moreover, several reports indicated that gene silencing was the consequence of dna hypermethylation  <cit> . recently, it was reported that several key genes are silenced in breast cancer and these events seemed to be linked to epigenetic modifications  <cit> .

consistent with an important role of dna methylation in msrb <dig> silencing, incubation of mda-mb <dig> cells with 5-aza-dc resulted in clearly detectable levels of both msrb <dig> mrna and protein. on the other hand, treatment of mda-mb <dig> cells with tsa did not induce msrb <dig> expression and there was no synergistic effect of tsa and 5-aza-dc on msrb <dig> expression. these findings suggested that transcriptional repression by dna methylation was unlikely to depend upon a tsa-sensitive histone deacetylase. these observations are consistent with the recent reports studying the regulation of the hypermethylated genes rfc, hprt and others. in these studies, the treatment of 5-aza-dc induced the expression of these hypermethylated genes, whereas tsa treatment did not induce similar changes  <cit> .

previous studies reported that dna methylation decreased sp <dig> binding affinity to the respective promoter region  <cit> . in contrast, we show in this report, using chip experiments, that sp <dig> binds the msrb <dig> promoter region in both high-expressing mcf <dig> and low-expressing mda-mb <dig> breast cancer cells. these findings suggest that sp <dig> binding affinity to the msrb <dig> promoter is not inhibited by dna methylation. similar data have been recently reported for the lhr promoter  <cit>  and for the cldn <dig> promoter  <cit> .

a proposed mechanism to explain transcriptional inactivation from promoter methylation is based on the finding that methyl-cpg-binding proteins bind methylated dna  <cit>  and these proteins can then recruit a variety of transcriptional repressors  <cit> . whether these transcriptional repressors are responsible to affect the msrb <dig> expression in mda-mb <dig> cells is still uncertain.

the epigenetic silencing of genes whose proteins function to attenuate oxidative free radicals, e. g., gstp <dig>  have been described in prostate cancer  <cit> . the epigenetic mediated loss of expression of antioxidant enzymes would create conditions favourable to both dna base damage and accelerated proliferation. obviously, more research is needed to postulate a possible msrb <dig> involvement in metastatic process.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we showed that:  sp <dig> is essential for the human msrb <dig> promoter activity;  despite having all of the usual characteristics of a ubiquitously expressed "housekeeping" gene, msrb <dig> is regulated differently among breast carcinoma cells; and  treatment with dna methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-dc induced msrb <dig> gene expression in the highly metastatic mda-mb <dig> cells. on the basis of these findings, we conclude that epigenetic changes are involved in msrb <dig> silencing.
