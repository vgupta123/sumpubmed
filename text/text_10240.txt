BACKGROUND
increasing evidence implicates stress as an important factor in the vulnerability to depressive and other mental illnesses  <cit> . consequently, understanding the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that transduce stress signals may inform our insight into the factors that lead to depression, as well as provide potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention. although current therapies for anxiety and depression usually focus on modulating serotonergic and/or noradrenergic activity in the brain  <cit> , recent data suggest that neurotrophins such as bdnf may ameliorate depression  <cit> . neurotrophins activate mapk signaling, and increased signaling via at least one of the mapks, erk, has been shown to regulate plasticity in the brain by modulating gene expression. thus, activation of the erk pathway via both a camp/pka-dependent mechanism leading to activation of creb, and a non-cyclase-linked pathway, leading to activation of creb and/or the serum response element  binding protein elk- <dig>  have been shown to occur in the hippocampus during acquisition of learning, memory consolidation and long-term potentiation   <cit> . it is therefore not unreasonable to speculate that these signal transduction pathways may also be involved in the neuronal plasticity that is presumed to underlie aberrant brain function  <cit> .

the term mapk is used to denote a family of signal transduction mediators, extensively distributed throughout the central nervous system  <cit> , that regulate a diverse array of cellular functions  <cit> . the most common mapks are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases erk <dig> and  <dig> , which primarily regulate cellular growth and differentiation, and the p38mapk and c-jun-n-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases , which mainly function as mediators of cellular stresses such as inflammation and apoptosis. physiologically stressful stimuli, including seizure induction  <cit> , ischemic insult  <cit> , visceral pain  <cit>  and electroconvulsive shock   <cit>  have also been shown to rapidly activate mapks in various brain regions.

subjecting rats or mice to acute stressors such as restraint or forced swim results in activation of c-fos gene and/or fos protein expression in many brain regions)  <cit> . cre and sre are dna sequences found in the promoter regions of many immediate early genes  such as c-fos and zif <dig>  p-creb and p-elk- <dig>  by binding to these elements, enhance the transcription of the iegs and regulate gene expression  <cit> . recently it was shown that swim stress increased p-creb expression in several brain regions  <cit> . thus, given that, on one hand, stress activated creb and increased c-fos expression, and on the other, that certain stressful stimuli  activated erk, it was reasonable to predict that acute physiological stressors would activate the erk  mapk pathway. the brain regions most likely to show such an effect would be those implicated in the response to stress, including the hippocampus  <cit> , prefrontal  <cit>  and other cortical areas  <cit> , and the amygdala  <cit> . in a previous study we tested this hypothesis and found indeed that acute restraint stress increased p-erk concentrations in several stress-relevant brain areas; however, neither jnk nor p38mapk phosphorylation were altered by restraint stress  <cit> . the present study followed up that investigation by examining the effects of a different common stressor, forced swim stress, extended the number of brain areas examined, and also evaluated changes in the phosphorylation state of the respective upstream mapkk activators mek1/ <dig>  mkk <dig>  and mkk3/ <dig>  while these studies were in progress, others reported that swim stress activated the mkk4/jnk pathway in mice  <cit> .

RESULTS
swim stress elicits large increases in phosphorylation of mek1/ <dig> in all brain regions
an acute  <dig> min session of forced swimming produced obvious large increases in the phosphorylation of the mapkk mek1/ <dig> in the hippocampus, neocortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum . surprisingly, phosphorylation of the substrate of activated mek1/ <dig>  erk1/ <dig>  was increased to a much smaller extent, and in some brain regions  not at all . swim stress significantly increased p-mek1/ <dig> levels from  <dig> -fold  to more than 100-fold  in the various brain areas . p-erk <dig> levels, on the other hand, were modestly elevated only in neocortex , prefrontal cortex  and striatum  . because p-erk <dig> signals were generally much weaker, and in short exposure blots nearly undetectable, only p-erk <dig> bands were quantitated. however, qualitative changes in p-erk <dig> concentrations paralleled those in p-erk <dig> ; this conclusion was borne out in over-exposed blots, which, however, were difficult to quantitate for p-erk <dig> because of overlap with the large adjacent p-erk <dig> signal.

swim stress increases phosphorylation of mkk <dig> in all brain regions
analogous to its effects on p-mek1/ <dig>  but much more dramatically, forced swimming enhanced the levels of p-mkk <dig>  the immediate upstream activator of jnk, in all brain areas tested . increases ranged from  <dig> -fold  to ~300-fold  . it should be noted that all increases greater than about 10–15-fold are approximate, since the relationship between optical density and the film exposure-response is no longer linear beyond this range, as determined previously  <cit> . thus, increases greater than 10–15-fold are likely underestimates of the actual changes. nevertheless, it seemed reasonable to utilize the calculated numerical estimates for statistical purposes. in contrast, and again analogous to the findings in the mek/erk pathway, much smaller changes were observed in p-jnk <dig>  and p-jnk2/ <dig>  levels . both p-jnk <dig> and p-jnk2/ <dig> were significantly elevated in all brain areas, with the single exception of a non-significant increase in p-jnk <dig> in the amygdala . significant swim stress-induced increases for these kinases ranged from  <dig> – <dig> -fold across brain regions .

effects of swim stress on activation of the p38mapk pathway and phosphorylation of creb
in contrast to its effects on the erk and jnk pathways, swim stress exhibited no effect on the phosphorylation of p38mapk in any brain region, with the exception of a small but significant increase  in the hippocampus . as shown above, the major impact of swim stress was to activate the corresponding upstream mapkks of erk and jnk, i.e., to increase p-mek1/ <dig> and p-mkk <dig>  respectively. since the major activators of p38mapk are the closely related, dual specificity kinases phosphorylated mkk <dig> and mkk <dig>  <cit> , we attempted to determine if swim stress increased the phosphorylation of this upstream kinase. fig.  <dig> shows that the p-mkk3/ <dig> antibody  detected at least two swim stress-induced bands in the hippocampus, at ~ <dig> and  <dig> kd. however, the expected molecular weight is ~ <dig> kd; indeed, cell extracts of uv-treated nih/3t <dig> and anisomycin-treated c <dig> glioma cells both exhibited induced bands at ~ <dig> kd . it seems likely, therefore, that basal levels of brain p-mkk3/ <dig> are very low , and, unlike p-mek1/ <dig> and p-mkk <dig>  are not induced by swim stress. interestingly, use of a different p-mkk3/ <dig> antibody  yielded very similar results, specifically, swim stress induced a large increase in an ~ <dig> kd band . other brain regions examined with the p-mkk3/ <dig> antibody yielded the same pattern; no band at ~ <dig> kd was evident . we considered the possibility that the swim-induced protein at ~ <dig> kd might be p-mkk <dig>  since that is the approximate molecular weight of this kinase. moreover, mkk <dig>  like mkk <dig>  phosphorylates jnk  <cit> . since the phosphopeptides used to raise the p-mkk <dig>  p-mkk <dig> and p-mkk3/ <dig> antibodies share a substantial degree of homology in their amino acid sequences, it was possible that the p-mkk3/ <dig> antibody was detecting a swim-induced increase in p-mkk <dig>  however, at a concentration of  <dig> ng/ml, neither the p-mkk <dig> nor the p-mkk <dig> phosphopeptides affected the protein band pattern observed using the p-mkk3/ <dig> antibody, whereas the p-mkk3/ <dig> phosphopeptide completely abolished all signals . this appears to rule out the possibility that the  <dig> kd band is p-mkk <dig>  the identities of the swim stress-induced bands observed with the p-mkk3/ <dig> antibodies remain unknown.

in partial agreement with a previous report  <cit> , swim stress induced significant increases in creb phosphorylation in the hippocampus and amygdala ; however, we were unable to replicate reported p-creb increases in neocortex and prefrontal cortex . the reasons for this discrepancy are not apparent; however, while the same rat strain  and swim protocol  were used, other differences  may account for the difference in results. note, moreover, that the regional pattern of changes in p-creb  and p-erk  differed markedly. whether this is due to a simple difference in time course or, more substantively, in activation mechanism, awaits further investigation.

time course of swim stress-induced mapk kinase phosphorylation: onset and offset
the effect of varying the duration of swim on the phosphorylation of mek1/ <dig> and mkk <dig> was examined in neocortex and hippocampus. the effect on both kinases gradually reached a maximum at  <dig> min , except for the increase in p-mek1/ <dig> in neocortex, which peaked at  <dig> min . the levels of p-mek1/ <dig> and p-mkk <dig> in both neocortex and hippocampus were maximal immediately after termination of swim stress , declined gradually, and all except p-mkk <dig> in neocortex returned to basal levels by  <dig> min. the levels of the corresponding phosphorylated substrates of the mapk kinases, p-erk <dig> and p-jnk  followed a very similar pattern of decline post-swim stress , and all except neocortical p-jnk were at control levels by  <dig> min. note that hippocampal p-erk <dig> was unchanged at all times after swim stress, consistent with the results shown above in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
the results presented establish unambiguously that forced swim stress elicits a rapid and profound but relatively transient increase in the phosphorylation  of the mek-erk and mkk4-jnk signaling pathways in, at the least, the five brain regions examined. these effects displayed specificity in that the mkk3/6-p38mapk pathway was essentially unchanged. . our results may be compared to a very recent study on the effects of forced swim in mice, reported by liu et al.  <cit>  while the present study was nearing completion. both studies are in agreement that swim stress elicits a very large increase in p-mkk <dig> levels throughout the brain, and that p-jnk levels are correspondingly elevated in the same brain regions. in addition, both studies agree that p-p38mapk levels are unaffected. however, liu et al.  <cit>  did not determine the effects of swim stress on p-mek1/ <dig> levels . moreover, whereas liu et al.  <cit>  did not find any significant change in p-erk levels, our studies indicated region-specific alterations in this kinase: increases in cortical areas  and striatum, but not in the hippocampus or amygdala . the reasons for the dissimilar results on p-erk are not apparent, but it should be noted that the studies utilized different species , which may have contributed to the observed differences. also, it is possible but unlikely that stress duration  accounts for the difference in results.

one of the most interesting aspects of the present results was the apparent discrepancy between the magnitude of the changes in the mapkks  and the corresponding mapks . it is obvious from figs.  <dig> and  <dig> that whereas swim stress elevated p-mek1/ <dig> and p-mkk <dig> levels dramatically, the effects on their substrates, p-erk <dig> and p-jnk, respectively, were much more modest. . one possible explanation is a temporal difference in the phosphorylation of the upstream mapkks and their downstream mapk substrates. a gradual increase in p-erk <dig> and p-jnk phosphorylation, subsequent to activation of mek1/ <dig> and mkk <dig>  may have been obscured by the fact that animals were sacrificed immediately after termination of the swim. however, this is clearly not the case, as the time-course of the swim-induced increases in phosphorylation of the mapkks and mapks were very similar in both the hippocampus and neocortex . another explanation centers on potential differences in phosphorylation stoichiometry, i.e., levels of basal phosphorylation among the various phosphoproteins may vary greatly. thus, one may posit that kinases  whose basal state of phosphorylation is very low may be subject to large increases, whereas those whose basal state is comparatively larger  demonstrate much smaller increases. for example, activation of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine biosynthesis, is related to phosphorylation of the protein on at least three different serine sites  <cit> . the basal phosphorylation stoichiometry of these sites varies not only among the sites but also between brain regions  <cit> . interestingly, haloperidol-induced phosphorylation of the sites, as visualized on immunoblots using phosphosite-specific antibodies, appears to be negatively related to the basal phosphorylation state  <cit> . to our knowledge, the basal phosphorylation stoichiometry of the various rat brain kinases examined in the present study are not known. however, a recent technique has been described  <cit>  that may lend itself to estimating basal and swim stress-induced phosphorylation stoichiometry in various brain regions.

nevertheless, differences in phosphorylation stoichiometry cannot explain why, in some brain regions , there were no discernable increases in p-erk after swim stress, despite large increases in p-mek1/ <dig>  activated mapkks, unlike their upstream activators or downstream targets, are known to exhibit narrow substrate specificity  <cit> . indeed, erk1/ <dig> activity is believed to be exclusively regulated by mek1/ <dig>  <cit> . thus, a large increase in mek1/ <dig> phosphorylation/activation would be expected to translate into substantial phosphorylation/activation of erk. however, the activity of p-mek1/ <dig> is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism involving activation of protein phosphatase that rapidly dephosphorylate p-erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . a large number of potential phosphatases have been implicated in the regulation of erk phosphorylation  <cit> ; consequently, identifying a specific phosphatase that may be responsible for such an effect was beyond the scope of the present study. recently, a detailed kinetic analysis of eleven different protein phosphatases implicated three specific phosphatases as the most likely mediators of erk <dig> dephosphorylation, including mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase  <dig>  and protein phosphatase 2a   <cit> . it might be instructive therefore in a future study to assess the activity of these protein phosphatases in tissue lysates. a final alternative hypothesis is that swim stress activates a mechanism that serves to uncouple mek1/ <dig> phosphorylation  from activation of erk. that such uncoupling is possible has been reported in mammalian cells undergoing mitosis  <cit> , but the mechanism deduced in that instance is highly unlikely to apply in the present case; nevertheless, the possibility is worthy of consideration.

in a previous communication we reported that  <dig> min of restraint stress elicited modest  increases in p-erk levels in hippocampus and prefrontal and cingulate cortex  <cit> . as for swim stress, p-p38mapk was not altered. in contrast to the effects of swim stress, p-jnk levels were not altered by restraint. that study did not assess changes in any of the mapkks, limiting further comparisons. however, in a preliminary experiment we found that restraint stress increased p-mkk <dig> levels in both the hippocampus and striatum, but the effects were more modest than after swim stress . interestingly, liu et al.  <cit>  reported that restraint, like swim, elevated both p-mkk <dig> and p-jnk levels in mice, but the effects in the former stress model were smaller than in the latter. however, p-erk and p-p38mapk levels were unchanged in both restrained and swim stressed mice. it thus appears that both the rodent species and type of stress may be important determinants of the specific regional changes occurring in the various kinases. additional studies will be required to sort out the influence of a variety of factors on the phosphorylation pattern of the mapk signaling pathways in the brain regions of different animal species. in particular, restraint and swim differences in ambient temperature and physical activity may impact the results. finally, because these two forms of stress yield different patterns of effects on mapks in brain, we can ask which mapks  are the more relevant to stress effects, i.e., which stress model is more appropriate. answering this question will require correlating the behavioral and mapk sequelae of different stress treatments .

the nature of the extracellular signaling molecule that are recruited upon subjecting animals to stress are unknown. the pathways leading from stimulation of a particular receptor on the cell surface to activation of mapk signaling cascades are diverse and complex  <cit> . for example, erk <dig> and erk <dig> can be activated by a variety of extracellular signaling molecules, including growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters  <cit> . calcium influx in particular has gained currency as potentially of prime importance  <cit> . as mentioned earlier, stress is well known to activate c-fos gene expression)  <cit> , and such activation in neurons can occur, at least in part, because of an increase in erk activity via nmda glutamate receptor-stimulated calcium influx  <cit> . stress also activates creb phosphorylation  <cit> , which may be mediated at least in part by nmda receptor activation  <cit> . thus, it is attractive to speculate that nmda receptor activation  may be the initial trigger leading to activation of the erk pathway . nmda receptors themselves are subject to regulation by phosphorylation on their nr <dig>  nr2a and nr2b subunits  <cit> . interestingly, dopamine d <dig> receptor-mediated creb phosphorylation appears to involve nmda nr <dig> subunit phosphorylation  <cit> . in preliminary experiments we have found that swim stress increased p-nr <dig> levels on immunoblots of the hippocampus, neocortex and striatum , suggesting that stress-induced activation of the mek-erk pathway may involve nmda receptor-mediated calcium influx. further studies will be directed toward explicating the differential effects of swim stress on the degree of phosphorylation of the mapkks vs. the mapks, assessing nmda receptor involvement, and determining whether  mapkk pathways participate in some behavioral sequelae of repeated swim stress treatment .

CONCLUSIONS
acute swim stress initiated a rapid increase in phosphorylation of the mapkks mek1/ <dig> and mkk <dig> in hippocampus, neocortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum. concomitantly, their corresponding substrates erk and jnk were also phosphorylated, but not always in register with the changes in the mapkks. moreover, the magnitude of the increase in phosphorylation of mek1/ <dig> and mkk <dig> was much greater than for their cognate substrates. while it is clear that stressors such as forced swim and restraint activate these signaling pathways, much work will be required to define the mechanism responsible for these effects, and to relate potential alterations in the activity of these molecules to stress-related influences on the development of anxiety and depressive disorders.
