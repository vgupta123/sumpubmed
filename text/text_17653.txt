BACKGROUND
serine/threonine kinase  <dig>  was first discovered in the course of comparative genome analyses of human chromosome 11p <dig>  and its orthologous region in the mouse . this region is highly syntenic  and known to be associated with several diseases including different types of cancer . stk <dig> is predominantly expressed in testis, certain brain regions and embryonic organs such as brain, heart and spinal cord in human and mouse, implying that it might be involved in spermatogenesis and organ ontogenesis  <cit> . its protein product has been classified as a member of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase group  <cit> . stk <dig> has been shown to co-localize with the intermediate filament protein vimentin in tanycytes of mouse, rat and hamster  <cit>  and kinase assays demonstrated that stk <dig> is able to phosphorylate vimentin in vitro  <cit> . stk <dig> and vimentin are associated in vivo and this interaction is not mediated by any additional protein as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-sedimentation assays  <cit> . thus, stk <dig> might be involved in the dynamics of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylating vimentin  <cit> . furthermore, stk <dig> has attracted attention since it has been identified as an essential component for the survival of kras-dependent cancer cells by high-throughput rna interference  screens . it has also been associated with pancreatic cancer  <cit> . however, the role of stk <dig> in kras-dependent cancer cells remains disputed because other research groups were not able to find a correlation between the knockdown or inhibition of stk <dig> and kras-dependent cancer cell survival, neither using rnai nor small molecule inhibitors . nevertheless, recent studies found an association of stk <dig> with colorectal cancer  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> , hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma  <cit>  and lung cancer  <cit> .

to date, stk <dig> has been found only in the subphylum vertebrata. so far it has been found in multiple vertebrate classes including mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fish, but not in birds . neither the analyses of the international chicken genome sequencing consortium  <cit> , nor our own screening of the chicken  genome for stk <dig> revealed a functional copy . so far, this was the only vertebrate class with no indication for a functional stk <dig>  since stk <dig> genes are present as well in mammalians as in phylogenetically older vertebrate species , we wanted to know whether birds do not have stk <dig> genes in general or if the chicken is an exception. therefore, we analyzed the genomes and transcriptomes of more than  <dig> different bird species using deep sequencing and publicly available next generation sequencing data  <cit> .

the class of aves comprises about  <dig>  extant species  <cit>  and the majority of these species arose from a rapid radiation after a mass extinction event about  <dig> million years ago within neonaves  <cit> . it is divided into the clade palaeognathae, including the flightless ratites and the tinamous, and the clade neognathae, including all other extant bird species  <cit> .

in this article, we report that stk <dig> is present and expressed in paleognath birds, but has become a unitary pseudogene within the subclass neognathae during the cretaceous period about  <dig> million years ago.

RESULTS
first, we analyzed the chicken  genome for the presence of a functional copy of stk <dig>  in human  and mouse  stk <dig> is located in a highly syntenic region on chromosome 11p <dig>  and chromosome 7e <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in the chicken this region could be identified on chromosome  <dig>  whereas in the chicken no stk <dig> has been annotated in this region . therefore we screened the whole genome and this region in particular for the presence of stk <dig>  these genomic screens revealed the presence of only eight remnant exons containing both frameshifting indels and multiple stop codons  in this region and multiple large genomic deletions that have led to the deletion of several exons. extensive blastn searches of the chicken genome did not reveal a duplication or a retrotransposition event for stk <dig> 

this led us to the conclusion that stk <dig> has become a unitary pseudogene in the chicken, raising the question if the chicken is an exception or if stk <dig> is missing in birds in general.

stk <dig> is present and expressed in the subclass palaeognathae
to answer this question, we first reconstructed the stk <dig> genomic locus and the intron-exon structure in the most basal extant bird, the african ostrich  which belongs to the subclass palaeognathae. illumina sequencing of total rna generated from both cerebellum and testis yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads . since no genomic data was available as a reference at the time, we performed de novo assemblies of the illumina reads using k-mer sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  these assemblies yielded between  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs with an average length between  <dig> and 1010 bp. all contigs from all assemblies were analyzed by blastn searches against the non-redundant nucleotide collection  database. a total of  <dig> assemblies contained stk <dig> relevant contigs, which were assembled into a single scaffold of  <dig>  bp length. for a preliminary annotation of exons on this scaffold the publicly available stk <dig> sequence from the green anole   was used. these exons were verified by rt-pcr and the intron-exon boundaries were determined using intron-spanning pcrs on genomic dna followed by sanger sequencing. we obtained the full length mrna sequence and identified two alternative transcriptional start sites as well as two different polyadenylation sites by race pcr. in summary, a stk <dig> mrna sequence of  <dig>  bp with a total of  <dig> exons was established , all flanked by consensus splice sites . for the genomic structure of stk <dig> all introns and the promoter region were amplified by pcr. finally a genomic contig of  <dig>  bp was assembled . in the promoter region, two gc-box elements were identified at positions − <dig> and - <dig>  for verification, the illumina transcriptome reads were mapped back to the genomic reference contig .fig.  <dig> stk <dig> gene structure in ostrich. transcriptomic reads obtained from total rna of the ostrich cerebellum and testis were mapped back to the genomic reference. paired-end reads mapping within their paired distance are shown in blue connected by a blue solid line, forward reads in green and reverse reads in red. broken lines depict split reads. the read coverage is illustrated as a red graph. the stk <dig> mrna is annotated as a green arrow, the corresponding coding sequences as yellow arrows. purple rectangles show gc boxes. all introns are shown with 10 % of their original size



the ostrich stk <dig> mrna sequence contains a single open reading frame  of  <dig>  bp encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein of  <dig>  kda that shows highly significant  similarity to stk <dig> of the american alligator , green sea turtle , chinese softshell turtle  and other reptiles. protein analysis employing interpro  <cit>  showed the presence of a serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain, an atp binding site and an active site, suggesting that all features of an active kinase are present . the ostrich stk <dig> catalytic domain shows high similarity to stk <dig> proteins from other species . a gc-rich region of 241 bp was found at the 5′ end of the transcribed region with a gc content of 81 % that seems to be unique for the ostrich . mappings of the transcriptomic data to the genomic reference contig revealed two alternative splice variants, skipping either exon  <dig> or exon  <dig> . all splice variants were verified by pcr using splice variant specific primers. the existence of a splice variant lacking both exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> was precluded by pcr. the splice variant lacking exon  <dig> shows no change within the functional domains, whereas the splice variant lacking exon  <dig> contains a by  <dig> aa shortened serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain. however both the active site and the atp binding site are not affected in both splice variants.fig.  <dig> amino acid sequence alignment of the stk <dig> catalytic domains from different species. percentage of sequence identities corresponding to the catalytic domain are shown next to the corresponding sequences. the atp binding site is framed by a green rectangle and the active site by a blue rectangle. mismatches are emphasized in red



encouraged by our findings that stk <dig> is expressed in the african ostrich, we investigated if the genomes of other paleognath birds contain a functional stk <dig> gene. for this purpose we chose the closely related emu  and the white-throated-tinamou . for the emu we used transcriptomic illumina data of the embryonic brain with a total of  <dig>  mio reads  and  <dig>  reads  from adult brain . since the publicly available genomic data  was of insufficient quality for the generation of a suitable reference sequence, we mapped the emu transcriptomic reads to the ostrich stk <dig> mrna sequence and extracted the consensus sequence. the transcriptomic reads were mapped back to this consensus sequence for verification. this led to an mrna sequence of  <dig>  bp in length split into  <dig> exons. the mrna sequence contains a single open reading frame of  <dig>  bp which shows 94 % identity  with the ostrich mrna sequence. the emu orf encodes a  <dig> aa protein of  <dig>  kda. amino acid sequence alignments of the ostrich and emu stk <dig> proteins show 97 % identity  within the catalytic domain . across the whole protein sequence the similarity is 91 %. the emu stk <dig> also contains a serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain, an atp binding site and an active site.

for the white-throated-tinamou we focused on the genomic analysis, since no transcriptomic sra data is available. this analysis showed that the white-throated-tinamou stk <dig> contains only  <dig> exons instead of the  <dig> seen in the african ostrich and emu, due to a large genomic deletion of  <dig>  kb, including exon  <dig> . however, the deletion of exon  <dig> does not interrupt the open reading frame and there are no indels or point mutations present elsewhere in the coding region, that would lead to frameshifts or premature stop codons. the same applies to a 6 bp deletion within exon  <dig> . furthermore, the african ostrich is expressing a splice variant lacking exon  <dig>  which is not crucial for the function of stk <dig> as a kinase, because this exon is not part of the serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain. in summary, we can conclude that stk <dig> is present and expressed in all birds of the subclass of palaeognathae.fig.  <dig> sequence alignments of identified stk <dig> exons of different birds to african ostrich stk <dig> mrna. the ostrich stk <dig> mrna is shown as a green arrow, the open reading frame as a yellow arrow. green lines indicate the mapped exons, red lines indicate inversed exons. small indels  are shown as blue triangles, large indels  as blue rectangles. stop codons are illustrated as red asterisks and start codons as a green capital “m”. black lines depict consensus sequences. the exon  <dig> region is highlighted by purple broken lines



stk <dig> has become a unitary pseudogene in neognathae
since we had evidence that a functional copy of stk <dig> is missing in the genome of the chicken, we wanted to know whether this is a particular case for galliformes or whether this is generally the case for all neognath birds. therefore, we examined a total of  <dig> neognaths  on a genomic level and four on a transcriptional level in order to achieve a good sample distribution over the neognathae pedigree   <cit> . the genomic studies were carried out as outlined for the white-throated-tinamou.

all of the  <dig> neognaths analyzed showed only remnants of non-functional stk <dig> sequences. frequent large genomic deletions of several kilobases within the stk <dig> locus were observed, leading to the loss of several exons. blastx searches of the remnant exons showed multiple frameshifting indels and frequent snps, leading to the generation of multiple premature stop codons within the stk <dig> orf . even the closest relative to the paleognath birds in our list, the mallard  shows a severely degenerated stk <dig>  including the deletion of six exons, several indels and multiple premature stop codons . in the anna’s hummingbird  an additional genomic inversion of a 3 kb fragment of the stk <dig> gene is present, leading to the inversion of the 5′ end of exon  <dig> . all birds examined belonging to the order passeriformes , which represents about 60 % of all extant avian species, showed deletions of the exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  several indels and premature stop codons . all other neognaths show similar severe mutations . interestingly, all neognaths examined share the deletion of exon  <dig> 

we have investigated whether stk <dig> is still transcribed in spite of the many mutations found in the neognath stk <dig> genes. we also looked for the possibility that in neognaths stk <dig> might have potentially acquired new exons in the course of evolution and thus, a functional variant of stk <dig> might have been restored. for this analysis, we downloaded several transcriptomic sra data sets  of tissues in which transcription of stk <dig> has been described previously  <cit> . the data included more than  <dig>  billion reads from chicken , about  <dig> million reads from the white-throated sparrow  and  <dig> million reads from the collared flycatcher . in addition, we sequenced cdna generated from zebra finch  brain, yielding  <dig>  million reads . these data sets were then mapped to the appropriate genomic stk <dig> target region and to the stk <dig> mrna sequence from the african ostrich. in all this data we could not detect any stk33-related sequences. furthermore, rt-pcr from cdna using pairs of primers designed to the remnant exon sequences did not yield any products.

in order to exclude that a duplication or a retrotransposition of stk <dig> occurred during the course of evolution, we performed both transcriptional de novo assemblies and extensive blastn searches of the wgs assemblies. these analyses did not reveal any duplicated or retrotransposed stk <dig> copies elsewhere in the genome, so that we can conclude that stk <dig> turned into a unitary pseudogene in neognaths and is no longer expressed.

discussion
in this study we used a combination of large scale next generation sequencing data analysis and pcr to elucidate the genomic structure and the transcription of the stk <dig> gene in the phylogenetic class of aves. in both ostrich and emu, belonging to the phylogenetically older palaeognathae, we were able to prove the presence of a functional stk <dig> which is also undoubtedly transcribed. in the third paleognath, the white-throated tinamou, genomic analysis showed the presence of  <dig> exons with no frameshifting indels or premature stop codons within the coding region. we therefore conclude that the white-throated tinamou, as ostrich and emu, carries a functional copy of stk <dig>  in the future this will need to be proven by transcriptomic and/or proteomic analyses. in summary, we can conclude that stk <dig> is present and expressed in all paleognath birds.

in neognaths we found only non-functional remnants of stk <dig>  there were no transcripts of these stk <dig> remnants detectable. genomic deletions, indels and premature stop codons clearly led to non-functionality of the degenerate stk <dig> remnants . furthermore, there is neither evidence for a functional stk <dig> copy elsewhere in the genome nor are new exons acquired to compensate for those that have been lost. this leads us to the conclusion that stk <dig> has become a pseudogene in neognaths during the evolutionary history of the class aves. although there is ample evidence that no gene duplication occurred, a copy of stk <dig> could have been retrotransposed back into the genome and somehow become a functional substitute for the original stk <dig>  but since these so called processed pseudogenes are generally considered to be “dead on arrival”  <cit> , due to the lack of a promoter, this scenario would be considered highly unlikely. in addition, all attempts to identify any copies of stk <dig> elsewhere in any neognath genome failed, so that we are rather confident that this subclass of birds is the only one among vertebrates lacking stk <dig>  as can be inferred from those vertebrates with a present stk <dig> . such gene loss is a common and important evolutionary process and has been described in bacteria  <cit> , eukaryotes  <cit>  and archaea  <cit> . it is very abundant in some lineages such as bacteria or tunicates, that have undergone considerable genome reduction during their evolution . birds also have undergone gene loss and genome reduction compared to other tetrapod classes, but not to the same extent as in bacteria or tunicates .

it is interesting that all neognaths lack exon  <dig>  indicating that this chromosomal deletion may have been the initial mutation leading to the degeneration of stk <dig>  this mutation most likely occurred at a very early stage in the diversification of the class of aves during the late cretaceous period about  <dig> million years ago, at the branching point of palaeognathae and neognathae   <cit> . interestingly, a current large scale comparative genomics study in birds could show that the origin of neognath birds was accompanied by an elevated rate of genomic rearrangements  <cit> . this and the long time span are in accordance with the drastic changes seen in the stk <dig> locus in neognaths. there are cases where pseudogenes have gained new functions expressing non-coding rnas that can have a variety of different regulatory functions  <cit> . however, in spite of intensive searches we could not detect any stk <dig> related transcripts in any of the neognath bird tissues analyzed. therefore, a function of the stk <dig> pseudogene is highly unlikely. this leads to the question, which gene could have taken over the function of stk <dig> in neognaths or if its function has become dispensable.

in the following we would like to discuss different hypothesis about how the loss of stk <dig> could have been tolerated and become fixed in neognath birds. one possibility could be, that the function of the stk <dig> gene could have become dispensable, leading to the fixation of the pseudogene by genetic drift  <cit> . we believe this to be unlikely since stk <dig> has been implicated in critical functions such as spermatogenesis and organogenesis  <cit>  and there is no obvious indication to assume that neognath birds can manage without these functions of stk <dig> whereas paleognath birds and other vertebrates cannot. following this assumption, stk <dig> could have undergone subfunctionalization, a process where a pair of genes that resulted from a duplication event retained different subfunctions of the original gene  <cit> . if one of these subfunctions should have become dispensable, the corresponding paralogous gene would have acquired the observed deleterious mutations. but since we could not find any evidence for a stk <dig> duplication event in neognath birds, we can preclude this possibility.

a third possibility is given by the “less is more” hypothesis. it states that gene loss can be an advantageous event and thus can serve as an engine of evolutionary change  <cit> . even though this may seem contradictory, since it suggests evolutionary innovation by degeneration, there are several examples of such a positive selection for gene loss . one could argue that the loss of stk <dig> may be beneficial, since it has been identified as an essential component in several types of cancer . however, the role of stk <dig> in cancer remains controversial  and we do not have any indication for a beneficial effect due to the lack of stk <dig>  making this a rather unlikely hypothesis. nevertheless, analyzing if neognaths display any form of immunity to these types of cancer could represent an interesting approach, since they constitute natural knockouts for stk <dig> 

another possible explanation for the toleration of gene loss is the phenomenon of genetic redundancy, which can be caused by either gene duplication or convergent evolutionary processes, leading to proteins that are performing the same function, but are unrelated in sequence  <cit> . due to the lack of selective pressure on these genes, genetic redundancy would be considered to be evolutionary unstable. however, genetic redundancy appears to be quite frequent in genomes of higher organisms, implying that redundant genes can be evolutionary stable under certain conditions . one model describing a stable genetic redundancy takes pleiotropy into consideration. if gene a performs function f <dig> and gene b performs both functions f <dig> and f <dig>  but f <dig> with a slightly reduced efficacy, this genetic redundancy would be considered as evolutionary stable  <cit> . the presence of different splice variants in ostrich, human and mouse  <cit>  strongly indicates that stk <dig> has more than one function and that vimentin may not be its only substrate  <cit> . this is supported by the fact that stk <dig> can also be found in vimentin-negative cells  <cit> . if we presume stk <dig> to be gene b and assume that the function f <dig> has become irrelevant to the neognath lifestyle, stk <dig> would have inevitably been lost in neognath birds.

a variant of the latter possibility is that stk <dig> may have become dispensable, because it has been functionally substituted by a non-orthologous, but functionally analogous kinase in neognaths, a process called non-orthologous gene displacement . several examples of such a nod have been reported .

regardless of whether genetic redundancy or non-orthologous gene displacement is causal for the pseudogenization of stk <dig> in neognath birds, a second kinase that is able to phosphorylate vimentin has to be involved. for this, only kinases that are able to phosphorylate vimentin in the same regions as stk <dig> are considered as candidates. so far, the exact phosphorylation sites of stk <dig> have not yet been determined, but they have been circumscribed to at least one phosphorylation site between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> and at least a second phosphorylation site located between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> within the amino-terminal non-α-helical head domain by kinase assays using truncated vimentin mutants  <cit> . a total of ten kinases has been shown to phosphorylate vimentin  . all these kinases are present in birds  <cit> . since vimentin could be regulated differently in neognaths or birds in general, an alignment of the vimentin amino-terminal head domain has been built. this alignment shows that most of the phosphorylation sites are conserved between human, mouse and birds . this suggests that vimentin is regulated in a similar way compared to human and mouse.table  <dig> known vimentin phosphorylating kinases and their phosphorylation sites



the phosphorylation sites of two kinases, plk <dig> and p <dig>  are located outside the amino-terminal head domain  <cit>  and thus probably are no candidates that could substitute stk <dig>  three other kinases  are also not suitable candidates since they only have a single phosphorylation site . even though mapkap kinase  <dig> and camkii have at least one phosphorylation site within the same region that is phosphorylated by stk <dig>  they both also phosphorylate ser- <dig>  <cit> , making them unlikely substituents for stk <dig>  the three remaining kinases, rho-kinase, protein kinase c and protein kinase a all have  <dig> phosphorylation sites within the same region as stk <dig>  . however the vimentin alignment clearly shows that ser- <dig>  which is phosphorylated by protein kinase c  <cit> , is not conserved in birds , making it a rather unlikely candidate. thus rho-kinase and protein kinase a represent the best candidates to compensate for the loss of stk <dig> in neognath birds, since their phosphorylation sites are within the same region as those for stk <dig> and are highly conserved in birds .

further studies about stk <dig> on the genomic and protein level, especially about the exact phosphorylation sites of stk <dig>  are necessary to further elucidate its function and to give additional indications towards the actual substituent. without further knowledge all hypothesis remain speculative.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we elucidate and describe the genomic structure and the transcription of the serine/threonine kinase  <dig>  in paleognath birds, such as the african ostrich , emu  and the white-throated tinamou  using both large scale next generation sequencing data analysis and pcr. we were able to show that all three paleognath birds analyzed carry functional and expressed copies of stk <dig> and thus, we concluded that stk <dig> is present and expressed in paleognath birds in general, as it is the case in all other vertebrate classes.

surprisingly, in neognaths birds we found only degenerate remnants of stk <dig> that have become non-functional by genomic deletions, indels and premature stop codons . furthermore, no transcripts of these remnant exons could be detected. interestingly, all neognath birds share the deletion of exon  <dig>  these results lead us to the conclusion that stk <dig> became a unitary pseudogene in the evolutionary history of the class aves during the late cretaceous period about  <dig> million years ago, at the branching point of palaeognathae and neognathae that was accompanied by an elevated rate of genomic rearrangements in neognaths  <cit> . we hypothesize that this pseudogenization of stk <dig> might have become fixed in neognathae due to either genetic redundancy or a non-orthologous gene displacement . rho-kinase and protein kinase a have been identified as the most promising candidate genes by comparing their vimentin phosphorylation sites to those of stk <dig>
