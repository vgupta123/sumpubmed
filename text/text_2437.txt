BACKGROUND
accumulating evidence indicates that ascorbate , an antioxidant vitamin, plays a critical role in modulating striatal function. an increase in extracellular aa, for example, enhances corticostriatal glutamate  transmission  <cit>  as well as the response of striatal neurons to glu iontophoresis  <cit> . under naturally occurring conditions, striatal aa release rises and falls, respectively, with increases and decreases in the level of behavioral activity  <cit> . extracellular glu  <cit>  and striatal neuron firing rate, which depends on glu input  <cit> , follow a similar behavior-related pattern. to assess the extent to which the level of behavioral activity influences the ability of aa to modulate extracellular glu in striatum, we used microdialysis to elevate aa and measure glu efflux in rats tested under different behavioral conditions. all animals were tested at the same time of day, the onset of the nocturnal phase of the circadian cycle, but aa effects were tested either with the lights on, which suppresses behavioral activity, or lights off, which causes behavioral activation.

RESULTS
during the baseline period when lights were on, all rats rested quietly and tended to remain in a single corner of the open field. all six rats exposed to continuous light  showed minimal to no ambulation throughout the session. in contrast, the six exposed to darkness  during the experimental period showed spontaneous locomotion as well as rearing and exploratory sniffing, and this activity persisted, albeit at a lower level, even as ambient light returned in the post-experimental period. fig.  <dig> depicts this darkness-induced behavior increase for quadrant crosses. these animals crossed more quadrants than those in the lights-on group during both the experimental  and post-experimental  periods. while it was expected that returning ambient light  following darkness exposure would result in more immediate behavioral cessation, their decreased locomotion was not significant . quadrant crosses were unaffected by reverse dialysis of either  <dig> or  <dig> μm aa  ruling out an effect of aa alone on locomotion.

like quadrant crossings, glu increased dramatically when lights were off regardless of treatment . relative to the lights-on group, which remained behaviorally inactive, lights off triggered a glu response that increased steadily throughout the experimental period. a repeated-measures anova revealed a significant increase in glu during either the first  <dig> min  or the entire  <dig> min  of the experimental period for both the  <dig> μm  and  <dig> μm aa infusion  among dark/active relative to lights-on/inactive animals. interestingly, when the post-experimental  collections were included in the analysis, the glu increase continued for the dark-exposed animals treated with  <dig> μm aa  , but not  <dig> μm aa  , suggesting that elevated aa can prolong the behavior-related glu response. in fact, the mean  percent glu increase above baseline for the final post-experimental collection was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the  <dig> μm infusion and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the  <dig> μm group. thus, not only does behavioral activity increase glu, but a high concentration of aa can extend this effect.

analyzing the glu response by aa treatment  revealed an effect of  <dig> μm during the experimental period but only for the lights-on condition and only during the early phase of this period. thus, there was a significant effect of aa treatment during the first  <dig> min  , but not the entire  <dig> min   of the lights-on condition . no aa difference emerged for the lights-off condition  at either time . thus, a darkness-induced behavioral activation appeared to elevate glu to a level that obscured the aa effect evident in behaviorally inactive animals. extending our analysis through the post-experimental period revealed no significant aa dose effect for either the lights-off   or the lights-on group  .

discussion
our results indicate that although an increase in aa can elevate glu in striatal extracellular fluid, this effect is sensitive to behavioral state. reverse dialysis of  <dig> μm aa increased extracellular glu during the lights-on condition, when rats rested quietly, but failed to alter the increase in glu during lights-off when maximal behavioral activity occurred. thus, the aa-induced potentiation of the magnitude of the glu response appears limited to behaviorally quiet or less-active conditions when endogenous glu release is relatively low. there is growing support for increases in glu release correlating with general behavioral activity. research on forced-limb use, for example, showed that increased activity of free limbs resulted in increased extracellular glu in contralateral sensorimotor cortex compared with cortex contralateral to a casted forelimb across extended periods  <cit> . regarding discrete periods of behavior, rearing behavior in freely-moving mice has been associated with discrete increases in striatal glu measured with 13-s resolution  <cit> . it is possible that the relatively high glu level during behavioral activity prevented a further aa-induced increase.

when ambient light returned, dark-exposed animals were still active but no longer at their behavioral peak. under these conditions, prior infusion of  <dig>  but not  <dig> μm aa maintained the glu increase during the post-experimental period. in fact, post-experimental glu leveled off in the lights-off animals treated with  <dig> μm. thus, although the concentration of extracellular glu may approach a maximal rate of increase during robust behavioral activity, aa appears to enhance this glu effect by allowing it to continue even as behavior declines toward baseline. further assessment of the aa-induced change in the behavior-related glu response is warranted.

the relationship between extracellular aa and glu appears to depend on the outward transport of aa during glu uptake  <cit> . thus, a high level of extracellular aa may prevent glu uptake by opposing further release of endogenous aa. in line with this prediction, the addition of  <dig> to  <dig> μm aa to striatal extracellular fluid significantly delayed the removal of electrically evoked glu release  <cit> . at the neuronal level, moreover, an increase in extracellular aa significantly enhanced the absolute magnitude of the excitation evoked by glu iontophoresis – albeit without prolonging the response  <cit> . it appears, therefore, that glu transmission is regulated, at least in part, by the level of extracellular aa. we show here that in awake animals an increase in extracellular aa can, in fact, elevate striatal glu release when animals are behaviorally quiet. this effect is less straightforward, however, during behavioral activation.

a likely reason for the complicating effect of behavior is the release of endogenous aa, which, according to aa-glu heteroexchange  <cit> , would normally accompany the behavior-related increase in glu transmission. if endogenous extracellular aa is already sufficiently high to interfere with glu uptake, as would be expected during lights-off when behavior is maximally stimulated, then additional aa will have no further effect. in fact, striatal extracellular aa during behavior can more than double the resting or anesthetized level  <cit> , which ranges roughly between  <dig> and  <dig> μm depending on striatal location  <cit> . our use of  <dig> μm in control acsf should minimize resting aa depletion but allow for endogenous aa release during glu uptake. extracellular application of  <dig> μm aa blocks the uptake of electrically evoked glu release from corticostriatal fibers in anesthetized animals  <cit>  and appears to match the extracellular concentration of endogenous aa that can be attained during naturally occurring or drug-evoked periods of behavioral activation  <cit> . as glu release plateaus and behavior begins to decline during the return of ambient light, endogenous aa release is also likely to plateau, thus allowing for  <dig> μm aa to exert a glu effect.

interestingly, glu variability seemed to increase over time . a likely source of this variability is the rate of striatal aa perfusion during reverse dialysis. although animals within a group received the same aa concentration, different aa diffusion rates between probes may have allowed aa to affect glu at different times during the experimental period. this type of variability may have terminated the aa-induced increase in glu at  <dig> min in the lights-on condition . it is unlikely that individual differences in locomotion contributed to the variability since animals were consistently inactive  or active  during the experimental period.

CONCLUSIONS
our results add to increasing evidence that aa modulates glu transmission. if, as the heteroexchange model predicts, glu uptake requires aa release, then the rise in extracellular glu during behavior may result from a slowing of uptake due to the progressive accumulation of extracellular aa. other mechanisms also may contribute, including glutamate-cystine exchange since, like cystine, aa is a redox molecule  <cit> . although the source of glu measured in our experiments may include both neuronal and metabolic pools, previous data indicate that the aa-glu interaction is directly relevant to neuronal release  <cit> . because dysfunctional glu has been implicated in a wide range of clinical conditions from drug addiction to neurodegenerative disease  <cit> , further research on an aa-glu link may have important therapeutic benefits.
