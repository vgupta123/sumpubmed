BACKGROUND
drug exposure, ionizing radiations and environmental pro-oxidant pollutants induce free radical formation. lipid peroxidation initiated by free radicals is considered to be deleterious for cell membranes and has been implicated in a number of pathological situations. carbontetrachloride , an industrial solvent, is a well-established hepatotoxin  <cit> . various studies demonstrated that liver is not the only target organ of ccl <dig> and it causes free radical generation in other tissues also such as kidneys, heart, lung, testis, brain and blood  <cit> . it has also been reported that exposure to ccl <dig> induces acute and chronic renal injuries  <cit> . case control studies and various documented case reports increasingly establish that hydrocarbon solvents produce renal diseases in humans  <cit> .

extensive evidence demonstrates that as a result of the metabolic activation of ccl <dig>  •ccl <dig> and •cl, are formed which initiate lipid peroxidation process. vitamin e protected ccl4-induced liver injury indicating the role of oxidative stress in this model  <cit> . studies also show that certain natural extracts containing antioxidants protect against the ccl4-induced increased lipid peroxide levels and impairment in hepatic gsh status  <cit> .

hesperidin is a flavanone glycoside abundantly found in sweet orange and lemon and is an inexpensive by-product of citrus cultivation  <cit> . hesperidin is effectively used as a supplemental agent in the treatment protocols of complementary settings. its deficiency has been linked to abnormal capillary leakiness as well as pain in the extremities causing aches, weakness and night leg cramps. supplemental hesperidin also helps in reducing oedema or excess swelling in the legs due to fluid accumulation. a number of researchers have examined the antioxidant activity and radical scavenging properties of hesperidin using a variety of assay systems  <cit> .

thus the present study was designed to investigate the effect of hdn on ccl4-induced oxidative stress and resultant dysfunction of rat liver and kidney.

RESULTS
effect on liver enzymes
ccl <dig> caused a marked rise in serum levels of alt  and ast  demonstrating a marked liver damage. treatment with hdn decreases the elevated levels of alt and ast in serum . both the doses of hdn also attenuated the ccl4-induced elevated levels of total bilirubin .

values are expressed as percent response compared to control rats. a = statistical significant at p <  <dig>  as compare to control, b = statistical significant at p <  <dig>  as compare to ccl <dig>  c = statistical significant at p <  <dig>  as compare to ccl4+ hdn

effect on hepatic and renal tbars levels
ccl <dig> challenge caused a marked lipid peroxidation in both liver  and kidney . both the doses of hdn decreased the level of lipid peroxidation in liver, but in the kidney, no effect on lipid peroxidation was seen with 100-mg/kg dose, and only the higher dose of hdn  could attenuate the increased level of lipid peroxidation  . 7-day oral feeding of hdn per se  did not result in a significant alteration of either hepatic or renal tbars levels.

effect on the glutathione levels in ccl <dig> treated rats
ccl <dig> administration markedly decreased the levels of reduced glutathione in both the liver  and kidneys  demonstrating oxidative stress. hdn  per se did not produce any change in the levels of reduced glutathione either in liver or kidney. hdn  showed no effect on the levels of reduced glutathione either in liver or kidney in ccl <dig> treated rats whereas hdn  significantly ameliorated ccl4-induced depletion of gsh in both liver and kidney . hdn per se  did not result in a significant alteration of either hepatic or renal gsh levels.

effect on the antioxidant enzymes in liver and kidneys in ccl <dig> treated rats
ccl <dig> challenge significantly decreased the levels of sod and catalase in both liver  and kidneys . hdn per se  had no effect on these enzymes either in liver or in kidneys. hdn  failed to improve the levels of sod or catalase either in liver or kidneys of ccl <dig> administered rats but hdn  significantly increased the levels of both enzymes in liver and kidneys of ccl <dig> treated rats . 7-day oral feeding of hdn per se  did not result in a significant alteration of any of these antioxidant enzymes either in liver or kidney.

discussion
ccl4-induced lipid peroxidation is highly dependent on its bioactivation to the trichoromethyl radical and trichloromethyl peroxy radical  <cit> . it is well known that ccl <dig> is activated by the cytochrome p <dig> system. the initial metabolite is the trichloromethyl free radical, which is believed to initate the biochemical events that ultimately culminate in liver cell necrosis <cit> . the trichloromethyl radical can form covalent adducts with lipids and proteins, interact with o <dig> to form a tricholoromethyl peroxy radical or abstract hydrogen atoms to form chloroform  <cit> . other products include conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, malonaldehyde-like substances, and other short-chain hydrocarbons  <cit> . in response to hepatocellular injury initiated by the biotransformation of ccl <dig> to reactive radicals, "activated" kupffer cells in liver respond by releasing increased amounts of active oxygen species and other bioactive agents  <cit> .

protective effects of various natural products in ccl <dig> hepatotoxicity have been reported  <cit> . studies done with ginseng showed that the antioxidant property of ginsenosides contributes to protection against ccl <dig> induced hepatotoxicity in rats  <cit> . in the present study, ccl <dig> induced a severe hepatic damage as represented by markedly elevated levels of alt, ast and bilirubin coupled with a marked hepatic oxidative stress. ccl4-induced generation of peroxy radicals and o2-• leads to inactivation of catalase and sod. we too observed that ccl <dig> challenge significantly decreased the levels of sod and catalase in liver and kidney. recently, szymonik-lesiuk et al  <cit>  have shown that ccl <dig> intoxication can lead to alteration in gene expression and depletion of sod and catalase levels in kidney and heart. oxidative stress causes depletion of intracellular gsh, leading to serious consequences. hdn administration ameliorated the increased level of lipid peroxidation after ccl <dig> treatment. interestingly, only the higher dose of hdn  was able to show improvement in the levels of endogenous antioxidant enzymes  and gsh in liver. improvement of hepatic gsh levels in hdn-treated rats in comparison to ccl <dig> intoxicated rats demonstrates the antioxidant effect of hdn.

we failed to observe any effect of ccl <dig> on renal function. neither bun nor serum creatinine levels increased after ccl <dig> administration . studies by zimmerman et al  <cit>  also did not report any rise in bun levels even after chronic treatment of ccl <dig> in nephrectomized rats. they found an increased frequency of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial alterations in rats with reduced renal mass on ccl <dig> administration thereby indicating nephrotoxicity on long-term ccl <dig> administration in rats. these findings raise the possibility that renal disease in man is related to hydrocarbon solvent exposure and may also be potentiated by concomitant renal disease or impaired renal function. ogawa et al  <cit>  also reported that chronic renal injuries and bun elevations developed in balb/c mice only after  <dig> weeks of ccl <dig> intoxication. on the contrary, we estimated the renal function just after  <dig> hrs of ccl <dig> challenge. thus this brief period might not be sufficient to demonstrate any rise in serum bun and creatinine levels. though renal function did not alter after  <dig> hrs of ccl <dig> administration but even this short period of exposure led to a significant oxidative stress in kidneys. fadhel and coworkers  <cit>  had also reported increased levels of renal tbars in rats after ccl <dig> exposure which could be improved by black tea extract. similar observations were also reported with certain indian ayurvedic indian preparations  <cit> .

hdn treatment has been previously demonstrated to improve gsh levels in liver and kidneys of diabetic rats and a decrease in levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , a marker of dna fragmentation, in the urine of diabetic rats  <cit> . hdn in combination with diosmin has also been shown to inhibit the reactive oxygen radicals production in zymosan-stimulated human polymorphonuclear neutrophils  <cit> . thus hdn has been shown to reduce oxidative stress in various in-vivo and in-vitro studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study demonstrated that ccl <dig> induces a marked oxidative stress in rat liver and kidney, which is amenable to attenuation by hdn. this protective effect of hdn can be correlated directly to its antioxidant property.
