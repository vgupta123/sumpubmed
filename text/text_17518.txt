BACKGROUND
vibrio strains are reported to be fatal pathogens not only to humans but also to aquaculture fish and shellfish. several virulence factors that they produce—including hemolysin, caseinase, gelatinase, lipase, and phospholipase—are detrimental to animal health . for instance, an extracellular protease with endopeptidolytic and exopeptidolytic activities from a pathogenic v. pelagius strain is responsible for the lethal effect and vibriosis in turbot. the different virulence factors are produced at different stages of infection. hemolysin-producing bacteria include v. parahaemolyticus, v. alginolyticus, v. cholerae, v. hollisae, aeromonas veronii, and v. anguillarum .

vibrio alginolyticus, a gram-negative halophilic bacterium that frequently occurs in the normal microbiota of marine environments, is a pathogen of epizootic outbreaks, which causes serious mortality of fish and shellfish and also can transmit to humans. the disease caused by v. alginolyticus often has lethal consequences for fish larvae throughout the world, and it has become one of the major limiting factors in aquaculture in developing countries. for example, it was a causal agent of vibriosis outbreaks in grouper sea bream sparus aurata
 <cit> . v. alginolyticus causes several symptoms in sea bream: septicemia, hemorrhaging, dark skin, and ulcers on the skin surface. some fish accumulate fluid in the peritoneal cavity or have hemorrhagic livers. in several cases of high-mortality outbreaks, vibrio alginolyticus and vibrio splendidus biovar ii were the primary organisms found in moribund clam larvae , and these two species processed extracellular products collaboratively at high concentrations to kill the hemocytes after four hours of incubation. neurotoxic effects caused by the supernates from diseased strains of vibrio alginolyticus and vibrio anguillarum caused several symptoms in trout, including convulsions, wriggling, contortive swimming and respiratory arrest  <cit> .

chemotherapeutic agents are effective to control pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture. nevertheless, emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a critical issue  <cit> . as a result of management practices in production cycles, the use of probiotics to prevent pathogenic bacterium growth in aquaculture is a practice to reduce both issues on antibiotic resistance and drug residues in food. one alternative is to use bacteriophages to control bacterial growth, which is similar to phage therapy in medical care. this idea has been proposed as a cure for coral disease  <cit> . a variety of bacteriophages that can quickly lyse the pathogens have high potential for future applications in aquaculture.

the burst size of a phage represents an overall outcome that is so important for phage therapy and probiotic usage. the molecular interactions between phage and its host under certain environmental conditions are complicated to resolve. sequences of bacteriophage genomes provide a magnificent tool to investigate interactions with hosts. in addition, vibriophages can be used as a new typing scheme for pathogen identification and as candidate agents for phage therapy and probiotics. for example, the roles of lytic bacteriophages in cholera epidemics were investigated, such as filamentous ctxϕ, myovirus icp <dig>  and podovirus icp <dig> of vibrio cholerae, causing infant and adult deaths for centuries  <cit> . though quite a large number of vibrio phages have been described, only a few of complete genome sequences are known. genome sequences of lytic vibriophages are new keys for molecular typing, pathogenesis, and even assessment of therapeutic efficacy. complete genomes of some phages of v. cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus, and v. vulnificus were documented, yet no genome for v. alginolyticus podovirus has been reported. in this study, we characterized the genome sequences of two newly-isolated phages that can lyse v. alginolyticus atcc  <dig> with different efficiencies.

RESULTS
host range, burst size, and thermal stability
the plaques of ϕa <dig> that formed in 4 hours at 25°c were very clear at their center and at the margin of the edge; sizes of the plaques were about 3 mm in diameter, which increased to 5 mm overnight . the phage concentration in each plaque infected and fully lysed the amounts of host bacterium up to a 50x volume ratio. in comparison, the plaque size of ϕas <dig> only reached 1 mm overnight , and the amplification should not be greater than 3-5x dilution ratio. the em morphology of phages ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> was indistinguishable from each other. the icosahedral head was almost isometric, with a size of 50–55 nm, and the shells on the head capsids sketched out at least three visible rings, although the tail fiber was barely distinguishable from the capsid shell in the micrograph . the tail was 12 nm long, elongating from 25 nm wide in the head-neck connector to 5 nm in the nozzle. they are highly similar to the bacteriophages of the family podoviridae

the susceptibility of other vibrio strains to phage ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> was also investigated by the agar overlay method. among six other vibrios, v. damsela and v. harveyi were found to be susceptible to both phages ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig>  while the other four species could not be infected even at an moi of more than  <dig>  for measurement of the burst size, a bacterial culture in the early exponential growth phase was split into glass tubes with equal numbers of v. alginolyticus cells , and then plaque titers were calculated within 4 hours of incubation. according to the one-step method  <cit> , the burst size of phage ϕa <dig> was  <dig> pfu per infected cell, while that of ϕas <dig> was  <dig> pfu/cell .a thermal stability test was carried out to analyze the heat resistance of phages at ph  <dig> - <dig> . the phages were incubated at  <dig> - 80°c for one hour. as figure 1d shows, the relative phage titers were measured at different temperatures. after incubation at 50°c for one hour, phage ϕa <dig> retained almost 100% infectivity, while ϕas <dig> decreased to 80%. when the temperatures rose higher than 70°c, nearly all phages were inactivated after 15 minutes of incubation.

the ϕa <dig> genome
ϕa <dig> genome was sequenced by a combination of shotgun sequencing . open reading frames  were determined using a combination of rast visual inspection and translated tblastx searches  <cit> . the genome consists of a single double-stranded dna molecule of 42544 bp with a gc content of  <dig> %. we have annotated  <dig> open reading frames , all but one of which are transcribed on one strand of the dna molecule. the ϕa <dig> genome is flanked by some terminal repeats. it is a tightly packed genome with ~90% of the sequence predicted to encode proteins. we use the same gene-numbering system by rast peg, starting from left to right on the genetic map, similar to that of k1e and sp <dig> since the genomes are analogous in organization of major predicted sequences . orfs that have no sequence similarity to any previously characterized podoviridae phages are simply painted in gray . like phage k1e, as well as other t7-like phages, the ϕa <dig> genome can be divided into three regions: early, middle, and late . the first predicted gene similar to other genomes is gp <dig>  which is likely to be of unidentified function in sp <dig>  other than the endosialidase , most open reading frames carried by ϕa <dig> are comparatively more similar to phages k1e and sp <dig> than to t <dig> and other known podoviruses that infect vibrio. ϕa <dig> encodes an rna polymerase  which is responsible for transcription of most of other phage genes that are involved in dna replication, maturation, and packaging  <cit> . an adenylation dna ligase-like gene  is analogous to that of sp6p <dig> or k1- <dig> gp <dig> and is present at the end of the class ii genes. the middle region encodes mainly proteins involved in dna replication/metabolism, among which only primase/helicase , dna polymerase , and exonuclease  were annotated functionally.figure  <dig>

the genes in genomes of phages ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> were annotated to known functions


*five nucleotide mutations were found in ϕas <dig>  which can be referred to text.

with the high similarity to other phages, the late region of the ϕa <dig> encodes the virion structural proteins as well as many of the proteins involved in maturation and cell lysis. the ϕa <dig> peg  <dig> is the head-tail connector , followed by those coding for the scaffolding protein , capsid , tail tube , and internal virion proteins . the genes coding for maturation and terminases subunits  were found in pegs  <dig> and  <dig>  perhaps the peg  <dig>  coded for the product with only a small region of amino acid similarity to the t <dig> tail fiber at the n-terminal head-binding portion, whereas the central catalytic region is highly similar to that of phage k1e endosialidase which may be involved in both recognition and depolymerization of the k <dig> polysaccharide capsule.

like most of members of the closely-related t <dig> family, ϕa <dig> is flanked by terminal repeats, suggesting similar replication strategies: phil- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were promoter-like and repeats. promoter sequences for most gene transcription among t <dig> supergroup phages, which are driven by phage-encoded rnaps, are recognized very specifically. ϕa <dig> encodes an rnap with highly conserved motifs to that of t <dig>  employing the ugene program for searching at repeats with the conditions of > <dig> bases and >95% homology, we predicted  <dig> promoter consensus sequences from  <dig> repeat regions:  <dig> putatively strong promoters and six weak ones. most of those have t7-like homologues . the consensus sequence from − <dig> to + <dig> is identical to that of t <dig>  except that a at − <dig> was replaced by c. however, bases of − <dig> through − <dig>  which are important for promoter specificity, differ from t <dig>  t <dig>  k <dig>  and sp <dig>  <cit> . the consensus at − <dig> for t <dig> and sp <dig> is c, any change leading to inactive  <cit> . since ϕa <dig> and k1e have t and g, respectively, at this position, it is unlikely that the t <dig> or k1e rna polymerase will initiate transcription from ϕa <dig> promoters. ϕa <dig> rnap has different promoter specificity.figure  <dig> 
the sixteen promoters in phage ϕa <dig> genome were predicted and aligned with those of t <dig>  sp <dig>  k <dig>  and t <dig> phages. the position of each promoter in ϕa <dig> genome was recorded as the number following the name of phage. the names of predicted promoters are given using their positions in ϕa <dig> genome, while the positions are shifted by two nucleotides in ϕas <dig> genome.



ϕa <dig> appears to have phage promoters throughout the region of the t <dig> analogues. we proposed that the promoters of phi <dig>  phi <dig>  and phi <dig> in ϕa <dig> are equivalent to φor involved in packaging and possibly replication  <cit> . unlike phages gh- <dig> and k1e, one phage-specific promoter  was found immediately upstream of the protein kinase and rna polymerase genes in ϕa <dig>  suggesting that the autoregulation controls these two genes together. the genome contains a strong σ <dig> promoter  responsible for early gene transcription, including phage rna polymerase. the end of transcription of the early genes in ϕa <dig> is marked by gccctgattcttaatgagtcagggctttt ctt, a rho-independent terminator  immediately following the rna polymerase gene, the equivalent position at  <dig> to  <dig> in k1f of such terminator. peg  <dig> in ϕa <dig> is similar to gene  <dig>  in t <dig>  which could encode a kinase to phosphorylate host rnap and efficiently inactivate the host gene expression  <cit> . two terminators, gcccctgcctactttggtaggggcttattttt at position  <dig> and gagggact cctaagagtccctcctttctt at position  <dig>  were found. terminator at  <dig> was a potential analogue to the t <dig> tφ terminator, located inside the gene encoding major capsid; terminator at  <dig> was just the end of tail fibers.

genome comparisons between ϕa <dig> and ϕas51
analyses of nucleotide restriction enzyme polymorphisms and protein profiles showed no difference between ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> ; the amplification rates were, however, significantly distinct for the two phages. it was worth-while to sequence the whole genomes to investigate the context. ϕas <dig> genome of 42542 bp  was almost the same as ϕa <dig>  except that five single nucleotides were mutated sporadically in the genome. triple checks by pcrs and re-sequencings showed that two deletions of adenosine were in rnap gene while single-nucleotide mutations in three sites also occurred in the major capsid protein.

in comparison with gene sequences of other t7-like rna polymerases, ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> rnap genes shared five consensus regions, corresponding to residues 421– <dig>  537– <dig>  563– <dig>  627– <dig>  and 811– <dig> residues in the t <dig> rna polymerase. as shown in our previous publication  <cit> , the motifs were highly conserved among the t7-like phages. in phage ϕa <dig>  the sequences of the motifs were dfrgr , dg , psekpqdiygavs , rsmtkkpvmtlpygs , and hds , respectively. in the region of ϕas <dig> rnap gene, two nucleotides were deleted at 1545 nt, resulting in that the rna polymerase molecules were translated into two pieces: one n-term fragment of the  <dig> residues plus three additional residues and the second fragment for c-term with just one additional met as a start codon . the analysis of nucleotide sequence revealed that the ribosome binding site agaagaat upstream of a gtg was suitable for the second translation of ϕas <dig> rnap gene to a product of the exactly same sequence as the c-term of ϕa <dig> rnap. with use of the threading method of phyre <dig> to predict the 3-dimentional structures for these two fragments of ϕas <dig> rnap, the result revealed that the truncation join was located in the junction of palm and fingers. as figure 4b shows, the tail of ϕas <dig> rnap n-term fragment formed a clip  to hold the ϕas <dig> rnap c-term fragment at the position on palm.figure  <dig>

three mutations of single nucleotide were all in the first codon of the residue, and therefore, totally altered the residues. the mutation at 23973th nucleotide resulted in mutating histidine at 53th residue to be asparagine ; 24171th nucleotide mutation changed isoleucine at 119th to valine ; and 245789th nucleotide mutation converted glu- <dig> to lys- <dig> . the structures of ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> major capsid proteins were predicted from models of hk <dig> and t <dig> capsids by phyre <dig> with >93% confidence. in comparing with the ϕa <dig> capsid, the mutation effects of asn- <dig> on ϕas <dig> major capsid protein broke the presumed cation bridge between his- <dig> of two capsomere subunits in ϕa <dig> capsid . glu- <dig> residue of βj in p-domain formed two hydrogen bonds with the o = c of the backbone of the spine helix to stabilize the link between three beta-sheets and one helix . however, e313k mutation in ϕas <dig> caused the βj in p-domain to lose two hydrogen bonds so as to destabilize the link on the spine helix .figure  <dig>

discussion
this is the first podoviridae genomes of vibrio alginolyticus phages that are documented in genbank.  <dig> out of  <dig> orfs were annotated to known functions, while other orfs were similar to enterobacteria phages k1e and sp <dig>   <dig> strong phage promoters and three terminators were predicted, which are located slightly differently from the closest partners, though genomic organizations were highly homologous  <cit> . most of promoters have t7-like homologues, except that a at − <dig> was replaced by c and specificity region on − <dig> to − <dig> . in ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> phage promoters, the consensus sequence from − <dig> to + <dig> is ccctatag. however, bases of − <dig> through − <dig>  which are important for promoter specificity, differ from t <dig>  t <dig>  k <dig>  and sp <dig>  the consensus at − <dig> for t <dig> and sp <dig> is c; any change of this nucleotide inactivates the promoter function  <cit> . since ϕa <dig> and k1e have t and g, respectively, at this position, it is unlikely that the t <dig> or k1e rna polymerase will initiate transcription from ϕa <dig> promoters. ϕa <dig> rnap has different promoter specificity. this exclusivity of promoter specificity seems to be the trend among the t7-like phages, and it seems that there must be some selective pressure that resulted in this feature.

electron microscopy revealed that phage ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> particles were morphologically similar to type c in bradley’s classification of podoviridae phage   <cit> . the podovirus family is characterized by phages with a nearly isometric icosahedron head and a short non-contractile tail  <cit> . furthermore, the lengths of the icosahedral capsid and tail of phage ϕa <dig> were morphologically indistinguishable from those typically observed for ϕas <dig> in phages ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig>  the sequences of the motifs were dfrgr , dg , psekpqdiygavs , rsmtkkpvmtlpygs , and hds , respectively. strikingly, two nucleotides were deleted in the region of ϕas <dig> rnap gene, which resulted in the rna polymerase molecules being translated into two pieces separated at the 515th residues ; the n-term fragment increased three additional residues in its c-terminus while the second fragment started from a suitable upstream ribosome binding site agaagaat and added just one codon gtg for met to form exactly the same product as the c-term of ϕa <dig> rnap . we suggested that the two fragments could form a 2-subunit-like enzyme to function for the rna polymerization but weaken rnap and lose 88% bursting ability.

virus maturation corresponds to a transition from an initial non-infectious to an infectious and robust virion. phyre <dig> matched the major capsid protein of ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> to phage t <dig> capsid structure pdb:3izg  <cit> . the 3-dimentional prediction clearly revealed that the capsids of the two new phages were characterized by a-domain, spine helix, p-domain, e- and f-loops. three β-strands are located in p-domain, where βj is in the center of the three. the matches of residues, however, were not by one-on-one basis. the 53th residue of ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> capsid was ruled onto 156th residue in f-loop of pdb:3izg while 115-135th residues of ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> were corresponding to 170-190th residues of spine helix in pdb:3izg. the prediction clearly showed spine helix and βj is located in p-domain. the pair of his <dig> is in the f-loops of two capsomere subunits or between the subunit g and hexamers. a fusion of the scaffolding protein to be δ-domain, residues 2– <dig>  in hk <dig> capsid was not found in the new phages, suggesting that the dynamic of forming matured capsid of ϕa <dig> and ϕas <dig> may differ from hk <dig>  based upon our predicted capsid that was well aligned with the structure of residues 104– <dig> in the hk <dig> coat subunits, which form a mixture of hexameric and pentameric capsomeres upon expression, they may still share some degree of expansion intermediates with the hk <dig> capsid  <cit> . for example,  <dig> coat subunits  assemble with a dodecameric portal and ~ <dig> copies of the viral protease to form proheads; or the prohead particles exhibit spine helix bent and p-domain β-sheet twist. veesler et al.
 <cit>  used an hk <dig> subunit mutation that prevents formation of non-covalent interactions in virus-like particles and stops maturation at the expansion intermediate of the particles without e-loop “chainmail” interactions. our results of ϕas <dig> also showed e313k in βj may be involved in the spine helix bending and p-domain β-sheet twisting, while h53n mutation may prevent non-covalent interactions of e-loop chainmail. when histidine at 53th is present in the f-loop, adjacent to e-loop, divalent cations like ni2+ and ca2+ will build a bridge for such interactions.

capsid instability in ϕas <dig> with residues asn- <dig>  and lys- <dig>  can account for the thermal stability data in figure  <dig>  we proposed that the deletion effects of rnap contributed higher percentages of losing burst ability for ϕas <dig> phage than the point mutations occurring in the major capsid protein. our findings suggest that the genome sequencing provides a security check prior to application of phages in therapy; thereafter, the mutation rate for each hotspot can be validated for managing the medication plan. the complicate mechanisms still lie ahead for us to solve. once phage decreases gene activities, the host gains a niche to suppress the phage propagation; as a seesaw does  <cit> . further investigations will discover the details.

CONCLUSIONS
five nucleotide mutations sporadically spread in the ϕas <dig> genome of about  <dig> nucleotides. those small differences may be the causes to distinguish the lower propagation ability and thermal tolerance of ϕas <dig> from the superior ϕa <dig> in plaque size. subtle analyses on the residue alterations uncovered the effects of five nucleotide mutations on the functions of the rnap and capsid proteins, which account for the host-bursting efficiency. the deletion of two nucleotides in rnap gene truncates the primary translation due to early stop codon, while a second translational peptide starting from gtg just at deletion point can remediate the polymerase activity. out of three mutations in major capsid gene, h53n mutation weakens the subunit assembly between capsomeres for the phage head; e313k reduces the fold binding between β-sheet and spine helix inside the peptide. genome sequencing has been done for phage therapy and probiotics to detect a tiny mutation but great effects which can provide early prediction of treatment efficacy or potential side effects.
