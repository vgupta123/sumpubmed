BACKGROUND
fold change is commonly used in quantitative proteomic analysis where proteins differing by more than an arbitrary cut-off value in abundance are considered to be differentially expressed  <cit> . a fold change test is equivalent to a global t-test assuming homogenous variance between different proteins. although it is a convenient and cost effective way to evaluate protein expression level differences between two conditions, fold change alone is not a statistical test that can indicate the level of confidence in differential expression of proteins.

rapid development of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  based proteomics has led to gradual replacement of the traditional 2d gel approach by the lc/ms approach. accordingly, variation and quality control of quantitation by lc/ms has been actively explored  <cit> . the importance of significance analysis for biomarker discovery has also been stressed  <cit> . molina et al. simultaneously measured three states of hela cells in response to stimuli using silac labeling for quantitation  <cit> . fold changes were evaluated at protein and peptide level by analysis of variance performed in the statistical program r. the authors demonstrated the capability of detecting  <dig> -fold change at a significance level of 95%. no significance score was assigned to individual proteins, however. piening et al. proposed mass deviance, a quality control metric, for assessing the accuracy of peptide detection in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . this approach was rigorous at validating peptide identification in lc/ms but not yet directly applicable for quantifying relative abundance. meng et al. used the differential mass spectrometry  method for label-free lc/ms profiling, demonstrating detection of peptides with a change as small as  <dig> -fold with ~20% relative errors in peptide relative abundance in a processed plasma background  <cit> . andreev et al. developed q-mend algorithm for label-free quantitation of relative protein abundances across multiple complex e. coli proteome samples, achieving 7% quantitation accuracy and mean precision of 15%  <cit> . wang et al. reported the algorithm quoil for label-free quantitation measurements across repeated lc/ms runs with student's t-test after applying the step-down adjustment of probability threshold  <cit> . most recently, reproducibility assessment of differential quantitation by silac, icat, and label-free methods was reported  <cit> . in this study, a ratio distribution analysis was applied to common peptides between samples to remove outliers until a normal distribution was obtained. using the filtered common peptides, it was assessed that 95% of the total common peptides have intensities within a ~2-fold change for a pair of cultures of t47d human breast cancer cells, with silac analysis having the best summary statistics. these conclusions were drawn from peptide-level quantitation in combination with a ratio distribution analysis. earlier efforts in statistical and computational methods for quantitative proteomics by lc/ms was reviewed by listgarten and emili  <cit> . these studies showed a great deal of efforts and progress in statistical analysis of lc/ms data in proteomics. currently, few have systematically assessed significance of analysis at a systems level along with estimation of false positive and negative rates.

in this work, we explore the use of the significance analysis of microarray  method  <cit>  for analysis of a two-sample significance problem in lc/ms quantitative proteomics. we used mycobacterium smegmatis cells grown at ph  <dig> and ph  <dig> in unlabeled media as the two-sample model. we also grew one 15n-labeled m. smegmatis cell culture and used it as the internal standard to normalize the protein abundance in the ph <dig> and ph <dig> unlabeled cells by the popular 14n/15n quantitation method  <cit> . cell protein extracts were first fractionated by sds/page. then a high resolution nanoliquid chromatography/linear ion trap-fourier transform mass spectrometry  system was used for peptide separation and identification. the lc/ms data was further quantified by the previously described algorithm  <cit> . we report the results of quantifying the protein relative abundance between the ph <dig> and ph <dig> unlabeled cells, with an emphasis on significance analysis of protein differential expression using the sam method in comparison with fold change and conventional t-test methods.

RESULTS
in this study, we report using the sam method to solve the two-sample significance analysis problem in lc/ms based quantitative proteomics. we compare the sam method with the conventional fold change test and t-tests.

sam was originally developed for microarray analysis by tusher et al.  <cit> . development of this method was initially propelled by the need to resolve the issue of multiplicity of testing in conventional t-tests when a large number of genes were studied simultaneously. as tusher et al. stated, "sam identifies genes with statistically significant changes in expression by assimilating a set of gene specific t-tests. each gene is assigned a score on the basis of its change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements for that gene. genes with scores greater than a threshold are deemed potentially significant with an assigned q-value." sam incorporated q-value as a measurement of the significance of a gene based on the work of storey  <cit> . each time when the threshold is adjusted, a false discovery rate is estimated for the resulting set of genes with significant differential expression. low-level data processing in the lc/ms measurements is typically very different from that in dna microarray experiments. however, at the higher level of protein differential expression determination, we treated the protein abundance data the same as the gene abundance data and used the sam method without modification.

for statistical analysis in this work, the ph <dig> and ph <dig> m. smegmatis cell cultures were grown in triplicate resulting in total  <dig> biological replicates. we also grew a 15n-labeled m. smegmatis culture and used it as the reference for normalizing the  <dig> unlabeled biological replicates. each of the  <dig> unlabeled biological replicates was first mixed with the 15n-labeled reference. it was then processed for protein quantitation by the widely used 14n/15n relative abundance measurement method  <cit> . after all  <dig> unlabeled biological replicates were normalized to the 15n-labeled reference, they were analyzed either by fold change test, t-test or the sam method.

in the following sections, we discuss the experimental layout of sample replicates, fold change analysis, random fluctuation of measurements, conventional t-tests, sam analysis, and differentially expressed proteins.

sample replicates
in dna microarray experiments, arrays are often spotted with gene probes in replicates. the typical practice is to average the replicates for each probe before assessing the differential expression of the gene. since the geometrical arrangement of gene probes on an array is known before an experiment, the replicates for a gene can be known a priori within an array and across multiple arrays. in proteomics, assignment and cross-reference of peptides and proteins across multiple lc/ms analysis is not as straightforward. in a typical lc/ms based proteomics experiment, a protein is digested with an enzyme into multiple peptides. the mixture of peptides from multiple proteins is injected into a lc/ms instrument for separation and peptide identification by ms/ms scan. protein relative abundance is assessed from the quantitation of one or more peptides originating from the protein. this process is analogous to the quantitation of genes based on multiple gene probes.

contrary to dna microarray experiments, one distinct characteristic of lc/ms based quantitative proteomics is that the number of peptides being quantified is usually not known a priori. there are different reasons for this. for example, if a peptide is highly hydrophobic or highly negatively charged, the chance of identifying this peptide by lc/ms is significantly reduced. there are also lc/ms instrument related considerations. a data-dependent acquisition algorithm is employed in most lc/ms instrument methods for peptide identification  <cit> . due to the limited speed with which a mass spec can acquire ms/ms spectra for peptide identification, only a limited number of precursor ions with the highest intensities in one ms scan will be selected for ms/ms identification. currently the sampling rate of a typical lc/ms instrument can easily be overwhelmed by the complexity of a protein sample. saturation of sampling a complex protein mixture requires more than just a few replicate runs. for this reason, a common way to increase the number of identified and quantified peptides for a sample is to pool the peptides identified by ms/ms from replicate runs of the same sample  <cit> .

callister et al.  <cit>  demonstrated an accurate mass and time tag  approach to overcome the above mentioned limitation. in this approach, the lc/ms scanning process is decoupled from the ms/ms peptide sequencing process. this is done by first accumulating enough ms/ms identification of peptides followed by high-throughput lc/ms analysis. this powerful amt approach skips the rate limiting ms/ms step. it thus avoids the random sampling effect of the ms/ms peptide identification process. however, successful application of this approach relies upon a database containing the amts accumulated from multiple lc/ms/ms runs. this requires precise control of the lc/ms/ms and lc/ms operation parameters to ensure the reliability of amts.

because the primary focus of this work was to compare several statistical significance analysis methods, we opted to take a straight-forward approach by only quantifying those peptides with confident ms/ms identification. these were the peptides assigned a probability of misidentification smaller than  <dig>  by the bioworks software based on a ms/ms spectrum database search. a probability of  <dig>  implies one misidentification out of  <dig> by chance. a peptide may be identified at different charge states typically ranging from + <dig> to + <dig>  the most often observed charge state is + <dig> or + <dig> in the nanolc/ltq-ftms system. bioworks assigns a probability for a peptide detected at each charge state. accordingly, a peptide detected at a particular charge state is called a peptide charge state   <cit> .

in this study, we grew the ph <dig> and ph <dig> unlabelled cell cultures in triplicate resulting in a total of  <dig> biological replicates. each biological replicate was mixed with the 15n-labeled reference sample prior to sds/page fractionation and lc/ms analysis. each biological replicate was analyzed by nanolc/ltq-ftms with triplicate runs. the pcs's with p <  <dig>  from the triplicate runs of a biological replicate were combined for calculating the protein and peptide relative abundance  <cit> . statistical analysis of relative abundance between the ph <dig> and ph <dig> unlabelled cells was performed for the proteins quantified in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> replicates. the  <dig> biological replicates were designated as ph5a, ph5b, ph5c, ph7a, ph7b, and ph7c . the average of the ph <dig> biological triplicates was named ph5av. similarly, the average of the ph <dig> biological triplicates was named ph7av.

in addition, we pooled the pcs's from the ph <dig> biological triplicates to calculate the protein relative abundance for the in silico pooled replicate for the ph <dig> cells, which we called ph5p. similarly, we also pooled the pcs's from the ph <dig> biological triplicates to calculate the protein relative abundance for ph7p, the in silico pooled replicate for the ph <dig> cells .

the protein mixture of each biological replicate was fractionated into  <dig> fractions by sds/page. only the center fraction was further processed for nanolc/ltq-ftms analysis. although it was desirable to analyze all the fractions in triplicate lc/ms analysis, we chose to only analyze the center fraction for each biological replicate for two reasons. first, focusing on one common fraction for all  <dig> biological replicates is sufficient for demonstrating the principle of statistical analysis we investigated in this work. second, we were conservative about the cost of analyzing all  <dig> fractions for all  <dig> replicates because it would have required  <dig> lc/ms runs lasting for more than  <dig> hrs. this estimation was based on  <dig> sds/page fractions per biological replicate, triplicate runs per sds/page fraction, and  <dig> min per run .

with only the center fraction analyzed, there were  <dig> proteins quantified in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> biological replicates of the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples . ninety were quantified in all  <dig> replicates, and  <dig> in  <dig> replicates. figure 1a shows the cv boxplots for these proteins in the  <dig> biological replicates and the  <dig> in silico pooled replicates. meanwhile, there were  <dig> proteins found in common between ph5p and ph7p. the cv boxplots for these  <dig> proteins are shown in figure 1b. the complete set of protein and peptide data for statistical significance analysis is summarized in table  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the protein relative abundance, standard deviation, number of unique peptides and number of pcs's for each protein in the sample replicates ph5a, ph5b, ph5c, ph7a, ph7b, ph7c, ph5p, and ph7p. results of the fold change test, the  <dig> t-tests, and the sam analysis to be described in a later section are shown to the right of table  <dig> 

fold change analysis
since ph5p and ph7p represent the average of both analytical and biological replicates for the ph <dig> and ph <dig> unlabeled culture samples respectively, we examine the number of differentially expressed proteins between the two samples by the fold change test. within this context, fold change refers to the ratio of relative abundance of a protein between the ph <dig> and ph <dig> unlabeled samples. it has a value greater than or equal to  <dig>  this definition is consistent with that of the sam.

based on the simple 2- and 3-fold change tests,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were respectively found to be differentially expressed between ph5p and ph7p . as discussed earlier, the fold change threshold alone is not a statistical test that can indicate the level of confidence about differentially expressed proteins. it does not reveal the random fluctuation inherent in protein differential expression levels. it would be of interest to test the level of such random fluctuation. as described below, we took a simple approach to test if random fluctuation was confined within a 2- or even 3-fold change boundary.

random fluctuation
to test random fluctuation, the number of quantified pcs's of a protein was plotted against the log ratio between the average of relative abundance of its biological triplicates  and the relative abundance of its in silico pooled replicate , as shown in figure  <dig>  in addition, the histogram for each sample was also plotted based on protein number and log <dig>  we reasoned that ph5av versus ph5p or ph7av versus ph7p represents a form of permutation for the biological triplicates of the ph <dig> or ph <dig> sample. the distribution of log <dig>  as summarized by the histograms, should therefore reveal some random errors in protein relative abundance quantitation. we chose the number of pcs's for plotting against log <dig> because it was interesting to examine the effect on random errors.

from figure  <dig>  it was noted that most of the proteins clustered within  <dig>  fold change, or ±  <dig>  on the log base  <dig> scale. the 95% interval was - <dig>  to  <dig>  for the ph <dig> sample  and - <dig>  to  <dig>  for the ph <dig> sample . there were  <dig> proteins in the ph <dig> sample and  <dig> in the ph <dig> sample falling outside the 2-fold boundary. there was  <dig> protein in the ph <dig> sample and  <dig> in the ph <dig> sample falling outside the 3-fold boundary. there were  <dig> proteins in the ph <dig> sample and  <dig> in the ph <dig> sample falling within the range of 2- to 3-fold change. there were  <dig> proteins in the ph <dig> sample and  <dig> in the ph <dig> sample falling within  <dig> - to 2-fold change range.

these results suggested that the random errors could occur outside a 2- or even 3-fold change boundary. in addition, the random errors shown in figure  <dig> were not limited to those proteins that had a very low number  of pcs's, even though the trend was that random errors mostly occurred below  <dig> pcs's for ph5av and ph7av or below  <dig> for ph5p and ph7p.

to evaluate the influence of random fluctuation on the confidence of measured protein differential expression, we performed  <dig> t-tests as described in the following. one t-test was based on peptide-level replicates. the other was based on protein-level replicates.

t-tests
in general, a t-test is used to evaluate whether the means of control and experiment groups are statistically different. the t-value is the ratio between the difference of group means and the variability of groups. the standard deviation of the t distribution is determined by the number of degrees of freedom derived from the sample sizes. the number of degrees of freedom need not be the same for the control and the experiment groups. for the same z score, a falling sample size will make the t distribution take on an increasingly larger standard deviation. increased standard deviation of the t distribution has the tendency to incur a higher false negative rate. on the other hand, a very large number of degrees of freedom may allow a higher false positive rate. in this analysis, the number of degrees of freedom may be very high for ph5p and ph7p for some proteins when it is based on the number of pcs's detected for each protein, i.e., peptide-level replicates. however, the number of degrees of freedom is no more than  <dig> when protein-level replicates are used. in either case, the t-tests do not require equal number of degrees of freedom between control and experiment.

for simplicity in describing proteins found to have statistically significant differential expression, the term "significant protein" is used hereafter with the meaning of "protein with significant differential expression".

t-test with peptide-level replicates
to test if the observed differential expression of these proteins was significant, a two-sample t-test assuming equal variances was performed on the  <dig> proteins using peptide-level relative abundance information. we adopted the t-test which was previously demonstrated by wu et al.  <cit>  in quantitative proteomic analysis of mammalian organisms. to compute the two-sample t-test, a pooled standard deviation was first calculated from the standard deviations of the protein relative abundance of the  <dig> samples. the pooled standard deviation was between the  <dig> standard deviations with greater weight given to the standard deviation of the sample with larger number of pcs's detected. the mathematical formula for the t-test was fully described by wu et al.  <cit> . since all of the pcs's were pooled to calculate the protein relative abundance in ph5p and ph7p, there was only one protein relative abundance value for each protein in ph5p or ph7p. the t-test for comparing ph5p and ph7p was thus performed using peptide-level replicates without protein-level replicates. this means that the number of degrees of freedom for measuring a protein was represented by multiple pcs measurements for that protein. this t-test with peptide-level replicates is different from that described later with protein-level replicates.

we used the volcano plot in figure  <dig> to visualize the proteins categorized as up- or down-regulated based on the simple 2- and 3-fold change thresholds, and to display their statistical significance based on the t-test with peptide-level replicates. in the volcano plot, the t-test p value was plotted against the relative abundance ratio between ph5p and ph7p on a logarithmic scale. the t-test rejected one of the proteins found upregulated in ph5p with greater than 3-fold change . this resulted in a total of  <dig> proteins having greater than 2-fold change with t-test significance . of these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> had fold change between  <dig> and  <dig> , and  <dig> had greater than a 3-fold change . of the remaining  <dig> proteins that had less than a 2-fold change,  <dig> were not significant , and  <dig> were significant .

t-test with protein-level replicates
the above t-test with peptide-level replicates utilized the pcs's of a protein quantified in ph5p and ph7p. each pcs should be an independent event for a protein. this assumption is complicated by several factors. in lc/ms based proteomic experiments, detection of a pcs depends not only on its concentration but also on the composition of the peptide mixture. ion suppression effect in electrospray ionization, space charge effect in ft mass spectrometer, lc column separation efficiency for complex samples, and data-dependant acquisition, etc., can directly or indirectly affect the quantitation of a pcs. therefore, a conventional t-test performed on such data requires cautious interpretation.

for comparison, we performed the second t-test at a protein level. this means that only protein relative abundance values were used without referring to the pcs information as for the t-test shown in figure  <dig>  basically, ph5a, ph5b, and ph5c represented the triplicates for the ph <dig> sample. ph7a, ph7b, and ph7c represent the triplicates for the ph <dig> sample. using the  <dig> sets of protein-level triplicates, we calculated their respective average ph5av and ph7av. to perform the t-test, the  <dig> sets of protein-level replicates were input as two arrays in the microsoft excel ttest function with option selection of two-sample equal variance, two-tailed, and type of homoscedastic.

there is an apparent discrepancy between the t-test results shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> based on respective peptide- and protein-level information. this suggests that we need a third method to examine whether the two conventional t-test methods are overly aggressive or conservative. to do so, we need to assess not only the individual protein significance but also the false positive and false negative rates for the group of proteins under significance testing. a similar issue has been extensively investigated in dna microarray data analysis. sam is one of the widely accepted methods for such analysis in dna microarray. in the following, we explore the applicability of the sam method towards our proteomics problem.

significance analysis with sam
as described earlier, sam is a statistical technique originally developed for finding genes with significant differential expression in a set of microarray experiments  <cit> . sam is capable of taking input from different response variables. for our proteomics problem of two-sample significance analysis between the ph <dig> and ph <dig> cell cultures, the response variable is equivalent to a grouping of untreated  and treated  samples . for each sample, at least two replicates are required by sam. using the protein-level replicates from the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples, sam calculates observed and expected scores for each protein. the observed score represents the relative difference of a protein between the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples. the expected score represents the random fluctuation when there is no difference between the two samples. when the difference between the observed and expected scores is beyond a certain threshold, the protein is called significant in differential expression.

to perform the sam analysis, the protein relative abundance data from the ph <dig> and ph <dig> biological triplicate samples were input as two-class unpaired response type into sam, with  <dig> permutations, t-statistic test, 1% fixed percentile for estimation of s <dig> factor for denominator, and k-nearest neighbors imputer as the imputation engine with  <dig> neighbors for filling missing values. due to the space limit here, we will not repeat further detail description of the sam software and its operation. the users guide and technical documents for sam are readily available elsewhere by chu et al.  <cit> . we will instead focus on the result output and interpretation of the method.

the observed score is the relative difference  <cit>  in protein expression. it is calculated by dividing the difference between protein relative abundances in the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples by the pooled standard error of repeated measurements of that protein in the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples  <cit> . the expected score is calculated using the large set of permutations of protein relative abundance data of the  <dig> biological replicates from the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples.

the observed score provides a control over random fluctuation, while the expected score allows assignment of statistical significance. the correlation of these two scores is used for identifying proteins with potentially significant differential expression as shown in figure  <dig>  if a protein has absolutely no differential expression, the observed relative difference would be the same as the random fluctuation that is represented by the expected score. the data point of such a protein in the sam plotsheet would fall on the 45° line through the origin. data points representing differentially expressed proteins will deviate from this 45° line. the point displacement of a protein from the 45° line through the origin is quantitatively measured by a Δ value in sam. proteins with Δ values beyond a certain threshold are called significant. the 45° upper and lower Δ lines indicate the boundary defined by a selected Δ value.

sam provides an estimation of false discovery rate  for the proteins called significant by each Δ value. a Δ value can be set together with a fold change threshold. fdr is calculated from the average number of falsely significant proteins in all the permutations divided by the number of proteins called significant above that Δ threshold.

combination of Δ =  <dig>  with 2-fold change reduces the number of significant proteins to  <dig> with a fdr of  <dig> % . when Δ =  <dig>  is used together with 3-fold change, the number of significant proteins are further reduced to  <dig>  with a fdr of  <dig> . when the 3-fold change criterion is used alone, there are  <dig> proteins called significant with a fdr of  <dig> % . the 13th protein  increases the total significant proteins determined by sam using the four different criteria to  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  for comparison, table  <dig> lists these  <dig> proteins with their analysis output by sam and the  <dig> conventional t-tests .

of the  <dig> proteins,  <dig> were found significant by the t-test  performed on the triplicates of the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples , and all were found significant by the t-test  performed on the in silico pooled replicates of the ph <dig> and ph <dig> samples . of the  <dig> proteins with greater than 3-fold change in table  <dig>  only  <dig> were found significant by the t-test shown in figure  <dig>  it is noted that there are  <dig> proteins with greater than 3-fold change shown in figure  <dig>  this extra 14th protein  with greater than 3-fold change in figure  <dig> has a significant fold change of  <dig>  calculated by sam after imputation. this protein was not found significant under the t-test in figure  <dig>  even though it showed a fold change of  <dig>  in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig> proteins analyzed by sam,  <dig> are called significant by the t-test  shown in figure  <dig>  whereas only  <dig> are called significant by sam with Δ =  <dig>  cutoff which controls false positive rate at 5% and fdr at  <dig> %. therefore, the t-test for the in silico pooled replicates ph5p and ph7p shown in figure  <dig> is overly aggressive while the t-test in figure  <dig> appears to be overly conservative. these results indicate that sam provides more reasonable results. the resampling approach used by sam appears to overcome the false positives one encounters using the peptide-based t-test while allowing for identification of a greater number of differentially expressed proteins than the protein-based t-test.

most importantly, for each significant protein, sam assigns a q-value that represents the minimum fdr of the list of proteins having Δ values and/or fold changes equal to or greater than that at which the protein is called significant in differential expression. therefore, q-value quantitatively measures how significantly the protein is differentially expressed. this is the lowest fdr at which the protein is called significant  <cit> . as further explained by chu et al.  <cit> , it is like the familiar 'p-value' but adapted to the analysis of a large number of genes. in other words, it is the p-value at which proteins with Δ values and/or fold changes smaller than the significant threshold are actually differentially expressed. the q-values for proteins called significant under different Δ and/or fold change criteria are presented in table  <dig> in comparison with conventional t-tests.

thirty-four  of the  <dig> proteins called significant with the Δ =  <dig>  threshold have fold change between  <dig>  and  <dig> . of these  <dig> proteins,  <dig>  have a q-value greater than 5%. for the  <dig>  proteins with greater than 2-fold change,  <dig>  have a q-value greater than 5% . this illustrates that q-value properly predicts the significance of protein differential expression. while conventional t-tests provide an estimation of probability for individual proteins, the distribution of errors is not known.

combination of Δ =  <dig>  and 2-fold change results in  <dig> significant proteins, of which  <dig> have a q-value of  <dig> and  <dig> have a q-value between  <dig>  and  <dig> . combination of Δ =  <dig>  and 3-fold change results in  <dig> significant proteins all of which have a q-value of  <dig>  using the 3-fold change criterion alone generates  <dig> significant proteins that include the  <dig> proteins called significant by Δ =  <dig>  and 3-fold change. the 13th additional protein  has a q-value of  <dig> %. the other  <dig> proteins all have a q-value of  <dig>  sam predicts that  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins  would be a false positive. since msmeg <dig> has the lowest observed score d =  <dig>  and a q-value of  <dig> %, by definition, msmeg <dig> is the one most likely to be falsely called significant by the 3-fold change criterion. the t-test performed in figure  <dig> identifies this protein as significant with a p value of  <dig>  × e- <dig> which is not the lowest among the proteins with greater than 3-fold change . msmeg <dig> was originally annotated as nitrite reductase , but is recently re-annotated as sulfite reductase   <cit> . sira is essential for growth of mycobacteria on sulfite or sulfate as the sole sulfur source. it does not appear to have an apparent role in acid stress response.

sam also generates a miss rate table for each Δ and/or fold change threshold. the miss rate is equivalent to a false negative rate for the proteins that are between specified score cut points and do not make the list of significant proteins. the contents of the miss rate tables for the four conditions shown in figure  <dig> are presented graphically in figure  <dig>  the general feature is that the proteins in the  <dig> – <dig>  quantile range tend to have the lower miss rate, and the proteins at the two tails tend to have a higher miss rate. this is totally as expected. comparison of panels a and b does not reveal apparent difference in the overall miss rates, suggesting that a combination of Δ =  <dig>  and 2-fold change can reduce fdr without increasing miss rates compared to either Δ =  <dig>  or 2-fold change alone. thus, this combination is a more optimum criterion. panel c shows increase in miss rates. this is expected when the 3-fold change threshold is applied in combination with Δ =  <dig> . when only the 3-fold change threshold is used, the overall miss rate decreases . the miss rate for the upregulated proteins decreases more than those for the downregulated ones. this suggests the 3-fold change threshold does not work equally for the up- and down-regulated proteins. this may be because fold change cutoff alone assumes a normal distribution, while sam does not impose this restriction. asymmetrical cutoff is preferred because the observed scores for up- and down-regulated proteins may behave differently in some biological experiments  <cit> . the samples analyzed in this study appear to be such a case.

differentially expressed proteins
by the 2-fold cutoff and fdr of  <dig> % with Δ =  <dig>  , sam found  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed proteins in the ph <dig> versus the ph <dig> samples . there were more repressed than induced proteins. this trend was similar to that observed in a microarray study of  <dig> min acid shocked m. tuberculosis by fisher et al.  <cit> , in which  <dig> genes were found induced while  <dig> were found repressed by sam with a  <dig>  fold cutoff and  <dig> % fdr. similarly, more genes were also repressed than induced when shewanella oneidensis was exposed to acidic ph  <cit> .

of the  <dig> induced proteins,  <dig>  are involved in purine ribonucleotide biosynthesis,  <dig>  in energy metabolism,  <dig>  in fatty acid and phospholipid degradation,  <dig>  in glutamyl-trna aminoacylation, and  <dig>  in protein degradation. inosine-5-monophosphate  dehydrogenase  is an important enzyme involved in guanine nucleotide synthesis, catalyzing the oxidation of imp to xanthosine 5'-monophosphate with the concomitant reduction of nad to nadh. the enzyme was identified as a dna binding protein  <cit> . it has been reported that protein guab was induced by acid in e. coli k- <dig>  <cit> , consistent with our result here that guab was induced in m. smegmatis grown at ph  <dig> 

genome analysis of mycobacteria has revealed an array of genes involved in lipid metabolism  <cit> . it has been suggested that mycobacteria grown in vivo are largely lipolytic rather than lipogenic due to the variety and quantity of lipids available within mammalian cells and the tubercle  <cit> . the acidic growth condition probably triggers induction of fatty acid degradation related proteins such as msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig>  even though there was no fatty acid supplied in the growth media for m. smegmatis in this study.

cytosolic protein degradation is central to regulating various aspects of cell biology, including stress response  <cit> . proteins targeted for degradation are unfolded and cleaved to release large peptides in an atp-dependant manner. these peptides are further cleaved or degraded by endopeptidases such as aminopeptidases in an atp-independent manner. this general scheme of cytosolic protein degradation is conserved in all organisms. while most of the enzymes involved in the upstream atp-dependant proteolysis are more organism-specific, the enzymes involved in the downstream atp-independent proteolysis, including leucine aminopeptidase , are present in most organisms. induction of cytosol aminopeptidase  in ph <dig> grown m. smegmatis is consistent with the putative function of pepa in stress response.

of the  <dig> repressed proteins,  <dig>  have roles in biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups, and carriers. one  is an enzyme involved in central intermediary metabolism. the remaining  <dig> proteins are involved in energy metabolism including the atp synthase f <dig> beta subunit . decrease in atp synthesis and downshift of metabolism is commonly observed in cells under stressful conditions.

schnappinger et al. used sam as the significance analysis program for transcriptional analysis of adaptation by m. tuberculosis in phagosomal environment  <cit> . the results indicated that all the seven atp synthase subunit genes  were repressed for intraphagosomal m. tuberculosis, consistent with the stressful condition within phagosomes. similarly, in a gene expression analysis of corynebacterium glutamicum in response to acid adaptation at ph  <dig> , the seven f0f1-type atp synthase subunits  were repressed  <cit> . in our recent study of protein turnover in m. smegmatis  <cit> , atpd was found to have lower protein turnover when logarithmically growing cells were shifted to acidic  or low iron medium, suggesting downregulation of atpd under both stress conditions. this result further supports our finding here that atpd was repressed in ph <dig> grown m. smegmatis cells. since only  <dig> of the  <dig> sds/page fractions was analyzed in this study, it is reasonable to expect that other atp synthase subunits could be found repressed as well if all the sds/page fractions were analyzed  <cit> . this expectation is based on the transcriptional analysis of m. tuberculosis and c. glutamicum under stress  <cit> , as well as our work on protein turnover analysis of m. smegmatis in which three detected atp synthase subunits  had lower protein turnover when the m. smegmatis cells encountered an acidic or low iron condition  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the sam method for dna microarray data analysis can be adapted for significance analysis in lc/ms based quantitative proteomics. sam assigns a significance value, a false discovery rate, and a miss rate for differential expression of individual proteins and groups called significant or insignificant. such information is not readily available by conventional t-test or fold change test alone. the sam method provides richer information and is more adaptive to different biological experiments that may have asymmetrical distribution of differential protein expression profiles.

one limitation of applying the sam method for quantitative proteomics is that it requires sample replicates. such data sets require more effort to obtain them in proteomics than in microarray analysis due to the limited ms/ms sampling speed in lc/ms analysis. in this work, we performed multiple runs for each biological replicate to cover as many proteins as possible so that enough proteins were commonly quantified between replicates. in on-going work, we will incorporate the cross-reference method that has already been developed by other research groups to align peptides between runs based on accurate mass and elution time information  <cit> . this will allow a peptide identified by ms/ms scan in one run to also be quantified in another run, even if the peptide is missed by ms/ms scan in the other run. implementation of this cross-reference method will also make it possible to perform time course study using sam  <cit> . storey et al. showed that "an actual time course analysis offers a sizable increase in statistical power over a static design analysis"  <cit> . measuring differential expression over time with single sampling at each time point will likely be a more sensitive study design than a typical static design even if replicates are sampled at the single time point. once the issue of protein cross-reference between samples is addressed for quantitation of lc/ms data, it is more desirable to perform a time course study for quantitative proteomics than a single time point design with replicates. sam is a suitable statistical analysis software for such a time course study  <cit> .
