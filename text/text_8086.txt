BACKGROUND
endogenous feline leukemia virus  sequences are found in the genomes of domestic cats  and related wild cat species  <cit> . these endogenous provirus sequences are transmitted vertically through the germ line and exhibit high similarity to exogenous feline leukemia virus  species, which are part of the genus of gammaretroviruses  <cit> . exfelv are enveloped viruses with an rna genome. the viral genome is composed of two single-stranded positive-sense messenger rna  chains inside a viral particle. before replication, the viral genome is converted to dna and then integrated into the host genome. the genome contains three viral genes necessary for replication, in the following order: 5′-gag-pol-env-3′  <cit> . on both ends of the viral genome, there are ltr , which contain regulatory sequences. although, transcription and translation of enfelv proviruses were detected in various tissues and cell lines, no infectious viruses are produced, due to mutations within essential parts of the viral genome  <cit> . however, recombination between enfelv sequences with exfelvs can generate infectious virus particles  <cit> .

exfelv infection has been associated with the emergence of lymphomas in cats. infected cats have a higher risk for tumor development compared to uninfected  <cit> . since exfelv  is capable of integrating its viral sequences into the host cell’s genome, insertional mutagenesis and subsequent activation of cellular oncogenes by regulatory elements on the viral ltr region is one possible mechanism responsible for malignant transformation by exfelv  <cit> . another potential tumorigenic effect of the virus would be the persistent stimulation of immune cells by viral antigens bringing them at risk for transformation  <cit> . due to the implementation of vaccination and elimination programs against exfelv, the infections rates are decreasing in some regions of the world  <cit> , while in other regions the prevalence of the virus remains high  <cit> . however, recent data suggest that increasing numbers of lymphomas are found among virus-negative cats  <cit> . the transcription of enfelv has been observed in feline lymphomas  <cit> , but it is still unclear if enfelv could be another cause of malignant transformation.

in this study, we examine the potential influence of felv expression in cats that have developed lymphomas and discuss the possible mechanisms that could have induced malignant transformation. to achieve that, we first sought to confirm the absence of exfelv, which would allow an independent evaluation of the effects of enfelv expression. we then investigated the difference in enfelv expression between two conditions: non-malignant lymph nodes  and feline intestinal lymphoma tissues . here we applied two methods to determine the transcription of exfelv and enfelv: next-generation rna-sequencing   <cit>  and for validation -reverse transcription quantitative pcr   <cit> . previous studies have measured the expression of felv using rt-qpcr  <cit> . this study presents the first investigation of the expression of felv for domesticated cats using next-generation sequencing technologies. using rna-seq, it is possible to analyze the transcriptome at a higher resolution, with a larger dynamic range  <cit> .

RESULTS
no exfelv expression detectable by rna-seq and rt-qpcr
the transcriptomes from three control and five tumor cat samples were sequenced. the mean number of sequenced reads in the control samples was  <dig>  million, and in the tumor samples was  <dig>  million . we mapped the reads to the reference genomes of both enfelv and exfelv . as a pairwise sequence alignment reported that the analyzed strains of enfelv and exfelv are  <dig> % identical, we counted only the reads mapped to virus specific parts of u <dig> regions in the ltr  to estimate the enfelv or exfelv specific expression strength. these virus specific regions were suggested by tandon et al.  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the raw number of mapped reads  to virus specific regions. in control samples, on average  <dig>  reads mapped to the enfelv specific region  and in tumor samples, on average  <dig>  reads mapped to the same region. in contrast, no reads mapped to the exfelv specific region  in both conditions, indicating that the samples contained only enfelv viral rna.figure  <dig>

we next used rt-qpcr to confirm the results obtained by rna-seq. the tissue samples were investigated for felv rna using the previously illustrated virus specific regions as rt-qpcr probes. table  <dig> summarizes the individual results. we detected no exfelv probe copies among all tested samples, while on average  <dig>  ×  <dig> standardized enfelv probe copies were detected in the control samples vs.  <dig>  ×  <dig> that were found in the tumor samples .

decreased enfelv expression levels in tumor compared to control samples
we investigated the expression level of the three enfelv genes  for control and tumor samples using rna-seq. table  <dig> shows the standardized number of mapped reads. on average,  <dig>  × 10− <dig> standardized reads mapped to the gag gene in the control samples, whereas  <dig>  × 10− <dig> standardized reads mapped to the same gene in tumor condition. thus, a  <dig> -fold decrease of gag expression was observed in tumor samples. we obtained similar results with the pol and env genes. on average  <dig>  × 10− <dig> standardized reads mapped to the pol gene in control and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> mapped to the pol gene in tumor condition, indicating a  <dig> -fold decrease of pol gene expression in tumor samples. as for the mapping to env gene, we found that in the control condition on average  <dig>  × 10− <dig> standardized reads mapped, while on average  <dig>  × 10− <dig> standardized reads mapped to the env gene in tumor samples, representing a  <dig> -fold decrease of env expression in tumor compared to control.table  <dig>

to test if the expression of each enfelv gene is significantly different in control compared to tumor condition, we performed three two-sided mann–whitney u tests . for the pol and env genes, tests did not show a significant difference  in the expression between control and tumor samples. for the env gene we observed a significant difference in expression  between the two conditions, towards the control condition. the fold change and the performed tests clearly show that there was no increase in expression in the tumor samples.

we then performed rt-qpcr targeting the enfelv specific u <dig> region to confirm the findings from rna-seq. the amounts of rt-qpcr detected viral rna were standardized by the copy numbers of feline gapdh, which was used as a reference gene for total rna levels . within all tumor samples, enfelv rna copies per  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of gapdh were found to be lower in comparison to the control samples. when compared to the average enfelv expression level of control samples, the mean enfelv expression level in the tumor samples was decreased  <dig> -fold. applying a two-sided mann–whitney u test , we determined that there was no significant  difference in the standardized copy numbers of rna detected from the enfelv specific u <dig> region between control and tumor conditions.

discussion
investigation of exfelv infection
rna-seq analysis showed that there were no reads mapped to the exfelv specific regions. no evidence of infection with exfelv was confirmed by rt-qpcr. additionally, no exfelv antigen could be detected by a commercial exfelv elisa test .

enfelv transcriptome: control vs. tumor samples
as infections with exfelv could not be detected among the here tested cats, transcription of the enfelv in the investigated animals was not affected by interactions with exfelv, and should have allowed a valid comparison of enfelv expression levels between tumor and control tissues.

by the means of rna-seq:  <dig> -fold less viral reads were detected among the tumors compared to control samples. confirmation of these findings was done by rt-qpcr, where similar values were obtained: the mean enfelv copies per  <dig> x <dig> gapdh for all tumor samples turned out to be  <dig> -fold lower compared to the mean value of the control samples. it should be noted that the acquired enfelv expression levels from rna-seq were based on the expression of three enfelv genes while, in contrast, rt-qpcr targeted only the viral u <dig> region. mann–whitney u tests on enfelv gene counts showed that enfelv genes transcription in tumor samples was not elevated compared to control tissues, which seems contradictory to observations for the exogenous virus, since a previous study found higher exfelv viral loads in lymphomas compared to non-malignant tissues  <cit> . as the exfelv env gene is supposed to have immunosuppressive properties, the increased viral env transcription could possibly prime the development and progression of malignancies  <cit> . in contrast to the exfelv, our results demonstrate that enfelv expression levels are not higher on average among all the investigated tumor samples compared to the control tissues. these findings can at least be applied for the here examined exfelv negative tumors. nevertheless, one must also take into consideration that a reason for a decreased expression of enfelv in tumor samples could be the increased transcription of certain cellular transcripts , which could lead to the observed decreased proportion of the other mrna species, including the amount of enfelv. that would have to be tested by future studies.

in summary, no exfelv sequences could be detected in the analyzed samples. although, increased expression of endogenous retroviruses  has been observed in feline lymphomas  <cit> , our data suggest no general increase in the enfelv transcription levels in lymphoma compared to non-malignant lymphatic tissues. a recent publication investigating human hodgkin’s lymphoma cells  <cit>  found similar observation of no increase in erv expression in lymphoma cells compared to normal blood cells. we speculate that the potential impact of enfelv on the formation of lymphomas seems to be distinct from the exogenous virus. thus, possible effects of enfelv on lymphoma development are presumably not due to immunosuppression induced by the expression of viral genes. for enfelv, high levels of insertional polymorphism have been already described in cats  <cit> . that led us to believe that insertional mutagenesis of cellular genes by proviral sequences may be a more important mechanism responsible for malignant transformation than viral gene expression induced immunosuppression. however, more data are required to conclusively show that, since other transponsable elements might also play a role in the malignant transformation.

CONCLUSIONS
we show no expression of exfelv in all analyzed samples. on the contrary, a clear signal indicates the expression of enfelv in all investigated samples, with no significant increase in enfelv expression detected in tumor samples compared to control samples. this indicates that the potential tumorogenesis caused by feline endogenous retroviruses cannot be well explained by an immunosuppression mechanism. further work is necessary to investigate how tumorogenesis in this case occurs.
