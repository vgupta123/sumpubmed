BACKGROUND
according to chargaff's second parity rule, the two complementary nucleotides will have similar frequencies in complete single stranded dna   <cit> . however, local violations of this parity rule have been observed in all known organisms and in bacteria  <cit> . thus at skew / and cg skew / can vary wildly in local genome scales. the base skews have been found closely related to genome function domains, such as the origin of replication, gene distribution, transcription and replication direction in bacteria  <cit> , plants  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . an intriguing question is, do the two nucleotide skews  correlate with each other? actually, the at and cg skew are often discussed simultaneously  <cit> . correlations between at and cg skews in bacterial genomes and in organellar genomes are also mentioned in several reports  <cit> . touchon et al. found that ta and gc skews in the coding strand for intronic regions  in human are correlated, and the correlation value is around  <dig>   <cit> . thus studying the relation between the at/cg skews is equally important as the variability in the two skews, and both may have evolutionary meaning for genome composition. the correlations between at skew and cg skew in higher organisms were generally studied in sets of segments in coding regions or noncoding regions, such as introns and some repeat elements which represent selected or neutral mutations, respectively  <cit> . such studies have focused more on mutation mechanisms  <cit> . however, the skew correlations have seldom been considered in whole genome or chromosome scale.

in earlier research, cg-skews have normally been analyzed by using cumulative skew diagrams  <cit> . recently, at and cg skews were analyzed simultaneously by touchon et al  <cit> , who calculated cumulative total skew as sum of at and cg skews over  <dig> kb non-overlapping windows, enabling prediction of replication origins in mammalian genomes. software for visualization of gc skew for circular bacterial genomes has been developed  <cit> . another similar package is genome diagram  <cit> , but methods for larger genomes are needed. we developed a new method enabling handy large-scale visualization and analysis of at and cg skews for whole genomes and large eukaryotic chromosomes, which is very informative. this new method of 2-d color visualization can represent at skew and cg skew of all segments up to total length or multiple of 1/ <dig> of the whole genome in a single figure. we call the tool base skew double triangle . after drawing bsdt images of eukaryotic chromosomes, we found that for chicken and other bird chromosomes, the correlations between the two skews show up very clearly and are also quantitatively very high , while such high values are not reached in chromosomes of any other eukaryote species. we then used further two quantitative methods and different window steps to validate these correlations.

compared to mammals, chicken/bird genomes have more compact structure, with higher gene density, fewer repeat sequences and specific base skew structure  <cit> . masking out repetitive sequences prior to analysis from all genomes showed that the level of skew correlation is still higher in birds. we think this has some biological and evolutionary meaning, still to be unraveled. from the increase in correlation values after masking repeats, it seems to be a feature related to evolution of the non-repeat component of the genomes. our 2-d visualization method is considered to be useful in the study and comparison of nucleotide skews at different scales in various genomes in understanding this phenomenon and its evolution in the phylogenetic tree.

RESULTS
bsdts for eukaryote chromosomes
our new 2-d color visualization representing at and cg skews was used, as described in methods, to draw the bsdt pictures  for  <dig> chromosomes of  <dig> fully sequenced species and two bird species for which extensive genomic scaffold sequences were available. all the bsdt pictures can be found at our website, under link of bsdt examples <cit> . visual inspection already shows that the bird chromosomes have the most symmetrical bsdts, even at large scale. the symmetry phenomenon suggests that there is a high correlation between at and cg skew in chicken and other birds when overlapping windows are used to slide through the whole dna sequence. the visual symmetry was validated by three quantitative calculations of correlations.

cncl – a quantitative index of skew correlation
constant number correlation level  was defined to depict the symmetry degree of bsdts  by calculating correlation of the two base skews at many scales. the degree of the correlation between at and cg skews was quantitatively validated by the calculation of cncl using overlapping windows. two indexes are important for this definition. first, each dna sequence is divided into  <dig> equal segments ; all analysis for cncl of bsdt pictures is based on this division. secondly, the step length of overlapping sliding windows is expressed by parameter β.

we calculated the cncl values for all genome data in table  <dig> for β =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> by equation . figure  <dig> shows the cncl values for  <dig> datasets with the highest correlations, using β =  <dig>  it is remarkable, that chicken chromosomes and the pooled genomic scaffold sequences of two bird species have clearly the highest correlation level by cncl value ordering. the calculated values can be seen in table  <dig>

*start and end means the range of correlation, the number in table means how many chromosomes/scaffolds have at/cg skew correlation number between start and end. for example, there are  <dig> chicken chromosomes having at/cg skew correlation between  <dig>  and  <dig> . we can see in this table that birds have higher skew correlation, and no other species reach this level of correlation.

**cncl distribution of the  <dig> random sequences. detailed cncl data of these random sequences are listed in supplemental materials   <cit> .

we also find that, for other vertebrates, a high correlation level is not common, though most vertebrates tend to have higher positive correlations than other lower eukaryotes. in table  <dig>  we list the distribution of cncl for all sequenced eukaryotes. most opossum chromosomes have unexpectedly negative cncl, as do pufferfish chromosomes. nematode has a relatively high negative correlation between at and cg skews. in a control test,  <dig> =  <dig> ×  <dig> ×  <dig> cncls of random sequences are calculated, with length of  <dig> mb,  <dig> mb,  <dig> mb,  <dig> mb,  <dig> mb  and gc percent of 35%, 36%~50%  and  <dig> repeats for each combination of length scale and gc percent, as listed in table  <dig> and details supplied in supplemental file . in all the random control sequences,  <dig> % of the |cncl| values are under  <dig> ,  <dig> % |cncl| <  <dig> , 79% |cncl| <  <dig> ,  <dig> % |cncl| <  <dig> , and  <dig> % |cncl| <  <dig> . compared to the random controls, only warmblooded animal cncls can be far from randomness but not for all their chromosomes. chicken and other birds are the only species in which correlation can reach  <dig>   and the exceptions are all chicken microchromosomes.

for all conceivable combinations of all species , and all chromosomes, β <dig> =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  β <dig> =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and n =  <dig> ~  <dig>   <dig> ~ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  thus our conclusion is that for calculation of cncl in any scale, chicken chromosomes consistently display distinctly higher correlation compared to other eukaryotes. here, the segmentation to  <dig> parts is only a choice for visual convenience. bsdt is a useful visual observation method, by which we can easily see which genome areas are of interest in terms of skew correlations.

cwcl – a generalization of cncl
it could be thought that the skew correlations might not represent a common measurement scale, because the dna sequences are not of same size, because all are divided into  <dig> segments. for this reason, we define a new value cwcl , which does not limit the number of windows to  <dig>  but limits the window length. in other words, window number for a constant window length replaces  <dig>  this way we can compare the different genomes in the same scale. the advantage of cwcl is that any two cwcl can be compared in the same scale, though it is not visualized in a common scale square.

we have calculated this standardized scale cwclβspecies−chr*

wl is the window length and β has the same meaning as in equation  <dig> for cncl. the number in table means how many chicken chromosomes have top-ranked at/cg skew correlation among all data in table  <dig> with parameter combination of window length and β. for example, when window length is  <dig> k and β =  <dig>   <dig> chicken chromosomes have top-ranked correlation values when comparing all chromosomes in table  <dig> 

non-overlapping windows based calculation
intuition and general knowledge suggests that symmetrical phenomena should happen in comparatively large scale, but in small scale, random fluctuations should be dominant. the question is from what scale the chicken/bird genome begins to exhibit its high correlation between skews, or in other words, how its variation changes with the increase of scale. figure 3a–c shows the relationships between window-sizes and correlation values, using non-overlapping windows. all chromosomes of chicken are drawn in green, for easy comparison with human in red and dog in blue.

it is obvious from figure 3a that for most chicken chromosomes, the correlation between at and cg skew rapidly increases to a high level , the exceptions being the microchromosomes. for all human and dog chromosomes, none can reach correlation level of  <dig> , even at the scale of  <dig> kb, at the right end of figure 3a. we can also see that dog has slightly higher correlation level than human, as already seen in the previous analysis of cncl and cwcl. this seems a species-specific difference. a very interesting phenomenon is that all chicken chromosomes begin at positive correlation level, and all chromosomes of human and dog at negative correlation level at small window sizes. also, some chromosomes in all species differ significantly from the species specific trend .

when we eliminated the repeat sequences from the three animal genomes using the standard repeat-masked sequences from the public databases , the correlations clearly increase in human and dog, and slightly also in chicken, although they already were at a very high level . this made both dog and human skew correlation levels more similar to each other and closer to that of birds. however, bird chromosome value correlations still stand clearly apart, suggesting that other factors in addition to repeats are responsible for the special characteristic of skew correlation in birds. we also eliminated the intergenic sequences from the three animal genomes using the genescan gene data in ucsc . we only see slight differences between figure 3c and figure 3a, but the change is far from that which occurred when masked the repeat sequences. this indicates that the skew correlation in the gene related regions is not significantly different from that in the whole genome.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we introduced a new visualization method of bsdt to display the changing rules of at and cg skews in the genome. the visual symmetry in bsdt means high correlation level between at and cg skews, and high visual symmetry in large scale appeared only in the bsdts of bird chromosomes. this indicates bird genomes have a very special compositional structure in base skew compared to other species. we validated this estimation by other two quantitative methods, confirming that only bird genomes can reach a high correlation level . other species, such as dog, horse and human can also reach a relatively high level , far from random sequence expectation. however, such high correlations do not appear in rodents and fishes, especially, opossum has an unexpected and unexplained negative correlation. we think this phenomenon is intriguing evolutionarily. three questions arise: 1) when did this high correlation appear in the vertebrate phylogeny tree? 2) have birds increased this symmetry due to some evolutionary pressure or have other species lost it ? 3) why there are so clear species-specific differences, even within mammals? the high correlation between at and cg skews is likely to be prevalent in other bird genomes as well, as zebrafinch and turkey genome data showed a very similar picture. the details of the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of this correlation awaits access to more genomic data from further species of birds, mammals and primitive vertebrates, like reptiles.

when the skew correlation is higher than  <dig> , we can nearly say that the at and cg skews change concomitantly. most chicken larger chromosomes can reach this level at large scale, and for other animals, we can only say they also have tendency to increase in larger scale. the base skew correlation is only a mathematical concept, but when it is far from random state, it must have a biological explanation to maintain it. there are so many vertebrate branches, but why this phenomenon occurred only in the few branches in birds? we have analyzed current genome data, from birds, canines, ungulates, primates, rodents, fishes and marsupials. it is unknown whether the high correlation occurred early, vanishing in marsupials, or whether it occurred reappeared in canines, ungulates, primates etc. at a relatively high level. we need to search for the common ancestor for the high skew correlation state.

it is difficult to judge when birds might have gained such high base skew correlation, either before or after the separation between mammals and birds. new primitive mammal, marsupial, reptile and amphibian data might clarify this. while waiting for such data, we can study further the role of repeat sequences, as well as the history of newly inserted sequences in the evolution process  <cit> . it could be that the high correlation phenomenon occurred very early in the vertebrate phylogeny tree, at least before the separating point of bird and mammal, and then was lost to some extent in mammals. alternatively, this trait appeared separately in birds and mammals and was strengthened further in the bird branch. we favor the first alternative.

we may need to improve the methods of finding and masking repeat sequences for robust analysis of data from reptiles and common ancestors of mammals and birds. it seems a small number of large-scale recombination events cannot cause an extensive change in skew correlation. point mutations also cannot be the main reason, since it is a relatively short time for this change in vertebrate phylogeny tree, but mutations maybe a contributing factor. we assume the main reason that most mammals lost the correlation to some extent was numerous random insertions of small sequences with a high difference in at and cg skew. such events could involve interspersed repeats, tandem repeats, transposable elements, etc. if we can eliminate such repeats in mammal in a clean manner, mammals may show even higher at/cg skew correlation, then being more similar to the ancestral genome. these repeats have changed during evolution, and were perhaps not captured well enough by the repeat masking procedure used in the public domain databases, from which we retrieved our repeat masked data.

as we know, avian genomes are commonly smaller and have fewer repetitive elements than other amniotes and that seems a key adaptation for flight  <cit> . we can also imagine, for the same goal of extremely efficient cell metabolism, birds may adopt a highly organized compositional genome structure, including or reflected in high at and cg skew correlation. we expect this history to be unraveled soon after more complete genomes are published. it is unknown what possible advantages does the similar at and cg skew give to the species to manage their genetic information, but it may involve having genes with similar constitution near each other for easier global control mechanisms.
