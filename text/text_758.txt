BACKGROUND
y chromosomes are widespread in plants and animals and are directly involved with important biological phenomena, such as sex-determination and male fertility  <cit> . the y chromosome is heterochromatic in most species, hindering the identification of y-linked sequences in many genome projects . the best known y chromosomes are the mammalian  and the fruit fly  chromosomes, in which a vast investment of time and resources resulted in a fairly accurate knowledge of their gene content . most genome projects rely on the whole genome shotgun approach  in which euchromatic portions of the genome are assembled in large  scaffolds, while heterochromatic regions are scattered in small unmapped scaffolds  <cit> . heterochromatic genes suffer with this assembly problem and in most cases their exons are assembled in separate scaffolds  <cit> .

a successful approach to find y-linked genes using a combination of computational and experimental methods was demonstrated by carvalho and coworkers  <cit> . however, the process was labor intensive and new approaches have been proposed to improve the identification of y-linked sequences. recently, two independent studies showed that shallow sequencing of males and female can be used to identify y-linked sequences in previously assembled genomes. in the first study, hall and co-workers did illumina sequencing of male and female dna and were able to identify six novel y-linked genes in anopheles mosquitoes  <cit>  . in the second study, carvalho and clark  <cit>  sequenced female dna and used it to find male specific sequences in the assembled genomes of drosophila virilis and human. they were able to identify four new y-linked genes in the drosophila virilis genome and 300 kb of previously unidentified sequences in the human y chromosome. arguably the most direct and simplest method would be to sequence male and female dna libraries separately; sequences assembled only with male reads are likely to be part of the y chromosome. this method was proposed by krzywinski and coworkers  <cit> ; its main limitation being that its use must be decided prior to the start of the sequencing which may be problematic since y chromosome and other hetrochromatic regions are not the main target of most genome sequencing projects. one of the goals of the rhodnius genome project was to identify y-linked genes, so from the begining it employed separate male and female libraries.

the triatomine rhodnius prolixus  is a major vector of chagas’ disease, a serious human tropical neglected disease present in latin america  <cit> , caused by the unicellular parasite trypanosoma cruzi. these insects have holocentric chromosomes characterized by the presence of a diffuse or non-localized centromere  <cit> . in spite of its biological importance, triatomine genetic studies are mostly limited to karyotyping. the number of sex-chromosomes and autosomes varies among triatomine species; the number autosomes  varies from  <dig> to  <dig> , and the number of x chromosomes ranging from xy to xxxy  <cit> . r. prolixus has  <dig> autosomes, a xy chromosome system and very little else is known about its chromosomes and sex-determination . it was found that rhodnius c-bands are minute, suggesting that heterochromatin is not a major component of this insect genome  <cit> . however, the r. prolixus y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic  <cit> . the genome of r. prolixus was assembled from reads produced from separate male and female dna libraries  <cit>  as initially proposed by krzywinski and coworkers  <cit> . using the assembly information, we identified scaffolds assembled exclusively with male reads as y candidates. therefore, in this study we report the identification of the first nine new y-linked genes in the r. prolixus genome. we also identified other  <dig> y-linked sequences which may now be used as y chromosome specific pcr markers. further studies of the function of r. prolixus y-linked genes may help in the understanding of the y-chromosome evolution, its role in sex determination, reproductive behavior and male fertility.

RESULTS
the rhodnius prolixus genome data and identification of y-linked candidates
for the r. prolixus genome project, male and female dna were sequenced separately, by sanger and  <dig> platforms, and assembled together  <cit> . the assembly used for this study  is composed of  <dig>  scaffolds, totalizing approximately 700 mb  <cit>  with n <dig> length of 848 kb . for the reason that sequences were produced from adult insects, we filtered the scaffolds for bacterial dna. a total of  <dig> scaffolds  have strong blast hits to bacterial dna and were excluded.

since genome libraries were built separately for each sex, we were able to identify the origin  of each read used to assemble each scaffold. autosomal scaffolds are expected to be composed from equal numbers of male and female reads; whereas y-linked candidates are composed only of male reads . it is important to note that even x-linked scaffolds could be predicted using this approach, since we expect that such sequences are composed 2/ <dig> of female reads . however, we also expect a significant number of autosomes to be assembled with 2/ <dig> of female reads. such overlap  should generate a substantial number of x-linked false positive candidates, making the identification of x-linked sequences more challenging.fig.  <dig> 
r. prolixus genome sequencing and assembly. male and female dnas were sequenced separately. this approach allowed us to count the number of reads from male libraries, which were then used in the assembly of each scaffold. autosomal chromosomes  are equally represented in males and females ; x-chromosomes are found in a ratio of  <dig> male for  <dig> female chromosomes ; while y chromosomes are found only in males 



to improve the reliability of our approach, we removed from our analysis all scaffolds that were assembled with less than  <dig> reads; since there is a higher chance of finding false positives in scaffolds assembled with a small number of reads . after the removal of scaffolds built with  <dig> reads or less, a total of  <dig>  scaffolds remained for further analysis. these scaffolds encompass  <dig>  mb and have an n <dig> length of 911 kb.

we found  <dig> candidate scaffolds that were assembled only with male reads and these were considered as candidates for linkage to the rhodnius y chromosome . we proceeded to select the ten largest scaffolds for y-linkage tests as a preliminary test of accuracy for our approach. pcr results showed that all ten scaffolds are indeed y-linked , showing that the method is accurate for large scaffolds. subsequent y-linkage tests in randomly selected scaffolds revealed similar accuracy of y-linkage prediction . as a result, we concluded with  <dig> experimentally confirmed y-linked scaffolds  in the r. prolixus genome .fig.  <dig> proportion of male reads for each scaffold. a computer program was developed in order to count the number of reads from male libraries in each scaffold. the information produced was plotted according to:  the percentage of male reads and scaffold size or;  the sum of scaffolds for each percentage of male reads. scaffolds composed of male reads only  were considered y-linked candidates

identification of y-linked genes
all  <dig> y-candidate scaffolds were first softmasked with repeatmasker to avoid repetitive sequences . softmasked sequences were then blasted against different databases . a total of  <dig> scaffolds presented hits in one or more databases. from these, only  <dig> have similarity with refseq proteins and a total of  <dig> scaffolds seemed to contain at least a part of putative protein from the ncbi nr database. a total of  <dig> scaffolds have blast hits only against r. prolixus transcripts and/or annotated genes  and some of these could be novel proteins. based on different blast evidences , we selected  <dig> scaffolds  to test for y-linkage. we found that nine genes in nine different scaffolds were y-linked. among the remaining  <dig> candidates, nine produced inconclusive results  and  <dig> clearly were autosomal or x-linked . note that the accuracy of y-linkage prediction here  was well below our previous tests with large or random scaffolds . the possible justification for these results is explored in the discussion section. y-linked genes are located in scaffolds gl <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig> and gl <dig> .table  <dig> annotation of nine y-linked genes

structural and functional annotation of y-linked genes
our first analysis showed that all nine genes were incomplete and some of them showed premature stop-codons and/or frame-shifts. these problems were expected since y-linked sequences tend to have sequencing/assembling errors due to shallow coverage  <cit> . another frequent assembly problem is that exons of y-linked genes end up scattered in separated scaffolds due to assembly failure of the repetitive sequences found in introns of heterochromatic genes  <cit> . therefore, re-sequencing is usually needed in order to fully annotate y-linked genes. sequencing of cdna was used to close gaps and to correct sequencing errors. indeed, premature stop-codons and frame-shifts were present in three genes; and cdna sequencing showed that these were sequencing errors. rapid amplification of complementary dna ends  was used to complete the mrna sequence of most genes. y-linked genes were named according to their putative function or as rpr-y, for the genes without previous described function. table  <dig> summarizes the annotation status of all nine y-linked genes.

putative function for y-linked genes was evaluated by both, amino acid identity with known proteins, and phylogenetic analyses of homologs. four out of nine genes shared homology with proteins with known function. we found an aconitase/iron regulatory protein , located in scaffold gl550523; a metaloprotease ; and two zinc finger proteins . our phylogenetic analysis also suggest that met-y is orthologous to gene mmp <dig> of d. melanogaster, while both zinc finger proteins have orthologous genes in tribolium castaneum . our results suggests that aco-y is not orthologous to the ancestral aconitase of hexapoda . the remaining five genes have no similarity to proteins with known functions or motifs; and were named as . while the gene rpr-y <dig> has homologues annotated in other genomes , genes rpr-y <dig>  rpr-y <dig>  rpr-y <dig> and rpr-y <dig> are probably orphan genes  <cit>  . we tested the expression of the nine y-linked genes in all r. prolixus developing stages  and for different tissues in the adult male . we found that eight of the nine genes are mostly or only expressed in the testis ; whereas aco-y is mainly expressed in the r. prolixus gut . rpr-y <dig> also presented a weak expression in the 2nd instar .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of y-linked genes. the phylogenetic trees of genes metaloproteinase-y , zinc finger-y <dig> and zinc finger-y <dig> , and aconitase-y  are shown. the protein sequences were aligned with clustalw, and a nj tree with poisson correction and complete deletion was constructed with the program mega. bootstrap support values  are shown inside the tree. we included all sequences returned by the tblastn search. sequence accession numbers are shown directly in the phylogenetic trees

homologous sequences of y-linked genes
blastn and tblastn searches in r. prolixus genome and in vectorbase annotated genes revealed that rpr-y <dig> is a single copy gene . in fact, we found a divergent paralog, rprc <dig> , for gene rpr-y <dig>  metaloprotease-y and aconitase-y have only one autosomal or x-linked paralog each . phylogenetic analyses of met-y suggests that this gene is paralogous to rprc <dig> . gene rpr-y <dig> has three autosomal or x-linked paralogous sequences in the genome . we also perceived that that genes zfn-y <dig>  zfn-y <dig> are probably a copy of each other , with a third copy in the y scaffold gl <dig> .

finally, we found  <dig> homologous sequences for rpr-y <dig> ,  <dig> homologous sequences for rpr-y <dig>  and  <dig> homologous sequences for rpr-y <dig> . phylogenetic analyses  suggest that rpr-y <dig> has an autosomal or x-linked paralog . the phylogenetic analyses for rpr-y <dig> and rpr-y <dig>  suggests that both to a large family of multicopy genes with autosomal/x and y-linked paralogs.

discussion
studies of y chromosome genetics started in  <dig> when bridges reported that drosophila melanogaster y chromosomes were not involved in sex determination, but were essential to male fertility. almost 30 years later, studies on klinenfelter and turner’s syndromes concluded that the human y chromosome might have one or more genes, or sectors, which determine the male phenotype. only in  <dig>  the mammalian male determining gene  was sequenced  <cit> . the heterochromatic nature of y chromosomes hindered most genetic studies of this chromosome. the advance in genomics in  <dig>  allowed researchers an easy access to the entire genomic data, permitting for faster identification of new y-linked genes and broader studies of the role of y chromosomes beyond male sex determination and fertility. since then,  <dig> y-linked genes were described for drosophila melanogaster and a total of  <dig> genes were described for mammals y chromosome  <cit> .

the identification of y-linked genes allowed studies on the evolution of gene content in the y chromosomes of drosophila and mammals. in drosophila, the research suggested that the gain of genes, instead of loss, plays an important role in y chromosome evolution  <cit> . in mammals, recent investigation revealed a low genetic conservation, the importance of gene gain and that y chromosome may influence male life span . hence, the identification of y-linked genes is crucial for the understanding of y chromosome function, origin and evolution.

in  <dig>  krzywinski and coworkers  <cit>  proposed that the separate sequencing of male and female genomes would facilitate the identification of y-linked sequences. using this method we putatively identified  <dig> y chromosome sequences covering more than  <dig>  mb . pcr tests for the ten largest candidates showed that all ten are y-linked; a similar test for another  <dig> scaffolds  found  <dig> y-linked and two failures . however, when we tested y-linkage for  <dig> genes, we found that only nine candidate scaffolds were y-linked . the rate of success for y-linkage dropped to  <dig> %  when we aimed for genes. hence, although it is clear that the method of identification of y-linked sequences proposed by krzywinski and collaborators works, it had a rather high rate of false positives when applied to the rhodnius genome.

recently, two independent researchers developed new methods to find y-linked genes in traditional genome projects   <cit> . both studies used a massive number of illumina short reads, which provide a high read coverage, increasing confidence to predict y-linked genes. the method used by carvalho and clark  used the drosophila virilis high quality virca assembly  and ~ <dig> fold coverage of illumina reads from female dna. in a similar way, hall and coworkers searched for y-linked sequences using a chromosome quotient  method in the anopheles gambiae genome, using ~ <dig> fold coverage of illumina reads from each sex to calculate probability of y-linkage. in contrast, the r. prolixus assembly has a mean coverage of eight reads/base, which is considered low even for sanger sequenced genomes . also, r. prolixus genome has  <dig>  scaffolds  and almost  <dig>  sequences are needed to cover ~ <dig> % of the genome  <cit> . this comparison suggests that high coverage  is crucial to reduce false positives. the r. prolixus low coverage assembly reduces the strength of our approach since the fewer the number of reads used to assemble a scaffold, the higher the chance of such scaffold to be assembled with reads from only one sex.

it is also important to note that the number of false positives increased when we aimed our searches towards protein coding genes. y chromosomes are remarkably poor in protein coding genes  <cit> . therefore, the narrow search for y-linked genes might have created a bias toward false positives. also, most candidates are composed of repetitive sequences or multi-copy genes , and in many cases we had difficulties to design specific primers. nonetheless, we were able to find nine new y-linked genes on the r. prolixus genome, showing the strength of the method applied here.

many genomes are now being sequenced using illumina platform  <cit> . in genomes assembled from short reads , reads are fragmented in shorter sequences   <cit> , and the final assembly does not contain the information of which reads were used to assemble a specific contig . nevertheless, separate sequencing for each sex , is a very powerful approach in order to enable fast identification of y-linked sequences in future genomes. in this case, short reads from male and female libraries can be easily aligned in the assembled genome to identify y-linked sequences , with the advantage of zero additional cost.

based on protein similarity and phylogenetic analysis, we were able to attribute putative functions to four y-linked genes. met-y gene is a member of the m <dig> metalloproteases, orthologous to drosophila melanogaster mmp <dig> protein, which are zinc-dependent endopeptidases, synthesized as inactive precursors  <cit> . our results suggest that met-y expression is restricted to testis. hence, it is tempting to imagine that met-y has an important role in male fertility and functional analysis  are being carried out to ascertain this. we also found two zinc finger proteins  containing a classical c2h <dig> zinc finger domain. this class of zinc fingers is best known for its role as transcription factors in sequence-specific dna-binding proteins  <cit> . like most of y-linked genes described here, both zinc finger proteins are mainly expressed in testis. the fourth gene identified is the aconitase-y. aconitase is an essential enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, interestingly, an iron regulatory protein  <cit> . iron regulatory proteins are especially important to hematophagous organisms, since excess of iron could be damaging to cells  <cit> . in r. prolixus females , iron intake and metabolism is crucial for egg development. however, there are no studies of the iron metabolism in rhodnius males. we found that aco-y is expressed only in male adult gut . the lack of aco-y expression in other developmental stages and other tissues  suggests that aco-y has a primary function in iron regulation, instead of its role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle .

we have no indication of the biological function of the other six y-linked genes. while genes rpr-y <dig> has similar sequences annotated in other genomes, genes rpr-y <dig>  rpr-y <dig>  rpry- <dig> and rpr-y <dig> are probably orphan genes. similarly to most y-linked genes in other organisms  <cit> , eight y-linked genes are expressed mainly in r. prolixus testis, in a coherent testis-restricted pattern observed in drosophila  <cit>  and in many human genes  <cit> . very little is known about r. prolixus sexual differentiation and the role of the y chromosome in sex determination is still unclear. sexual dimorphism and gonadal development can only be observed in 5th instar nymphs. most y-linked genes described here presented mrna expression restricted to male adults and, although not impossible, it is very unlikely that any of these have any roles in sex determination. future functional studies  are needed for better understanding of the biological role of the r. prolixus y chromosome.

it is very tempting to look at our experimental results and phylogenetic analyses to speculate on the origin and evolution of r. prolixus y-linked genes. the discussion about animals y chromosome origin and evolution is rich and with different points of view. although it is widely accepted that y chromosomes share a common ancestrally with x chromosomes  <cit> , recent studies of drosophila y chromosomes suggest a non-canonical mechanism of origin and evolution  <cit> . our results suggests that some y-linked genes may have an autosomal or x origin. however, for such discussion, the mapping of x-linked genes is vital to understand y chromosome origin and evolution. the method used in this study suggests that scaffolds assembled with ~ <dig> % male reads could be x-linked. further studies  are needed to ascertain this question. also, we need the genome analysis of other triatomines to determine the origin of each y-linked gene, as well as a good genetic map of r. prolixus scaffolds to ascertain the location of each paralog. only afterwards it would be possible to answer the questionings about r. prolixus y chromosome evolution.

all the y sequences and genes described here could also be used as molecular markers in population studies, which have great importance for vector biology and control research . since these sequences have a male specific non-recombinant inheritance, they are good markers for such studies. in fact, we have already used y sequences as male specific markers in recent analysis of r. prolixus embryogenesis, revealing the usefulness of such sequences  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the simple choice, proposed by krzywinski and coworkers in  <dig>  of sequencing male and female dna separately in new genome projects, is of great value for the identification of y-linked genes. with little computational effort we were able to find hundreds of putative y-linked sequences. here we described, for the first time, nine new y-linked genes in the rhodnius prolixus genome. this methodology is advantageous when compared with classical genome sequencing approaches , since it allows the identification of y-linked sequences at basically zero additional cost. in many genomes, the sequenced organisms have y chromosomes but these are missed during genome assembling. great computational and human effort is then needed to unveil y sequences from such genomes and, in many cases, resequencing is needed to facilitate the process. although many false positives could arise from low coverage and low quality assemblies, we showed that the method proposed by krzywinski and coworkers is powerful enough to find y genes with autosomal duplicates sharing amino nucleotide identities above  <dig> %. the method also allowed for rapid identification of  <dig> male-specific markers. a few of these markers were already used in other studies and many of them may be useful for further r. prolixus population or vector control studies. even though we were not able to fully describe the biological role of r. prolixus y chromosome, the functional study of y-linked genes could reveal important genes for male development, fertility or sex determination. the sequencing of new organisms, especially different triatomines species, applying the same approach as described here for r. prolixus, could prove useful for the rapid identification of y chromosome genes, contributing to further understanding of the evolution and function of animal y chromosomes.
