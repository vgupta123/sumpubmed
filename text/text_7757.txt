BACKGROUND
nucleosomes play a critical role in gene regulation in eukaryotes by modulating the access of various transcription factors to dna  <cit> . genome-wide data on in vivo nucleosome organization in yeast reveal that nucleosomes are depleted in the promoter regions  <cit> , providing space for assembly of the transcriptional machinery. accurate determination of nucleosome positions is extremely important when studying gene regulatory mechanisms because displacement of a nucleosome by just a few nucleotides may occlude  the binding site of a protein. nucleosome positioning is usually characterized by two parameters: rotational positioning, referring to the side of the dna helix that faces the histones, and translational positioning, determining the nucleosome midpoint  with regard to the dna sequence  <cit> . various experimental and computational methods have been proposed to provide high-resolution mapping of nucleosomes .

the most commonly used empirical method for nucleosome mapping involves treating native chromatin with micrococcal nuclease , which has been employed to generate genome-wide nucleosome maps in many eukaryotes . however, it is well documented that mnase has strong sequence preferences: it cuts predominantly within at-rich sequences in both free dna  <cit>  and in the linker dna between nucleosomes  <cit> . this sequence specificity makes it difficult to determine the boundaries of nucleosomes bordered by gc-rich sequences  <cit> .

the free hydroxyl radical  method was originally used to study the structure of dna and dna-protein complexes  <cit> . it has several advantages over mnase cleavage. first, hydroxyl radical footprinting has no pronounced sequence preference  <cit> .  second, the small size of fhrs in solution allows them to cut the dna backbone at every nucleotide that is not protected by protein. later, flaus et al.  <cit>  developed the site-directed hydroxyl radical  approach to precisely map nucleosome dyads. using this approach, researchers have successfully determined  <dig> nucleosome positions in vitro at a single base-pair resolution  . recently, this approach was used to map in vivo nucleosome positions across the yeast genome  <cit> . these precise experimental nucleosome positions serve as ideal test cases for computational approaches to nucleosome positioning prediction.table  <dig>

computational models for nucleosome positioning can be roughly divided into two classes: structure-based models and sequence-based models. the structure-based models are based on analyses of structural parameters of individual dinucleotide steps derived from crystal structures of nucleosome core particles and numerous protein-dna complexes  <cit> . nucleosomal dna is severely deformed when wrapped around the histone octamer. several models have been proposed to assess the energy cost of the deformations required to wrap dna around the histone core  and to calculate the dna structural features  <cit>  which can be used for prediction of the nucleosome occupancy and transcription factor binding  <cit> .

the sequence-based models depend on statistical analyses of sequence features in nucleosomal dna fragments. it has been known for many years that certain sequence motifs usually occur at particular sites within a nucleosome, constituting characteristic patterns. the initial breakthrough was made by trifonov and sussman  <cit> , who observed periodic oscillations of dinucleotides, especially aa:tt, in genomic sequences and postulated that they are critical for bending of dna and stabilization of nucleosomes. since then, various features have been suggested to be essential for dna packaging in chromatin  <cit> . the most well-known sequence pattern is related to the rotational setting of nucleosomes. that is, at-containing dinucleotides  frequently occur in the minor-groove sites facing toward the histone, while gc-containing dinucleotides  are often found in the minor-groove sites facing outward. this pattern has been observed in nucleosomal dna from chickens  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , fruit flies  <cit> , nematodes  <cit>  and humans  <cit> , indicating that the structural rules for rotational positioning are essentially the same across species.

the ww, ss and other similar patterns were extensively used for prediction of the nucleosome positioning. in particular, ioshikhes and colleagues analyzed the correlation profiles for the aa/tt and gg/cc dinucleotide patterns  <cit> . reynolds et al.  <cit>  compared mono-, di- and tri-nucleotides and found that the mono-nucleotide patterns are the most informative features. tillo and hughes found that g + c content dominates nucleosome occupancy  <cit> , while chung and vingron further showed that the overall g + c preference for nucleosomal dna together with the periodic dinucleotide patterns results in maximal predictive performance  <cit> . teif and rippe used the aforementioned dna patterns, as well as remodeler activities to predict nucleosome positions  <cit> .

at the same time, other research groups used large nucleosome occupancy data sets to develop discriminative models  <cit>  and regression-based models  <cit> , which aim to predict nucleosome positions at low resolution by discriminating between nucleosome and linker dna. these studies show that genome-wide nucleosome occupancy is often directed by exclusion signals such as long a-tracts.

the segal group initially developed a markov model incorporating the aforementioned periodic patterns associated with nucleosome rotational positioning and taking into account steric exclusion and thermodynamic equilibria  <cit> . this model was later modified by introducing a “position-independent” component, pl, to represent sequences that are generally favored or disfavored regardless of their position within the nucleosome  tracts, which are strongly disfavored by nucleosomes)  <cit> . this method, denoted as ks- <dig> hereafter, is quite successful in predicting in vivo nucleosome occupancy across the yeast genome  <cit> . the notation ks- <dig> gives credit to the first and the last authors of the paper .

note that the term “position” has two different meanings in the above description – the first is the position of a nucleosome on dna, and the second is a position along the nucleosome length. to avoid possible confusion, the second case will be denoted as a “site” on nucleosomal dna. accordingly, the above value pl will be denoted below as a “site-independent” component. .

recently, we developed a method  aiming to predict the exact positioning of nucleosomes in vitro
 <cit> . it was based on analysis of the periodic distribution of dinucleotides ww, ss and yr, as well as of the yyrr and ryry motifs . the tetranucleotides were included to reflect the differential bending anisotropy of pyrimidine-purine  dinucleotide steps in the context of their neighbors  <cit> . we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> nucleosomes mapped at high resolution in vitro are predicted within  <dig> bp from their experimental positions. our data showed that both the dinucleotide and the tetranucleotide patterns are critical for nucleosome positioning  <cit> . however, the relative importance of the ww, ss and yr dinucleotides  remained unclear.

to address this issue, we used a simple w/s model based solely on distribution of the ww and ss dinucleotides. this model is a modification of the method described earlier  <cit> . below, we demonstrate that the w/s model provides accurate prediction of the rotational positioning of nucleosomes both in vitro and in the yeast and human genomes, with an error distribution narrower than that produced by the ks- <dig> model. we suggest that the w/s model, in conjunction with the translational component pl introduced by kaplan et al.  <cit> , has a potential for accurate prediction of both the rotational and translational positioning of nucleosomes in vivo.

methods
in vitroexperimental nucleosome positions
twenty nucleosome positions were mapped in vitro using high-resolution mapping techniques such as the fhr and sdhr methods . all these positions were used in this study.

in vivoexperimental nucleosome positions
three sets of nucleosome positions mapped in vivo at high resolution are used in this study. one set is from yeast, mapped by the sdhr method  <cit> , while two other sets, one from yeast and one from humans, are mapped by mnase cleavage  <cit> . the sdhr brogaard set  <cit>  includes  <dig>  unique nucleosome dyad positions across the yeast genome,  <dig> of which are too close to the ends of chromosomes . the remaining  <dig>  positions were used in this analysis. the mnase cole set contains ~ <dig> million fragments from yeast with lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bp  <cit> . only fragments  <dig> bp in length  were used in this analysis. the mnase gaffney set contains ~ <dig>  billion paired-end reads with lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> bp from seven human lymphoblastoid cell lines  <cit> . only the 147-bp fragments  were used in this study. note that ~16% of yeast nucleosomes and ~5% of human nucleosomes were selected; our analysis, however, is not exclusively effective with fragments of this length. that is, using nucleosomal dna fragments with the length l =  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp yields similar results.

w/s scheme
the w/s scheme is based on the method described earlier  <cit>  with some modifications. briefly, this method implements the well-established sequence patterns initially observed by travers and his colleagues in chicken nucleosomes  <cit> . that is, the ww dinucleotides predominantly occur at the sites of dna bending into the minor groove, while the ss dinucleotides are frequently found at the sites where dna is bent toward the major groove. in this implementation, the 147-bp and 146-bp nucleosomal templates contain  <dig> minor-groove bending sites and  <dig> major-groove bending sites , each  <dig> bp in length. .

for example, consider the superhelical location shl − <dig> , which covers the nucleosomal dna locations  <dig> through  <dig> . when computing the ww score, cww, for this site, we consider three dinucleotide steps: 15– <dig>  16– <dig> and 17– <dig>  if two or three ww dimers occur at this site, cww =  <dig> or  <dig>  respectively . this ‘cumulative’ approach is consistent with the idea that three or four consecutive at pairs are more favorable  for interaction with the histone arginines penetrating into the minor groove  <cit> . similarly, the ww score is computed for the other dna-bending sites along nucleosomal dna. for each 147-bp nucleosomal fragment with the dyad at position n, the total score s is defined as
  

where cww and css are the total occurrences of ww and ss dinucleotides occurring at a given site.  that is, the ww fragments occurring at the minor groove sites and the ss fragments occurring at the major groove sites are treated as ‘gains’ because they facilitate anisotropic dna bending into the minor and major grooves. by contrast, the ww fragments in the major groove sites and the ss fragments in the minor groove sites are considered to be ‘penalties’.

since both 146-bp and 147-bp dna fragments can form stable nucleosome core particles  <cit> , it is critical to consider both templates to provide greater flexibility to the model. the profiles for the 147-bp and 146-bp templates were combined in the following way. for a given position n, the score of the 147-bp template  is compared with the scores of the two 146-bp templates occupying positions from n– <dig> to n+ <dig> and from n– <dig> to n+ <dig>  the locations of the minor- and major-groove sites for both templates are shown in additional file 1: tables s <dig> and s <dig>  the highest of the three scores is assigned to position n. the resulting 147/146-bp profile is compared with the experimentally detected nucleosome positions. note that in our model, the linker dna is not used for calculation of the w/s score.

comparison with other computational models
our method was compared with a widely used computational model developed by segal and colleagues, denoted as the ks- <dig> model  <cit> . we used the executable file available at the website . in the output of the ks- <dig> model, the “p start” values are reported for the probability of a nucleosome starting at a given position. to compare with the w/s score assigned to the center of a nucleosome, we shift the “p start” value by  <dig> bp and denote it as “p-center”. in addition, we compared our model with two recent physics-based models, one developed by van der heijden et al., denoted as the hn- <dig> model  <cit> , and the other by minary and levitt, denoted as the ml- <dig> model  <cit> .

RESULTS
prediction of in vitronucleosome positions mapped at high resolution
first, we set out to predict the well-established nucleosome position on the dna of synthetic clone ‘ <dig> ’ it is one of the highest-affinity sequences identified so far for histone binding  <cit> . clearly, both the w/s and ks- <dig> models fail to predict the translational positioning of the ‘601’ nucleosome because the highest peaks are not at the experimental location . nevertheless, the two methods do succeed in predicting the rotational positioning of the nucleosome – their profiles show oscillating patterns with a ~10-bp periodicity and have the local maximum at the experimentally determined location. unfortunately, both the hn- <dig> and the ml- <dig> models fail to correctly predict the rotational positioning of the ‘601’ nucleosome .figure  <dig>

table  <dig> summarizes, for each of the  <dig> experimental in vitro nucleosome positions, the predictions made by the w/s and ks- <dig> models. note that most of the  <dig> positions are mapped by the sdhr method, a very accurate method that can map nucleosome positioning at single base-pair resolution . the w/s scheme correctly predicts the rotational positioning of  <dig> nucleosomes, but fails in five cases . we showed earlier  <cit>  that in additional to the ww and ss dinucleotides, distribution of the tetranucleotides yyrr and ryry has to be considered to account for positioning of four out of the five nucleosomes mentioned above. this explains why the w/s scheme fails for these nucleosome positions.

the ks- <dig> model gives correct predictions for  <dig> out of  <dig> positions . notably, the ks- <dig> model succeeds in two out of the five positions for which the w/s scheme fails. the most interesting case is the oocyte 5s rdna fragment  <cit> . on this fragment, four nucleosomes were mapped at positions − <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig> with respect to the transcription start site of the 5s gene. the position + <dig> is obviously out of phase with the other three positions. the success of the ks- <dig> model in predicting the rotational setting of nucleosomes at positions − <dig>  + <dig> and + <dig>  indicates that this approach, in some cases, can predict nucleosome positions even if they are in the opposite rotational phases. it should be noted, however, that the peaks at positions + <dig> and + <dig> are very low compared to the peak at position + <dig>  where no nucleosome was observed experimentally.

taken together, both the w/s and ks- <dig> models predict the rotational setting of ~70% of the nucleosomes in vitro with the precision of  <dig> bp . this result is based on a detailed case-by-case comparison which is hardly possible for a genome-wide analysis. therefore, we need to develop an automatic computational procedure for handling millions of nucleosome positions in vivo. in an earlier report  <cit> , we made an ‘overall comparison’ of the observed positions with the theoretical score profiles. as follows from figure 2a, the experimental positions of nucleosomes coincide with the peaks in the averaged predicted profiles. note, however, that these profiles do not give information about the discrepancy between the experimentally observed and the predicted positions of the nucleosome in each particular case. to quantify how precisely each nucleosome position is predicted, we calculated the error distributions . overall, the error distribution for the w/s model differs significantly from the one for the ks- <dig> model . the fraction of positions predicted exactly  was 50% for the w/s model and 35% for ks- <dig> model. although the fraction of positions with a discrepancy exceeding  <dig> bp was ~30% for both models , the w/s model outperformed the ks- <dig> model, yielding a narrower error distribution. importantly, the error distribution gives the same results as the detailed analysis of the  <dig> nucleosome positions in vitro presented above. thus, we can use this computational approach to evaluate the accuracy of prediction of the nucleosome positioning genome-wide, as manual comparison is impractical.figure  <dig>

prediction of nucleosome positions in yeast mapped by the sdhr method
to compare the performance of the two models in the case of in vivo nucleosomes, we first analyzed the yeast nucleosomes mapped by the sdhr method  <cit> . it is clear that both computational models produce periodic score profiles with maximal values at the experimental dyad positions . at the same time, the two profiles display noticeable differences in the vicinity of the dyad. in particular, the w/s peak at the dyad  has almost the same height as the peaks at positions ± <dig> and ± <dig>  while the ks- <dig> peak at the dyad clearly stands out from the rest of the peaks . since the ks- <dig> model incorporates both periodic dinucleotide patterns  and the frequencies of penta-nucleotides  it is plausible that the observed difference is related to the site-independent part of the model.figure  <dig> 
prediction of the yeast nucleosome positions mapped by the sdhr method  <cit> , by the w/s and ks- <dig> models. average score profiles  and error distributions  are shown. the notations are the same as in figure  <dig> 



a comparison of error distributions for the two models shows that they are significantly different . for example, the w/s model has the highest fraction of nucleosomes with positions predicted precisely , which is much higher than for the out-of-phase positions with error ± <dig> bp . by contrast, the ks- <dig> model predicts precisely only ~10% of the nucleosomal positions, while the fraction of the out-of-phase positions increases to ~25%. moreover, the w/s model predicts ~75% of the in vivo positions with the precision of  <dig> bp, compared to ~45% by the ks- <dig> model. these data demonstrate that the w/s model predicts the rotational setting of these nucleosomes fairly well, whereas the ks- <dig> model fails to distinguish between the rotational settings of the experimental positions and their immediate neighbors.

prediction of yeast and human nucleosome positions mapped by mnase cleavage
to exclude the possibility that performance of the two models is sensitive to sdhr mapping, we investigated the yeast nucleosomes mapped by mnase cleavage  <cit> . this dataset was obtained by paired-end sequencing. thus, the lengths of the nucleosomal dna fragments were derived precisely. only 147-bp fragments were used in our analysis . as before, the two models produce periodic score profiles with maximal values at the dyad . moreover, the profiles produced by the ks- <dig> model exhibit the global maxima at the experimental dyad , consistent with the trend described above . by analogy with the previous section, the two models yield different error distributions for the mnase set of nucleosomes . the w/s model predicts ~65% of the nucleosome positions with  <dig> bp precision, compared to ~45% predicted by the ks- <dig> model. thus, we conclude that the w/s model is better than the ks- <dig> model at predicting the rotational nucleosome positioning in yeast, no matter which mapping method  was used.figure  <dig> 
prediction of the yeast and human nucleosome positions mapped by mnase cleavage. average profiles and error distributions for the w/s and ks- <dig> models for yeast  nucleosomes . the notations are the same as in figure  <dig> 



on the other hand, there is a notable difference between the two yeast sets  <cit>  mapped by different techniques. the w/s score amplitude varies by  <dig> units for the nucleosomes mapped by the sdhr method  <cit>  , while it varies by  <dig> units for the nucleosomes mapped by mnase cleavage  <cit>  . the sdhr set contains ~ <dig>  “almost non-overlapping” nucleosome positions selected from a redundant map of ~ <dig>  nucleosomes  <cit> , while the mnase set contains ~ <dig>  nucleosome fragments that are  <dig> bp in length  <cit> , without any additional selection. it is thus possible that the sdhr set is more ‘homogeneous’ due to a specific selection process, which results in a larger variation of the w/s score .

in the case of human nucleosomes, the translational positioning is again predicted better by the ks- <dig> model , while the w/s model performs somewhat better in terms of rotational positioning: it predicts ~65% of the nucleosome positions with 2-bp precision, compared to ~55% for the ks- <dig> model . accordingly, the difference between the two error distributions is statistically insignificant . in other words, the w/s and ks- <dig> models demonstrate very similar performance when used to map the human nucleosomes.

finally, note yet another difference between the two models. the w/s model appears to be species-independent – it correctly predicts ~65% of positions for both yeast and human nucleosomes mapped by mnase cleavage . by contrast, the ks- <dig> model performs differently for the two species – it predicts ~55% and ~45% of positions for the human and yeast nucleosomes, respectively. ironically, the ks- <dig> model was devised based on yeast in vitro data  <cit> . nevertheless, our analysis indicates that this model performs better for the human nucleosomes mapped in vivo
 <cit> . since chromatin remodeling is involved in nucleosome positioning in vivo, the difference in rotational positioning prediction of the ks- <dig> model in the cases of yeast and human nucleosomes may reflect different remodeling activities in these two species.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed the simple and easily reproducible w/s model for prediction of the rotational positioning of nucleosomes based on the well-established sequence-dependent bending anisotropy of dna  <cit> . our model does not use specific training data sets or make any assumptions about the species-dependence of the nucleosome positioning. therefore it can be used to predict nucleosome positions on any genomic dna. this, in turn, is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms modulating the access of various transcription factors to dna in the context of chromatin. for example, recently we used the 147-bp analog of the w/s model to examine accessibility of p <dig> binding sites in the human genome for the tumor suppressor protein p <dig>  <cit> . by contrast, the w/s scheme presented here uses a ‘flexible’ template allowing variation of the nucleosomal dna fragment from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. we know from earlier experience that consideration of the stretching flexibility of dna is critical for precise prediction of nucleosome positioning, e.g., in the case of the ‘601’ nucleosome  <cit> .

to compare the performance of different models, we used a simple and effective way to evaluate the error distribution. as follows from our study, the w/s scheme is superior at predicting the rotational positioning, whereas the ks- <dig> model is more successful in predicting the translational positioning of nucleosomes because it contains a “site-independent” translational component  <cit> .

naturally, additional training on the high-resolution datasets would improve performance of the ‘sophisticated’ models like ks- <dig> containing numerous external parameters. our main goal, however, was to show that a simple and transparent w/s scheme that was not trained on any data, works ‘reasonably well’ in predicting rotational positioning of nucleosomes. this opens exciting possibility of improving the performance of existing models by combining their ‘positive’ features. it is conceivable that the w/s model might correctly predict the translational positioning of nucleosomes after a species-specific translational component is added.
