BACKGROUND
the appearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins in specific regions of the brain is one of the common pathological hallmarks of various progressive neurological disorders in humans, such as early onset torsion dystonia   <cit> , alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, parkinson’s disease, various polyglutamine diseases and prion disease  <cit> . a variety of evidence suggests that accumulated misfolded proteins are key players in the onset and progression of these neurological disorders  <cit> . the endoplasmic reticulum  is a sub-cellular organelle where secretory and membrane proteins are synthesised, modified, correctly folded and assembled prior to transit to the cell surface or to intracellular organelles. perturbations of er function, caused by various stressors, may result in the underlying deposition of intra- and/or extracellularly accumulated misfolded proteins in the brain, which has been associated with various neurological disorders  <cit> . the known er stressors include physiological stress, pathological stress and environmental stress  <cit> .

to sense and respond to er stressors, eukaryotic cells have developed a group of evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways known as the unfolded protein response , which is characterised by transcriptional up-regulation of er resident chaperones, selective inhibition of translation, and activation of er-associated degradation   <cit> . under physiological conditions, the er resident chaperone bip, also known as glucose-regulated protein  <dig> , and heat shock 70 kda protein  <dig>  are bound to three upr inducers, such as the pancreatic er kinase , the inositol-requiring enzyme  <dig>  and the activating transcription factor  <dig> . when unfolded proteins accumulate in the er lumen, bip binds to unfolded stretches in the proteins and becomes dissociated from the three upr inducers, which subsequently activate the upr that induces expression of bip and other er chaperones. if the increased bip expression is sufficient for restoring er function, it inactivates the upr by binding to the three upr inducers  <cit> . however, prolonged activation of the upr by mild or strong er stresses may result in the adaptation and survival of cells under these conditions or cell death  <cit> . recent studies have shown that the prolonged activation of the upr may contribute to the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa   <cit> , alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , parkinson’s disease  <cit> , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> .

dyt <dig> dystonia is the most common and severe form of dystonia caused by mutations in the dyt <dig> gene encoding torsin a in humans . dyt <dig> patients show severe twisting movements and abnormal postures caused by involuntary muscle contractions. the loss of one of a pair of glutamic acid residues in htora  has been identified in most patients with this disorder  <cit> . only 30-40% of heterozygous individuals manifest severe symptoms, suggesting that the Δe mutation in htora may increase an individual’s susceptibilities to other genetic and/or environmental risk factors required for the development of this disorder  <cit> . amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that htora is a member of a family of atpases associated with a variety of cellular activities  and as such, may play a pivotal role in the assembly, disassembly, degradation and trafficking of other proteins  <cit> . moreover, recent studies have shown that the secretory pathway in fibroblasts acquired from dyt <dig> dystonia patients is impaired  <cit> , and the impaired secretory pathway in those cells is rescued by the down-regulation of htoraΔe via the expression of an allele specific small interfering  rna of htoraΔe  <cit> .

another consequence of the Δe mutation on htora at the subcellular level is the redistribution of htoraΔe to the nuclear envelope  that results in the appearance of perinuclear membranous inclusions in dyt <dig> dystonia fibroblasts  <cit> , torsinaΔe knock-in mouse brains  <cit> , and transgenic mice over-expressing htoraΔe in the brain  <cit> . at the molecular level, interactions between the htorawt and its interaction partners, including the lamina-associated polypeptide  <dig>  in the ne, the luminal domain like lap <dig>  in the er  <cit> , the ne network-associated protein vimentin  <cit> , and kinesin light chain  <dig>   <cit>  are abolished in the htoraΔe. recently, it has been shown that ultrastructural defects in the neuronal ne in the lap <dig> knock out mouse are similar to those observed in the tor1aΔe knock-in mouse, suggesting that htora and lap <dig> may be present in the same signal transduction pathway that regulates normal development of the neuronal ne  <cit> . these reports suggest that dyt <dig> pathogenesis could be the consequence of altered transcriptional regulation caused by abnormal interactions of htoraΔe with nuclear envelope proteins and/or a loss of function of htorawt in the er that would impair certain neuron-specific signalling pathways.

to investigate how transcriptional or translational alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of dyt <dig>  unbiased genomics and proteomic analyses were recently performed using in vitro and in vivo dyt <dig> models. the expression of htoraΔe in neuronal cell lines did not induce transcriptional alterations; however, expression changes of proteins involved with energy metabolism and the redox state were detected in this model  <cit> . a recent study revealed that the expression of several genes involved in the development and function of the nervous system, cytoskeleton organisation and biogenesis, cell adhesion, g-protein-receptor signalling and the vesicle mediated trafficking pathway were altered when transcriptional profiles in peripheral blood cells from dyt <dig> dystonia patients were compared with those of htoraΔe carriers  <cit> .

drosophila has been extensively utilised as a model to investigate the molecular and cellular aetiologies underlying diverse neurological diseases in humans. we have shown that htoraΔe but not htorawt expressed in drosophila induced protein aggregates near the ne, caused defects at synaptic terminals, and increased the flies’ susceptibility to environmental stress  <cit> . in this study, we gained further insights into the molecular and cellular consequences of htoraΔe in drosophila brains by performing an unbiased 2-dimensional electrophoresis analysis that demonstrated that heat shock protein cognate  <dig> and heat shock protein  <dig> were dysregulated with the expression of htoraΔe. in addition, we performed biochemical, behavioural, cellular and molecular biological, genetic, pharmacological and proteomics profiling analyses to provide several lines of evidence supporting the observation that upr activation and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress were the consequences of htoraΔe expression in drosophila.

fly genetics
uas-htorawt, uas-htoraΔe, tubulin-gal <dig>  c155-gal <dig>  <cit> , xbp1k13803/cyo and uas-xbp1-egfp  <cit>  were previously characterised. tubulin-gal <dig>  uas-htorawt/tm6b tb <dig> and uas-htoraΔe/cyo, p{gal4-kr.c}dc <dig>  p{uas-gfp.s65t}dc <dig> flies were generated via chromosome recombination. rnai flies for xbp <dig>  hsc <dig>  activation transcription factor  <dig>  and pancreatic elf-2a kinase  and x box binding protein −1k13803/cyo were obtained from the vienna drosophila rnai center  and the bloomington stock centre. uas-actin-gfp  flies were obtained from bloomington stock centre. uas-dtor-cdna  flies were generated by cloning full length dtor-cdna into puast germ line transformation vectors. flies were reared on a standard drosophila medium in a 16 h light – 8 h dark cycle at 25 ± 1°c and 60 ± 1% relative humidity.

2-dimensional electrophoresis
as described in koh et al.  <cit> , tubulin-gal4/uas-htorawt and uas-htoraΔe/+; tubulin-gal4/+ flies collected from three different independent crosses were raised at 30°c for accelerating aging. proteins were extracted from 10 day old adult fly heads by grinding for 5 min using a manual pestle in 100 μl lysis buffer  chaps, 40 mm tris–hcl , 10 mm edta,  <dig> % ipg buffer  with protease inhibitor cocktail . next, 300 μl of lysis buffer was added, the solution was centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm  for 10 min and the supernatants were collected. the concentrations of proteins were quantified using the bradford assay. a total of 200 μg of proteins were applied on immobilised linear gradient strips  using the ipgphor system . after rehydration for 12 hr, focusing was performed in the following three steps: 200 v for 1 hr, 500 v for 1 hr and a final phase of  <dig>  v for 8 hr. after the reduction and alkylation, proteins were achieved by incubating strips for 15 min while shaking in  <dig>  m tris–hcl buffer , and the second dimension was run on a 12% poly-acrylamide sds gel using an ethan dalt electrophoresis kit . two-d gels stained with  <dig> % coomassie brilliant blue r <dig> were scanned with a powerlook iii image scanner  and analysed using progenesis editor software  with the exclusion filter set manually. the total number of protein spots on the  <dig> gels ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the normalised volumes of the protein spots from three different comparisons were analysed using one-way anova  to select protein spots for subsequent analyses.

identification of proteins in differentially expressed protein spots
seven differentially expressed spots were excised from the gels, washed with 10 mm nh4hco <dig> and 50% ch3cn , and digested in a buffer containing 50 mm nh4hco <dig>  5 mm cacl <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/ml trypsin gold  at 37°c for 12–16 h. the digested peptides were recovered by extraction twice with 50 mm nh4hco <dig> and 100% ch3cn. the resulting peptide extracts were pooled, lyophilised in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at 4°c for subsequent protein identification. the protocol for protein identification was published by lee et al.  <cit> . a nano lc/ms system consisting of a surveyor hplc system  and esi-quadruple it ms  equipped with a nano-esi source was used to perform the ms/ms experiments for protein identification. for desalting and concentration, 10 μl of digested sample was loaded by the auto sampler onto a c <dig> trap column  at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. to separate trapped peptides, the samples were back-flushed into a home-made microcapillary column  packed with c <dig> resin  in 75-μm silica tubing  using mobile phases, a and b, composed of 0% and 80% of ch3cn containing  <dig> % hco2h and  <dig> % ch3cooh, respectively.

the gradient initiated with 5% of the mobile phase b and 95% of the mobile phase a for 15 min. the mobile phase b was increased from 20% for 3 min, to 50% for 32 min, to 60% for 5 min, to 80% for 5 min, to 100% for 2 min and finally held at 100% for 8 min. the column was equilibrated and cleaned with 5% ch3cn for 10 min between running samples. the operating conditions for obtaining ms and ms/ms spectra were as follows: a capillary temperature of 220°c, an esi voltage of  <dig>  kv, and a collision energy setting at 35%. the three most abundant ms ions from ms were selected as peaks. mass spectrometric analysis was included with the ms/ms analysis of the three most abundant ions from ms and 180 second dynamic exclusion. the xcalibur data system  was used to control ms scan functions and hplc solvent gradients. ms/ms spectra were searched against the proteins extracted with drosophila from a non-redundant protein database at ncbi  using the sequest  searching algorithm from the bioworks  software package with the following parameters: a mass tolerance of  <dig>  da on the parent ion and  <dig>  da on the ms/ms, one missed cleavage per peptide allowed, and modifications of proteins were not considered. mass peak lists were analysed for the b and y ions. the search results were filtered using the cross-correlation score  and the normalised difference in cross-correlation scores . matched peptide sequences had to pass the following thresholds: 1) the uniqueness scores of matches  were at least  <dig>  and 2) minimum cross-correlation scores xcorr of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for charge states + <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig>  respectively. the search results were saved automatically. an srf file including the merging of proteins, filter and sort settings, ratios and protein area/height values was used to select and sort peptide/spectrum matches passing this set of criteria. proteins were identified using more than two peptides per spot.

oxidative and er stress sensitivity assay
to investigate the changes in oxidative and er stress in drosophila, a modified version of the oxidative and er stress protocol from meulener et al.  <cit>  and park et al.  <cit>  was used. briefly, each group of flies consisted of  <dig> males and  <dig> females that were 10 days old, which were transferred into a vial containing 1% agar, 5% sucrose with 20 mm paraquat  or 1% h2o <dig>  and kept at 25 ± 1°c and 60 ± 1% relative humidity. to induce er stress, each group of flies was transferred to a vial containing 1% agar, 5% sucrose with 12 μm tunicamycin , and 5 mm, 25 mm, or 100 mm dithiothreitol . flies were transferred to newly prepared tubes every other day. the number of dead flies was counted every 12 hours until 120 hours. ten-independent tests were performed for each genotype. two-sample t-tests were performed using minitab software . when the flies were treated with only 1% agar and 5% sucrose, there were no differences in survival rates between the htorawt- and htoraΔe-expressing flies . a kaplan-meier survival analysis was performed using r  software.

autophagy inhibitor treatments
to inhibit autophagy, each group of flies consisting of  <dig> males and  <dig> females that were 10 days old were transferred into a vial containing 1% agar, 5% sucrose with 10 mm 3-methyladenine , 40 μm wortmanin , and 40 μm ly <dig>  and kept at 25 ± 1°c and 60 ± 1% relative humidity as described previously  <cit> . the flies were transferred to newly prepared tubes every other day. the number of dead flies was counted every 12 hours. ten-independent tests were performed for each genotype. a kaplan-meier survival analysis was performed using r  software.

density gradient sub-cellular fractionation
to obtain microsomes derived from endoplasmic reticulum in drosophila brains, a modified version of the density gradient sub-cellular fractionation protocol from xia et al.  <cit>  and tan et al.  <cit>  was used. briefly, one hundred adult fly heads were grinded and placed in 390 μl ice-cold isotonic homogenisation medium  containing protease inhibitors . the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4°c to remove cellular debris and nuclei. the amounts of proteins in the supernatants were measured using the bca method, and equal amounts of proteins were used for further separations. the supernatant was then centrifuged in a s120at <dig> rotor at  <dig>  g for 1 hr at 4°c using a himac cs 120ex . the resultant vesicle pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of membrane suspension buffer . discontinuous iodixanol gradients were generated using 60% iodixanol  with dilution buffer  and set up in ultra-centrifuge tubes as follows: 40% iodixanol, 100 μl; 35% iodixanol, 150 μl; 30% iodixanol, 200 μl; 25% iodixanol, 350 μl; 20% iodixanol, 500 μl; 10% iodixanol, 450 μl; 5% iodixanol, 250 μl;  <dig> % iodixanol, 100 μl). the re-suspended vesicle fractions were loaded on top of the gradients and centrifuged in a s100at <dig> rotor at  <dig>  g for 3 hr at 4°c using a himac cs 120ex . the resulting gradient was harvested in 200 μl fractions. ten μl from  <dig> fractions was separated using 8% sds-page and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. to identify er fractions, the membranes were blotted with rat anti-hsc <dig> antibodies as described above.

protein extraction, sds-page and in-gel digestion
one hundred μl of density gradient solutions from fraction nos.  <dig> to  <dig> was boiled with sds sample buffer for 10 min and concentrated using vivaspin  <dig>  before loading onto 10% sds page gels. the gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue. each lane was split into  <dig> pieces that were digested individually with trypsin-gold  as described above. after incubation, digested peptides were extracted using an oasis hlb extraction cartridge with c <dig> resin . peptides in aqueous solution were loaded onto the columns washed with  <dig> % acetic acid/5% ch3cn and eluted in  <dig> % acetic acid/100% ch3cn. the peptide extracts were lyophilised in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at 4°c for subsequent identification and semi-quantification of proteins.

identification and semi-quantification of proteins present in hsc <dig> positive density gradient fractions using label-free proteomics
previously published label-free proteomic methods  <cit>  were modified and used. lyophilised peptides were resuspended in 20 μl of  <dig> % formic acid with  <dig> fmol/μl of massprep yeast enolase digestion standard  prior to lc/mse analysis. each sample was analysed in three independent experimental runs with lc/mse using a nanoacquity ultra pressure liquid chromatography  and a synapt q-time of flight  mass spectrometer equipped with a nanolockspray ion source . a mass prep digestion standard   was run before and after the samples to monitor sensitivity and quantity. two μl of sample was injected online onto a waters symmetry c <dig> trapping column  at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in  <dig> % formic acid for 5 min. peptides were eluted off the precolumn and separated by in-line gradient elution onto a 75 μm i.d. x 200 mm length column packed with beh <dig> c <dig> resin,  <dig>  μm particle size, at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using a linear gradient from  <dig> to 45% b over 55 min , followed by 25 min rinses at 90% b. the column was re-equilibrated with 3% b for 20 minutes prior to the next run. all column temperatures were maintained at 35°c. the mass accuracy was maintained during the run using nanolockspray of the peptide -fibrinopeptide b delivered through the auxiliary pump of nanoacquity at a concentration of  <dig> fmol/μl and a flow rate of 500 nl/min. the peptides were analysed in positive ion mode and were operated in v-mode with a typical resolving power of  <dig>  fwhm. prior to the analyses, the tof analyser was calibrated using -fibrinopeptide b fragments that were obtained using a collision energy of 30 ev and over the mass range 50–1990 m/z. the q-tof was operated in the lc/mse mode of acquisition. the mse mode was programmed to acquire data with a proprietary dual exact mass protocol. the two acquisition functions were rapidly alternated between low and elevated collision energies. one second scans of low and elevated high collision energy resulted in the acquisition of a time-resolved global protein expression dataset containing two data functions; the first was composed exclusively of conventional, low energy ms spectra , and the second was composed of mass spectra acquired at an elevated high collision energy . low energy data collections were performed at a constant collision energy of 4 ev, and high collision energy acquisitions were performed using a 15–40 ev ramping. the -fibrinopeptide at a concentration of  <dig> fmol/μl  was infused via the nanolockspray ion source at a flow rate of 500 nl/min and sampled every 30 s as an external mass calibrant. for each injection, the mass spectrometer acquired data from  <dig> to 90 min. the water protein expression system informatics incorporated in proteinlynx global server version  <dig>   was used to process all raw data files. each processed file was then searched against the drosophila melanogaster protein database obtained from uniprot  with saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase  appended. protein identifications from the low/high collision spectra for each sample were processed using a hierarchical approach where detection of at least  <dig> fragment ion matches per peptide,  <dig> fragment ion matches per protein and  <dig> peptide matches per protein were required. the fixed and variable modifications considered were carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues and oxidation of methionine, respectively, with one allowable missed cleavage. all proteins identified with high confidence and with more than two peptides were considered for protein quantification. in relative protein quantitative analyses, multiple normalised global expression datasets were compared and contrasted. exact mass retention time  signatures enabled all detected proteins to be uniquely identified. the emrt signatures of any two global expression datasets to be compared were matched. the normalised intensity of each emrt signature was indicative of the abundance of a specific tryptic peptide. each protein in a global expression dataset was represented by multiple peptides, so the relative quantitation of any protein was calculated by comparing an average and relative protein fold-change of multiple matched emrt signatures. we considered significantly regulated proteins with a likelihood of quantification smaller than  <dig> . the entire data set of differentially expressed proteins was further filtered by considering the identified peptides that replicated two out of three technical instrument replicates with an over  <dig> protein probability score . the label-free semi-quantification results of density gradient fractions were summarised in additional file  <dig> 

life span analysis of the htoraΔe flies with down-regulated upr sensors and inducers in the neuronal system
the expression of hsc <dig>  xbp <dig>  atf <dig> and pek in the neuronal systems of the flies was down-regulated by crossing rnai construct flies with pan-neuronal gal <dig> drivers, c155-gal <dig>  the levels of transcripts of each gene down-regulated by its rnai flies were confirmed using qrt-pcr . among  <dig> lines of the hsc3-rnai flies tested, only one line that gave rise to the adult flies when crossed with c155-gal <dig> driver flies was used to test the consequences of down-regulated hsc <dig> at the neuronal systems with  or without htoraΔe . the xbp1-rnai and the xbp1k13803/cyo flies previously characterised  <cit>  were used in this study to examine the consequences of a reduced amount of xbp <dig> in fly brains with or without htoraΔe. the atf6-rnai and the pek-rnai flies were crossed with the pan-neuronal gal <dig> flies with or without htoraΔe-expression, and then the consequences were examined. the numbers of live flies in 12 ~  <dig> vials of each genotype were counted every 3 ~ 4 days. only female flies raised at 25°c were used for this analysis. a kaplan-meier survival analysis was performed using r  software.

significantly increased hsc <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins in htoraΔe-expressing brains
htora belongs to the aaa+ atpase family and localises to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . the consequence of a Δe mutation in htora was a preferential localisation of the htora aggregates at the nuclear envelope  and in the er in diverse animal and cellular models  <cit> . we further verified the increased expression of hsc <dig> and hsp <dig> in the htoraΔe-expressing brains compared to the htorawt-expressing brains by performing western blot analysis using rat anti-hsc <dig> and rabbit anti-hsp <dig> antibodies. the hsc <dig> proteins in the htoraΔe-expressing brains were increased  <dig> -fold compared to the levels expressed in the htorawt-expressing brains. however, hsc <dig> proteins in act-egfp expressing brains were similar to those of htorawt-expressing brains . we also further tested whether expression of drosophila torsin  induced any change in hsc <dig> expression. even dtor proteins in dtor overexpressing brains were increased  <dig> -fold compared to the levels of tub-gal4/+ control flies, there was no change in hsc <dig> expression . in addition, hsp <dig> proteins were detected from only the htoraΔe flies in normal condition , and a  <dig> -fold increase of hsp <dig> was observed in the htoraΔe-expressing brains compared to the htorawt-expressing brains following heat shock . these data confirmed that the amount of hsc <dig> and hsp <dig> were increased in the htoraΔe-expressing brains.figure  <dig> the htoraΔe-expressing flies had significantly increased hsc <dig> and hsp <dig> in their brains.  when the amounts of hsc <dig> were normalised with α-tubulin as a loading control, the htoraΔe-expressing brains had  <dig> -fold more hsc <dig> than those of the htorawt-expressing brains. however, actin-enhanced green fluorescence protein  expressing flies showed similar expression levels of hsc <dig>   in normal condition, hsp <dig> was detected from only the crude mitochondrial fraction of the htoraΔe-expressing brains and it was  <dig> -fold more abundant in the crude mitochondrial fraction of the htoraΔe -expressing brains than that of the htorawt-expressing brains before or following a heat shock. * = p <  <dig> .



transcripts of hsc <dig> and hsp <dig> were increased in htoraΔe-expressing brains
on the basis of the proteomic results for hsc <dig> and hsp <dig>  we next checked their transcript levels compared to those of controls by performing quantitative real-time pcr . the transcripts of hsc <dig>  tsf <dig> and hsp <dig> in the htoraΔe-expressing fly brains were significantly higher than those in the htorawt-expressing fly brains, but there was no difference in transcript levels of scp <dig> between the htorawt- and the htoraΔe-expressing brains . because hsc <dig> has two very closely related genes  in the fly genome, we confirmed that there were no differences in the levels of expression of hsc <dig> and hsc <dig> transcripts between the htorawt- or the htoraΔe-expressing brains.figure  <dig> transcripts of hsc <dig>  hsp <dig>  tsf <dig> and ire1-dependent spliced xbp <dig> and xbp1-egfp signals were significantly increased in the htoraΔe-expressing brains. quantitative-rt-pcr results of genes encoding proteins displaying the largest alterations in expression in the 2-de analysis.  only the transcripts of heat shock protein cognate  <dig>  but not those of hsc <dig> and hsc <dig> were significantly increased in the htoraΔe flies.  the transcripts of transferrin <dig> , heat shock protein  <dig> , and sarcoplasimc calcium binding protein  were not changed.  the amount of the ire1-dependent spliced form of xbp <dig> mrna  was increased in the htoraΔe brains.  compared with htorawt, expression of htoraΔe induced increased expression of xbp1-egfp in drosophila heads. α-tubulin was used as a loading control.  the normalised amount of the xbp1-egfp band in the htoraΔe expressing brains was  <dig> -fold higher than that in the htorawt-expressing brains.



increased ire1-dependent spliced x-box binding protein  <dig>  mrna in the htoraΔe-expressing brains
previous studies have shown that the transcripts of hsc <dig> and hsp <dig> are increased when flies are exposed to er stress that activates the upr  <cit>  and oxidative stress  <cit> , respectively. to determine whether the upr in the htoraΔe-expressing flies was induced, the levels of unspliced and ire1-dependent spliced forms of x-box binding protein  <dig>  mrna were examined using performing qrt-pcr. previous studies in drosophila have shown that the levels of an ire1-dependent spliced form of xbp <dig> mrna are increased upon activation of the upr  <cit> . the levels of unspliced xbp <dig> mrna were similar between the htorawt- and the htoraΔe-expressing brains. in contrast, the level of spliced xbp <dig> mrna was significantly increased in the htoraΔe-expressing brains compared with those of the htorawt-expressing flies . these results suggest that htoraΔe initiates the upr in the er.

to further confirm that the ire1-dependent splicing of xbp <dig> mrna was induced by htoraΔe, we used a xbp1-egfp reporter that allowed egfp to be expressed only when a 23 bp intron was spliced out of the xbp1-egfp construct by ire <dig> in the er  <cit> . compared with protein extracts of the brains of the control flies , the brains of the htoraΔe-expressing flies  showed significantly increased amounts of xbp1-egfp signals that were detected using anti-gfp antibodies . these results show that htoraΔe activates the upr through ire1-dependent splicing of xbp <dig> mrna.

increased oxidative and er stresses in the htoraΔe-expressing flies
the altered transcription and protein expression of hsc <dig> and hsp <dig> in the htoraΔe-expressing fly brains suggested that the htoraΔe-expressing flies might have altered susceptibilities to oxidative and/or er stress. previous studies have shown that the susceptibility of flies to oxidative stress can be determined by treating them with h2o <dig> or paraquat  <cit> . when flies were reared on foods containing 1% h2o <dig>  the htoraΔe-expressing flies exhibited significantly more susceptibility to h2o2-induced oxidative stress than the htorawt-expressing flies . the hazard ratio  of the htoraΔe-expressing flies was  <dig>  compared with the htorawt-expressing flies. in addition, the hr of the htoraΔe-expressing flies was  <dig>  compared with the htorawt-expressing flies when exposed to 20 mm paraquat .figure  <dig> increased sensitivities to oxidative and er stressors and autophagy inhibitors in the htoraΔe flies.  the hazard ratio  of the htoraΔe expressing flies reared on fly food containing 1% h2o <dig> was  <dig>  times increased compared to those of the htorawt expressing flies.  the htoraΔe-expressing flies also showed  <dig>  times increased hr to 20 mm paraquat induced oxidative stress.  when er stress was induced using 12 mm tunicamycin, the hr of the htoraΔe-expressing flies was  <dig>  times increased compared with the htorawt-expressing flies.  when a protein disulfide bond reducing compound dtt was applied with three different concentrations, including 5 mm , 25 mm , and 100 mm , there was no difference in hr between the htorawt and the htoraΔe-expressing flies.  the htoraΔe flies were vulnerable to autophagy inhibitors, 10 mm 3-ma , 40 μm wortmannin , and 40 μm ly <dig>  compared with the htorawt flies. hr = hazard ratio, 95% ci = 95% confident intervals of hazard ratio.



the hr of the htoraΔe-expressing flies to tunicamycin induced er stress was  <dig>  compared with the htorawt-expressing flies . however, there was no difference in dithiothreitol  sensitivity between the htorawt- and the htoraΔe-expressing flies when the flies were treated with 5 mm, 25 mm or 100 mm dtt . because tunicamycin and dtt have been known to activate upr signalling by a different mechanism, these results suggest that htoraΔe may induce the activation of specific pathways in the upr.

htoraΔe-expressing flies showed increased sensitivities to autophagy inhibitors
in a previous study, we showed that protein aggregates induced by htoraΔe localised to the nuclear membrane, mitochondria, synapses, single membrane lysosomes and double membrane autophagosomes  <cit> . because mutations that are known to cause defects in autophagy are related to various neurological disorders  <cit> , we further investigated whether htoraΔe flies showed altered sensitivities to  <dig> different autophagy inhibitors . these results suggested that formations of autophagosomes in htoraΔe flies may be involved in protecting flies from htoraΔe induced toxicities.

altered transcript levels of atf <dig>  calreticulin, drosophila glucose regulated protein  <dig> , activating transcription factor  <dig> , and components of the erad pathway in the htoraΔe-expressing brains
to further investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying upr activation in the htoraΔe-expressing brains, the levels of transcripts of three upr inducers and er-stress  and upr target genes   <cit>  were quantified and compared with those of the htorawt-expressing brains by performing qrt-pcr . of the three upr inducers, the transcript level of atf <dig> was significantly increased in the htoraΔe-expressing flies . the expression of the stress-responsive activating transcription factor- <dig> , a downstream regulator of the upr genes that is activated by drosophila perk , was significantly increased . in addition, the transcription levels of calreticulin, erp <dig>  pdi, drosophila homologue of grp <dig> , and p58ipk were significantly different, whereas those of calnexin 99a, gp <dig> , and drosophila homologue of sil <dig>  were the same between the two fly groups . among the erad components tested, the transcripts of hrd <dig>  hrd <dig>  derlin- <dig>  edem <dig>  and edem <dig> were also significantly different .figure  <dig> transcripts of some er stress sensors, chaperones, components of erad, and atg8b were significantly altered in the htoraΔe-expressing brains. the amount of atf <dig>  atf <dig>  calreticulin

 transcripts in the htoraΔe-expressing brains was significantly different from those of the htorawt-expressing brains.



because the htoraΔe flies showed significantly increased susceptibilities to autophagy inhibitors , we also examined any change in the expression of autophagy-related genes  in the htoraΔe flies. among  <dig> atgs tested, only atg8b was found to have a significant difference in expression . taken together, the qrt-pcr results indicated that the three upr inducers in the er were activated by htoraΔe and that the expression of certain er chaperones, nucleotide exchange factors, erad components and atg8b was also induced.

hsc <dig> positive density gradient fractions of htoraΔe and htorawt microsomes harboured different protein profiles
in addition to their functions as er stress chaperones  <cit> , bip and its homologues are involved in many molecular chaperone activities in the er, such as importing newly synthesised proteins across the er membrane, increasing the possibility of the correct protein folding, assembly and oligomerisation of the newly synthesised proteins, and controlling ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> . because several lines of evidence in this study suggested that the htoraΔe expression in fly brains may activate the upr in the er and perturb er homeostasis, we reasoned that the biophysical and biochemical properties of the er in the htoraΔe flies might be different than those in the htorawt flies. we directly addressed this question by obtaining er microsomes via density gradient ultra-centrifugation followed by anti-hsc <dig> western blot analysis and profiling the constituent proteins in those fractions via lc/mse proteomic analysis. interestingly, the fraction nos. 9– <dig> obtained from htorawt contained hsc <dig>  whereas the fraction nos. 8– <dig> from htoraΔe were hsc <dig> positive . in addition, the fractions that had the most abundant hsc <dig> immunoreactivity were no.  <dig> in the htorawt-expressing brains versus no.  <dig> in the htoraΔe-expressing brains. because sedimentation equilibrium density is known to be determined by the sizes, densities, and molecular weights of the proteins comprising macromolecular complexes, differences in the intensities of hsc <dig> signals in the microsome fractions of the htoraΔe- and the htorawt-expressing brains suggested that the diversity and quantity of the proteins in the hsc <dig> positive microsomes might differ from each other.figure  <dig> the distribution patterns of hsc <dig> in optiprep density gradient factions acquired from the htoraΔe-expressing brains were different from those of the htorawt-expressing brains.  hsc <dig> was present in fraction nos. 9– <dig> in the htorawt-expressing brains, with the strongest signals in fraction no.  <dig>  however, hsc <dig> was detected from fraction nos. 8– <dig> in the htoraΔe-expressing brains with the strongest signals found in fraction no.  <dig>   proteins identified from fraction  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> from the htoraΔe-expressing brains were different from those form the htorawt-expressing brains.  when all proteins identified from faction  <dig> to  <dig> were pooled, fractions from htoraΔe-expressing brains had  <dig> genes that were increased or unique, whereas  <dig> genes were increased or unique from the htorawt-expressing brains. gene ontology profiles for functions  and pathways  were displayed, respectively.



indeed,  <dig> proteins in fractions no.  <dig>   <dig> proteins in fractions no.  <dig>   <dig> proteins in fractions no.  <dig>  and  <dig> proteins in fractions no.  <dig> from the htoraΔe and the htorawt microsomes were identified using lc/mse . eight,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins in fractions no.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were increased or detected in the htoraΔe microsomes, and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins in fractions no.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were decreased or not detected in the htoraΔe microsomes. greater numbers and types of proteins were present in the htoraΔe microsomes than in the htorawt, suggesting that htoraΔe in the er may impair the trafficking and secretion of proteins resulting in er overloads, which is another known er stressor.

the quantitatively and qualitatively altered proteins in each fraction were divided into groups according to gene ontology  molecular functions using panther version  <dig>   <cit>  and amigo, the gene ontology   <cit>  . of the proteins that were increased or unique to the htoraΔe-expressing brains,  <dig> % of the annotated proteins in fraction  <dig> had binding activity , whereas  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the annotated proteins in fractions no.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, had catalytic activity . other proteins had structural molecule activity , translation regulator activity , transporter activity , ion channel activity , receptor activity , enzyme regulator activity , motor activity , and transcription regulator activity  . furthermore, of the proteins that were decreased or not present in the htoraΔe-expressing brains,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the annotated proteins from fractions no.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, had catalytic activity . in addition, the proteins with structural molecule activity  were consistently decreased in all lanes. other decreased proteins had binding activity , ion channel activity , receptor activity , and transporter activity  . when all proteins from fractions no.  <dig> to  <dig> were combined for comparison,  <dig> proteins were increased or unique to htoraΔe microsomes. among  <dig> annotated proteins,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % had catalytic activity , binding activity  and structural molecule activity , respectively. of the  <dig> proteins decreased or not present in the htoraΔe microsomes,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the  <dig> annotated proteins had catalytic activity  and binding activity , respectively .

the dysregulated proteins in the er microsomes were further characterised by their association with  <dig> regulatory and metabolic pathways in the panther pathway  <dig>   <cit> . the following pathways had more than  <dig> genes associated with them when up-/down-regulated genes were considered simultaneously: the huntington’s disease pathway , the cytoskeletal regulation by rho gtpase pathway , the inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signalling pathway , the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling pathway , the alzheimer’s disease-presenilin pathway , the cadherin signaling pathway , the wnt signaling pathway  and the atp synthesis pathway  . these profiling results indicated that htoraΔe in the er involved defects in the synthesis, modification, folding, assembly and trafficking of secretory and membrane proteins that translocate to the cell surface or to intracellular organelles.

down-regulation of hsc <dig>  xbp <dig>  atf <dig> and pek in the htoraΔe flies induced a significantly earlier death
to understand the physiological consequences of upr activation in the htoraΔe flies, we genetically down-regulated the expression of hsc <dig>  xbp <dig>  atf <dig> or pek in the htoraΔe flies using rnai flies for each gene . when the expression of hsc <dig> was down-regulated in the htoraΔe flies by rnai constructs, its hr was  <dig>  or  <dig>  compared with c155/+; uas-htoraΔΕ/+ or c155/+; uas-hsc3-rnai flies, respectively . we further examined the consequences of the down-regulated expression of xbp <dig> by expressing xbp1-rnai constructs or using the xbp <dig> mutant chromosome xbp1k <dig> in the htoraΔe flies. the down-regulation of xbp <dig> expression by xbp1-rnai constructs or mutant chromosome xbp1k <dig> in c155/+; uas-htoraΔΕ/+ significantly increased the hr to  <dig>  or  <dig>  compared with c155/+; uas-htoraΔΕ/+, respectively . the hr of those flies were  <dig>  or  <dig>  when compared with c155/+; uas-xbp1-rnai or c155/+; xbp1k <dig> flies, respectively . the effect of down-regulation of atf <dig> by rnai in htor1aΔe flies was less pronounced but also resulted in a significant induction of early death. the hr of c155/+; uas-htoraΔΕ/uas-atf6-rnai flies were  <dig>  and  <dig>  compared with c155/+;uas-htoraΔΕ/+ or c155/+; uas-atf6-rnai/+ flies . in addition, the down-regulation of pek by pek-rnai in c155/+;uas-htoraΔΕ flies induced a significantly earlier death of the flies. the hr of c155/+;uas-htoraΔe/uas-pek-rnai were  <dig>  or  <dig>  compared with c155/+;uas-htoraΔe/+ or c155/+;uas-pek-rnai .figure  <dig> down-regulation of hsc <dig>  xbp <dig>  atf <dig> and pek induced early death of the htoraΔe flies.  when hsc <dig> expression was down-regulated by hsc-rnai, it resulted in the induction of early death for the htoraΔe flies.  down-regulation of xbp <dig> by mutant chromosome, xbp1

discussion
the aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular and cellular consequences of htoraΔe in drosophila brains to gain insight into the pathogenesis of dyt <dig> dystonia. the most interesting finding was that the expression of the er molecular chaperone hsc <dig> and a mitochondria specific chaperone hsp <dig> were significantly increased in the htoraΔe-expressing brains obtained from unbiased 2-de analysis . those alterations were further verified using western blot and qrt-pcr analyses .

three axes of upr signaling in the htoraΔe brains may be activated
the er chaperone hsc <dig>  is a member of the hsp <dig> protein superfamily and is known to be a drosophila homologue of bip  <cit> . similar to bip and its homologues in metazoans, hsc <dig> has been shown to act as an er stress regulator in flies  <cit> . for example, the up-regulation of hsc <dig> upon activation of the upr has been shown in drosophila models of adrp  <cit> , congenital glaucoma  <cit> , and parkinson disease  <cit> . similar to those models, we found additional key evidence that upr activation increased the transcript levels of the ire1-dependent spliced form of xbp <dig>  and the xbp1-egfp signal . although the amount of ire <dig> and pek mrnas was not altered, the mrnas of atf <dig> and atf <dig> were significantly increased in the htoraΔe brains . in contrast to the other two upr inducers that activate downstream transcription factors, xbp <dig> and atf <dig>  atf <dig> is transported to golgi complexes where it is processed into an n-terminal 50 kda active form that translocalises and activates the transcription of the er stress response genes  encoding molecular chaperones and enzymes regulating protein folding and disulfide formation   <cit> . thus, the increase of atf <dig> transcripts could be interpreted as the activation of the upr. further confirmation of upr activation in htoraΔe flies was obtained by genetically reducing the expression of upr sensors and inducers in the htoraΔe fly brains . the down-regulation of hsc <dig>  xbp <dig> and pek induced a significantly earlier death in the flies. although the effects of atf <dig> down-regulation were not as pronounced as those of hsc <dig>  xbp <dig> and pek, it also induced a significant increase in hr . taken together, our results suggest that all three upr inducers may be activated in the htoraΔe brains.figure  <dig> the three axes of the upr in drosophila brains activated by htoraΔe. htorawt may not induce activation of the upr in er. however, htoraΔe may induce activation of the three axes of the upr signalling pathway by directly binding to hsc <dig> or by impairing protein trafficking and secretion from the er that results in er overload. the amounts of transcripts of the ire1-dependent spliced xbp <dig>  aft <dig>  and atf <dig> are consequently increased and initiate transcriptional up-regulation of er-stress and upr target genes, including hsc <dig>  xbp <dig>  components of erad, er chaperone, disulfide bond proteins, oxidative stress response proteins, and atg8b in drosophila brains. consequently, the htoraΔe flies showed an increased susceptibility to oxidative and er stress and a prolonged upr activation compared with the htorawt flies.



increased transcripts of erse and upre in the htoraΔe brains
one of the enigmatic observations reported from dyt <dig> dystonia is the absence of obvious pathological lesions in postmortem dyt <dig> brains  <cit> . similarly, the htoraΔe fly brains do not display any obvious neurodegenerative abnormalities  <cit> , suggesting that the presence of the htoraΔe aggregates in fly brains may not be sufficient to induce apoptosis; however, these aggregates may be sufficient to activate certain adaptive upr signalling pathways that enable neurons to overcome the toxic effects caused by the accumulation of htoraΔe in the ne and the er. interestingly, we found that the htoraΔe flies showed some differences in sensitivity to two er stressors, tunicamycin and dtt . the htoraΔe were significantly more susceptible to tunicamycin, which inhibits the activity of udp-n-acetylglucosamine-dolichol phosphate n-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase, but not to dtt, which inhibits the formation of disulfide bonds. this observation suggests that other unknown pathways, which were not tested in this study, may exist. in addition, among the er chaperones, enzymes and nucleotide exchange factors that are known to respond with up-regulation upon activation of the upr in mammalian cells  <cit> , the calreticulin, p58ipk, erp <dig>  pdi, and dgrp <dig> transcripts were significantly increased . the increased expression of pdi at the protein level was confirmed by performing protein profiling and semi-quantification analysis in hsc <dig> positive microsomes  and may explain why the htoraΔe flies did not show dtt sensitivities as pdi activity is important for maintaining dtt resistance in yeast  <cit> . thus, htoraΔe in brains may induce a mild activation of the three branches of the upr signalling pathway that are sufficient to induce the expression of some of the erse and upr target genes , allowing neurons to overcome and adapt to survival with htoraΔe .

degradation of htoraΔe by erad and autophagosome in drosophila
another known consequence of upr activation is the degradation of mis-/unfolded proteins by two protein quality control pathways, including erad and autophagy  <cit> . a recent study in drosophila showed that the over-expression of erad components suppressed the onset of retinal degeneration in the drosophila adrp model by reducing misfolded, mutated rh- <dig> proteins  <cit> . thus, the increased transcription levels of components of the erad  in the htoraΔe fly brains suggest that misfolded htoraΔe might be metabolised by the erad pathway. these misfolded proteins may be exported from the er and degraded by proteasomes in the cytosol. interestingly, a recent study using a dyt <dig> neuronal cell line model demonstrated that htoraΔe was degraded by both the proteasome and the macroautophagy-lysosome pathway and that htorawt was mainly degraded by the macroautophagy-lysosome pathway  <cit> . we also provided several lines of evidence suggesting the involvement of autophagy in htoraΔe degradation. first, we observed increased transcription levels of atg8b, which shares 82% amino acid sequence identity and 94% similarity with atg8a, another drosophila homologue of lc3s  <cit> . the overexpression of atg8a has been shown to extend the life span and resistance to oxidative stress in flies  <cit> . however, the consequences of atg8b loss or gain of function mutations remain unknown. nevertheless, both the  <dig> -fold increase of atg8b transcription levels present in the htoraΔe brains  and the increased susceptibility to autophagy inhibitors in the htoraΔe flies  suggest that autophagosomes may be increased in the htoraΔe brains and play a pivotal role in the metabolism of htoraΔe. furthermore, in a previous study, we showed that the htoraΔe aggregates in flies are colocalised with a lysosome marker and present within the double membrane structures at em levels that are similar to autophago-lysosomes  <cit> .

hsp <dig>  sensitivity to oxidative stress and the proteins involved in atp synthesis, glycolysis and the tca cycles were altered in the microsomes of htoraΔe flies
drosophila hsp <dig> is a small heat shock chaperone known to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and carcinogenesis  <cit> . in addition, hsp <dig> has been shown to be induced in response to acute heat and oxidative stress and is increased with normal aging in flies  <cit> . the over-expression of hsp <dig> in flies was sufficient to increase resistance to oxidative stress and extend life span  <cit> . thus, transcriptional and translational increases of hsp <dig> in the htoraΔe-expressing brains  may be one of the molecular consequences for overcoming htoraΔe-induced defects that might be similar to the defects induced by acute heat and oxidative stress to brains. considering this observation together with the activation of the upr may help to explain why the htoraΔe-expressing flies had similar life spans to those of the htorawt-expressing flies and why they did not manifest severe dystonic symptoms under normal conditions despite the presence of protein aggregates at the ne, the er and the mitochondria and structural defects at the synapses  <cit> . the increased hsp <dig> in the htoraΔe flies might compensate for those defects caused by the presence of htoraΔe under normal conditions. however, if the htoraΔe flies were exposed to additional environmental stressors that usually do not induce severe defects in the htorawt flies because of the protections afforded by hsp <dig> induction, the htoraΔe flies would be susceptible to those stresses because hsp <dig> is no longer protecting the neurons and the brains. indeed, we presented additional evidence to support this notion, such as the increased oxidative stress sensitivity of the htoraΔe-expressing flies  and the altered levels of proteins associated with atp synthesis, glycolysis and the tca cycle in hsc <dig> positive microsomes . in addition, our hypothesis and observation were further supported by recent studies showing that proteins involved in energy metabolism and the redox state were altered in human neuronal cell lines over-expressing htoraΔe  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have provided several lines of evidence that strongly indicate that htoraΔe in fly brains may induce prolonged activation of the upr . because the expression of htora was not induced by treatment of the pc <dig> cell line  <cit> , the human kidney cell line  <cit> , or the human glioblastoma cell line  <cit>  with er stressors, it may not belong to the group of er chaperones that are up-regulated upon upr activation. moreover, recent studies utilising fibroblasts from dyt <dig> dystonia patients  <cit>  suggest that htora is an er molecular chaperone that regulates the trafficking and secretion of membranes and/or secretory proteins. the fact that treatment with tunicamycin was enough to induce the upr activation but that neither htorawt nor htoraΔe-expression in a human glioblastoma cell line did so  <cit>  suggested that the expression of htoraΔe may not be sufficient for the activation of the upr in this tumor cell line system. how can we explain the discrepancy between our results and those reported from the dyt <dig> cellular models? a wide variety of tumours, such as glioblastomas, melanomas, and breast and cervical cancers activate the upr to allow tumour cells to adapt and survive under certain conditions  <cit> , and the expression of htoraΔe in tumour cell lines may not be sufficient to further induce the activation of the upr. similar to our results, the overexpression of htoraΔe in c. elegans induced the increased expression of its bip homolog hsp- <dig> tagged with gfp and ire1-dependent spliced xbp- <dig> mrna even before tunicamycin treatment  <cit> . furthermore, the decreased export of reporter proteins from dyt <dig> dystonia fibroblasts compared to those of normal fibroblasts  <cit>  could be explained as the activation of the upr by er overload because the protein overload is a physiological er stressor that could initiate upr activation in the er  <cit> . thus, it will be intriguing to examine upr activation and the alteration of hsp <dig> orthologs in the brains of dyt <dig> patients and available tg mouse models. further utilisation of the htoraΔe-expressing fly brains will reveal unknown in vivo molecular and cellular consequences.
