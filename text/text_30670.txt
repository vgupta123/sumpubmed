BACKGROUND
lignosus rhinocerotis  ryvarden, which belongs to the family of polyporaceae, is characterized by a centrally stipitate pilei arising from its distinct tuber-like sclerotium. this mushroom is widely used by natives of southeast asia as a general health tonic for immune enhancement, or as a treatment regime for numerous ailments including cancer, asthma, and bronchitis. it is also used to treat discomfort caused by fright, fever, coughing, vomiting, and cuts  <cit> . the sclerotium is the part of l. rhinocerotis with medicinal value. it is a compact mass of hardened fungal mycelium and represents one of the stages in the fungal life cycle. this structure is a morphologically variable, nutrient-rich, multihyphal aggregate that serves as a food reserve and can remain dormant until favourable growth conditions arise  <cit> . different developmental stages of l. rhinocerotis are shown in figure  <dig>  a two weeks culture of mycelial growth is shown in figure 1a. expansion of the mycelium by repeated branching of the germ tube  eventually develops into a circular form known as the “tiger-eyes”. cross-linking of the radiating hyphae facilitates nutrient uptake and mobilization around the growing mycelium. after four to six months, the vigorous mycelial growth promotes the development of the sclerotium . this is often spherical in shape with a dark and tough outer skin that keeps the internal compacted hyphal mass from drying out . the stipe of the mushroom was formed after 12 months culturing, which was preceded by formation of the pileus . in malaysia, isolates of l. rhinocerotis have been found in penang island, cameron highlands, hulu langat, and gerik. all of these isolates showed high nucleotide sequence identity  in their internal transcribed spacer  gene regions  <cit> .figure  <dig>

this mushroom is rich in carbohydrates and dietary fiber with moderate amounts of protein while being low in fat  <cit> . previous research reported the medical benefits of l. rhinocerotis against hypertension, cancer cell cytotoxicity along with enhancement of immunomodulatory activity and antioxidant properties . the non-digestible carbohydrates of polyporus rhinocerus, a synonym for l. rhinocerotis, was also reported as a potential novel prebiotic for gastrointestinal health  <cit> . the recent interests in the nutrition and biopharmacology of l. rhinocerotis signalled for an immediate need to decipher its biochemical functions, at the genetic level and the identification of its bioactive components.

rapid advancements in technology has led to the sequencing of numerous fungal genomes with the fungal kingdom becoming one of the most sequenced amongst the eukaryotes  <cit> . this is not unexpected due to their importance in industry, agriculture, medical, and health. however, the publicly available genome sequences of macrofungi, especially medicinal mushrooms, are still relatively scarce compared to the plant pathogenic and wood-degrading basidiomycetes or to ascomyceteous microfungi. a recent example is the genome sequence of the medicinal mushroom ganoderma lucidum  by chen et al. and liu et al. where the genes in the triterpene biosynthesis and wood degradation pathways were described  <cit> . other genomes of edible mushrooms include volvariella volvacea  by bao et al.  <cit>  and agaricus bisporus  by foulongne-oriol et al.  <cit> .

in this paper, we present the de novo draft genome sequence of l. rhinocerotis tm <dig> sclerotium. the recent availability of several genome sequences of polyporaceous fungi, especially from the jgi csp saprotrophic agaricomycotina project  <cit> , has allowed us to gain insights into the l. rhinocerotis genome through comparative analyses. we have also surveyed its secondary metabolite production capabilities and identified putative genes that may be involved in the biosynthesis of bioactive proteins and polysaccharides. to our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of the genomic features of l. rhinocerotis, an ethnobotanical mushroom of southeast asia.

RESULTS
genome features
genome sequencing of l. rhinocerotis sclerotium with more than 100× coverage produced a total of  <dig>  mb clean data which was further assembled into a  <dig>  mb draft genome . this consisted of  <dig>  scaffolds with n <dig> of  <dig>  bp and  <dig> % g + c content. using k-mer  analysis with an average insert size of 700 bp, these scaffolds were estimated to cover  <dig> % of the whole genome, which has an expected size of  <dig>  mb . the lower genome coverage can be attributed to the high repeat rate encountered in the assembly. the repeat rate of the number of contigs with lengths shorter than 100 bp and longer than 100 bp is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively  . heterozygosity is unlikely to be the major contribution to the lower genome coverage based on the 15-mer depth analysis   <cit> . the use of fosmid libraries for longer paired end reads , beyond the 5000 bp inserts we have used, may be required to overcome the high repeat rate. alternatively, the genome assembly can be improved in the future by construction of whole genome physical maps using an optical mapping system, as reported for g. lucidum
 <cit> . nonetheless, this draft genome allows a detailed analysis into the gene content, phylogeny, and metabolic pathways of l. rhinocerotis.table  <dig>

genome features


repeat elements
repeat elements of  <dig> diverse families make up about  <dig> % or  <dig> ,638 bp of the assembled genome of l. rhinocerotis, where  <dig> % of them are tandem repeat sequences and  <dig> % are transposable elements . the tandem repeats , not clearly associated with transposons, vary in copy number from  <dig>  to  <dig> . while among the retrotransposons, long terminal repeats  and non-ltr retrotransposons  make up  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome, respectively. dna transposons  comprised  <dig> % of the genome. the dna transposons elements were mainly categorized into three classes: enhancer , tigger , and activator .

gene prediction
the total  <dig>  predicted genes,  <dig> trnas,  <dig> snrnas and a single rrna together comprise  <dig> % of the assembled genome. gene density and the average size of protein coding genes are  <dig>  genes/10 kb and  <dig> .33 bp, respectively. among the trnas,  <dig> are possible pseudogenes, four with undetermined anticodons and the remaining  <dig> anti-codon trnas correspond to the  <dig> common amino acid codons. about half of the trnas  are predicted to not contain an intron. the genome size of l. rhinocerotis, its average gene length, the proportion of repeat sequences, and the average number of exons and introns were comparable to the recently sequenced polyporaceous g. lucidum genome  <cit> .

the l. rhinocerotis genome revealed a total of  <dig>  predicted genes that encode for hypothetical proteins with no apparent homologs to currently available sequences. this is indicative of the uniqueness of l. rhinocerotis. on the other hand, up to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes are homologous to known proteins in the ncbi nr, swissprot, interpro and trembl databases, respectively. these homologous proteins represent  <dig> % of the assembled genome.

we further mapped the genome to the eukaryotic clusters of orthologs , gene ontology , and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  databases to further characterize the predicted proteins. based on the phylogenetic classification of the kognitor,  <dig>  proteins  were assigned to kog . the r category for “general functional prediction only” , which has the most number of genes , indicates that these proteins were not unambiguously assigned to a certain group. this is followed by “carbohydrate transport and metabolism”, “transcription”, “replication, recombination and repair”, and “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” as the top five most abundant gene categories in the kog grouping. these findings suggest the presence of an enriched and varied array of carbohydrate uptake and metabolism mechanisms that can better facilitate the terrestrial substrate of l. rhinocerotis because such a lifestyle results in exposure to more diverse carbohydrate forms and sources as opposed to the wood saprophytes.figure  <dig>

the hits from interpro were used to map to the “cellular location”, “molecular function”, and “biological process” categories of go . go classification revealed that  <dig> %  of the predicted proteins were mainly assigned to “binding”, “physiological process”, “catalytic activity”, and “cellular process”. to provide a better understanding of the gene functions in l. rhinocerotis, we successfully assigned  <dig>   putative proteins to their orthologs in the kegg database . the top five categories in kegg pathway classification, with the highest numbers of annotated genes in l. rhinocerotis, are “genetic information processing - replication and repair”, “metabolism - xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism”, “genetic information processing - folding, sorting, and degradation”, “metabolism - carbohydrate metabolism”, and “metabolism - amino acid metabolism”.figure  <dig>

kegg-based comparative genomics analysis
kegg pathway annotations for seven medicinal basidiomycota fungi, consisting of five agaricomycetes , a basidiomycete  and tremellomycete , were selected for comprehensive comparison. l. rhinocerotis is relatively enriched with genes for catabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  such as “limonene and pinene degradation”, “indole alkaloid biosynthesis”, “penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis”, and “stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis”. however, l. rhinocerotis was predicted to have a relatively low number of genes associated with the biosynthesis of siderophore group nonribosomal peptides. the metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in l. rhinocerotis are further discussed in the subsection “secondary metabolism”.table  <dig>

the enzyme commission  number classification was used to link the respective enzyme genes to their repertoire of metabolic pathways  <cit> . in the fourth layer of the reference kegg pathway, l. rhinocerotis was found to have  <dig> putative enzymes that are two-fold greater than the other fungi compared . among them,  <dig> were mapped to “metabolism”, two for “genetic information processing” and one for “organismal systems” while two remain “unclassified” according to ko terms. there were another six enzymes that mapped to multiple sections in the first layer of kegg.

interestingly, a total of  <dig> enzymes are exclusive to l. rhinocerotis and not present in any other basidiomycota fungi compared . some of the exclusive enzymes participate in multiple ko classes. among them,  <dig> % are predicted to involve in “metabolism” where  <dig> % and  <dig> % play major roles in “amino acid metabolism” and “carbohydrate metabolism”, respectively. this is followed by “genetic information processing”  and “cellular processes” . about  <dig> % remain “unclassified” without mapping to any specific pathway.

phylogeny of l. rhinocerotis
in this study, we selected eight common kogs shared by l. rhinocerotis and  <dig> basidiomycota fungi plus three from ascomycota fungi for rooting the phylogenetic trees. the four phylogenetic methods according to kuramae et al. were employed  <cit> . the resulting single consensus tree gives highly supported internal branches of  <dig> to 100%, thus signifying the robustness of our dataset . support value of 99% was only observed in the branch of puccinia graminis to ustilago maydis while the others are 100%. phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> concatenated proteins present in the  <dig> genomes compared revealed a closer evolutionary relationship of l. rhinocerotis to g. lucidum, dichomitus squalens, and t. versicolor, all members of the polyporaceae family. the polyporales have been informally divided into several major clades, which include the antrodia, core polyporoid, and phlebiod clades that are well supported by a recent phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . l. rhinocerotis falls into the core polyporoid clade along with g. lucidum, d. squalens, and t. versicolor while w. cocos and fomitopsis pinicola belongs to a sister clade known as the antrodia clade.figure  <dig>

it should be noted that, although l. rhinocerotis falls into the same clade with g. lucidum, d. squalens, and t. versicolor, it is relatively distant from them and shows distinct morphological features. unlike the other white-rot members from the core polyporoid clade that grow on wood, l. rhinocerotis has a terrestrial growth habit similar to the brown-rot w. cocos with the development of an underground sclerotium  <cit> . the sclerotium of l. rhinocerotis is oblong to irregular shape and its fruiting body  is centrally stipitate with an isodiametric cap. on the other hand, the cap of g. lucidum and t. versicolor is offset and sometimes indistinct with either a bare stipe for the former or lacking one for both fungi. on the contrary, d. squalens has a basidiocarp with poroid hymenophore and lacks a stipe. although l. rhinocerotis shows similar growth habit to w. cocos with the presence of a sclerotium, the latter has resupinate fruiting body and spherical sclerotium. therefore, l. rhinocerotis is relatively unique among the sequenced basidiomycota mushrooms.

the cazymes family
as l. rhinocerotis is known to thrive on cellulosic substrates, its genome was mapped to the cazy database to identify the presence of carbohydrate-active enzymes  and auxiliary proteins  <cit> . a total of  <dig> non-overlapping cazyme-coding gene homologs were identified. this includes  <dig> glycoside hydrolases ,  <dig> glycosyl transferases , three polysaccharide lyases ,  <dig> carbohydrate esterases ,  <dig> carbohydrate-binding module , and  <dig> with auxiliary activities  distributed among  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> coinciding ec activities respectively . the mapped ec activities may not be directly associated with the family but simply a result of similarity to adjacent modules due to the modular nature of cazymes. the number of cazyme candidates identified was almost similar to the average reported in several studies for basidiomycota fungi  <cit> . the high number of putative gh and gt genes suggests their plausible roles in the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides. these polysaccharides consist mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose , and pectin .

the cyps family
the cytochrome p <dig>  superfamily is a diverse group of enzymes involved in various physiological processes, including detoxification, degradation of xenobiotics and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  <cit> . although not substantial, when compared to most other fungi, it is noted that l. rhinocerotis has  <dig> genes engaged in “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450” and  <dig> in “drug metabolism - cytochrome p450” kegg sub-pathways , respectively.

for further comparison, the p <dig> genes in l. rhinocerotis and seven other basidiomycetes were retrieved using blast searches against the p <dig> database . g. lucidum had the most number of putative p <dig> genes of  <dig> followed by t. versicolor  and w. cocos . on the other hand, t. mesenterica, a tremellomycete, formed the smallest group among the eight fungi compared with  <dig> functional genes and a known pseudogene. l. rhinocerotis had a total of  <dig> cyp sequences , which can be classified into  <dig> families according to nelson’s nomenclature   <cit> . the cyp <dig> family was found to have the most number of genes , followed by cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig>  families . the cyp <dig> family may play a role in triterpenoid biosynthesis  while genes from the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families were found to cluster with terpene synthases . l. rhinocerotis also harbours five genes from the cyp <dig> family, which has been implicated in xenobiotic degradation in phanerochaete chrysosporium
 <cit> . however, the exact roles of these cyps remain to be determined.table  <dig> 
p <dig> genes and subfamilies in
l. rhinocerotis


others are minority cyp families with single gene number which are not shown here.



secondary metabolism
secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes are often clustered  <cit> . the l. rhinocerotis genome contains several secondary metabolite gene clusters that suggest the potential for production of certain biologically active compounds . there are ten gene clusters encoding key enzymes, such as terpene synthases , non-ribosomal peptide synthetase , and polyketide synthase , that are crucial for the biosynthesis of terpenes, peptides, and polyketides, respectively. it is noted that, like most basidiomycetes, l. rhinocerotis has very few pks genes and multi-domain nrps genes compared to ascomycetes. the only pks gene that can be found in l. rhinocerotis is gme5066_g, which encodes a non-reducing pks which are often associated with the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides. this non-reducing pks appears to be conserved among basidiomycetes and an ortholog of the gene can be found in most of the sequenced basidiomycetes genomes, including g. lucidum, t. versicolor, and a. bisporus. interestingly, gme5066_g shared a head-to-tail homology  and domain architecture with the orsellinic acid synthase from coprinopsis cinerea , the only basidiomycete pks gene that has been characterized so far  <cit> . like ccig_ <dig>  gme5066_g contains a starter unit acyl-carrier protein transacylase , ketosynthase , acyltransferase , product template , two acyl-carrier proteins  and a thioesterase  domain. gme5066_g is clustered with gme5065_g, which is a predicted flavin-dependent oxidoreductase. it remains to be determined if the gme5066_g gene cluster produces orsellinic acid derivatives or related polyketides. the l. rhinocerotis genome also harbours a single multidomain nrps gene. the nrps has a single adenylation domain along with three thiolation and condensation domains, and are conserved among several basidiomycetes, including d. squalens dicsqdraft_ <dig>  and t. versicolor travedraft_ <dig> , but none are characterized.

terpenoids  is one group of secondary metabolites that are well recognized for their pharmaceutical uses and are known to be one of the major groups of therapeutic compounds in g. lucidum. the triterpenoid ganoderic acids, for example, have been reported to have anti-tumor, immuno-regulation, and antioxidative functions  <cit> . other notable examples include the diterpenoid antibiotic pleuromutilins from clitopilus mushrooms  <cit> , as well as the sesquiterpenoid anticancer illudins  <cit> . in the genome of l. rhinocerotis, we identified  <dig> key enzymes involved in the mevalonate  pathway but not the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate  pathway . this indicates that the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis in l. rhinocerotis, like most fungi, can only proceed via the mva pathway. all the core enzymes involved in the mva pathway are listed in table  <dig>  the enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase and solanesyl diphosphate synthase are each encoded by two copies of the genes whereas the remaining nine enzymes are encoded by single copy genes. as in the case for the g. lucidum genome reported by liu et al.  <cit> , we found a fusion gene  that was partially homologous to cystathionine beta-lyase  and mevalonate kinase  at the n- and c-terminal respectively. this metc-mck gene, which encodes for  <dig> amino acids, is the only gene that matches the key enzyme mevalonate kinase, implying the role in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis.table  <dig> 
putative genes involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis




we next searched the l. rhinocerotis genome for potential triterpenoid biosynthesis genes and found an open reading frame  that encodes a single copy gene for lanosterol synthase . lss is a squalene/oxidosqualene cyclase family enzyme that catalyzes the cyclization of the triterpenes squalene or 2-3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol, the precursor of all steroids  <cit> . this enzyme has been implicated in biosynthesis of ganoderic acids, which are the bioactive triterpenes in g. lucidum
 <cit> . similarly, the lss in l. rhinocerotis can be involved in biosynthesis of bioactive triterpenes. the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families of p <dig> genes have been previously implicated in triterpenoid biosynthesis in g. lucidum due to their co-expression with lss  <cit> . as mentioned earlier, cyp <dig> is the largest p <dig> family in l. rhinocerotis with  <dig> genes, while six cyp <dig> family genes are present in its genome as well. this suggests that l. rhinocerotis may be a potential triterpenoid source.

mushrooms are known to be prolific producers of bioactive sesquiterpenes  <cit> . the l. rhinocerotis genome is enriched with sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis genes compared to some of the other seven basidiomycota genomes . the l. rhinocerotis genome encodes up to  <dig> sesquiterpene cyclase genes. this is comparable to the number of sesquiterpene cyclase genes found in the recently sequenced genome of the jack o’lantern mushroom omphalotus olearius, which is the producer of anticancer illudins  <cit> . many of these terpene synthase genes are clustered together with various modifying enzymes . comparatively, the common filamentous ascomycetes have fewer sesquiterpene cyclase genes, for example, both the aspergillus nidulans and aspergillus oryzae have only one sesquiterpene cyclase gene, while the aspergillus fumigatus has none  <cit> . this suggests that unlike the filamentous ascomycetes that are enriched with the polyketide and nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis genes, the sesquiterpenoids are major secondary metabolites produced by l. rhinocerotis.

biosynthesis of potential bioactive proteins and polysaccharides
polysaccharides are the most extensively investigated mushroom constituents due to their pharmaceutical potential. the water soluble  <dig> -β- and  <dig> -β-glucans are some of the most active immunomodulatory compounds reported  <cit> . additional file 2: table s <dig> lists enzymes that may be involved in the biosynthesis of uridine diphosphate glucose  and  <dig> -β-glucans in l. rhinocerotis. these enzymes include hexokinase, α-phosphoglucomutase, utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase,  <dig> -β-glucan synthases, and β-glucan biosynthesis-associated proteins.

mushrooms have also been an important source of bioactive proteins, which include lectins, fungal immunomodulatory proteins , ribosome inactivating proteins , antimicrobial proteins, ribonucleases, and laccases  <cit> . the genome of l. rhinocerotis codes for nine putative lectins, two putative fungal immunomodulatory proteins , and four putative laccases . it is interesting to note that both of the l. rhinocerotis fips  are homologous to lz- <dig> , a member of the fip family from g. lucidum that has been shown to possess immunomodulation and anti-cancer activity  <cit> . both the putative fip proteins carry an fve domain  found in the major fruiting body protein isolated from flammulina velutipes with immunomodulatory activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
l. rhinocerotis genome sequencing has allowed us to perform comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis. this has provided valuable insights into the biology of this medicinal mushroom from southeast asia. a survey of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes in the l. rhinocerotis genome shows that it is particularly enriched with sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis genes. thus, future bioactive molecule discovery efforts should focus on this class of metabolites. furthermore, l. rhinocerotis appears to encode the capabilities to produce  <dig> -β- and  <dig> -β-glucans as well as bioactive proteins, such as lectins and fips. our genomic analysis of l. rhinocerotis will provide the foundation for future research and exploitation of l. rhinocerotis in pharmacological and functional food applications.
