BACKGROUND
microarrays are one of the most important technologies used in molecular biology to massively explore how the genes express themselves into proteins and other molecular machines responsible for the different functions in an organism. these expressions are monitored in cells and organisms under specific conditions, and have many applications in medical diagnosis, pharmacology, disease treatment, just to mention a few. we consider cdna microarrays which are produced on a chip  by hybridizing sample dna on the slide, typically in two channels. scanning the slides at a very high resolution produces images composed of sub-grids of spots. image processing and analysis are two important aspects of microarrays, since the aim of the whole experimental procedure is to obtain meaningful biological conclusions, which depends on the accuracy of the different stages, mainly those at the beginning of the process. the first task in the sequence is gridding  <cit> , which if done correctly, substantially improves the efficiency of the subsequent tasks that include segmentation  <cit> , quantification, normalization and data mining. when producing cdna microarrays, many parameters are specified, such as the number and size of spots, number of sub-grids, and even their exact locations. however, many physicochemical factors produce noise, misalignment, and even deformations in the sub-grid template that it is virtually impossible to know the exact location of the spots after scanning, at least with the current technology, without performing complex procedures. roughly speaking, gridding consists of determining the spot locations in a microarray image . the gridding process requires the knowledge of the sub-girds in advance in order to proceed .

many approaches have been proposed for sub-gridding and spot detection. the markov random field  is a well known approach that applies different constraints and heuristic criteria  <cit> . mathematical morphology is a technique used for analysis and processing geometric structures, based on set theory, topology, and random functions. it helps remove peaks and ridges from the topological surface of the images, and has been used for gridding the microarray images  <cit> . jain's  <cit> , katzer's  <cit> , and stienfath's  <cit>  models are integrated systems for microarray gridding and quantitative analysis. a method for detecting spot locations based on a bayesian model has been recently proposed, and uses a deformable template to fit the grid of spots using a posterior probability model for which the parameters are learned by means of a simulated-annealing-based algorithm  <cit> . another method for finding spot locations uses a hill-climbing approach to maximize the energy, seen as the intensities of the spots, which are fit to different probabilistic models  <cit> . fitting the image to a mixture of gaussians is another technique that has been applied to gridding microarray images by considering radial and perspective distortions  <cit> . a radon-transform-based method that separates the sub-grids in a cdna microarray image has been proposed in  <cit> . that method applies the radon transform to find possible rotations of the image and then finds the sub-grids by smoothing the row or column sums of pixel intensities; however, that method does not automatically find the correct number of sub-grids, and the process is subject to data-dependent parameters.

another approach for cdna microarray gridding is a gridding method that performs a series of steps including rotation detection and compares the row or column sums of the top-most and bottom-most parts of the image  <cit> . this method, which detects rotation angles with respect to one of the axes, either x or y, has not been tested on images having regions with high noise .

another method for gridding cdna microarray images uses an evolutionary algorithm to separate sub-grids and detect the positions of the spots  <cit> . the approach is based on a genetic algorithm that discovers parallel and equidistant line segments, which constitute the grid structure. thereafter, a refinement procedure is applied to further improve the existing grid structure, by slightly modifying the line segments. using maximum margin is another method for automatic gridding of cdna microarray images based on maximizing the margin between rows and columns of spots  <cit> . initially, a set of grid lines is placed on the image in order to separate each pair of consecutive rows and columns of the selected spots. then, the optimal positions of the lines are obtained by maximizing the margin between these rows and columns using a maximum margin linear classifier. for this, a svm-based gridding method was used in  <cit> . in that method, the positions of the spots on a cdna microarray image are first detected using image analysis operations. a set of soft-margin linear svm classifiers is used to find the optimal layout of the grid lines in the image. each grid line corresponds to the separating line produced by one of the svm classifiers, which maximizes the margin between two consecutive rows or columns of spots.

RESULTS
for testing the proposed method , three different kinds of cdna microarray images have been used. the images have been selected from different sources, and have different scanning resolutions, in order to study the flexibility of the proposed method to detect sub-grids and spots with different sizes and features.

the first test suite consists of a set of images drawn from the stanford microarray database , and corresponds to a study of the global transcriptional factors for hormone treatment of arabidopsis thaliana samples. the images can be downloaded from smd.stanford.edu, by selecting "hormone treatment" as category and "transcription factors" as subcategory. ten images were selected, which correspond to channels  <dig> and  <dig> for experiments ids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the images have been named using at , followed by the experiment id and the channel number .

the second test suite consists of a set of images from gene expression omnibus  and corresponds to an atlantic salmon head kidney study. the images can be downloaded from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, by selecting "geo datasets" as category and searching the name of the image. eight images were selected, which correspond to channels  <dig> and  <dig> for experiments ids gsm <dig>  gsm <dig> and gsm <dig>  and also channel  <dig> of gsm <dig> and channel  <dig> of gsm <dig>  the images have been named using gsm followed by the experiment id, and the channel number .

the third test suite consists of two images, obtained from a dilution experiment  and correspond to channels experiments ids diln4- <dig> .01a and diln4- <dig> .01b  <cit> . the specifications of the cdna microarray images for each of these three test suites are summarized in table  <dig> 

the specifications of the three datasets of cdna microarray images used to evaluate the proposed method.

to assess the performance of the proposed method, we consider the percentage of the grid lines that separate sub-grids/spots incorrectly, marginally and perfectly. these quantities were found by visually analyzing the result of the gridding produced by our method. for smd and geo, our gridding was not compared with the gridding currently available in these databases. for diln, apart from the visual analysis, we also apply segmentation and quantification by computing the volume of log of intensity and relate these to the rate of dilution in the biological experiment. for the implementation, we used matlab <dig> on a windows  <dig> platform and an intel core i <dig>  <dig> cpu with 8gb of memory. the average processing times for sub-grid and spot detections are shown in table  <dig>

additionally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the refinement procedure, we tested the accuracy of the proposed method with and without applying the refinement procedure. the results are shown in table  <dig>  for simplicity, we only include those images in which there is a change in accuracy. we observe that applying the refinement procedure slightly improve the efficiency of the method in all the images in the table.

the accuracy of the proposed method with and without using the refinement procedure in the spot detection phase. only images with changes in accuracy are listed.

to analyze the results from a different perspective, we have also performed a visual analysis. figure  <dig> shows the detected sub-grids in the at-20387-ch <dig> image  and the detected spots in one of the sub-grids . also, figure  <dig> shows the sub-grids detected in the gsm16101-ch <dig> image  and the detected spots in one of the sub-grids , while figure  <dig> shows the sub-grids detected in the diln4- <dig> b image  and the detected spots in one of the sub-grids . as shown in the all three figures, the proposed method finely detects the sub-grid locations first, and in the next stage, each sub-grid is divided precisely into the corresponding spots with the same method. the robustness of omtg is so high that spots in sub-grids can be detected very well even in noisy conditions, such as those observable in the selected sub-grid in figure  <dig>  the ability to detect sub-grids and spots in different microarray images with different resolutions and spacing is another important feature of the proposed method.

as mentioned earlier, deformations, noise and artifacts can affect the accuracy of the proposed method. figure  <dig> shows an example in which the proposed method fails to detect some spot regions due to the extremely contaminated regions with noise and artifacts. in this particular sub-grid, noisy regions tend to be confused with spots. also, most spots have low intensities that are confused with the background. after testing other methods on this image, we observed that they also fail to detect the correct gridding in these regions.

to further analyze the efficiency of the proposed method to automatically detect the correct number of spots and sub-grids, we show in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> the plots for the indices of validity against the number of sub-grids for at-20387-ch <dig>  gsm16101-ch <dig> and diln4- <dig> b respectively. the plots on top of the figures represent the values of the index functions  for detecting the horizontal lines for the i, a and α indices respectively, while the plots of the indices for the vertical separating lines are shown at the bottom of the figures. we observe that it would be rather difficult to find the correct number of sub-grids using the i index or the a index, while the α index clearly reveals the correct number of horizontal and vertical sub-grids by producing an almost flat curve with pronounced peaks at  <dig> and  <dig> respectively for smd and geo images, and pronounced peaks at  <dig> and  <dig> respectively for diln images. for example, it is clearly observable at the bottom plots in figures  <dig> and  <dig> that the i index misses the correct number of sub-grids,  <dig>  by showing a higher peak at  <dig>  while the α index finds the correct number of vertical sub-grids accurately.

rotation adjustment accuracy
to test the effect of the radon transform we rotate two of the images  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> degrees in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. figure  <dig> shows the images rotated by - <dig>  - <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> degrees  and the result of the adjustment after applying the radon transform . also, table  <dig> shows the accuracy of the proposed method on two of the rotated images. in all cases, the adjustment method works accurately and corrects the rotations in both directions. moreover, as shown in table  <dig>  the accuracy of the method remains nearly constant for all cases regardless of the degree of rotation. this shows the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in significantly rotated images.

comparison with other methods
a conceptual comparison between the proposed method, omtg, and other microarray image griding methods based on their features is shown in table  <dig>  the methods included in the comparison are the following:  radon transform sub-gridding   <cit> ,  bayesian simulated annealing gridding   <cit> ,  genetic-algorithm-based gridding   <cit> ,  hill-climbing gridding   <cit> ,  maximum margin microarray gridding   <cit> , and the proposed method, omtg. as shown in the table, as opposed to other methods, omtg does not need any number-based parameter, and hence making it much more powerful than the previous ones. one could argue, however, that the index or thresholding criterion can be considered as a "parameter". we have "fixed" these two on the α index and the between class criterion, and experimentally shown the efficiency of omtg on various cdna microarray images with different configurations.

an experimental comparison of the proposed method with gabg and hcg is shown in table  <dig>  as opposed to the proposed method that needs no parameters, gabg needs to set several parameters such as the mutation rate, μ, the crossover rate, c, the maximum threshold probability, pmax, the minimum threshold probability, plow, the percentage of lines with low probability to be a part of the grid, fmax and the refinement threshold, tp. also, hcg needs to set some parameters such as λ and σ. as shown in the table, the accuracy of our method is much higher than gabg and hcg. since gabg and hcg use several parameters, to obtain good results for the smd, geo and diln datasets, all the parameters must be set manually and separately for each dataset. if the same parameters for one of datasets were used for the others, unpredictable and poor results would be obtained - the accuracy of both methods could decrease to as low as 50%. this makes these methods fully dependent on the parameters, which have to be set manually and for specific datasets. the proposed method, however, does not need any parameter at all, and works exceptionally well in different kinds of images with different resolutions and noisy conditions.

biological analysis
in order to assess the proposed method on its suitability to perform in accordance with the biological problem, we analyze the quantification results and their relationships with the dilution experiment on the diln dataset. to compute the volume intensity of each spot, first, we use sobel method to detect the edge of each spot and then the region within the edge is defined as the primary region of each spot. in the next step, a set of morphological dilation and erosion operators are used to decrease the noise and artifacts in the region identified for each spot. finally, the summation of all pixel intensities in the spot are used as the level of expression of the gene associated with that spot; this summation represents the volume of the spot. table  <dig> shows the volume intensity of each dilution step for images a and b respectively. as shown in the table, the proposed method estimates the average intensities of dilution steps very well with near linear decreasing steps. also, figure  <dig> shows log-plots of the dilution steps for all  <dig> cases and the mean of them with a red line. the reference line with slope - <dig> is also shown in black. as shown in this figure, in most parts of the dilution experiment, the estimated intensities of each case follow a linear relationship. in step  <dig> of the dilution steps, there is an irregularity in the linearity of the red curve as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the reason for this irregularity is that, in some sub-grids of diln4- <dig> .01a and diln4- <dig> .01b, the intensities of the spots in step  <dig> are smaller than those of step  <dig>  one example of this can be seen in the third and last rows of the sub-grids in figure  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  this decrease in the intensity of the spots causes a slight nonlinearity in step  <dig> of the dilution steps. in general, we observe that the proposed method is able to capture the nonlinear relationships present in the dilution experiments. this is observable in the log-plots of figure  <dig>  as the black line follows the array of logs of spot volumes.

CONCLUSIONS
a new method for separating sub-grids and spot centers in cdna microarray images is proposed. the method performs four main steps involving the radon transform for detecting rotations with respect to the x and y axes, the use of polynomial-time optimal multilevel thresholding to find the correct positions of the lines separating sub-grids and spots, a new index for detecting the correct number of sub-grids and spots and, finally, a refinement procedure to increase the accuracy of the detection.

the proposed method has been tested on real-life, high-resolution microarray images drawn from three sources, the smd, geo and diln. the results show that  the rotations are effectively detected and corrected by affine transformations,  the sub-grids are accurately detected in all cases, even in abnormal conditions such as extremely noisy areas present in the images,  the spots in each sub-grid are accurately detected using the same method,  using the refinement procedure increases the accuracy of the method, and  because of using an algorithm free of parameters, this method can be used for different microarray images in various situations, and also for images with various spot sizes and configurations effectively. the results have also been biologically validated on dilution experiments.
