BACKGROUND
nuclear factor kappa b  is a crucial transcription factor regulating multiple cellular pathways leading to survival or death of the cell depending on the stimulus. in unstimulated cells, the nf-κb dimers  are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called i kappa b . upon stimulation by activators like tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin  <dig> , cd40l, lipopolysaccharides  etc., signaling cascades involving activation of various protein kinases are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of the iκb kinases  which phosphorylate iκbα, leading to its degradation by the 26s proteasome complex. the degradation of iκbα exposes the p50/p <dig> nuclear localization sequence and allows nf-κb dimers to translocate to the nucleus, bind to κb motifs in the promoters regions of many genes, and regulate their transcription
 <cit> .

in many cases, infection by extra-cellular pathogens has been shown to alter nf-κb activity in order to facilitate the survival of pathogens or host. as part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens, nf-κb activation is required for resistance to a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections
 <cit> . however, many viruses such as hiv, exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through κb response elements located in their promoters
 <cit> . on the contrary, many pathogens such as african swine fever virus, hiv- <dig> and cowpox virus
 <cit>  have developed strategies to interfere with host nf-κb responses. inhibition of nf-κb activity by these pathogens has been shown to be important for pathogenesis.

hepatitis e virus  is a positive strand rna virus which codes for three known open reading frames 
 <cit> . orf <dig> codes for non structural proteins, essential for viral replication; orf <dig> codes for the major capsid protein of hev, called orf <dig> protein; and orf <dig> codes for a phosphoprotein which may play a key role in manipulating various host-cell processes during viral infection, and may have a role in cell survival and propagation of the virus
 <cit> . although hev infection is generally self-limiting, it induces fulminant hepatic failure, which results in a very high mortality rate in pregnant women. a recent study done by prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that nf-κb activity is suppressed in the pbmc and liver biopsy samples of pregnant fulminant hepatic failure patients
 <cit> . however, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown.

in the present study, we report the ability of the orf <dig> protein to inhibit the cellular nf-κb activity. in human hepatoma cells, orf <dig> protein could directly associate with the f-box protein βtrcp and heterologous expression of the orf <dig> protein led to reduced recruitment of skp <dig> and cul <dig> subunits to the scfβtrcp ubiquitination complex, resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the iκbα protein. this, in turn, led to reduced nuclear localization and subsequent dna binding of the p <dig> protein, which is the major subunit of the nf-κb trans-activation complex. analysis of two nf-κb target genes further confirmed the above observation. the possible significance of this phenomenon in enhancing survival of hev infected hepatocytes is discussed.

RESULTS
heterologous expression of the orf <dig> protein inhibits nf-Îºb activity
in order to test whether orf <dig> or orf <dig> protein of hev inhibit cellular nf-κb activity, a reporter vector with il- <dig> receptor promoter region, which contains nf-κb element, cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coding sequence  activity using these cell extracts revealed that orf <dig> protein inhibited the nf-κb cat activity . however, no inhibition was observed by orf <dig> expression . in order to investigate whether orf <dig> mediated inhibition of nf-κb activity was an artifact of the experimental system, cells were treated for 30 minutes with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , a known inducer of nf-κb activity
 <cit> , or transfected with an expression construct of iκb kinase β, which is the catalytic subunit of the ikk complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of nf-κb activity
 <cit> . tpa treatment increased nf-κb activity of mock transfected cells by approximately  <dig> folds whereas orf <dig> expressing cells did not show any significant increase in nf-κb activity . similarly, co-expression of orf <dig> in ikkβ transfected cells resulted in downregulation of nf-κb activity in comparison to cells transfected with only ikkβ . these results clearly suggest that hev orf <dig> inhibits nf-κb activity.

further, we examined the turnover of iκbα in iΚkβ and orf <dig> co-expressing cells since iκbα is the major inhibitor of nf-κb activity in unstimulated cells. by performing a pulse chase assay, using 35s]-cys/met labeling mix, the half-life of iκbα in ikkβ expressing cells was found to be approximately 90 minutes, whereas in cells expressing both ikkβ and orf <dig>  approximately 15% of iκbα was found to be degraded at a chase period of 90 minutes . notably, the levels of iκbα at the end of the labeling period  in ikkβ alone expressing cells were less than that in ikkβ and orf <dig> coexpressing cells, indicating that iκbα is a very labile protein in ikkβ expressing cells. the graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of iκbα at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100%. to further confirm whether iκbα stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of nf-κb in orf <dig> expressing cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and orf <dig> transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-p <dig> antibody. as seen in figure
2b, orf <dig> transfected cells were found to accumulate more p <dig> protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction . as expected, mock transfected cells were found to contain more p <dig> protein in the nuclear fraction . this is attributed to the fact that basal nf-κb activity is higher in huh <dig> cells
 <cit> . in order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls, equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin and anti-phospho c-jun antibodies.

in order to check whether the phosphorylation of iκbα was altered in orf <dig> expressing cells, the level of phosphorylated iκbα  was measured in orf <dig> expressing cells. orf <dig> expression marginally increased the levels of phospho iκbα  as well as the level of total iκbα . in ikkβ and orf <dig> co-expressing cells, the level of total as well as phosphorylated iκbα was significantly higher as compared to only ikkβ expressing cells . in order to check that the decreased band intensity in ikkβ expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of iκbα, one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor mg- <dig> for 2 hours, resulting in equal iκbα protein levels in both the samples . aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody to check equal loading. thus, it appears that orf <dig> expression prevents the degradation of iκbα. the fact that orf <dig> did not interfere with phosphorylation of iκbα by the ikk complex was further confirmed by checking the activity of the ikk complex. orf <dig> expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for phospho ikkα/β  levels. as expected, orf <dig> expression  did not modulate the levels of pikk α/β .

orf <dig> protein interferes with iÎºbÎ± ubiquitination
proteasomal degradation of iκbα is preceded by its ubiquitination, which occurs by the association of phosphorylated iκbα with the scfβtrcp complex
 <cit> . in order to check whether orf <dig> inhibits iκbα ubiquitination, we checked the level of ubiquitinated iκbα in orf <dig> expressing cells. mock or orf <dig> transfected cells were treated with mg- <dig> for 2 hours, iκbα was immunoprecipitated, followed by immunblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody. protein level of ubiquitinated iκbα was significantly decreased in full-length orf <dig> expressing cells as compared to control cells . a similar effect  was observed following expression of a mutant orf <dig> protein  with er signal sequence deleted which consequently constitutively localizes to the cytoplasm
 <cit> . aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with iκbα antibody to confirm its presence . a parallel set of samples were labeled with 35s]-cys/met promix, immunoprecipitated with anti-orf <dig> antibody and autoradiographed to check the expression of full-length and Δ <dig> orf <dig> protein .

subsequently, we checked whether orf <dig> interfered with the assembly of iκbα ubiquitination machinery. expression of orf <dig> protein inhibited the association of iκbα with skp <dig>  and cul <dig>  in a dose-dependent manner . aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-iκbα antibody to check the levels of iκbα . a parallel set of samples were labeled with -cys/met and immunoprecipitated with anti-orf <dig> antibody to check the expression of orf <dig> . to further check whether the orf <dig> expression in these cells inhibited the association of iκbα with the f-box protein βtrcp, orf <dig> and myc tagged βtrcp co-expressing cells were labeled with -cys/met and aliquots of the lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody and immunoblotted using anti-iκbα antibody. orf <dig> expression led to the inhibition of iκbα association with full-length βtrcp when compared to control cells . however, iκbα association with an f-box deleted mutant βtrcp  remains unaffected despite the presence of orf <dig> . the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody to check the expression of full-length and Δf-βtrcp . lane  <dig> shows the protein level of total iκbα. 50% of the sample has been loaded in lane  <dig> in comparison to other samples. the other half of the blot was autoradiographed to check the expression of the orf <dig> protein .

since the presence of orf <dig> could inhibit iκbα association with full-length βtrcp but not with Δf-βtrcp, we postulated that the orf <dig> protein either interacts with iκbα and sequesters it away from βtrcp or interacts with other subunits of the scf complex thereby modulating βtrcp binding to iκbα. alternatively, it binds to βtrcp itself and blocks the formation of the scf complex. we thus checked the association of orf <dig> with the above components. no interaction was detected between orf <dig> and iκbα  as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay. the possibility that βtrcp over-expression might be promoting orf <dig> association with iκbα was ruled out by testing orf <dig> and iκbα association in full-length or Δf- βtrcp over-expressing cells . lane  <dig> shows the level of iκbα in control cells. subsequently, we checked whether orf <dig> interacts with skp <dig> and cul <dig>  the orf <dig> protein did not associate with either skp <dig> or cul <dig>  under conditions, where ikbα associated with these proteins .

orf <dig> protein directly associates with the f-box protein Î²trcp
coimmunoprecipitation assay of cell lysate expressing both orf <dig> and myc tagged full-length βtrcp revealed that orf <dig> could efficiently associate with the latter . exposure of the same blot to x-ray film revealed the band specific to orf <dig> in βtrcp and orf <dig> cotransfected cells . 3rd lane in upper panel shows the expression of the βtrcp protein, as judged by immunoprecipitation using anti-myc antibody. specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of orf <dig> with another f-box protein, skp <dig>  we were unable to detect any interaction between orf <dig> and skp <dig> as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay . in order to ensure that skp <dig> was indeed functional in these experiments, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody. endogenous skp <dig> was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c-myc protein  and similarly ip using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the skp <dig> protein . bottom panel shows an autoradiogram of orf <dig> expression. these experiments proved that orf <dig> specifically interacts with the f-box protein βtrcp. direct interaction between orf <dig> and βtrcp was further confirmed using an in vitro pull-down assay. full-length orf <dig> as well as kdel orf <dig>  and Δ <dig> orf <dig> mutant were able to pull-down βtrcp . as negative controls, orf <dig> transfected sample was immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum  or mock translated lysate was incubated with orf <dig> protein bound to beads  or, the orf <dig> protein was incubated with βtrcp protein .

the orf <dig> protein downregulates the expression of nf-Îºb targets
nf-κb is known to regulate the transcription of a large number of genes during different cellular conditions. one of the most critical events for initiation of immune response against viral antigens is the presentation of viral peptide epitopes over the infected cell surface, which can then be recognized by cytolytic t cells. the viral antigens are presented through their association with the major histocompatibility complex-i . as mhc-i heavy chain is a known target of nf-κb, we checked expression levels of the mhc-i heavy chain in orf <dig> expressing cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysacharides . egfp , full-length orf <dig>  or Δ35-orf <dig>  transfected cells were treated with lps for 45 minutes and total cell lysate was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-mhc-i heavy chain antibody . protein level of mhc-i heavy chain was decreased in both full-length and Δ35-orf <dig> expressing cells in comparison to egfp expressing cells. an aliquot of the lysate was immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody to ensure equal loading of the sample .

further, we checked nf-κb recruitment to the mhc i heavy chain promoter in lps stimulated orf <dig> expressing cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay. immunoprecipitation was conducted using an antibody specific for the p <dig> subunit of the nf-κb complex. egfp expression did not alter p <dig> recruitment to mhc-i heavy chain promoter. however, full-length or Δ35-orf <dig> expression decreased p <dig> recruitment to the mhc-i heavy chain promoter. 10% of the total lysate used for one immuonprecipitation reaction was used as input in each sample . we also checked p <dig> recruitment to interleukin  <dig>  proximal promoter region, which showed a similar pattern as observed for the mhc-i heavy chain promoter . as a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for nf-κb, aliquots of the lps treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-sp <dig> antibody  and purified chip dna was pcr amplified using mhc-i heavy chain promoter specific primer. as expected, sp <dig> recruitment to the mhc-i heavy chain promoter was not altered in orf <dig> expressing cells . these experiments confirmed that orf <dig> expression specifically prevents p <dig> nf-κb association with its cognate response element present on natural promoters.

next, the effect of orf <dig> protein on the expression of two tpa inducible cytokines- il- <dig> and il- <dig> was measured by performing real time quantitative rt-pcr of these cytokine transcripts in orf <dig> expressing huh <dig> cells, which were treated with tpa for 6 hours prior to rna isolation. as expected, il- <dig> and il- <dig> transcript level was decreased in

orf <dig> expressing tpa treated cells in comparison to mock transfcetd tpa treated cells . these experiments indicates that orf <dig> protein, by virtue of its ability to inhibit nf-κb activity, suppress tpa induced il- <dig> and il- <dig> rna synthesis.

discussion
the orf <dig> protein of hev has traditionally been believed to associate with genomic rna, multimerize and form the viral capsid. no other function of orf <dig> protein has yet been reported. in this article, we present evidence which suggest that the orf <dig> protein may be playing an important regulatory role during the viral life cycle. the fact that the observed phenomenon was not an artifact of the experimental setup was evident from multiple experiments. first, orf <dig> was capable of directly interacting with the f-box protein βtrcp, both in vitro and in vivo. second, Δ <dig> orf <dig> mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum , was also capable of inhibiting nf-κb activity, thus ruling out the possibility of er stress induced artifact. third, orf <dig> protein of hev was unable to elicit such a function in parallel experiments.

hev infection results in an acute, self-limiting and icteric disease that is prevalent in much of the developing world. although self-limiting infection occurs in adults with mortality rate ~1–2%, a high 10–20% mortality rate is observed during pregnancy
 <cit> . hence it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which hev completes its life cycle inside the host. a recent study done by prusty and coworkers revealed that nf-κb activity is inhibited in the pbmc and liver of fulminant hepatic failure patients
 <cit> . our findings that the orf <dig> protein has the ability to inhibit nf-κb activity in human hepatoma cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation.

the nf-κb inhibitory activity of the orf <dig> protein may be mediated by its ability to directly associate with the f-box protein βtrcp and inhibit the assembly of the iκbα ubiquitination complex. βtrcp is a cytoplasmic protein. hence it is worth speculating that the orf <dig> βtrcp interaction would occur in the cytoplasm. although orf <dig> is an n-linked glycoprotein, which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of orf <dig> protein exploits the er retro-translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm, where it is detected as a non-glycosylated protein. importantly, in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates, retrotranslocated orf <dig> protein is not immediately degraded by the 26s proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm
 <cit> . thus, cytoplasm localized deglycosylated orf <dig> protein may be able to associate with βtrcp. indeed, experiments done using Δ <dig> orf <dig> protein suggest that non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized orf <dig> protein is capable of associating with βtrcp and inhibiting nf-κb activity. further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism.

expression of mhc class i heavy chain, which is known to be a transcriptional target of nf-κb, was down-regulated in lps treated orf <dig> expressing cells presumably due to reduced promoter occupancy of p <dig>  which is crucial for nf-κb dependent transcriptional activation. in an infected cell, by default, pathogenic antigens are processed by the proteasome and presented by the mhc class i molecules so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic t cells. this helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection. thus, it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step. in fact, downregulation of mhc class i both at transcriptional and post-translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections
 <cit> . since nf-κb is one of the major transcription factors induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many chemokines and class i molecules in the infected cell, inhibition of the nf-κb activity by pathogen encoded proteins will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection.

CONCLUSIONS
owing to its central role in regulating multiple cell signaling pathways, modulation of nfkb activity has been an attractive target of many viral factors in order to allow them to exploit the host cell signaling machinery to their benefit. we have identified the ability of the orf <dig> protein of the hev to inhibit host cell nfkb activity. however, whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of hev infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects, can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus. nevertheless, the present study confirms the nfkb inhibitory property of the hev orf <dig> protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event.
