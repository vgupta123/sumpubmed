BACKGROUND
adventitious root formation is an organogenic process induced in stem cuttings, or in intact plants, by which roots are induced from differentiated cells other than those specified to develop roots. in forest tree species, a decline in the capacity to regenerate shoots, roots or embryos from somatic differentiated cells in an ectopic location is associated with tree age and maturation  <cit> . maturation is an age-related developmental process described in vascular plants that affects morphology, growth rate and other physiological and developmental traits  <cit> . four phases of maturation have been recognized:  the embryonic phase,  the post-embryonic juvenile vegetative phase,  the adult vegetative phase, and  the adult reproductive phase  <cit> . the decline in the ability to form adventitious roots from stem cuttings is a maturational trait that limits the successful vegetative propagation of adult trees. regeneration efficiency is much higher in tissues at earlier stages of development. however, the mechanisms behind the respecification of fully differentiated progenitor cells to induce a root meristem in an ectopic location, especially in relation to the cell’s developmental age, are unknown  <cit> . experimental systems based on the differential rooting capacities in response to auxin in hypocotyl and epicotyl cuttings from young seedlings of pine have revealed clues to the underlying mechanisms  <cit> . hypocotyl cuttings from 21-day-old seedlings rapidly form adventitious roots, while hypocotyl or epicotyl cuttings from 90-day-old pinus radiata seedlings do not root or root poorly . a continuous ring of mature and active cambium, and a complete ring of secondary xylem were developed in non-competent hypocotyls and epicotyls from 90-day-old seedlings, with interruptions at the primary leaf-axillary bud traces in epicotyls. however, while the cambium was beginning to form, it was not yet differentiated or active in competent hypocotyls from 21-day-old seedlings  <cit> . cells competent to form adventitious roots are confined to the cambial region, which is mostly located centrifugal to the resin canal at the xylem poles of the hypocotyl from 21-day-old seedlings. these cells exhibit rapid division and the re-orientation of divisional planes to directly organize a root meristem in response to exogenous auxin, without becoming a developmentally non-identified callus cell. hypocotyl or epicotyl cambial cells from 90-day-old seedlings respond to the presence of exogenous auxin by dividing, but the re-orientation of the divisional planes needed for the direct organization of a root meristem does not occur or occurs infrequently. therefore, auxin-induced adventitious root meristem organization appears to occur independently of cell reorganization and division, and the capacity to re-enter the cell division cycle alone  <cit>  is not sufficient to reset the previous cellular state in non-competent cells  <cit> . de almeida et al.  <cit>  described the procambial cells as niches of pluripotent and totipotent stem-like cells for organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis, and hutchison et al.  <cit>  proposed that the maturation-related decline of adventitious root formation could result from the suppression of gene expression levels that are needed for adult cells to re-enter the embryonic root formation pathway. the mechanisms that enable a somatic differentiated cell to become a pluripotent or totipotent cell, which can develop a root, shoot, or embryo, or repair damaged tissues, are unknown.figure  <dig>

while auxins do not seem to be the limiting factor at the rooting site in the ability to form adventitious roots at the mature stage  <cit> , the capacity to recruit root meristem or embryonic programs, and the effects of auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways on the regulation of genes involved in the organization of stem cell niches seem to be key factors in the de novo regeneration of several plant species  <cit> . the capacity of cells to generate polar changes in the local distribution of auxin can also influence cell fate  <cit> ; alternatively, transcriptional regulatory networks can function as developmental signals underlying changes in a cell’s fate  <cit> . the establishment of an embryonic root meristem involves members of the gras family of putative transcription factors, which includes scarecrow , scarecrow-like  and short-root  proteins. these genes are also involved in the radial patterning of roots, hypocotyls and aerial organs. their expression is associated with auxin distribution in the root apical meristem  <cit> . a p. radiata scarecrow-like  gene and a castanea sativa scarecrow-like  gene, which are expressed in roots and root primordia, and are induced in rooting-competent cells at the earliest stages of adventitious root formation in the presence of exogenous auxin, have been previously reported  <cit> . additionally, solé et al.  <cit>  described a p. radiata short-root  gene that is also expressed in roots and root primordia, and is induced in rooting-competent cells at the earliest stages of adventitious root formation in the absence of exogenous auxin. these authors concluded that these genes and, perhaps, a gras cascade of transcription factors play roles during the earliest stages of adventitious root induction via auxin-dependent and auxin-independent pathways  <cit> .

to investigate if gras transcription factors could be associated with the maturation-related decline in adventitious rooting, the gras family in pine was characterized. additionally, the transcript profiles of  <dig> gras genes in rooting-competent and rooting-non-competent cuttings in response to auxin were compared at the earliest stages of adventitious root formation, the cell reorganization state, prior to the onset of cell divisions leading to the formation of an adventitious root meristem. the expression analysis was also performed until after the initiation of the rapid cell divisions that organize the root meristem. auxin distribution was analyzed over the same time course. we also examined the transcript profiles of gras genes during somatic embryogenesis  <cit> , at the stages of initial-cell formation, embryo polarization and embryo differentiation .

RESULTS
the pine gras gene family: in silico identification of gras genes, motif prediction and phylogenetic analysis of gras proteins
to further our previous work on pine gras genes and their roles in the maturation-related decline of adventitious root formation  <cit> , an in silico search was conducted to identify new members of the pine gras family. an initial blast search of pinus and picea sequences in the genbank database  <cit> , using a conserved sequence of the gras motif, led to the identification of  <dig> est sequences that were classified into  <dig> groups representing putative unigene sequences. p. radiata sequences obtained in our lab were used to design primers for expression analyses .

after a second round of searching using the europine database  <cit> , a total of  <dig> ests and genomic sequences from picea glauca, picea sitchensis, pinus albaucalis, pinus ayacahuite, pinus banksiana, pinus bungeana, pinus cembra, pinus contorta, pinus densiflora, pinus flexilis, pinus gerardiana, pinus korainensis, pinus lambertiana, pinus monticola, pinus morrisonicola, pinus pinaster, pinus pinea, pinus radiate, pinus strobiformis, pinus sibirica, pinus squamata, pinus sylvestris, pinus taeda, pinus thumbergii, and pinus wallichiana were obtained. additionally, three full-length cdnas from p. radiata  <cit>  and five 3′end cdnas from p. radiata, p. pinea and p. pinaster that were available in our databases were included, for a total of  <dig> cdna sequences. the in silico comparison of these sequences resulted in the identification of  <dig> unique members of the gras gene family in pine.

after the release of the picea abies and p. taeda genomic sequences, a third round of searching using the congenie and dendrome databases  <cit>  was performed. a total of  <dig> p. abies and  <dig> p. taeda genes models were classified and, together with the previously identified ones, led to the identification of  <dig> unique members of the pine gras gene family . in addition to the scr and shr genes, the predicted genes were named following the nomenclature of our previous work  <cit> , scl <dig> to scl <dig> .

for  <dig> of the  <dig> gras genes, at least one predicted gene was identified in both pine and spruce . seven additional predicted genes were found in p. taeda that had no putative orthologs in p. abies or other pine species . pairwise comparisons among the predicted amino acid sequences of the  <dig> members for which more than one complete sequence was found revealed a high degree of conservation. sequence identities ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % between pine sequences and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % between pine and spruce sequences, except for sequences related to atscl <dig> , which showed a higher divergence between pine and spruce, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.

to classify the conifer gras proteins, a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> pine and spruce predicted gras protein sequences was performed using a  <dig> amino acid fragment that included the conserved gras c-terminal motif. to avoid possible pseudogenes, only sequences of complete predicted gras proteins were included. at least one sequence per conifer gras family member, either from pine or from spruce, was included in the analysis. the tree grouped the sequences according to their homology with the classical gras protein subfamilies  <cit>  and revealed the existence of an additional group, containing mostly pine sequences, with homology to atscl <dig> .figure  <dig>

the evolutionary relationship of the conifer and angiosperm gras proteins was phylogenetically analyzed using  <dig> amino acid fragments from  <dig> sequences, including the  <dig> conifer and  <dig> angiosperm sequences belonging to the gras protein subfamilies  <cit> . a sequence from physcomitrella patens was used as the outgroup . the phylogenetic tree showed that the predicted pine gras proteins do not cluster into a separate branch, but are distributed among the angiosperm gras subfamilies . the distribution of the conifer sequences was similar to that obtained from the conifer tree, and showed that the atscl <dig> branch is indeed a subfamily that includes  <dig> pine, two spruce and one arabidopsis sequences .

in addition to the  <dig> complete putative gras sequences, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  hypothetical genes encoding partial gras proteins were identified . these could represent pseudogenes resulting from gene duplication, and were more frequent in the scr, shr, pat and atscl <dig> subfamilies of p. taeda and in the pat and della subfamilies of p. abies .

conserved motifs and intrinsically disordered n-terminal domains of the pine gras proteins
comparisons of the putative gras sequences with previously described proteins revealed that they contain domains characteristic of the gras proteins. an analysis of the predicted sequences revealed the presence of the highly conserved vhiid motif, with changes in the valine, leucine and isoleucine residues among members, as well as the pfyre and saw motifs in the c-terminal region of the proteins . two leucine repeats  were also identified in the c- terminus. in addition, the lxxll motif and several additional amino acid residues conserved in other known gras members of the protein family, such as the rver or the lritg motifs, were identified. the saw motif contains pairs of the conserved residues rx4e, wx7g and wx10w. full-length sequences were obtained for  <dig> members of the multigene family. the n-terminal region of gras proteins is variable; however, acidic-residue-rich regions flanking repeated hydrophobic/aromatic residues, similar to those found in prscl <dig> and prshr  <cit> , were also found in other gras proteins from pine . homopolymeric stretches of proline and asparagine were only found in scl <dig> and scl <dig>  respectively, while a glycine stretch was found in the gras region of the scl <dig> 

a common feature of the n-terminal region of the analyzed proteins was the enrichment in disorder-promoting residues such as proline, glutamic acid, serine, glutamine, lysine, or in amino acids that are indifferent to disorder or structure, such as alanine, arginine or aspartic acid  <cit> . a comparison of the disorder profiles of these proteins and the corresponding proteins from angiosperms belonging to the same subfamily shows that the n-terminal region is intrinsically disordered. the intrinsically disordered profile is conserved among members of the same subfamily .

the structure of the gras multigene family in pine suggests different roles of individual gras members in constitutive or induced processes. to extend our previous analysis of the gene expression patterns of gras genes  <cit> , and to show possible differences in spatial and induced expression patterns associated with the maturation-related decline of adventitious root formation, the relative transcript abundance of  <dig> of the  <dig> gras genes was measured by qrt-pcr in organs during vegetative development, during somatic embryo development, at the developmental transition from embryonic to postembryonic development, and during the early stages of adventitious root induction in response to auxin in rooting-competent and non-competent cuttings from p. radiata. genes selected for expression analysis were those initially identified from the est collection in genbank, which included members of all of the subfamilies except atscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prshr expression levels had already been measured in organs during vegetative development and in hypocotyl cuttings from 21-day-old seedlings during adventitious root formation  <cit> .

constitutive transcript profiles of gras genes in organs and changes in the gras mrna levels during somatic embryo development and at the embryonic-postembryonic developmental transition
to characterize the expression patterns of gras genes in different organs during vegetative development, rnas isolated from roots, hypocotyls, shoot apex nodal segments  and cotyledons from 35-day-old pine seedlings were used. results were expressed as values relative to the expression levels in roots . additionally, changes in gras mrna levels were also studied during somatic embryo development  and at the embryonic-postembryonic developmental transition . to that end, mrna levels were analyzed in developing somatic embryos and in organs of embryonic and postembryonic origin from seedlings of different ages. zygotic embryos are very difficult to isolate at specific developmental stages, but p. radiata somatic embryos show a very similar developmental pattern; therefore, specific developmental stages can be defined and isolated. rnas isolated from embryogenic masses in the proliferation stage, from somatic embryos at the early and late maturation stage, and from rooting-competent and non-competent hypocotyl or epicotyl cuttings from 21- and 90-day old seedlings were used to analyze the expression patterns during embryo development and at the embryonic-postembryonic developmental transition. results were expressed as values relative to the expression in embryogenic masses after 7 days in proliferation medium. the expression of prscl <dig> was not detected in any of the rna samples tested.figure  <dig>

most gras genes showed relatively high mrna levels in roots, except prscl <dig>  which showed relatively high levels in hypocotyls and in the shoot apices of young seedlings. prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> also showed relatively higher expression levels in cotyledons. the relative abundances in other tissues depended on the individual gras genes .

the analysis of gras transcript profiles during somatic embryo development  showed that the transcript levels of all gras genes, except prscl <dig>  which showed relatively high levels in embryogenic masses, were significantly higher in the embryos at the late maturation stage than in other stages. mrna levels of prscr, prshr, prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> increased between two and four times in the embryo during the early maturation stage . the analysis of gras transcript profiles at the developmental transition from embryonic to postembryonic development  showed that prscr and prscl <dig> maintained relative high levels in rooting-competent hypocotyls from 21-day-old seedlings, whereas the other gras genes also maintained relatively high levels in rooting-non-competent hypocotyls and epicotyls from older seedlings .

transcript profiles of gras genes during adventitious rooting in competent and non-competent stem cuttings
a possible role of gras genes in the loss of rooting capacity was analyzed by assessing their temporal expression patterns in response to auxin in hypocotyl and epicotyl cuttings from 21- and 90-day-old seedlings . cuttings were treated with 10 μm indole-3-butyric acid   <cit> . then, transcript profiles were analyzed in the basal ends of cuttings during the initial 24 h, at 48 h and  <dig> d after the onset of the treatment, and compared with control tissues at their time of excision . data are presented as mrna levels normalized to ribosomal 18s  <cit>  and as fold inductions relative to their time of excision . the expression of prscl <dig> was not detected in any of the rna samples tested.figure  <dig>

several patterns of expression were observed in hypocotyl cuttings from 21-day-old seedlings during adventitious rooting . prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> mrna levels increased in the presence of exogenous auxin, similar to prscl1’s expression pattern  <cit> . prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> mrna levels were even increased in the absence of exogenous auxin similar to prshr’s expression pattern  <cit> . prscr, prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> mrna levels did not show any change in their expression level during the root-induction process. no gras genes showed increases in mrna levels in the absence or presence of exogenous auxin in the rooting-non-competent hypocotyl cuttings from 90-day-old seedlings . prscr and prscl <dig> mrnas were not detected in non-competent hypocotyls under root-induction conditions .figure  <dig>

several expression patterns were also observed in epicotyl cuttings from 90-day-old seedlings during adventitious rooting . prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> mrna levels increased in the presence of exogenous auxin, while prshr, prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> mrna levels even increased in the absence of exogenous auxin. prscr and prscl <dig> mrnas were not detected in the presence or absence of auxin. prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> were not tested for in epicotyls. prscl <dig> mrna levels increased in the absence of exogenous auxin in both rooting-competent hypocotyl cuttings from 21-day-old seedlings and rooting-non-competent epicotyl cuttings from 90-day-old seedlings. however, the increase in transcript levels was significantly higher in the presence of exogenous auxin .

the expression of two genes, prscl <dig> and prshr, which are associated with auxin-dependent and auxin-independent signaling pathways, respectively, in rooting-competent cuttings  <cit>  were also analyzed by in situ hybridization in non-competent cuttings. in our previous work, it was shown that increased transcript levels of both genes accumulated in the rooting-competent tissues of hypocotyls from 21-day-old seedlings after 24 h of root induction  <cit> . these genes were not predominantly expressed in the cambial region of non-competent hypocotyls or epicotyls at the time of excision, nor under rooting conditions . no specific tissue-localization was observed in any samples during adventitious rooting. no signal was observed when tissues were hybridized sense-oriented probes .figure  <dig>

auxin distribution in rooting-competent and non-competent cuttings in the presence of exogenous auxin and polar auxin transport inhibitors
auxin-dependent adventitious root formation in pine is associated with a directional flow of auxin in combination with the competition of neighboring cells for free auxin  <cit> . tissue-specific auxin gradients can elicit specific cellular responses. the role of the endogenous auxin distribution in rooting-competent and non-competent tissues during adventitious root formation was addressed by analyzing the indole-3-acetic acid  distribution. experiments were performed at the time of excision and after 24 h with or without exogenous auxin. the iaa distribution was analyzed by an immune-cytochemical approach using antibodies raised against iaa . iaa was mostly located in the cambial region of rooting-competent hypocotyls, including the cells positioned centrifugal to the resin canals after excision, and during the initial 24 h of root induction . treating rooting-competent hypocotyls with 1-n-naphthylphthalamic acid , a polar auxin transport inhibitor, resulted in the mislocalization of endogenous auxin, which was also distributed in the pith, in the vascular cylinder and in the cortex . no auxin accumulation was detected in the cambial cells in non-competent hypocotyls or epicotyls. auxin was mainly located in the xylem parenchyma of hypocotyls , and in the cortex of epicotyls . no signal was observed when tissues were hybridized in the absence of the antibody .

discussion
plants do not lose their developmental potentialities during differentiation and retain a certain level of plasticity  <cit> , either by maintaining pro-embryonic or meristematic cells in the adult tissues or by a major developmental reprogramming to acquire the embryonic or meristematic status  <cit> . the plasticity of plant tissues results in the regenerative capacity of cells other than those of meristem, lateral root initials or zygotes.

a decline in the regenerative capacity of somatically differentiated cells in an ectopic location is associated with age and maturation in forest tree species  <cit> . efforts have been made to identify genes associated with plant cell fate switches  <cit> ; however, pluripotency or indeterminacy genes, with high expression levels in non-differentiated embryonic cells or at the very early stages of development, significantly reduced or even no expression levels in adult tissues that have lost their regenerative capacities, but maintained in tissues with regenerative capacities or induced after the reprogramming of adult cells during regeneration  <cit> , have not been described. we have made use of embryogenic cultures maintained under non-differentiated proliferating conditions or subjected to differentiation, as well as adult tissues from plants of different ages showing different adventitious rooting capacities in response to auxin, to identify genes, changes in gene expression levels and regulatory mechanisms associated with the competence and reprogramming of adult tissues to form adventitious roots in pine .

in our previous work, two members of the gras gene family of p. radiata, prscl <dig> and prshr, were associated with the adventitious root formation in rooting-competent cuttings  <cit> . gras proteins are involved in a diverse suite of physiological and developmental processes ranging from light and hormone signal transduction to organ identity and tissue differentiation  <cit> . among them, scr and shr are involved in root patterning, establishing the quiescent center’s identity and in maintaining the stem cell status of the initial cells in the root meristem  <cit> . additionally, they have been involved in root tip regeneration  <cit>  and in cell reprogramming  <cit> . gras proteins have been identified as homologous proteins to the stat proteins in animals  <cit> , which have also been associated with differentiation, reprogramming and regeneration  <cit> .

a large gene family encodes gras proteins in pine. supporting cdnas were identified for at least  <dig> unique members in p. taeda , a number close to that described in p. abies  and arabidopsis  <cit> , higher than the number described in p. pinaster and p. glauca   <cit> , and lower than the number described in oryza sativa, populus trichocarpa and brassica rapa  <cit> . eighteen members were identified in p. radiata   <cit> . pairwise sequence similarities among predicted polypeptides for each gras member of the different pine and spruce species confirmed that they may represent intra- or inter-specific alleles of the same genes, similar to those described for other gene families in conifer species  <cit> . the proteins belonging to the atscl <dig> group showed a lower degree of identity, which could be related to a high number of duplication events, perhaps to acquire new functions .

a phylogenetic analysis showed that conifer gras proteins do not form a separate cluster  and most are included in the major gras subfamilies  <cit> . the ham family contains the atscl <dig> subfamily, which may be the result of a high number of duplication events for conifer sequences compared with their angiosperm counterparts. conifers diverged from angiosperms  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the phylogenetic relationship between conifers and angiosperms highlights the ancient diversification of this family, which may precede the transition to terrestrial environments, as suggested by engstrom  <cit>  based on comparisons among gras proteins from angiosperms, bryophytes and lycophytes, but not gymnosperms. the ancient diversification and the non-clustering of conifer sequences suggests functions or modes of action for these proteins in primary constitutive or induced processes  <cit> .

an analysis of the polypeptide sequences shows a high degree of conservation in the representative gras core motifs   <cit> , which are involved in transcriptional regulation, indicating that the transcriptional regulatory machinery is also conserved in conifers. the n-terminal domain of the predicted gras proteins is highly variable in pine , similar to the n-terminal domain of angiosperm gras proteins  <cit> . homopolymeric stretches, such as those characterizing angiosperm gras proteins  <cit> , were not found in conifer gras proteins, except for the proline and asparagine stretches found in ptscl <dig> and ptscl <dig>  the amino acid compositional profile of the n-terminus of gras proteins from pine is very similar to that of the intrinsically disordered proteins and contains an enrichment in disorder-promoting residues . however, the c-domain shows a compositional profile similar to that of fully structured proteins, as described for other gras proteins  <cit> . disordered proteins lack a well-defined three dimensional structure, resulting in an extreme structural flexibility that enables them to form highly specific complexes with different proteins or nucleic acids in a reversible and transient low-affinity interaction, depending on the changing physiological, developmental or environmental conditions  <cit> . intrinsic disorder has been described for several families of plant transcription factors, and intrinsically disordered proteins have been associated with key cellular and signaling processes  <cit> . the intrinsic disorder could be a way to increase functional diversity and the complexity of biological networks without increasing the size of the families, or even, the size of the genome, and it was proposed as the mechanism involved in the functional divergence within gras subfamilies  <cit> . despite the highly variable sequence of the n-terminus, gras proteins in pine show conserved disordered profiles when compared with gras proteins from angiosperm species of the same subfamily   <cit> . this is in agreement with previous suggestions  <cit> , indicating that the pattern of protein disorder could be more conserved through evolution than the amino acid sequence in the n-terminus. similar results have been described for the mammalian myc proteins  <cit> . consequently, mutations that do not affect the general disorder pattern would allow the conservation of specific protein interactions and, hence, functions.

the conservation of the protein motifs and structures, the absence of a particular conifer subfamily, and the intrinsically disordered n-terminal domain can account for the versatile roles of these proteins in tree biology and for the molecular mechanisms regulating their expression levels and functions. the dynamic ability of intrinsically disordered proteins to recognize multiple molecular partners reveals the need for a synchronous spatio-temporal connection between the functionally appropriate gras genes and proteins participating in specific functions.

the expression of gras genes in the different organs, at the embryonic-postembryonic developmental transition, as well as during adventitious rooting, in response to auxin showed unique and overlapping patterns, indicating a differential regulation and tissue-specific functions . individual genes within each group may have acquired different and specialized functions, some of which may relate to competence and the reprogramming of adult cells to form adventitious roots. many pine gras genes show relatively high levels of mrna during the transition from the polarization stage  to the late maturation stage , indicating that they play roles in embryo development . a subset of these genes, prscr, prshr, prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig>  increase their mrna levels during the early maturation stage. at this stage, embryo polarization occurs, but tissue differentiation has not been yet completed; therefore, these tissues, along with the proliferating embryogenic masses, may be sources of non-determined or pluripotent cells associated with the establishment of tissue domains  <cit> . however, prscl <dig> shows a relatively high level of mrna after 7 days of proliferation, when initials are developed. consequently, these genes play key roles in the initial establishment of embryo tissue domains or hormone gradients  <cit> . among them, prscr and prscl <dig> are highly expressed in organs of embryonic origin, such as hypocotyls, cotyledons and shoot apices. additionally, prscr, along with prshr, prscl <dig>  <cit> , prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> showed relatively higher levels of mrnas in roots than in any other organs tested during vegetative development, indicating a role in the roots . these results suggest that the expression of these genes is not only restricted to embryonic development but extended to other processes. we then analyzed if the expression levels of genes associated with the early stages of embryo formation could be significantly reduced or even non-existent in cuttings that have lost their rooting capacity, but maintained in rooting-competent tissues or induced after the reprogramming of adult competent cells to form adventitious roots.

prscl <dig> and prscr maintain relatively high levels of mrna in rooting-competent hypocotyls, while other gras genes are expressed in both rooting-competent hypocotyls and rooting-non-competent hypocotyls or epicotyls . these results indicate that prscl <dig> and prscr, in addition to their functions in embryo development, are associated with an embryonic characteristic that could result in the competence for adventitious organogenesis in cuttings. an analysis of these genes during adventitious root formation in competent and non-competent tissues indicated that prscl <dig> is auxin-induced in rooting-competent hypocotyls only, and the expression increases during the initial 48 h, which is the time required for auxin action and for the reorganization or dedifferentiation of cambial cells  <cit> . prscl <dig> is not detectable in rooting-non-competent hypocotyls or epicotyls . similar results are also obtained when prscr expression is analyzed; however, prscr is not induced in rooting-competent hypocotyls, but its mrna levels are maintained at higher levels in these tissues than in non-competent hypocotyls or epicotyls, in which prscr is not detectable during the initial stages of rooting . therefore, both genes could be associated with embryonic cells or with the very early stages of development. their mrna levels were significantly reduced or even lost in older and more mature rooting cuttings that had lost their rooting capacities, but were maintained in competent hypocotyls or increased after the reprogramming of adult competent cells during adventitious root formation. this would make them candidate genes for rooting competence and cell reprogramming.

the mrna levels of other genes, such as prshr prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig>  changed in an auxin-, age- or developmental-dependent manner during adventitious rooting in competent and non-competent cuttings   <cit> . the localized increases of prshr and prscl <dig> mrnas in competent tissues  <cit> , which were not detected in non-competent hypocotyl or epicotyl cuttings , suggests their involvement in adventitious rooting. the expression profiles in epicotyls could be associated with the presence of meristematic tissues in these cuttings, such as the shoot axillary meristem or cambium  <cit> . the tissue localization of prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> mrnas would help to show the roles of their mrna variations in adventitious rooting. other pine gras genes do not seem to be related to the adventitious rooting response .

these results indicate that high levels of prscr and prscl <dig> may be related to the degree of determination, competence, and/or the reprograming capacity of tissues to form adventitious roots, while other genes that are also expressed or induced, such as prshr, prscl <dig>  prscl <dig>  prscl <dig> or prscl <dig>  could be involved in transcriptional regulatory networks associated with auxin-dependent and auxin-independent pathways in an age- or developmental-dependent manner. therefore, the participation of these genes in determining whether cells become roots in competent tissues cannot be discarded. the low expression levels of prscr and prscl <dig> could make these rate-limiting steps in competence and in auxin-induced processes. additionally, all these genes are expressed or induced at the very early stages of adventitious root formation before the onset of cell divisions leading to the formation of a root meristem. a set of  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription factors expressed during the early events, which occur in the initial 24 h, leading to the regeneration of arabidopsis plants from protoplasts, were not expressed during senescence  <cit> .

the functional analysis of genes based on their subfamilies indicates a possible role in determination and patterning. scr and shr are involved in root meristem determination  <cit>  and, along with other transcription factors, have been involved in reprogramming in arabidopsis  <cit> . additionally, prscl <dig>  which may be related to the rooting process, has been associated with the adventitious and lateral root meristem of pine and chestnut  <cit> , and with the shoot axillary meristem in chestnut  <cit> . also, prscl <dig> and prscl <dig> are members of two gras subfamilies , which have been associated with the determination of lateral meristem  <cit> . although prscl <dig> is included in the pat family of gras proteins, which is associated with light responses  <cit> , members of this subfamily have also been associated with cell defense  <cit> . therefore, this subfamily is also functionally diverse. overall, a role in adventitious root competence, reprogramming and determination could be envisaged for a subset of the pine gras genes.

the asymmetrical increases of prscl <dig> and prshr transcript levels previously described in the cambial region and rooting-competent cells  <cit>  were not detected in non-competent cuttings . in these cuttings, expression spread into the cortex and dividing cells. the asymmetrical increase in mrna during the earliest stages of adventitious root formation in similar cell types at different developmental stages suggests the presence of specific cellular signaling pathways or specific factors in pine, perhaps distributed in cell-type- and developmental-stage-specific contexts in the tissues involved in rooting, which could be crucial for rooting capacity  <cit> . the nature of these signaling pathways or factors is unknown. de novo organ formation and cell specification are processes involving rearrangements of tissue polarity, with the temporal and spatial distribution of auxin being a very important player, contributing to tissue polarization and patterning  <cit> . no differences in auxin uptake, accumulation or metabolism were found between rooting-competent and non-competent hypocotyls and epicotyls at the base of the cuttings  <cit> . however, an asymmetric auxin distribution was detected in rooting-competent tissues after excision and was maintained during the initial 24 h of root induction  at locations where prshr and prscl <dig> are expressed  <cit> . an asymmetrical distribution was not observed in non-competent hypocotyls or epicotyls . treatments with npa, which inhibits rooting  <cit>  and does not change the number of cell layers in the vascular cylinder, cortex or pith, changed the auxin distribution pattern , indicating that polar auxin transport, which resulted in an accumulation of auxin at the base of the cutting  <cit> , as well as auxin localization and distribution at the tissue or cellular levels. this result indicated that rooting-competent tissues could retain an intrinsic capacity to maintain or accumulate auxin after excision, which could be crucial for rooting. the cellular capacity of initial cells to produce auxin gradients may be a mechanism involved in the determination and maintenance of meristem, the induction of lateral primordia at the shoot meristem, and the formation of lateral roots or adventitious roots  <cit> . auxin distribution largely depends on the dynamic expression and subcellular localization of the pin auxin-carrier proteins  <cit> . however, pin activity can be modulated by endogenous or exogenous signals, such as other hormones, stress or tissue-specific factors, to trigger developmental decisions that could initiate regeneration by triggering cell fates or other local changes  <cit> . no differences in the wounding stress response were observed between competent and non-competent cuttings  <cit> ; therefore, other tissue-dependent signals could also trigger re-patterning either by inducing cell-fate respecification or by re-establishing the auxin distribution. transcription factors are main players in regulatory modules controlling auxin gradients, positional information and the development of polarity fields, resulting in a cross regulatory network involved in organ formation  <cit> . the differential expression of genes, such as prscr and prscl <dig>  in rooting-competent and non-competent cuttings, as well as the differential responses of genes, such as prscl <dig> or prshr [figure  <dig>   <cit>  to exogenous auxin during adventitious rooting may indicate the local involvement of specific gras transcription factors in the rooting capacity by participating in the auxin distribution, control of cell-type divisions, or other mechanisms. the auxin-related increase of prscl <dig> mrna in competent tissues after 24 h of root induction  <cit>  could be associated with auxin localization in these tissues at the same time . the overlap in the temporal and spatial distribution of auxin , and the increase of the auxin-independent prshr mrna  <cit>  could indicate a possible crosstalk between the signaling pathways, perhaps establishing response domains that activate a cascade of other gras genes or root determining factors before the resumption of cell divisions. sabatini et al.  <cit>  proposed that scr- and shr-expressing cells are competent to acquire quiescent center identity, with auxin distribution being the cue that specifies a subset of cells within the scr or shr expression domains. however, the shr pathway regulates root development through a transcriptional regulatory network and also by affecting the expression of genes involved in cytokinin and auxin signaling in arabidopsis, resulting in the fine-tuning of hormonal responses  <cit> . additionally, formative divisions that generate the root’s ground tissue are controlled by shr in arabidopsis, which specifically regulates the spatiotemporal activation of specific genes involved in cell division, and by scr, both activating a d-type cyclin involved in formative divisions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
adventitious root forming treatments induce root meristem patterning genes, such as gras genes, before the onset of cell division in competent cells. the same gras genes also may play a role during the earliest stages of embryogenesis, initial-forming and polarization. the capacity to maintain or recruit root meristem or embryonic programs in response to a specific stimulus seems to be key in switching cells into different developmental programs, both in herbaceous and woody plants, including forest tree species  <cit> . however, whether this pattern of expression represents a maintenance, a dedifferentiation or a transdifferentiation to an embryonic or root identity, or it represents a different adult developmental program unique to regeneration, as was described in arabidopsis  <cit> , remains unknown.
