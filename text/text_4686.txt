BACKGROUND
the whitefly bemisia tabaci   is a species complex composed of at least  <dig> morphologically indistinguishable cryptic species   <cit> . these species differ genetically as well as in host range, fecundity, insecticide resistance, mating behavior and ability to transmit begomoviruses  <cit> . while many species within the b. tabaci complex cause no obvious harms to agricultural production; some members of this species complex are highly invasive and cause extensive damage to agricultural, horticultural, and ornamental crops through direct feeding or the transmission of plant viruses  <cit> . two species of the b. tabaci complex, middle east - asia minor  <dig>  and mediterranean  have risen to international prominence due to their global invasion during the last  <dig> years  <cit> . meam <dig> and med originated from the middle east asia minor and mediterranean basin regions respectively, and have invaded many countries around the world  <cit> . extensive evidence has indicated that the invasion of meam <dig> and med are associated with the displacement of their closely related indigenous whitefly species  <cit> .

the invasion of an alien whitefly species and competition between invasive and indigenous species are mediated by many abiotic and biotic factors. efforts have been made to understand the factors that contribute to the incursion of the two species into new regions and the displacement of indigenous species. for example, the invasion of meam <dig> is assumed to be associated with its high adaptability under various environmental stresses and host plants  <cit> . liu et al.  <cit>  also revealed that the displacement of indigenous whitefly species by meam <dig> is associated with the behavior of mating interference. on the other hand, the spread of med is closely related to its ability to maintain high levels of resistance to major classes of insecticides  <cit> . despite these advances, the molecular mechanisms underlying the extraordinary capacity of meam <dig> and med to spread and ultimately displace the native species remains largely unknown. furthermore, previous studies have mainly focused on single gene or individual aspect of the b. tabaci biology, a global picture of the genetic factors associated with the invasion of these two whitefly species is still lacking.

the genomic divergence between invasive and indigenous species is valuable for determining how phenotypes specific to invasive species have been formed  <cit> . by examining the divergence of large numbers of genes, a overall picture of genetic differences and invasion mechanisms may be attained  <cit> . here, we propose that a global analysis of genomic divergence among the b. tabaci species complex will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological invasions of meam <dig> and med. first, the b. tabaci species are reproductively isolated, but retain sufficient genetic similarity for comparative analyses  <cit> . second, the whitefly species went through an allopatric divergence process and showed significant differences in survival and reproductive performance  <cit> . this warrants exploring the interspecies evolutionary processes through the comparison of orthologous genes. third, at least  <dig> species have been delineated for the b. tabaci complex including  <dig> invasive species and  <dig> indigenous species. the rich diversity of invasive and indigenous species allows extensive cross comparisons of orthologous genes among difference members of the complex, which will facilitate the elucidation of invasive mechanisms.

the transcriptomes of two invasive whitefly species med and meam <dig> have been sequenced using illumina sequencing technology  <cit> . in this study, we sequenced the transcriptome of an indigenous b. tabaci species - asia ii  <dig>  and generated  <dig>  distinct sequences. these transcriptome sequences provide a rich molecular resource for functional analysis of the native b. tabaci species. in order to gain further insights on how genes have diverged between the indigenous and invasive whiteflies, we compared the global sequence divergence between the transcriptomes of asia ii  <dig> and the invasive species meam <dig> and med. the identification and analysis of divergent sequences between the indigenous and invasive whitefly species opens the door for future investigations on the molecular mechanisms of b. tabaci invasion. the approach described in this manuscript will significantly accelerate the identification of genetic variation underlying adaptation in b. tabaci and other invasive species.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and assembly of asia ii  <dig> transcriptome
using illumina technology, the transcriptome of the indigenous asia ii  <dig> whitefly species was sequenced. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads of  <dig> base pairs long were obtained in a single run and were assembled into  <dig>  contigs  with soapdenovo software  <cit> . the contigs were assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds  and further clustered into  <dig>  distinct sequences  . overall, these results are comparable to the transcriptome of the invasive meam <dig> which contains  <dig>  scaffolds  and  <dig>  distinct sequences with an average length of  <dig> bp   <cit> . however, compared to the transcriptome of med, which contains  <dig>  distinct sequences, the number of genes in the asia ii  <dig> transcriptome is much less. this is probably due to the lower number of sequencing reads in the transcriptomes of asia ii  <dig>  and meam <dig>  compared to the med transcriptome    <cit> . even though a large number of genes  were identified, a large fraction of lowly expressed transcripts were probably missed due to a low number of sequence reads .

functional annotation of asia ii  <dig> transcriptome
for functional annotation, distinct sequences were searched against the non-redundant  ncbi nucleotide database and a total of  <dig>  genes returned an above cut-off blast result representing about  <dig> % of all distinct sequences . this proportion is similar to the 20% to 40% of annotated sequences from a traditional sanger sequenced est library  <cit> . to determine the possible functions of assembled asia ii  <dig> genes, gene ontology  assignments were used to classify the distinct sequences. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  sequences could be categorized into functional groups under the “molecular function”, “biological process” and “cellular component” divisions . the functions of genes cover various biological processes and genes participate in “cellular process” and “metabolic process” are the most highly represented. next, we compared the go classification of the asia ii  <dig> transcriptome with that of meam <dig> and med transcriptomes, respectively  <cit>  and found that the distributions of gene functions from these three species are similar . these results suggest: i) the functions of genes from asia ii  <dig>  meam <dig> and med are highly conserved; ii) there is no bias in the construction of the libraries from these b. tabaci species.

analysis of asia ii  <dig> gene expression
the level of asia ii  <dig> gene expression was analyzed based on the number of reads per kilobase per million mapped reads ; and a list of all the genes and expression levels are shown in additional file  <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first global analysis of gene expression level in b. tabaci. twenty annotated genes with very high expression levels  were found. many of the genes with significant expression levels were involved in cell structure , ribosome  and energy metabolism  . this finding is not surprising, as these genes are essential for the survival of an organism. next, we grouped asia ii  <dig> genes into three categories based on their levels of expression. roughly, 14% of the genes were highly expressed , 25% of the transcripts were in medium level  and 61% of the genes had a rpkm< <dig> . conversely, when calculating the number of reads for each gene, it was found that the small fraction of highly expressed genes constituted approximately 61% of the sequenced reads, whereas only 13% of the reads were from the genes with low expression levels .

bgene expression level was determined by calculating the number of reads for each gene and then normalizing to rpkm .

identification and analysis of b. tabaci protein families
to compare the transcriptomes of asia ii  <dig>  meam <dig> and med, protein families for the three species were built. a total of  <dig>  protein families were identified based on sequence similarities . the number of protein families for med transcriptome was  <dig> , which is much higher than that of asia ii  <dig>  and meam <dig> . in this comparison, both diversification and conservation of the b. tabaci transcriptomes were obvious at the protein family level. a total of  <dig>  protein families were conserved among the transcriptomes of asia ii  <dig>  meam <dig> and med which represent the core cellular and physiological proteins  common to the three species. the total number of protein families found in only one species was  <dig>  , which might be responsible for the differences and unique features of each species . however, as these transcriptomes are incomplete, the number of species-specific protein families is likely to change when more genes are sequenced. among these specific protein families, the majority was from med . this is probably due to the higher sequencing amount of med  compared to asia ii  <dig>  and meam <dig>    <cit> . to reveal the common characteristics of the whitefly transcriptomes, a hypergeometric test was implemented to identify enriched go terms in the “core protein families”. a total of  <dig> protein families were significantly enriched . interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> enriched go terms were related to nucleotide binding. this phenomenon is consistent with the previous finding in the analysis of nematode transcriptomes  <cit>  and demonstrates the importance and conservation of nucleotide binding proteins in different species. the other major go terms enriched in the “core protein families” were related to amino acid transporter, protein folding, proteolysis and peptidase, suggesting the critical roles of protein transportation and metabolism among the three b. tabaci species .

identification of the orthologous genes between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig>  asia ii  <dig> and med
possible orthologous genes between the transcriptomes of asia ii  <dig> and meam1were identified according to the diagram in figure  <dig> . between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig>  a total of  <dig>  pairs of possible orthologs were identified. among these sequence pairs,  <dig>  pairs of sequences could be unambiguously mapped to the same protein in swissprot database, suggesting strongly that they are orthologous genes . based on the coding information of swissprot hits, the untranslated region  of each gene pair was predicted  and  <dig>  pairs of orthologous coding sequences  were obtained . the features of the  <dig>  orthologous genes are listed in table  <dig>  similarly,  <dig>  pairs of potential orthologs were identified between asia ii  <dig> and med . after the swissprot annotation,  <dig> pairs of 5’utrs,  <dig> pairs of 3’ utrs and  <dig>  pairs of cds were identified between the transcriptomes of asia ii  <dig> and med . the average divergence for the  <dig>  orthologous genes between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig> is  <dig> %. this difference is comparable to the average divergence between asia ii  <dig> and med  and much higher than the divergence between meam <dig> and med    <cit> . genome sequences are very useful for constructing phylogenetic trees with high resolution and accuracy. using all the orthologous genes among the three species, a neighbor-joining tree was reconstructed . the phylogenetic distance between meam <dig> and med is less than that of the invasive whiteflies to the native asia ii  <dig>  this is not surprising as both meam <dig> and med originated from the middle east asia minor and mediterranean basin regions whereas asia ii  <dig> is a native species in china  <cit> .

the sequence divergence between asia ii  <dig> and meam1
to reveal the molecular variation between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig>  the sequence divergence was analyzed between the orthologous genes of their transcriptomes . the average divergence between the 5’utrs of asia ii  <dig> and the meam <dig> orthologous genes is  <dig> % which is almost twice as much as between the same region of meam <dig> and med. similar to previous reports, the divergence rate at the cpg sites in the 5’utr  is much higher than that of non-cpg sites . for the 3’utr, the overall difference between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig> is  <dig> %. cpg and non-cpg sites differ at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . hence, in the 3’utr, cpg sites contain  <dig>  times of differences compared to non-cpg sites. among the  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs, the overall divergence in cds is  <dig> %. in non-cpg sites, the divergence is slightly lower , whereas the cpg site divergence  is about  <dig>  times as high as the non-cpg site divergence . nucleotides in cds can further be classified as non-degenerative  sites  and four fold degenerate  sites . at nd sites the overall divergence is  <dig> %, whereas the overall divergence at 4d sites  is  <dig>  times of that at the nd sites. this is due to the fact that any nucleotide substitutions at an nd site will produce an amino acid change; therefore nd sites evolve under extensive functional constraints. to understand the mechanism of gene evolution in the b. tabaci complex, we also compared the ratio of transition  and transversion  of the three species  <cit> . overall, the transitional differences are more frequent than transversional differences in 5’utrs , cds  and 3’utrs  . interestingly, for all regions, the transition-transversion ratio is higher in the cpg positions than the non-cpg positions . this is consistent with the suggestion that, in the cpg sites, the predominant type of mutations is cytosine deamination, which results in transitional differences  <cit> .

the sequence divergence between asia ii  <dig> and med
for asia ii  <dig> and med, the average differences between the 5’utrs, cds and the 3’utrs are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . the sequence divergences are almost the same between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig> and nearly twice of the divergence between meam <dig> and med which is  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %   <cit> . likewise, in the 4d and nd regions, the same phenomenon was observed . it confirmed the previous analysis that the phylogenetic distance between meam <dig> and med is shorter than that of the invasive whiteflies to the native asia ii  <dig>   <cit> . these results indicate that despite high-sequence identity in their coding sequences, the asia ii  <dig>  meam <dig> and med b. tabaci species have diverged substantially between their transcriptomes. the levels of sequence divergence provide further supports to the previous proposition that asia ii  <dig>  meam <dig> and med are different species  <cit> .

analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous sites
the nonsynonymous  and synonymous  substitution rates have been widely used to measure the intensity of gene evolution. to identify genes undergoing purifying or positive selections, we estimated ka and ks rates of orthologous gene pairs. among the  <dig>  pairs of cds between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig>  both a ka and a ks rate could be calculated for  <dig>  orthologs . the  <dig>  sequence pairs had mean values of ka, ks and ka/ks of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . these ratios are similar to the average ka/ks ratio of meam <dig> & med , ka/ks ratio of rat & mouse  and human & chimpanzee   <cit> . the distribution of the ka/ks ratio showed that the majority of genes  have ka/ks ratios less than  <dig>  indicating the strong purifying selection for these genes. in addition, fisher's exact test reports that nearly 56% of the genes are statistically significant  . in this set of data,  <dig> orthologous gene pairs had a ka/ks value >  <dig> suggesting that strong positive selection acts on these genes. among the sequences with ka/ks values >  <dig>  a number of genes are involved in protein metabolism, such as peptide deformylase, cathepsin, cysteine proteinase and metalloendopeptidase, suggesting this process is critical for the differentiation of the b. tabaci species complex. between asia ii  <dig> and med, a total of  <dig>  orthologs had ka and ks rates and the mean values of ka, ks and ka/ks were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the list of asia ii  <dig> and med genes with ka/ks and functional annotation is presented in additional file  <dig>  the distribution of ka/ks between asia ii  <dig> and med is similar to that of asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig>  in which  <dig> % of the genes had a high ka/ks> <dig> ,  <dig> % of the genes were highly conserved  and  <dig> genes had a ka/ks > <dig>  even though a number of genes under positive selection have been identified in our study, the simple ka/ks calculations are quite conservative and may fail to detect positive selection even when it exists  <cit> . further studies using more sophisticated site and branch specific models are needed for estimating ka/ks.

sequences with very weak amino-acid similarity
the  <dig>  sequence pairs between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig> had a mean homology of  <dig> % and the homology for individual gene pair ranged from  <dig> % to 100% . among these sequence pairs, only  <dig> show 100% homology . this is much lower compared to the  <dig> identical sequences between meam <dig> and med  <cit> . these results further suggest that the divergence between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig> is much higher that that between meam <dig> and med . to reveal the proteins responsible for the differences between the two species, the functions of sequence pairs with weak amino-acid similarity were analyzed. interestingly, many of the divergent genes were related to protein kinase and metabolism, such as protein kinase c , serine/threonine-protein kinase , glutathione s-transferase  and ethanolaminephosphotransferase  . to gain further insights into the diverged sequences, we compiled sequence identify data into gene functional groups using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  classifications. to prevent false positive results, only those classes containing five or more entries were shown . interestingly, we found that several classes of genes involved in signal transduction were highly conserved between the two species, such as phototransduction, taste transduction, olfactory transduction and mapk signaling pathway . on the other hand, the most divergent kegg classes were about metabolism, such as metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig>  glutathione metabolism, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism . it suggests that the divergence of cytochrome p <dig> genes in the metabolism of xenobiotics might be important for the differentiation between meam <dig> and asia ii  <dig> and warrant further investigation.

analysis of snp
to further understand the mechanism of divergence, we analyzed the potential snp sites in cds of the orthologous gene pairs between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig>  for asia ii  <dig>  a total of  <dig> snps were identified within the  <dig>  kb aligned regions, about  <dig> every ten thousands bp. the complete list of snps with annotation can be found in additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig> snps,  <dig>  were synonymous and  <dig>  were non-synonymous. this percentage of snps is much lower than those obtained in previous analyses in other insects  <cit> . the possible reason is that our b. tabaci populations were established from a pair of b. tabaci and the samples were collected within five generations. for meam <dig>  a slightly higher number of snps  were found in the orthologous gene pairs with  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous . compared with the average divergence between asia ii  <dig> and meam <dig> in cds , the percentage of snps is more than  <dig> times lower. next, the potential snp sites in the cds of orthologous gene pairs between asia ii  <dig> and med were analyzed. our results showed that a total of  <dig> snps in asia ii  <dig> and  <dig> snps in med were identified within the  <dig>  kb aligned regions . the large variation between the numbers of snps in asia ii  <dig> and med is probably due to the difference in the sequencing among of asia ii  <dig>  and med  . some of the snps in asia ii  <dig> might have been filtered out because only snp sites with the minimum read depth of  <dig> reads were selected. thses results are consistent with previous findings, in which overall number of snps decreases at lower coverage levels  <cit> . while the snps we have identified here are suitable for future research, more rigorous statistical tests are required to confirm the current results as well as to detect specific codons undergoing adaptive changes. in addition, further studies of the snps on population samples are warranted as our data were generated from inbred lab colonies.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study dramatically increases the number of genes from the native asia ii  <dig> b. tabaci species. together with the previously available meam <dig> and med transcriptomes, this study is the first globally comparative analyses of the genetic differences between the invasive and indigenous b. tabaci species. based on sequence homology, a group of  <dig>  protein families conserved among the asia ii  <dig>  meam <dig> and med species were identified. these protein families might be responsible for core cellular and physiological functions of the b. tabaci complex. sequence comparisons of all orthologous gene pairs revealed that the average genetic divergences between asia ii  <dig> and invasive meam <dig> are nearly twice of that between meam <dig> and med, in accordance with previous genetic studies. the divergent genes identified in this study will be an invaluable resource to reveal the possible mechanisms of b. tabaci invasion, displacement and speciation.
