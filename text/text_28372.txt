BACKGROUND
population genetic structure is dependent on the interaction of the biology of a species and the environment in which it resides. marine organisms generally show low levels of genetic differentiation over large geographic distances  <cit> . in open marine systems it is evident that higher dispersal potential during planktonic egg, larval, or adult stages coupled with the absence of physical barriers to movement seems to greatly facilitate extensive gene flow among populations of organisms  <cit> . however, populations of freshwater fish species from different basins often show significant genetic differentiation resulting from isolation, while populations within a basin often show no or low levels of genetic differentiation  <cit> . there is evidence that for some species instream barriers can restrict gene flow and induce high levels of genetic differentiation between populations  <cit> . even in the absence of restricted gene flow, multiple unrelated founding events could also shape the same pattern of population genetic structure  <cit> .

due to periodic climatic oscillations during the pleistocene, range contractions, range expansions and changes in interconnectivity within and between drainages during the periodic climatic oscillations of the pleistocene have greatly influenced the distribution of many fish species, have significantly altered the amount and distribution of intraspecific genetic variation in many species and have remodelled the population structures of temperate fish faunas  <cit> . the major climatic oscillations occurred during the past  <dig> kyr , and the last glacial maximum  occurred about  <dig> kyr ago with a decline of the sea levels of about 120– <dig> m  <cit> . each of the severe climatic shifts and the change in the sea levels could have produced great changes in the freshwater fish species' geographical distribution and abundance  <cit> . the legacy of these changes in the phylogeographic distribution of genetic diversity has been traced in several species  <cit> . in cyprinids, it has been shown that glacial, interglacial and postglacial oscillations have resulted in major changes of distributions and have shaped current distributions by changes of river courses and river confluences in response to falling sea levels  <cit> .

the family salangidae, which is classified as protacanthopterygii, order osmeriformes, suborder osmeroidei  <cit> , comprises six genera and approximately  <dig> species  <cit> . the salangid, neosalanx taihuensis, is one of the most economically important species in this family. this species is endemic to china and is restricted to large bodied freshwater systems such as inland lakes, out-flowing rivers and estuaries, covering a continuous distribution from the temperate  to the subtropical zone   <cit> . also, this species exhibits annualism poor swimming ability and has some neotenic features such as transparent miniaturized bodies, cartilaginous endoskeletons, and notochords  <cit> . the combination of relative large spatial distribution encompassing discrete drainages in tropical and subtropical regions and the low vagility constitutes a good model system to study the palaeoclimatic effects on population genetic structure and phylogeography of freshwater  <cit> . in recent years, because of water pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction, the population of n. taihuensis has undergone the lost of appropriate habitat and the decrease in population size  <cit> . in order to protect the resource of n. taihuensis, the habitat detection has to be implemented immediately, and the study on the n. taihuensis population structure and its phylogeoraphic pattern should be enhanced since the failure to detect population units will lead to local overfishing and ultimately to severe declines  <cit> . the salangidae family has been studied for more than  <dig> years, but most of studies have focused on taxonomy  <cit> , biology  <cit> , and molecular phylogeny  <cit> . previous studies in china have shown that in two unrelated species,opsariichthys bidens  and brachymystax lenok pallas , both had genetic patterns coinciding with contemporary drainage structure  <cit> , but the related study on n. taihuensis is not conducted till now.

the basins of yangtze river, huai river and pearl river, in which n. taihuensis mainly distributes, are important river systems in china. although a strong uplifting of the tibetan plateau occurred during the pleistocene in southwest china  <cit> , there is no evidence to indicate that large-scale river rearrangement occurred after the pliocene in the mid-lower reaches of these basins  <cit> . the yangze river and the huai river basin are connected by the peking hangzhou canal, while there are no connection between pearl river basin and the others <cit> . given the intolerance of the n. taihuensis to waters with some salt content, members of freshwater fish division cannot disperse by river connections  <cit> . therefore, we expect vicariance among basins might play an important role in shaping population genetic structure of n. taihuensis. in addition, the glaciations during the pleistocene, especially the last glacial maximum  with sea levels lowered , should have severely affected the genetic structure of this species. in order to detect the population structure and phylogeographic pattern of n. taihuensis at large geographical scales, samples of n. taihuensis were collected from  <dig> populations among the pearl river basin, the yangtze river basin, and the huai river basin . the complete mtdna cytochrome b gene  sequence was used to analyze population genetic differentiation of this species, population dynamics and demographic history, and to show how the glaciations influenced the phylogeographic patterns of freshwater fish, and how this species responded to the severe climatic oscillations and decline of the sea levels during the pleistocene ice ages.

RESULTS
sequence variation and genetic diversity
for  <dig> bp of the complete cyt b gene analyzed in  <dig> individuals, there were  <dig> variable nucleotide sites, and no insertions or deletions in any of the sequences. the average nucleotide composition for all individuals was highest for c , followed by t , a , and g . nucleotide composition showed an anti-g bias , which is characteristic for the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . since there were no stop codons when the cytb sequence was translated into amino acid sequences, and based on the criteria of zhang & hewitt  <cit> , we found no evidence for nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes  in our pcr sequences. linkage disequilibrium  test and selective neutrality test were implemented for cyt b sequences in n. taihuensis, which indicated that there was no signs of recombination  and the neutral hypothesis  could not be rejected  for these cyt b sequences. thus, the cyt b was suitable marker for analyzing the evolutionary history of this species.

thirty-six different haplotypes were identified in the  <dig> samples analyzed . the number of haplotypes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for each basin. the populations with the greatest number of haplotypes were the taihu lake population  and chaohu lake population  in yangze river basin, and the hongzehu lake population  in huai river basin. the haplotype frequency distribution was strongly skewed, with the vast majority of haplotypes found only once  and restricted to a single population. h <dig>  the most common haplotype found in  <dig> sampled populations with the exception of the xujiahe reservoir population, occupied  <dig> % of all individuals among all populations . other common haplotypes found in all three basins were h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all individuals, respectively .

note:n, number of individuals; h, number of haplotypes; s, number of segregating sites; h, gene diversity ; k, mean pair-wise nucleotide; π, nucleotide diversity 

diversity indices , h and π , are summarized in table  <dig>  the total of h was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and π was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ranging from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  among there basins. there are no evidences that heterogeneous levels of genetic variability were produced by unequal sample size for each population through pearson's correlation test between diversity indices and sample size . these results showed a medium/high haplotype diversity and a low nucleotide diversity, and that the genetic diversity for three near-coastal populations  were higher than others .

population structure and phylogeography
unrooted ml tree revealed that there were no distinct haplotype groups with high bootstrap support  and there was no geographical structure among haplotypes , which was supported by network analysis . in this study, only a few missing haplotypes were detected, which indicated that we gathered enough samples  for phylogeographical analysis. each haplotype was connected with others by  <dig> to  <dig> mutational steps, suggesting that there was no deep branching among halotypes for this species. in network, h <dig> yielded the highest outgroup weight  followed by h <dig> , h <dig> , and h <dig> , indicating h <dig> was the most probable ancestral haplotype  <cit> . in fact, the high frequency of shared haplotypes  were found among all basins, which produced a pattern of population relationships associated with the ancestry of the haplotypes found within each population rather than with the hydrological network . thus, we suggested that there was no obvious phylogeographic pattern within n. taihuensis.

pair-wise comparisons Φst test among  <dig> populations showed that the differences among the most of populations were irrelevant to their distributions . amova analysis revealed that there were significant subdivisions within and among populations of n. taihuensis, but no significant genetic variance was found among basins, with only  <dig> % of the genetic variance was found among basins , which provided evidences that the high level of population structure was not related to the hydrological pattern. the mantel test indicated no significant relationship between Φst/ and geographic distance among populations, with p =  <dig>  for all  <dig> populations among basins, p =  <dig>  for  <dig> populations within yangze river basin and p =  <dig>  for  <dig> populations within huai river basin, respectively.

Φst values are reported below, and the river distances  between populations above, the diagonal. asterisks indicate significant values after bonferroni correction.



the nca analysis  provided some historical information for the pattern of genetic differentiation for n. taihuensis. the widespread clade 1– <dig> with significantly small dc and large dn, were indicative long-distance colonization . clade 1– <dig>  clade 1– <dig>  and two second cladistic levels of clade 2- <dig>  clade 2- <dig> indicated restricted gene flow with isolation by distance, and the overall picture of nca indicated historical contiguous range expansion.

demographic analysis
an examination of demographic histories revealed the marked differences among the basins under study . the skyline plots  <cit> of n. taihuensis in the entire region and the yangze river basin showed a sudden stepwise expansion. fu's fs  <cit> , ramos-onsins and rozas's r <dig>  <cit>  tests for the entire region and fu's fs test for yangze river basin were statistically significant negative, supported this point. although both fs and r <dig> tests could not effectively tell the causes of bottleneck or expansion, fu and li's d*  <cit>  tests were not significant  for these populations, suggesting that there were no historical reduction in effective population size in these regions. the mtdna mismatch analyses for the entire region and the yangze river basin showed bimodal profile which might result from constant population size among an old population or an admixture population . however, the mismatch distribution goodness of fit test  was not significant, which indicated that there were no severe departure from the estimated demographic model. moreover, the results of the coalescent based analysis using fluctuate <dig>   <cit>  showed high growth rate, g =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the entire region and g =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the yangze river basin, providing powerful evidences of population expansion in these regions. in contrast to that of the entire region and the yangze river basin, the skyline plot for huai river basin provided evidence that the exponential growth model fitted the population demographic fluctuation well . significant fu's fs  and ramos-onsins and rozas's r <dig>  test, as well as high growth rate  confirmed population growth in huai river basin, which was also supported by the test of hri , although the bimodal mismatch distribution  and significance of ssd  indicated a poor fit for the stepwise growth model . for the pearl river basin, the bimodal mismatch distribution  and significance of ssd  values indicated a relative constant population size. fu and li's d* test, fu's fs and r <dig> test for pearl river basin were not significant, which also rejected population expansion/bottleneck model . in addition, a relative constant population size was confirmed by a relative low growth rate  with the approximate 95% confidence interval of g included zero in this region.



according to the tau value  and the mutation rates for the cyt b gene , the estimated expansion time was found to be  <dig>  kyr ago for the entire region and  <dig>  kyr ago for the yangze river basin. using the coalescent method, an estimate of tmrca was  <dig>  kyr for this species in the huai river basin and  <dig>  kyr in the pearl river basin, respectively .

to get a more detailed picture of the mutational pattern for population expansion of n. taihuensis within the yangze river basin and the huai river basin, genetree  <cit>  was used to construct a gene tree for determining the distribution of mutation time. to make the sequence data suitable for the infinite-sites model, four haplotypes  were excluded in this analysis. it is worth to note that the possible removal of data can have important effects on inference, and can lead to unusual conclusions  <cit> , but the results from this procedure can provide a rough profile for the distribution of mutations. as shown in figure.  <dig>  it was evident that the vast majority of mutations occurred near the tips of the gene tree, with  <dig> % mutations occurring within  <dig>  kyr in the yangze river basin and  <dig> % mutations occurring within  <dig>  kyr in the huai river basin.

discussion
population genetic structure and phylogeography
our results revealed low nucleotide diversity  and medium/high haplotype diversity  in n. taihuensis , which could reflect a recent expansion or a short evolutionary history of the population  <cit> . this scenario was also supported by the absence of deep branching among haplotypes in the genealogical tree and the "star-like" shaped network  as well as nca and demographic history analysis .

phylogenetic inference based on unrooted ml tree revealed that there were no distinct clades with high bootstrap support  and individuals from three basins did not partition into distinct clades , which indicated no geographical structure among haplotypes. the statistical parsimony network displayed a "star-like" shape with h <dig> being the most probable ancestral haplotype  , which also revealed a lack of geographical structure.

beyond the prediction that vicariance among basins should play an important role in shaping population genetic structure, the results of amova showed that the contemporary drainage structure served as a poor model in explaining the high levels of genetic differentiation, with only  <dig> % variance among basins, it was suggested that there must be other factors shaping the genetic structure of n. taihuensis. our results were in contrast to the 'stream hierarchy model'  <cit> , which showed that the distribution of genetic variation would follow different basins. similar results were found in many studies of freshwater fish species  <cit> , including opsariichthys bidens  conducted in the pearl river and the yangze river in china  <cit> . however, some researchers  <cit>  have reported population genetic structure in some freshwater fish species being analogous to our study, and these provided evidence that the contemporary drainage structure did not coincide with the genetic relationships among populations, or that the instream barriers and complex population histories played an important role in the determination of the population genetic structure.

pair-wise comparisons between Φst and amova analysis confirmed the existence of some degree of restricted gene flow, which could be one of the important factors determining the genetic structure among populations of n. taihuensis. however, the mantel test indicated no significant relationship between genetic differentiation and geographic distance among populations. the discrepancy between these results indicated that the pattern of genetic differentiation for n. taihuensis was complex and could not be interpreted simply using the ibd model.

in contrast, nca analysis revealed that multiple unrelated long-distance founding events could be important in determining the patterns of genetic diversity. in nca, the large dn and small dc suggests long distance dispersal  <cit> . the nca inferences for widespread clade 1– <dig>  including the most probable ancestral haplotype h <dig> with a significantly small dc and large dn, were indicative of range expansion and long-distance colonization   <cit> . the observed population relationships agreed with the population structure predicted by normal dispersal models of recently expanding populations, with a portion of individuals migrating beyond neighbouring demes because of rare long-distance migrants founding pocket populations under this dispersal scenario  <cit> . also, theoretical study has proven that even though no effectively restricting gene flow exists under these conditions, the effects on these founder-events can persist for thousands of generations, which results in higher levels of divergence within than between rivers  <cit> . in addition, it was also suggested that historical basin rearrangements might form the analogous population genetic structure mentioned above  <cit> . although a strong uplifting of the tibetan plateau occurred during the pleistocene in southwest china  <cit> , there is no evidence to indicate that large-scale river rearrangement occurred after the pliocene in our study area  <cit> . it may imply that historical basin rearrangements are not critical in determining the current population genetic structure of this species. accordingly, we suggested that the current complex population genetic structure of this species was mainly constituted by multiple unrelated founding events  of dispersal, and also affected by contiguous population expansion and some degree of restricted gene flow.

demographic history
statistical analysis of sequences was originally developed to test selective neutrality of mutations and has recently been used to test for population expansion. demographic events are also commonly analyzed by using the distribution of pair-wise differences or mismatch distributions of non-recombining dna sequence such as mtdna  <cit> . comparative studies on the test power of various statistics suggested the superiority of fs and r <dig> over other statistics  <cit> . the power of these tests also depends on sample size, and the r <dig> test is more powerful for a small sample while fs is more powerful for a large sample  <cit> . in this study, fs tests were significant for the entire region, yangze river basin and huai river basin. however, r <dig> tests were significant for the entire region and huai river basin, but not significant for yangze river basin . the different results for population expansion in this study may reflect the differences in sample size requirements of the tests as well as source information.

mismatch distribution analysis was a common method to infer population demography; however, some of inferences of the mismatch analysis were not consistent with the results of the other indices in this study . besides a relative lower statistical power of demography analysis  <cit> , other factors might also induce such scenario. first, the single stepwise expansion model in mismatch analysis might be inadequate for some populations  <cit> , and the use of an incorrect demographic model can also lead to biased and invalid estimates of demographic history and other evolutionary parameters  <cit> . as the case for huai river basin in this study, the skyline plot provided evidence that the exponential growth model could be more realistic than that of stepwise expansion . second, mismatch analysis needed a pair of genes being chosen at random from the population. in populations having gone through a recent and still large expansion, the internal branches should be very short due to the star-like structure of the tree, and a very few mutations would accumulate on those branches  <cit> . in this case, pairs drawn from the sample would be not independent due to the shared portions of their genealogy  <cit> . in this study, both unrooted ml tree and the statistical parsimony network displayed "star-like" shape with no deep branching among halotypes . so the inadequate information inferred from mismatch analysis might attribute to the sign in the data set being swamped by non-independence in this study. moreover, although the unrooted ml tree indicated that there were no distinct haplotype groups with high bootstrap support, the results of our phylogeographic analysis revealed that there were high levels of genetic differentiation among populations, and that the genetic pattern of this species was mainly constituted by multiple unrelated founding events. so cases of founder events not containing all genetic types in some regions might be unavoidable, and could severely affect the shape of the mismatch distribution. finally, other factors such as high frequency of the ancestral haplotypes, population substructure, or inbreeding could also affect the shape of the mismatch distribution, but to an extent these effects had not been quantified  <cit> .

however, the methods of mismatch distribution analysis and neutrality test did not make full use of the data  <cit> . the coalescent-based method, by incorporating information from the genealogical tree structure of dna sequences, used more information in the data and seemed to be more adequate to estimate demographic growth  <cit> . in yangze river and huai river basin, three different coalescent-based methods, the skyline plot  <cit> , the estimate of population growth rate  using fluctuate  <dig>   <cit>  and the distribution of mutations conducted by genetree  <cit> , which provided the similar information of population expansion in these regions, suggested that the superiority of the coalescent-based method. in conclusion, despite of some inconsistency in these results, it was evident that the combined demographic analysis could confirm population expansion in yangze river and huai river basin, while a relative constant population size in pearl river basin.

during the last glacial maximum , with sea levels lowered   <cit> , the present distribution range of n. taihuensis was almost completely exposed and eradicated, and this species should have been severely impacted by the past glaciations. our estimate of tmrca in the pearl river and the huai river basin, and the population expansion time for n. taihuensis in the yangze river basin were much older than that of lgm. it was difficult to link the population demographic history to any particular pleistocene paleo-climatic event. however, the gene tree  provided evidence that the pleistocene ice ages had a great effect on the demographic history of this species. that the vast majority of mutations occurred near the tips of the gene tree suggests that population expansion events mainly occurred after lgm. therefore, we proposed that in the yangze river basin and the huai river basin, the n. taihuensis should have been the most severely impacted by the past glaciations, surviving in some refugium, and then post-glacial colonizations and population expansions occurred with the climate warming and sea levels uplifting after the late quaternary   <cit> . further, three near-coastal populations  contained higher numbers of haplotypes, haplotype diversity  and nucleotide diversity  , suggesting that a glacial refugium could exist near the estuaries. however, n. taihuensis has been exposed to pollution and habitat destruction for decades; its population size has decreased drastically in out-flowing rivers and estuaries of these basins under study  <cit> . no sample from these locations could be collected to detect the probable glacial refugium. further studies should be conducted in future. in addition, it is worthy to note that many attached lakes formed in these areas with sea levels uplifting after the lgm. for example, chaohu lake and taihu lake in the yangze river basin shaped about  <dig> and  <dig>  kyr ago, respectively, and hongzehu lake and weishanhu lake in the huai river basin was shaped about  <dig>  and  <dig>  kyr ago, respectively  <cit> . this indicated that the formation of appropriate habitations facilitated historical population expansions. this inference was compatible with the "r-strategy" characteristic of n. taihuensis with high relative fertility and a shorter generation time  <cit> , which also suggests its population size could be severely affected by climate and habitation. thus, it is not surprising that n. taihuensis has maintained a relatively constant population size in the pearl river basin, because this area is a subtropical zone, with average  <dig> – 3°c higher than in the yangze river basin or the huai river basin during the pleistocene  <cit> . there was no large-scale creation of appropriate habitations  after the lgm in this area.

implications for conservation
the salangid, neosalanx taihuensis, is one of the most important commercial species in this family. the dry or frozen salangids are good materials in chinese food, and they are also exported to japan and other southern-east asia countries. but, it has to be noticed that the population size of n. taihuensis and its fishing yield have decreased rapidly in recent years  <cit> . for example, the yield of salangids per year in poyanghu lake decreased from  <dig> ×  <dig> kg in 1960s to  <dig> kg in  <dig>  <cit> , and the fishery production of n. taihuensis was completely collapsed in poyanghu lake thereafter  <cit> . the yield of salangids per year in the yellow river has also decreased since  <dig>  and the lowest yield per year less than  <dig> kg occurred in  <dig>  <cit> . according to our investigation being from  <dig> to  <dig> and the information from the local fishery management offices, both adults and juveniles are now rarely found in the yellow river. some authors thought that over-fishing was a serious problem  <cit> , but you et al. suggested that over-fishing was not the most important threat to this species  <cit> . on the other hand, the water pollution should be also the one of the most serious threat to n. taihuensis  <cit> . the environment of n. taihuensis has been polluted because of the waste water from urban, industry and agriculture  <cit> . finally, the threat to n. taihuensis is also from the habitat fragmentation. since mid 1950s, the aquatic networks have been fragmented dramatically with the construction of dykes and floodgates across the river-lake connections  <cit> . most of the lakes in the mid-lower reaches lost their connection with the main river watercourse by the mid 1980s  <cit> . consequently, most of the small lakes nearly disappeared and the mid-large lakes shrank considerably resulting in unsuitable habitat for this species  <cit> . up to the present, no specific protect action has been taken for n. taihuensis, so it is urgent to make an effective plan to protect this economically important species.

the study on population structure and its phylogeoraphic pattern could provide particularly information for us to more broadly consider conservation options and more accurately assign appropriate fishery management  <cit> . according to the model proposed by moritz  <cit> , evolutionary significant units  are designated on the basis of reciprocal monophyly at mitochondrial markers. in the present study, phylogenetic inference based on ml and nca methods revealed that it was no geographical structure among haplotypes in n. taihuensis, suggesting that there was not a genetically distinct and independent population that could be considered as an esu. however, amova analysis indicated that significant genetic variance resulted from genetic differences among populations and within basins. in addition, based on low vagility, geographic isolation among most populations and rapidly population decline over the recent decades for this species  <cit> , we proposed that all populations should be managed and conserved separately. moreover, special attention must be paid on habitat protection and pollution control because this species is susceptive to appropriate habitat change.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that this species presented a very random genetic pattern and was not compatible with the present hydrological structure. this genetic pattern might be formed mainly by multiple unrelated long distance founding events, combining with population expansion and the instream barriers restricting gene flow. demographic analysis revealed that the populations in the pearl river basin  has kept a relatively constant population size of n. taihuensis, but populations in the yangze river basin and the huai river basin expanded about  <dig>  and  <dig>  kyr ago, respectively, with the majority of mutations occurring after the lgm. we concluded that the more favourable climate and the formation of appropriate large-scale habitations facilitated this expansion. we suggested that it was necessary to develop a suitable management plan for n. taihuensis based on our results.
