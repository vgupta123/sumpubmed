BACKGROUND
duf <dig> proteins constitute a highly conserved family of cell wall-associated proteins specific to spermatophytes  <cit> . although proteins in this family have been detected in cell-wall proteomes from a variety of plants and tissues, only one functional study on this protein family has been published so far. at5g <dig> is highly expressed in seedlings during the early developmental stages, and plants of the at5g25460-null mutant have shorter roots and smaller rosettes than those of wild-type plants  <cit> .

transcriptome analyses have revealed the differential expression of five duf <dig> genes during seed barley germination, suggesting a possible function of this protein family during the germination process  <cit> . in addition, differential spatial expression of duf <dig> genes among various seed compartments during germination has been reported in arabidopsis thaliana. a gene expression study showed that at3g <dig> and at5g <dig> transcripts are enriched in the micropylar endosperm before testa rupture, whereas at4g <dig> is expressed in this compartment after testa rupture  <cit> . in brassica oleracea seeds, the expression of the at5g <dig> gene ortholog increases during germination  <cit> . at3g <dig> transcript is present in after-ripened seeds, and the transcript levels increased in seeds subjected to controlled imbibitions in soil or water . notably, at3g <dig> transcript is absent from aged seeds with low germination performance  <cit> .

duf <dig> proteins have been detected in the cell-wall proteomes of multiple tissues  <cit> . a transcriptome analysis of stigmatic papillae cells revealed high transcript levels of two duf <dig> genes, at4g <dig> and at2g <dig>  and genes encoding other cell wall-related proteins, including a pectin methyl esterase. cell wall remodeling of the stigma is involved in successful pollination, likely via regulating the penetration of the pollen tube through the transmitting tract  <cit> . in lilium longiflorum, an analysis of proteins in the stigmatic exudate revealed a duf <dig> protein  <cit> .

proteins encoded by at4g <dig> and at5g <dig> interact in vitro with the catalytic domain of pectin methyl esterase  <dig>   <cit> . protein interactome data have proved to be an useful resource for formulating and testing hypotheses  <cit> . one potential physiological function of the duf <dig> proteins encoded by at4g <dig> and at5g <dig> is related to the regulation of pme activity. several studies have shown that the degree of pectin methylesterification, a highly regulated process, is critical for fine-tuning the biomechanical properties of the cell wall during various developmental processes . the demethylesterification of pectins is mediated by pmes, and pme catalytic activity is regulated by pme inhibitor  proteins  <cit> .

unesterified pectins, especially homogalacturonans , are the substrates for polygalacturonases , enzymes regulated by polygalacturonase inhibitor proteins  that are involved in cell separation processes  <cit> . differences in pectin methylesterification have been described during pistil, silique, and seed development. in olive, low methylesterified hgs are detected in the stigma and in the transmitting tissue during pollination  <cit> . in a. thaliana, silique growth is related to a decrease in the degree of methylesterification  <cit> . in seeds of a. thaliana, the cell walls within the embryo have low levels of unesterified pectins, the endosperm cell walls contain abundant unesterified hg, and the testa cell walls are rich in highly methylesterified hg  <cit> . in a. thaliana, the genes encoding pectin-modifying enzymes and their regulators are highly regulated during the first 24 h of seed germination  <cit> . in yellow cedar seeds, pme activity positively correlates with germination performance  <cit> .

in a. thaliana and related endospermic species, germination is a two-step process that requires testa and endosperm rupture for radicle protrusion  <cit> . during a. thaliana germination, pme activity increases until testa rupture is complete, and decreases during endosperm breakdown. overexpression of pmei led to accelerate endosperm breakdown and an improved capacity for radicle emergence. delays in endosperm rupture caused by abscisic acid significantly extend the period of high pme activity  <cit> . conversely, pgip overexpression inhibits germination, a process that is enhanced in pgip mutant seeds  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to study the function of the duf <dig> gene at4g <dig> during seed germination and plant development. we evaluated the role of the bdx protein in the regulation of pme activity, focusing on the periods of seed germination and plant growth. we demonstrated that the overexpression of either at4g <dig> or its homolog at5g <dig> increased pme activity and promoted germination, primarily by accelerating testa rupture. we also demonstrated that total pme activity was inhibited in at4g <dig> antisense transgenic plants and that the morphological changes in these plants included small siliques with no seeds. this phenotype was also observed in salk t-dna mutants. in accordance with these results, we named at4g <dig> as biidxi , which means ‘seed’ in the zapotec language. our data suggest that duf <dig> proteins are involved in the regulation of pme, thereby remodeling the cell wall during various processes in plant development.

RESULTS
biidxi is expressed in the embryos of imbibed seeds, roots, leaves, stems, and various floral organs . to determine whether the cloned region  was sufficient to drive expression in a pattern similar to that described previously for a. thaliana, we produced transgenic plant lines containing the cloned fragment fused to the green fluorescent protein  reporter. three transgenic lines were produced, and we monitored gfp fluorescence throughout their growth and development. gfp driven by the bdx promoter was highly expressed in the vascular tissue of primary and lateral roots, and in leaves, stamens, and petals . gfp fluorescence was detected in the vascular tissue of radicles from seeds that had been germinating for 48 h and 72 h . during the seed imbibition process, gfp fluorescence was detected from 6 h until germination was complete . in the primary roots of 6-day-old seedlings, gfp fluorescence was detected exclusively in the provascular tissue of the meristematic and transition zone . in the roots of 8-day-old seedlings, gfp fluorescence was detected in pericycle cells in the differentiation zone . in the roots of 22-day-old plants, gfp fluorescence was detected in the vascular tissue in specific regions of the mature zone . gfp fluorescence was also detected in the vascular tissue of fully expanded leaves . during different stages of flower development, bdx promoter-driven gfp expression was detected exclusively in the vascular tissue of stamen filaments and anthers, in petals, and in the stigmatic papilla, as described previously  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

next, we analyzed bdx promoter activity in embryos at various stages; heart stage, torpedo stage, and mature embryos . gfp fluorescence was detected in provascular cells from the radicle meristematic region of the mature embryo  and in embryos at the torpedo  and heart stages . the expression pattern of gfp driven by the bdx promoter was primarily associated with vascular tissue during different stages of plant development, consistent with previous reports.figure  <dig>

transcriptome analyses have revealed that bdx expression is induced by auxin  <cit>  and also by gibberellic acid  during germination  <cit> . in silico analysis of the putative promoter region  revealed at least two auxin response factor motifs  <cit>  and two gibberellic acid response element   <cit> . we performed hormone induction analyses to test whether the pbdx fragment contained information for auxin and ga responses. auxin and ga treatments, for 2 h or 48 h, altered bdx expression in the roots of 7-day-old seedlings. in both treatments, bdx expression was detected in vascular tissue, as previously observed in control seedlings, but also in cortical cells .

to understand the physiological function of bdx, we generated overexpression lines  in which the full-length at4g <dig> coding sequence was expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter . several independent and homozygous transgenic lines were obtained. we examined dry seeds from two lines to determine their pme activity and bdx transcript levels.figure  <dig>

bdx transcript was not detected in wt dry seeds, but was presented at high levels in the overexpression lines . although there were no morphological differences among the different lines at all developmental stages , there was increased total pme activity in vegetative-meristem-enriched samples and in seedlings , compared with that in wt. there was no significant difference in pme activity in leaves between the overexpression lines and wt . in wt a. thaliana seeds, pme activity has been reported to increase before testa rupture and to decrease at the beginning of endosperm rupture  <cit> . based on this information, we performed a germination analysis of matrix-primed seeds of two oebdx lines and wt plants. plants transformed with the empty vector were used as a negative control . compared with wt, oebdx lines showed a shorter initial time of testa rupture , and their seeds showed a shorter time to endosperm break initial time .

phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that bdx and at5g <dig> resulted from a recent duplication event, and that their respective encoded proteins interact with atpme <dig> in vitro  <cit> . also, recent studies have shown that at5g <dig> expression in the micropylar endosperm increases prior to testa rupture, suggesting a potential role for at5g <dig> in this process  <cit> . to evaluate the possible role of at5g <dig> in testa rupture, we generated overexpression lines . there were no morphological differences among the different lines and wt . at5g <dig> transcript was detected at high levels in dry oe <dig> seeds . compared with wt, the oe <dig> lines showed a significant increase in pme activity in vegetative-meristem-enriched samples and seedlings , but no significant change in pme activity in the leaves . also, oe <dig> matrix-primed seeds showed improved germination, compared with that of wt seeds . specifically, the lag time until the initiation of testa and endosperm rupture was shorter in oe <dig> seeds than in wt seeds . there was an increase in the rate of endosperm rupture in oe <dig> lines . germination analysis of oebdx and oe <dig> matrix-primed seeds suggests that the overexpression of these genes in dry seeds improves their germination, possibly through enhancing testa rupture performance .figure  <dig>

to determine the effects of the overexpressed genes on seed germination and pme activity during germination, we tested seeds without a priming pre-treatment. the initial testa rupture and endosperm rupture times were shorter for oe seeds than for wt seeds . the seeds of oebdx and oe <dig> did not show different testa rupture rates, but seeds of both lines showed significantly lower endosperm rupture rates compared with that of wt seeds . for wt seeds, pme activity increased before testa rupture was complete and decreased thereafter, similar to the pattern reported previously  <cit> . the same pattern of pme activity was observed in oe <dig> seeds. at 20 h of germination, pme activity was significantly higher in oe <dig> seeds than in wt seeds. however, the pme activity pattern for oebdx seeds was different; the pme activity did not decrease at 34 h of germination. in the 1-h and 34-h germinating seeds, pme activity was higher in oebdx seeds than in wt seeds .figure  <dig>

pectins are the main component of a. thaliana seed mucilage, and can be detected by staining with ruthenium red  <cit> . in water-imbibed oebdx seeds, mucilage release was similar to that of wt imbibed seeds .

next, we used antisense rna technology to silence bdx expression. an at4g <dig> rna antisense transgene driven by the cognate promoter of the endogenous bdx gene  was transformed into wild-type a. thaliana plants to generate asbdx plants . five independent transgenic lines were obtained by kanamycin selection. all of these transgenic lines exhibited phenotypic variation in the t <dig> progeny, and the segregation analysis revealed a 3: <dig> ratio of wt phenotypes to defective phenotypes. this ratio was previously observed for an antisense construct with a cognate promoter in rice  <cit> . analyses of morphological and developmental defects were conducted using three independent antisense lines. all three lines showed reduced silique size and did not produce seeds . analysis of a transverse section of a stage  <dig> asbdx flower bud revealed abnormal carpel morphology. the size of the stigma was decreased, and the septum had engrossed regions. in mature ovules, different tissues could not be differentiated . the mean silique length for asbdx lines  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 4 mm, respectively, corresponding to a size reduction of at least 60% . compared with wt, all three asbdx lines showed significantly lower pme activity in the leaves . a quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  analysis revealed that all three asbdx lines showed a 40% reduction in at4g <dig> transcript levels, compared with that in wt inflorescences .figure  <dig>

we conducted a phenotypic analysis of two salk lines, salk_ <dig> and salk_ <dig>  each of which have a t-dna insertion in the bdx coding sequence. the results provided further evidence that bdx plays roles in reproductive development, and possibly in modulating pme . the t-dna insertion in the salk_ <dig> line is at end of the second exon and that in the salk_ <dig> line at the end of the third exon of the at4g <dig> locus . heterozygous plants of the two salk lines showed a reduction in silique length, similar to that in asbdx plants . however, in the salk lines, the siliques contained a few seeds . some seeds showed an abnormal morphology and were not viable . seeds with normal morphology generated either heterozygous or wt plants but not homozygous plants. a qrt-pcr analysis showed a significant decrease in bdx transcript levels in t-dna heterozygous plants .figure  <dig>

discussion
duf <dig> is a highly conserved family of cell wall-related proteins specific to spermatophytes. this family shows a high level of amino acid identity among different plant species, suggesting that members of the duf <dig> play an important function in plant cell wall properties  <cit> . our results showed that bdx was expressed in embryos, in imbibed seeds, in 48-h seedlings, and throughout the adult plant, where it was primarily localized in vascular tissue, as has been described for at5g <dig>  <cit>  . bdx was detected in the initial cells of the different stages of the embryo and primary root, mainly in the pericycle cells before lateral root emergence; therefore, its expression in vascular tissue in other organs could be related to these types of cells.

auxin signaling promotes the emergence of lateral root primordia  <cit> . in the present study, auxin induced bdx expression in roots , and bdx was highly expressed in stigma tissue of stage  <dig> flowers , where auxin-signaling genes are overrepresented  <cit> . auxin distribution in the stigma plays an important role in the pollination process. in the asbdx plants, the siliques were very short and contained no seeds; in the heterozygous t-dna plants, the siliques were short but they contained a few seeds . the high transcript level of bdx in stigma tissue could be related to the low seed yield of asbdx and t-dna plants. it has been suggested that the regulation of cell wall structure, and especially pectin status, in female tissue is fundamental for pollen tube penetration  <cit> . previous studies have shown that methylesterification of the transmitting tract decreases before and during pollination and that pme activity increases during silique development  <cit> . whereas pme3-null mutants showed no morphological changes in silique development  <cit> , pmei <dig> oe plants grew short and wrinkled siliques containing only one or two seeds. a decrease in total pme activity is detected in pmei <dig> oe  <cit>  and in asbdx plants .

bdx was also expressed during embryogenesis . in three generations, homozygous t-dna plants were not obtained, suggesting that there was an embryo development defect in null mutant plants.

transgenic plants overexpressing atpme <dig> showed an increase in total pme activity, but their only morphological changes are longer roots and taller shoots than those of wt  <cit> . in the present study, the a. thaliana plants overexpressing bdx and at5g <dig> had no morphological changes, as compared with wt, during different vegetative stages of the life cycle, although they showed higher total pme activity in the meristem, seedlings, and imbibed seeds . the increased pme activity could be related to improved germination performance in oebdx and oe <dig> seeds. compared with wt seeds, oebdx and oe <dig> seeds showed shorter initial times to testa rupture, which were correlated with the increase in pme activity . a previous study showed that the at5g <dig> transcript is enriched in the micropylar endosperm before testa rupture  <cit> . in the present study, there were high levels of pme activity in the hours before testa rupture in the oe <dig> line, suggesting that at5g <dig> plays a physiological role in germination.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicated that the duf <dig> proteins encoded by bdx and at5g <dig> are positive regulators of pme activity in a. thaliana. they may affect pme activity directly, or indirectly via altering cell wall properties. the relevance of cell wall modifications during plant development has been studied extensively, and pmes have been shown to play important roles in modulating methylesterification during fruit development and germination  <cit> . in this study, the lines overexpressing bdx and at5g <dig> showed increased pme activity during seed germination, a two-step process that is highly correlated with changes in pme activity. we speculate that pme activation leads to faster completion of germination by improving the capacity for testa rupture. previous studies have shown that reduced cell wall pectin methylesterification allows improved access of pg to degrade pectin and promote cell separation in the testa. in addition, the modulation of pg activity by pgip was shown to inhibit germination  <cit> .

many morphogenetic events during algal and plant development are related to pectin chemistry  <cit> . in chara corallina, pectin de-esterification promotes cell expansion  <cit> . phyllotaxis and organ initiation depend on the regulation of pectin status of the meristem  <cit> . during pollen tube elongation, a spatial gradient in pectin methyl-esterification is shown to be precisely controlled by pmes and pmei proteins  <cit> .

the evolution of the complexity of the methylesterification process is an important process in plant diversification and adaptation to different environments. the expression of pectin and pme in cell walls first occurred in charophytes. the inhibitory domain of pmes appeared in the pmei family in land plants during the divergence of mosses from charophytes  <cit> . the cellulose binding protein  of the nematode heterodera schachtii increases pme activity in plants through directly interacting with atpme3; other than this exception, no other positive regulator of pmes has been described  <cit> . our results suggest that duf <dig> proteins, a spermatophyte-specific family, contribute to the complexity of the methylesterification process by participating in the fine regulation of pectin status during plant development.
