BACKGROUND
general anesthetics have been shown to depress neuronal responses in virtually all brain areas studied and this depression has been proposed to result from actions at gabaa-mediated inhibitory synapses and postsynaptic chloride channels  <cit> , potassium channels  <cit> , or calcium channels  <cit> , and/or at glutamate-mediated excitatory synapses  <cit> . the last decade has seen a major shift in our understanding of general anesthetic mechanisms of action, away from a non-specific unitary theory of action, towards a detailed view of anesthetic actions at membrane receptor and ion channel targets for these agents  <cit> . it is likely that several anesthetic actions occurring at independent sites contribute in additive ways to depress neuronal circuits in higher brain structures. alternatively, anesthetic effects could result from actions at only a few sites and this should become evident by studying overall effects on the ca <dig> neural circuit and 'chasing down' the underlying actions. in the present study, the effects produced by five general anesthetics were studied at several possible sites of action within the well characterized schaffer-collateral to ca <dig> neuron circuit using electrophysiological recordings from rat hippocampal slices. the ca <dig> circuit has previously been shown to be depressed by anesthetics from several chemical classes  <cit>  at concentrations which alter hippocampal electrical activity in chronically instrumented rats during anesthesia  <cit> . the five agents chosen for this study are all clinically used anesthetics and provide a good representation from unique chemical classes: a halocarbon , halogenated ether , barbiturate , sulfonated-barbiturate , and a newer di-isopropylphenol compound, propofol.

RESULTS
anesthetics enhance gaba-mediated inhibition
all five anesthetics depressed synaptically evoked discharge, measured as a block of population spike  responses recorded from ca <dig> neurons . the two volatile anesthetics, halothane and isoflurane, produced a nearly complete depression  at clinically effective concentrations: halothane  and isoflurane . the three intravenous agents, pentobarbital , thiopental  and propofol , also depressed ps responses to a comparable degree:  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of control responses, respectively . all anesthetic effects were reversible on washout of the agent with drug free acsf. it should be noted that the more lipophilic intravenous anesthetics produce lower effect site concentrations in these brain slices than the applied concentrations shown, especially for these short time periods of application, because it can take several hours for these agents to diffuse  <dig> to  <dig> μm into brain slices and achieve steady-state levels  <cit> . for example, an applied concentration of  <dig> μm propofol would be expected to produce only ~  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm at a recording depth of  <dig> microns within  <dig> minutes  <cit> . the volatile anesthetics, in contrast, rapidly equilibrate throughout the brain slice due to their relatively high aqueous solubility.

these equi-effective applied concentrations for ps depression were used in subsequent experiments to determine whether this depression resulted from enhanced gabaa-mediated inhibition.

a gabaa receptor antagonist, bicuculline, was applied in the continued presence of each anesthetic to attempt to reverse the anesthetic-induced ps depression. bicuculline  reversed anesthetic-induced ps depression to varying degrees for each agent: isoflurane –  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, halothane –  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, pentobarbital –  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, thiopental –  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and propofol –  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. similar degrees of reversal were observed using the gaba-chloride channel blocker, picrotoxin . a gabab receptor antagonist, cgp 55845a  did not reverse ps depression for any of the anesthetics studied . none of the anesthetics produced a significant depression of antidromically stimulated ps responses  indicating that ca <dig> neuron axonal conduction was not appreciably altered. thus, enhanced gabaa-mediated inhibition appeared to play a major role for the ps depression produced by propofol and thiopental , less so for pentobarbital , and contributed only partially to the depressant effects of the volatile anesthetics .

anesthetics depress glutamate-mediated excitatory synapses
to determine whether anesthetic-induced ps depression resulted from depressed glutamate-mediated excitatory synaptic inputs to ca <dig> neurons, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials  were recorded from dendritic regions in stratum radiatum. all five anesthetics depressed epsp responses : isoflurane to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , halothane  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , pentobarbital  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , thiopental  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and propofol  <dig>  ±  <dig>   % of control responses. bicuculline did not reverse volatile anesthetic-induced epsp depression, but did partially reverse the effect for pentobarbital  and completely reversed the epsp depression produced by thiopental and propofol . thus, depressed glutamate-mediated synaptic excitation appeared to play an important role for ps depression produced by isoflurane, halothane and pentobarbital. the thiopental and propofol-induced epsp depression would also contribute to ps depression for these agents, but appeared to occur via enhanced gaba-mediated inhibition at a dendritic level, since this depression was reversed by bicuculline.

pre- and postsynaptic sites of action at gabaa synapses
whole cell voltage clamp recordings from ca <dig> neurons were used to examine more closely anesthetic effects on membrane currents at gaba synapses. spontaneous gaba-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents  were observed in all ca <dig> neurons studied  and were completely blocked by bicuculline . in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists  the anesthetics produced agent-specific effects on holding currents needed to clamp neurons at the control resting membrane potentials . propofol was most effective at increasing holding currents , followed by thiopental  and pentobarbital . halothane  and isoflurane  produced weaker and more variable responses . the changes in holding currents produced by propofol and the barbiturates were reversed by bicuculline  or picrotoxin , indicating that they involved activation of gabaa-mediated chloride channels.

the most dramatic effect produced by all five anesthetics was observed on ipscs . membrane charge transfer, for example, was increased by  <dig> to  <dig> fold in the presence of halothane and came about by at least two separate mechanisms. the first mechanism was a prolongation of ipsc time course  resulting in nearly a  <dig> fold increase in charge transfer for each ipsc . this result was in good agreement with previous findings showing that anesthetics prolong ipscs by increasing the open time of gaba-gated channels in the postsynaptic membrane  <cit> . the second mechanism appeared to involve presynaptic sites, observed as an increase in frequency of ipscs  and occurred with a small, but significant, depression in ipsc amplitudes . the anesthetic-induced ipsc frequency increase was also observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin, used to block action potentials , indicating a direct action on gaba nerve terminals. this confirms earlier findings that anesthetics can increase ipsc frequency and the release of gaba from nerve terminals  <cit> . this presynaptic effect combines with postsynaptic prolongation of ipscs to account for the marked increase in membrane charge transfer observed, and would contribute to the anesthetic-induced postsynaptic hyperpolarization of ca <dig> neurons previously reported  <cit> . all of the anesthetics studied increased inhibitory charge transfer and the degree of enhancement corresponded well with the ability of bicuculline to reverse the anesthetic-induced depression of population spike responses . for halothane and isoflurane, this enhanced inhibitory charge transfer played a relatively minor role in population spike depression compared with their ability to depress glutamate-mediated excitatory inputs to the ca <dig> neurons.

anesthetics increase paired-pulse facilitation
to determine whether presynaptic actions also contribute to anesthetic effects at glutamate synapses, paired pulse  facilitation of schaffer-collateral evoked epsps were studied. in the presence of either halothane or isoflurane no apparent change in epsp rise time or decay kinetics were observed , contrasting with the marked prolongation of ipsc decay time produced by the anesthetics. facilitation was increased to nearly  <dig> % of control and this effect was independent of gabaa-mediated actions, since they persisted in the presence of the antagonist – bicuculline . this increase in facilitation is consistent with a presynaptic depression of glutamate release from nerve terminals, perhaps via depressant actions on voltage activated calcium or sodium channels which couple axon spike depolarization to the release of transmitter  <cit> .

anesthetics increase paired-pulse inhibition
agent-specific effects were observed for paired pulse inhibitory responses  recorded from ca <dig> neurons . halothane and isoflurane produced no apparent change in paired pulse responses, both the first and second population spike following a pair of stimuli were depressed to a similar degree by these anesthetics. in contrast, propofol, thiopental and pentobarbital increased paired pulse inhibition, evident in a greater degree of depression for the second of a pair of responses. to quantify these increases in paired pulse inhibition, effects on second pulse responses were compared at concentrations that produced a half maximal depression of first spike responses. at a level of  <dig> % depression of first pulse responses, pentobarbital produced a  <dig> ±  <dig> % increase in second pulse inhibition, thiopental produced a  <dig> ±  <dig> % increase and propofol produced a  <dig> ± 13% increase . this effect is consistent with in vivo findings  <cit>  and is thought to reflect a greater degree of gaba-mediated inhibition contributing to the second of a pair of stimuli, via recurrent  activation of inhibitory interneurons caused by the first pulse  <cit> .

anesthetics depress ca <dig> neuron excitability
to determine whether the anesthetics could alter postsynaptic membrane excitability, effects on action potentials evoked by direct current injection into ca <dig> neurons were studied. differences in effect were apparent across anesthetic agents – hardly any effect was evident for halothane and isoflurane, but the barbiturates and propofol produced a significant depression of action potential discharge . when measured as a reduction in the number of action potentials produced in response to a one second long depolarizing current step, halothane produced an  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % depression and isoflurane an  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % depression . propofol was much more effective at depressing ca <dig> discharge, producing a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % depression . thiopental produced a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % depression and pentobarbital a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % depression . the anesthetic-induced depression of spike discharge activity was accompanied by decreases in membrane resistance and to a lesser extent by small changes in membrane resting potential. in spite of the marked depressant effects observed for the intravenous anesthetics on spike discharge, none of the anesthetics appeared to alter action potential amplitude, rise time or decay profiles , suggesting that the major depressant effect was accounted for by actions on spike threshold – not on the sodium currents which underlie action potentials per se.

CONCLUSIONS
two conclusions can be drawn from these results: 1) for a given anesthetic, like halothane, multiple sites of action contributed in an additive manner to produce an overall depression of transmission through the ca <dig> neuronal circuitry ; 2) for each anesthetic the degree of effect was agent specific at some of these sites. together the results support a multisite agent specific  mechanism of action for general anesthetics. this represents a departure from traditional unitary theories of action in several important respects. unitary theories posit that all anesthetics act via a common molecular mechanism, such as to change the fluidity of nerve cell membranes, or to enhance a potassium current, or most recently to enhance gaba-mediated inhibition  <cit> . with the mas theory, no common site of action is required  for anesthetics. this is consistent with observations at the molecular,  <cit>  cellular  <cit>  and behavioral levels  <cit> .

differing degrees of action  were evident at both glutamate and gaba synapses for each anesthetic. for example, our results demonstrate that the two barbiturates studied appear to have differing degrees of effect at gaba synapses since thiopental's depressant effects were reversed ~  <dig> % by a gaba antagonist, but pentobarbital's effects were only reversed by ~  <dig> %. similarly, these two barbiturates exhibited differing degrees of depression for glutamate-mediated excitatory inputs to the ca <dig> neurons, pentobarbital produced a  <dig> % depression in contrast to thiopental with only a  <dig> % depression. it was interesting that opposite actions were seen at presynaptic sites  and at postsynaptic sites . the mas theory can readily account for the unique agent-specific profiles of effects observed in various experimental models, and also seen clinically – a long standing weakness of unitary theories  <cit> . finally, the mas theory predicts that agents which selectively target gaba and glutamate synapses could lead to the design of safer and more effective therapeutic agents for anesthesia, that exhibit fewer undesirable side effects.

glutamate and gaba synapses in the hippocampus are among the best characterized synapses in the brain and appear to utilize receptor subtypes which are similar to those in neocortex, thalamus and other higher brain regions. thus, the effects described in the present study would be expected to occur in these other brain regions as well, but it should be noted that different gaba and glutamate receptor subtype distributions are known to occur in cerebellum, spinal and some brain stem nuclei, and it remains to be determined whether anesthetics alter these synapses in a similar manner to their hippocampal counterparts. ted eger's group at ucsf has recently found that enhanced gaba-mediated synaptic transmission at the spinal level plays an important role for propofol-induced immobility in response to a noxious stimulus  <cit> , but this was not the case for isoflurane-induced immobility  <cit> . this agrees well with our findings that the volatile anesthetic-induced depression of synaptic signaling involves mechanisms other than enhanced gaba inhibition , while the depression produced by the barbiturates and propofol are more dependent on enhanced gaba-mediated inhibition. additional in vivo support comes from studies utilizing a gaba beta  <dig> receptor mutant mouse model – proprofol-induced anesthesia was blocked in these mice, while volatile anesthetic effects were not  <cit> . taken together with these in vivo findings, our results indicate that effects on gaba synapses play a role in anesthetic actions, especially for propofol, thiopental and pentobarbital; but the results also indicate that effects on glutamate synapses and postsynaptic membrane excitability contribute to the cns depression produced by all anesthetics. given the multiple effects observed for anesthetic actions on the two types of synapses studied here, it is likely that effects on other neurotransmitter systems also contribute to anesthetic-induced depression of the cns.
