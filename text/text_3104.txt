BACKGROUND
non-coding rnas  are sequence-specific regulators of gene expression, mediating a plethora of cellular responses to changing environmental conditions and morphological differentiation. in bacteria, ncrnas are a heterogeneous group of functional rna molecules normally  lacking a protein-coding function. they are frequently smaller than  <dig> nt in size, and act to regulate mrna translation/decay but can also bind to proteins and thereby modify protein function . in many cases, these ncrnas function through sequence-specific base pairing; hence they frequently have a  base complementarity to their target rna molecules. the vast majority of known ncrnas is encoded at genomic locations far away from the target genes . however, a small number of ncrnas is transcribed from the reverse complementary strand of the respective target and hence these are fully or partially overlapping with their target rnas. this latter class of ncrnas is called cis-encoded or antisense rnas.

as a result of recent systematic searches, more than  <dig> ncrnas are now known in e. coli, most of which had been overlooked by traditional genome analysis. many, or possibly most major stress responses in e. coli include at least one small regulatory rna as part of the regulon  <cit> . systematic biochemical, genetic, genomic or computational searches for ncrnas are still lacking for most eubacterial phyla outside the enterobacteria. in general, genes encoding ncrnas are not annotated during standard genome analysis procedures. the efforts to accomplish their identification in bacteria can broadly be divided into  sequencing the population of srnas  as comprehensively as possible  or  prediction by bioinformatics tools  followed by experimental verification .

there is currently only very scarce information on regulatory rnas and their genes in cyanobacteria. in addition to the more common types of ncrna , less than  <dig> different ncrnas and only three antisense rnas have been described for this whole group of bacteria so far  <cit> . among the known ncrnas are yfr1- <dig> . the existence of these ncrnas was predicted for one , two , three  or four  strains of the prochlorococcus/synechococcus lineage in a comparative genomics-based approach and their actual presence was demonstrated under various growth and stress conditions that they encounter in the natural environment  <cit> . however, functions and phylogenetic distribution of these ncrnas have remained unknown. there are  <dig> genome sequences from the prochlorococcus/synechococcus clade in the public domain now, providing an excellent data set for comparative genomics-based computational prediction of ncrnas. however, for more distantly related cyanobacteria there are only few such data sets available, rendering the direct identification of ncrnas through comparative genomics difficult. an exception is ncrna yfr <dig>  due to its exceptionally highly conserved sequence and based on an extended structural model, this rna was identified as the cyanobacterial homolog of a ubiquitous eubacterial riboregulator, the rna polymerase – interacting 6s rna  <cit> . molecular details of its expression in synchronized cell cultures of prochlorococcus med <dig> are given in more detail separately  <cit> . the rnas yfr <dig> through yfr <dig> in prochlorococcus med <dig> constitute a family of closely related ncrnas with a length of 89– <dig> nt  <cit> . gene copy numbers of yfr2- <dig> homologues in other prochlorococcus and synechococcus genomes seem to differ widely and there is only very little synteny among them. therefore, here we selected yfr <dig>  with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in prochlorococcus med <dig>  mit  <dig> and synechococcus wh  <dig> the smallest ncrna detected in cyanobacteria so far  <cit> , to address the question if it is possible to find more orthologs of a short bacterial ncrna in an alternative computational-experimental approach. this approach is likely to be successful also in other cases in which comparative data suggest a highly conserved ncrna secondary structure that can be taken as a starting point.

RESULTS
yfr <dig> in marine unicellular cyanobacteria
cyanobacteria are phototrophic bacteria which perform oxygenic photosynthesis and populate widely diverse environments such as freshwater, the oceans, rock surfaces, desert soil or the polar regions. therefore, various types of regulatory rna can be expected that interplay with the different signal transduction pathways and stress responses. antisense rnas found within the gas vesicle operon in calothrix pcc  <dig>  <cit> , or covering the ferric uptake regulator gene fura in anabaena pcc  <dig> over its full length  <cit> , or regulating the light-absorbing protein isia under conditions of iron limitation and redox stress in the unicellular synechocystis pcc  <dig>  <cit>  are three known examples for such rnas in cyanobacteria. based on comparative computational analysis, we predicted a whole set of putative trans-acting ncrnas with unknown function, which we called yfr1-yfr <dig>  <cit> .

we have previously shown the existence of yfr <dig> in three out of four tested marine cyanobacteria belonging to the genera prochlorococcus and synechococcus  <cit> . unicellular marine cyanobacteria of these genera provide an excellent dataset for computational predictions that require comparative genome information since currently  <dig> different genome sequences from very closely related isolates are available. thus, there is an extensive dataset to take compensatory base mutations into account for the prediction of novel ncrna candidates. in these genomes, orthologs of yfr <dig> can be found even by simple blast searches .

prediction of yfr <dig> homologs in different classes of cyanobacteria based on an rna motif
despite some recent progress  <cit> , marine unicellular cyanobacteria are not trivial in functional studies requiring genetic manipulation. therefore, finding possible orthologs of yfr <dig> in one of the cyanobacterial model species amenable for genetic manipulation would be desirable. the direct identification of such an ncrna is not intuitively possible based on sequence similarity alone. in table  <dig>  blastn hits are given for three such model strains, synechocystis pcc  <dig>  synechococcus pcc 7942/ <dig>  anabaena pcc  <dig> and the marine synechococcus wh  <dig>  using the yfr <dig> full length sequence of prochlorococcus med <dig>  as a query, only for synechocystis pcc  <dig> a hit to the correct sequence was found, ranking only at the third position. similar results were obtained when the yfr <dig> full length sequence of synechococcus wh  <dig> was taken, except that the ortholog in the very closely related synechococcus wh  <dig> was found with clear statistical support .

the three top hits  obtained by blastn are given for each genome.

thus, sequence homology alone is not sufficient and we reasoned to complement it by comparative structure information. taking up this idea, the initial set of the three previously identified yfr <dig> sequences from prochlorococcus med <dig>  mit <dig> and synechococcus wh <dig> plus the novel putative orthologs from the marine synechococcus/prochlorococcus were subjected to a comparative sequence/structure analysis. as a result we derived an initial sequence/structure-model  consisting of two stem loops and a central unpaired section of 18– <dig> nt. interestingly, both loop sequences appeared unconserved and therefore these were set to any nucleotide in our subsequent searches. in contrast, we noted the presence of an eleven nt highly conserved sequence stretch within the unpaired central section. we reasoned if this sequence element would be essential and tried different rna motif descriptors in which the undecanucleotide had to be fully conserved or allowed one or two mismatches. furthermore, we relaxed the required length of the central unpaired section to a range of 12– <dig> nt and the lengths of both terminal helices to 5– <dig> base pairs and permitted a single bulge or mismatch in the 5' helix as observed in the data in fig.  <dig>  this model was used to search for orthologs within genomes of other cyanobacteria and also other eubacteria. candidates found by this method were incorporated into the model and, finally, this procedure led to the identification of putative yfr <dig> orthologs in  <dig>  out of  <dig> available cyanobacterial genomes. all here identified yfr <dig> candidates are summarized in a multiple sequence/structure alignment shown in fig.  <dig>  an outstanding property appearing in this alignment is the perfectly conserved  <dig> nt long sequence motif  within the unpaired region. the reason for this perfect conservation might be that this short sequence is targeting a conserved sequence element in one or several other rnas, mrnas or ncrnas, through base-pairing interactions as it is known for many ncrnas. alternatively, it could also be a protein binding motif. the rather high concentration of yfr <dig> in the different organisms is rather untypical for an ncrna acting through base-pairing.

from this set of orthologs, a comprehensive sequence/structure-model for yfr <dig> was derived . the 5'-end forms a 6– <dig> bp stem-loop, which may be interrupted by one bulge or internal loop. at the 3'-end the sequences show a 6– <dig> bp gc-rich hairpin, followed by a u-tail. these features make this element very likely to be a rho-independent terminator. furthermore, together with the 5'-terminal helix the 3'-helix may ensure the unpaired state of the conserved sequence motif and/or protect the rna against degradation. one would expect approximately  <dig>  instances of a specific  <dig> nt motif in a  <dig> mb genome and equal base distribution of  <dig> . the here identified ultraconserved 5'-acuccucacac-3' occurs more often then by chance in the investigated genomes . therefore, this motif alone is not sufficient to find homologs of yfr <dig>  however, it is interesting to note that the two additional occurrences in prochlorococcus med <dig> both are located in intergenic spacer regions, close to two other ncrnas: 160– <dig> nt upstream the mapped 5' end of yfr <dig> and 128– <dig> nt upstream of yfr <dig>  <cit> . the only two cyanobacterial genomes for which no yfr <dig> ortholog was found were prochlorococcus sp. ss <dig> and mit <dig>  these latter two examples were chosen to test when the rna motif prediction would find likely false positives. when the score was reduced to  <dig>  still no candidate yfr <dig> homologs were found in these two genomes. only when in addition one or two mismatches were allowed in the central consensus element, candidates were found . however, these candidate sequences could not be aligned to each other or to the other yfr <dig> sequences. in case of prochlorococcus sp. ss <dig> also a previous experimental screen had remained negative  <cit> . therefore, the candidates found under these very relaxed conditions  do not appear realistic. thus, the here desribed search method allows for an  excellent discrimination between true positives and false  positives. this finding is in agreement with studies in which rna motif prediction was integrated into computational pipelines for the high-throughput prediction of cis-regulatory rna sequences  <cit> .

conservation of genomic location and flanking genes can also be a powerful tool for finding related ncrnas. indeed, the yfr <dig> gene is at a conserved position in the majority of the here investigated genomes. in  <dig> out of  <dig> genomes, it is found upstream a guab gene, coding for inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase . even more obvious is the frequent association with a downstream located trxa gene .

we extended the search also to non-cyanobacterial photosynthetic bacteria, such as the alpha-proteobacteria erythrobacter litoralis, rhodobacter sphaeroides, silicibacter sp. tm <dig>  the chlorobiaceae chlorobium tepidum, chlorobium chlorochromatii and cytophaga hutchinsonii, as well as one spirochaete  and, finally, escherichia coli, but did not identify a reasonable ortholog of yfr <dig> within these. so far, the occurrence of yfr <dig> seems to be restricted to cyanobacteria. since cyanobacteria represent a separate eubacterial phylum for at least  <dig>  billion years of evolution it is very likely that yfr <dig> originated very early in the progenitors of this group and must have co-evolved with its  target for a very long time.

experimental verification of yfr <dig> in phylogenetically different groups of cyanobacteria
according to morphologic criteria, cyanobacteria can be organized into five different sections  <cit> . these sections are only partially congruent with molecular phylogenetic data, therefore we chose six cyanobacterial species which clearly are very different from each other, judged by their morphology, 16s rrna sequence and life style, to test our result by northern hybridization. we also included rna from microcystis pcc <dig> for which no genome sequence was available and, hence, no candidate predicted. the results are given in fig.  <dig> and clearly show that yfr <dig> is present in all tested species. together with the three previous identified ones  <cit>  our experiment raises the number of validated yfr <dig> homologs to ten. in our previous study we did not identify an yfr <dig> homolog in prochlorococcus ss <dig>  this is substantiated by the result of this study as we also do not predict one here. summarizing, we found reasonable orthologs of yfr <dig> in  <dig> out of  <dig> cyanobacterial strains and, furthermore, their existence could be validated for ten out of ten in this and a previous study.

superimposing our results with a phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna yields the tree shown in fig.  <dig>  the widespread existence of yfr <dig> over large evolutionary distances points to an important function of yfr <dig> throughout the cyanobacterial domain. interestingly, prochlorococcus ss <dig> and mit <dig>  neither of which is predicted to hold an yfr <dig> homolog, appear in one separate cluster. this lets us conclude, that these two or a common ancestor of them lost yfr <dig> secondarily. this may be related to their special habitat. different prochlorococcus isolates can broadly become subdivided in an ecotype adapted to low light and another one adapted to high light. these ecotypes are genetically and physiologically distinct  <cit>  and show a distinct distribution under natural conditions  <cit> . prochlorococcus ss <dig> and mit <dig> have both been isolated from greater depths in the water column and are adapted to very low light conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
starting with a known ncrna from one lineage we show here the highly specific and sensitive identification of its homologs within all lineages of cyanobacteria. the integration of rna motif prediction into computational pipelines for the detection of ncrnas in bacteria appears as a promising step to improve the quality of such predictions. the only cyanobacteria that appear to lack yfr <dig> are  prochlorococcus ss <dig> and mit <dig>  which both are adapted  to live at very low light intensities and must have lost  yfr <dig> secondarily. therefore, one essential function of yfr <dig> might have to do with the ability to cope with high photosynthetic energy fluxes or redox conditions.
