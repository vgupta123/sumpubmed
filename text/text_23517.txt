BACKGROUND
t lymphocytes develop within the thymus, undergoing distinct differentiation events based on phenotype, while following spatial-temporal cues. the most immature human thymocytes are triple negative for cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  but express cd <dig>  cd <dig> is one of the earliest markers to be expressed during human t cell ontogeny, followed by the upregulation of cd1a, which marks t cell commitment. following this stage, human thymocytes progress to a cd <dig> immature single positive  stage, at which point cd <dig> is expressed in the absence of cd <dig>  thereafter, a subset of cd4isp cells are thought to complete tcrβ rearrangement leading to β-selection and differentiation to the cd4+ cd8+ double positive  stage. finally, following successful tcrα rearrangement, tcrαβ expressing dp thymocytes undergo positive and negative selection events, which result in the production of cd4+ cd8- and cd4- cd8+ single positive  t cells, which then emigrate to the periphery  <cit> .

cytotoxic cd <dig> sp t cells play a critical role in adaptive immunity by destroying virally infected or malignant cells. cytoablative regimens to treat malignancies or hiv infection results in the destruction of t cells, leading to a period of immunodeficiency and a concomitant increase in opportunistic infections  <cit> . while hematopoietic stem cell  transplants can reconstitute the entire immune system, t cells are the slowest population to recover or may never recover at all  <cit> . the robust differentiation of multiple sources of hscs  <cit>  into t-progenitors using the op9-dl <dig> coculture system suggests that these progenitor cells could be harvested in vitro to rapidly restore the t cell compartment in vivo and thereby reduce the incidence of opportunistic infection and ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes  <cit> . while we have demonstrated that specific populations of t-progenitor cells generated in vitro can reconstitute the thymus of immunodeficient mice and generate cd <dig> single positive  t cells in vivo  <cit> , it was not clear whether functional maturation of mature cd <dig> t cells could take place entirely in vitro starting from umbilical cord blood  hscs in op9-dl <dig> cell cocultures.

mature cd <dig> t cells were recently reported to be generated following coculture of early thymocyte progenitors  on op9-dl <dig> monolayers  <cit> . the absence of a clinically viable source from which to isolate low frequency etps, makes it difficult to envision a therapeutic approach to treat t-immunodeficiency based on harvested postnatal thymocytes . therefore, it is important to determine whether accessible sources of hscs, such as umbilical cord blood, directed to differentiate in vitro can generate functionally mature cd <dig> t cells. two elegant studies have reported the generation of cytotoxic human t cells from hscs genetically modified to express tumor-specific tcrs cocultured with op9-dl <dig> stromal cells  <cit> . whether in vitro-generated cd <dig> t cells derived from unmanipulated hscs could also give rise to mature functional t cells and respond to signals delivered through an endogenously generated tcr remained to be tested. here we demonstrate that long-term coculture of non-transduced human ucb hscs on op9-dl <dig> cells generates αβ-tcr/cd3+ cd8+ sp t cells that exhibit the molecular and cellular signatures corresponding to functionally mature t cells.

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization of human cd <dig> sp t-cells derived from hscs cultured with op9-dl <dig> cells
we have previously reported the ability to generate cd4+ cd8+ t-lineage cells as well as cd <dig> and cd <dig> single positive  cells from human cord blood-derived cd34+ cd38-/low hsc/op9-dl <dig> cocultures  <cit> , however the maturational, molecular and functional status of these cd <dig> sp t-cells were not assessed.

to address this, we analyzed long-term cocultures that were allowed to differentiate for an extended period of time. figure  <dig> shows the presence of both dp and sp subsets from a day  <dig> coculture. examination of multiple cocultures demonstrated the generation of cd <dig> sp t cells ) after 60- <dig> days of culture. additionally, table  <dig> displays an analysis for the number of cd <dig> t cells obtained from individual op9-dl <dig> cultures initiated with different numbers of hscs, which provides an indication of the expected cd <dig> sp cell yields per input hsc. we further examined the cd <dig> sp subset present in these cultures for the expression of cell surface markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit> , typically expressed on mature t-cells. amongst the sp cd <dig> cells  found in late cocultures, about 50-60%  expressed cd3/αβtcr. of note, the majority  of cd3+ sp8s were found to co-express cd <dig>  in addition, cd27+ cd3+ cd8+ sps were also found to lack cd1a expression, which is indicative of functional maturity  <cit> . this is in contrast to the subset of cd27- cd3+ cd8+ sps that continued to express cd1a, which is characteristic of the preceding stage in t-cell differentiation  <cit>  and consistent with reports showing that the acquisition of functional maturity by cd3+ thymocytes following positive selection is associated with the expression of cd <dig> and down-regulation of cd1a expression  <cit> .

a indicates the number of tcr/cd3+ cd8+ t cells obtained after flow cytometric sort purification from day 60- <dig> cocultures, which were seeded with the indicated number of cd34+ cd38-/low cells.

molecular analysis of in vitro derived human cd <dig> sp t-cells from ucb hscs
to gain further insight into the phenotypically characterized cd <dig> sp t cells derived in vitro, we examined the expression of genes known to influence the differentiation or effector status of cd <dig> t cells by quantitative real-time pcr. we examined the expression of th-pok , eomes, plzf  and gata- <dig> transcript levels in sp <dig> t cells obtained from cd34+ cd38-/low hscs cocultured with op9-dl <dig> cells for approximately 60- <dig> days. cd4+ cd8- cd3+ , cd4- cd8+ cd3+  t cells and cd33+ myeloid cells obtained from the mature lineage-positive fraction of ucb were used as controls. consistent with the role of the zinc finger transcription factor th-pok in cd <dig> lineage-commitment  <cit> , th-pok transcripts were barely detectable in coculture-derived sp <dig> t cells compared to lin+ sp <dig> t cells . also, a low, but detectable, level of th-pok expression was observed in ucb-ex vivo lin+ sp <dig> t cells. in contrast, the t-box transcription factor eomes, which is a critical regulator for cd <dig> t cell differentiation and effector function  <cit> , was highly expressed in coculture-derived sp <dig> t cells at levels that were lower but comparable to that of peripheral sp <dig> t cells obtained from lin+ ucb. interestingly, we also observed a high level of this transcription factor in ucb-derived cd <dig> t cells, which is consistent with a recent report showing the expression of eomes in a subset of naïve peripheral cd <dig> t cells  <cit> . in addition, the nkt cell/innate t cell transcription factor plzf  <cit>  was expressed at low levels in hsc/op9-dl <dig> coculture-derived cd <dig> t cells similar to ucb cd <dig> peripheral t cells. lastly, we observed high levels of gata- <dig> transcripts in coculture-derived sp <dig> t cells, likely owing to the delta-like-induced signaling of notch in these cells.

generation of functional human cd <dig> t cells from hscs cultured with op9-dl <dig> cells
to address the functional status of in vitro-generated sp8s, we sorted the cd3/tcr-expressing subset  and examined whether these cells had the capacity to up/down-regulate downstream differentiation markers, proliferate, express cytolytic effector-function molecules, and secrete γ-interferon  following stimulation with immobilized anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> mabs for  <dig> days. as shown in figure 3b, a blast-like appearance based on forward-light scatter  is seen in stimulated  cells as compared to non-stimulated  cells, which displayed significantly different  fsc mean values when analyzed over multiple experiments . additionally, stimulated cells up-regulated cd45ro, cd <dig> and mhc-class ii expression, and down-regulated cd <dig> expression, as compared to non-stimulated cells . as shown in figure 3d, a similar trend was observed when ucb ex vivo cd <dig> t cells were assayed. however, a more prominent upregulation of cd45ro and cd <dig>  and less prominent downregulation of cd <dig>  was observed. nevertheless, further analysis of cd45ro mfi and the percentage of cd <dig> expression  demonstrated a significant difference between non-stimulated and stimulated in vitro-derived cd <dig> t cells. indeed, this was also observed for ucb-ex vivo cd <dig> t cells .

furthermore, to address the extent of cellular proliferation induced by tcr-stimulation, sorted cd3+ cd8+ t-cells were loaded with cfse and incubated for  <dig> days with or without tcr-stimulation. figure 4a shows that stimulated cells undergo many rounds of cell division as indicated by the loss of cfse  compared to non-stimulated cells and by the increase in cellularity . a similar loss of cfse and increased cellularity was observed in ucb-ex vivo t cells . like ucb-ex vivo cd <dig> t cells, we observed that in vitro-derived proliferating cells also displayed marked up-regulation of cd <dig> expression . the average percentage of cd <dig> on the cell surface of stimulated cells was 78% ± 5%, which was significantly higher than on non-stimulated cells .

to determine whether these tcr-responsive in vitro-derived cd <dig> sp t-lineage cells can be induced to express cytotoxic/effector-function molecules, the expression of granzyme-b and ifnγ were assessed. intracellular granzyme-b expression was detected in approximately 38% of stimulated cd3+cd8+ t-cells, as compared to non-stimulated cells that expressed much lower levels of granzyme-b . as demonstrated in figure 4d, when in vitro-derived cd <dig> t cells were gated on granzyme-b+ cells, these corresponded to cd25+ proliferating cells. finally, supernatants from wells containing in vitro-generated cd <dig> sps were analyzed for the presence of ifnγ following stimulation. as shown in figure 4e, supernatants from cells stimulated with either  <dig> μg/ml or  <dig> μg/ml of anti-cd3/anti-cd <dig> mabs showed a significant increase in the amount of ifnγ, as compared to non-stimulated cells. in a separate set of experiments , in vitro-derived and ucb-ex vivo cd <dig> t cells were directly compared, and showed similar levels of ifnγ production after tcr/cd <dig> stimulation. taken together, these results show that in vitro-derived cd <dig> sp t cells are functionally mature.

lastly, we also noted the appearance of cd3+ cd4+ t-cells , which could be selected by human mhc class ii-expressing cells, which may be a t-lineage cell or a non t-lineage cell such as a dendritic cell. indeed, when late day cultures were analyzed for the presence of mhc class ii expressing cells, mhc-ii+ cd34+ cd7+ progenitor t cells and mhc-ii+ cd7- non-t-lineage cells were detected as shown in figure 5a. figure 5b, demonstrates the generation of cd33+ cd7- myeloid cells, which could provide mhc-ii molecules to developing t cells. interestingly, in contrast to the cd <dig> sps, in vitro-generated cd <dig> sp t cells do not show the hallmarks of being functionally mature t-cells. experiments examining their proliferative ability revealed a lack of responsiveness to cd <dig> stimulation . also confirming these findings was the lack of cd <dig> expression on cd <dig> sp t-lineage cells compared to cd <dig> t cells in the same culture . since this molecule is upregulated upon positive selection and present on mature naive t cells, the cd <dig> sp generated in these cultures may represent transitional cells that require additional differentiation signals that are not readily available in these cultures.

discussion
the hsc/op9-dl <dig> cocultures not only serve to characterize progenitor function or early events in human t-cell development  <cit> , but may also provide a simple method for the generation of functional human t-cells in vitro. this approach may be applicable to cell-based immunotherapies that presently capitalize on t-cell effector-function to induce/enhance anti-tumor eradicating immunity  <cit> . thus far, adoptive cell transfer  for tumor eradication has employed the use of autologous and allogeneic t cells obtained from blood or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, followed by expansion protocols to generate millions of cells, with the efficacy of act depending on the ability to generate large cell numbers of t cells that maintain effector function. one caveat to stromal-based cultures of hscs into cd <dig> t cells is that clinically relevant numbers of cd8+ t cells are not readily obtained  following one round of tcr-stimulation. however, one could attempt to overcome this by promoting expansion of cd <dig> t cells with artificial-apcs and cytokines with several rounds of stimulation  <cit> . additionally, the number of cd <dig> t cells obtained in these cultures is directly related to the number of input hscs; thus, expansion of hscs prior to differentiation into cd8+ t cells would provide another strategy for the large-scale generation of mature t-lineage cells  <cit> . nonetheless, we now provide clear evidence for the maturation of functionally responsive cd <dig> t cells generated from human ucb hscs in coculture with op9-dl <dig> cells.

although some of the gene transcript levels were not identical to ucb-ex vivo cd <dig> t cells, this may be reflect the fact that coculture-derived t cells are more akin to human post-natal thymocytes, rather than t cells found within the periphery. in addition, some differences in cell surface expression may be due to different temporal kinetics of up/downregulation between in vitro-generated versus ucb-ex vivo cd <dig> t cells. recently, van coppernolle et al. reported the development of cd <dig> sp αβt cells and large numbers of γδt cells following op9-dl <dig> coculture from pnt. while γδt cells can be detected in ucb-derived op9-dl <dig> cocultures, we find them at very low frequencies . this suggests that the cd34+ pnt, compared to ucb hscs, have received instructive signals that are notch independent, which appear to affect specific t-lineage outcomes.

the observation that functionally mature cd <dig> sp t-lineage cells are generated from hscs on op9-dl <dig> stroma, raises the question of which cell-type, within the cultures, is mediating the mhc-dependent positive selection of this population. it is unlikely that the op <dig> cells, which express mouse mhc class i, which is not effectively recognized by human cd <dig> molecules  <cit> , would supply the required positive selection signals. rather, a human mhc class i-expressing ucb-derived cell, which may or may not be a t-lineage cell, is likely to be the conveyor of these signals. although van coppernolle et al. describe the generation of mature cd <dig> t cells from postnatal thymocytes cocultured on op9-dl <dig>  and excluded mouse mhc-i as a mode of selection due to its absence on op9-dl <dig> cells, our analysis showed that op9-dl <dig> cells are in fact mhc class i-expressing cells , suggesting that this possibility remains available for supporting cd <dig> positive selection. indeed, the high transcript levels of eomes, while low for plzf, suggest that the in vitro-derived cd <dig> sp cells are likely conventional t-lineage cells and not cells with innate-like function and phenotype, which are typically the product of t-to-t selection  <cit> , such as nkt cells, γδ-t cells and innate cd <dig> t cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our findings demonstrate that hsc/op9-dl <dig> cocultures produce functional cd <dig> sp t-cells, which are cd3+ cd27+ cd1a-, and following tcr-stimulation up-regulate cd <dig>  cd45ro, cd <dig> and mhc class ii, while down-regulating cd <dig> expression. this complex phenotype is unique to activated human t cells  <cit>  and consistent with full effector maturation and effective cytolytic capability  <cit> , as seen with the induced expression of granzyme-b and ifnγ by the in vitro-derived cd <dig> t-cells. the generation of functionally responsive t cells derived in vitro from hscs may broaden the therapeutic avenue for treatment of immunodeficiency and adoptive immunotherapy.
