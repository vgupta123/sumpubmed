BACKGROUND
post translational modifications of proteins are important events that influence protein function, interaction and localization  <cit> , making those key elements in cellular processes and systemic reactions of organisms. the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme a to the α-amino group of an n-terminal amino acid residue is a very common modification that occurs on a large part of the proteome   <cit> ,  <cit> . this modification can be carried out by one of five protein complexes , whereby each consists of a catalytic and a varying number of auxiliary subunits  <cit> . the function of these complexes seems to be highly conserved across species  <cit> . for yeast natb, which will be the target of this study, the complex consists of nat3p  and mdm20p   <cit> . n-acetyltransferase complexes act upon the n-terminus of polypeptide chains at the ribosome during their synthesis  <cit> . they work in conjunction with methionine amino peptidases that can cleave the initial methionine dependent on the penultimate amino acid residue  <cit> ,  <cit> . the substrate recognition of the different n-acetyl transferases is primarily dependent on the n-terminal amino acid sequence of target proteins  <cit> . however, other factors may play a role. for instance, the huntingtin  interacting protein hypk, which associates with nata in human cells, is required for n-acetylation of certain nata targets  <cit> .

the best characterized n-acetyltransferases  are nata, natb and natc. nata acetylates the largest set of proteins, which have had their initial methionine removed and possess predominantly a serine, alanine, threonine, valine or glycine at their n-terminus  <cit> . the substrates of natb and natc still contain the n-terminal methionine whereby the specificity of these n-acetyltransferases is directly dependent on the penultimate amino acid. natb targets proteins that display a glutamic acid, aspartic acid or glutamine in the penultimate position while natc seems to prefer isoleucine, leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine at the penultimate position  <cit> .

in a number of studies protein n-acetylation in yeast has been charted  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> . however, the overall coverage and characterization of the yeast n-acetylated proteome is still far from complete. for instance, for the n-terminal acetyltransferase complex natb, subject of this study, only  <dig> substrates have been experimentally verified so far. mutants deficient for nata, natb or natc are viable but they generally display defects in aspects such as growth, temperature sensitivity and sporulation. further, polevoda et al. showed that the nat3Δ displays temperature sensitivity and reduced growth on glycerol and nacl containing media  <cit> . despite targeting a significantly smaller subset of proteins, the phenotype of a natb  knockout is much more apparent than the phenotype for a nata  deficient strain. in the case of natb deficiency, the effects cover decreased resistance to chemicals, abnormal budding, increased cell size and a decreased growth rate  <cit> . caesar et al.  <cit>  proposed that putative natb targets are preferentially involved in cell cycle progression and maintenance of the nucleus. it has been shown, for instance, that the n-acetylation of the natb target tropomyosin is necessary for its association with actin  <cit> . here the n-acetylation is thought to induce a conformational change that stabilizes coiled-coil structures involved in tropomyosin-actin polymerization. restoring the actin filaments did not suppress the natb phenotype, indicating a complex interplay of multiple natb related effects on different proteins. another study demonstrated that n-acetylation of the cpy inhibitor tfs <dig> is necessary for its inhibitory function  <cit> . most recently, it was suggested that protein n-acetylation can act as a degradation signal recognized by the doa10p ubiquitin ligase  <cit> . this implies that protein n-acetylation can also be involved in protein stability. all this recent work indicates that the complex and diverse role of protein n-terminal acetylation is slowly more and more revealed.

traditionally, n-acetylated proteins were identified by their change in electrophoretic mobility, for instance on  <dig> d gels. new experimental strategies like the diagonal chromatography cofradic approach now allow for the enrichment and quantitative characterization of protein n-acetylation at a much higher through-put  <cit> ,  <cit> . cofradic sorting of n-acetylated peptides enabled the large-scale charting of protein n-acetylation in human cell lines <cit> , drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and even the prokaryotes halobacterium salinarum and natronomonas pharaonis  <cit> . another technique amendable for the targeted analysis of protein n-termini involves the coupling of free n-terminal amine groups to cnbr activated sepharose  <cit>  or dendritic polyglycerol aldehyde polymers  <cit> . this allows the subsequent removal of all "normal" peptides enriching the n-terminally modified peptide subset. recently, we introduced a straightforward methodology, based solely on strong cation exchange  that is able to achieve near baseline separation of n-acetylated  <cit> , phosphorylated and unmodified peptide populations  <cit> ,  <cit> , and applied this technique to characterize for instance the n-acetylated proteome of hek <dig> cells  <cit> .

here, we extend the use of this technology, in conjunction with metabolic 15n stable isotope labeling  <cit> , to experimentally identify natb substrates and to investigate the effects of natb mediated protein n-acetylation on the s. cerevisiae proteome. employing a comprehensive mass spectrometry based strategy that utilizes the complementarity between trypsin and lys-n proteases we map differential protein abundances, protein phosphorylation and n-terminal acetylation in a wt and nat3Δ yeast strain, in an effort to investigate in more depth the role of protein n-terminal acetylation.

methods
cell culturing
saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were purchased from euroscarf . yeast wildtype  and naa <dig>  knockout  strains were cultured on ynb medium , which was supplied with a  <dig> amino acid mix  and glucose . ammoniumsulphate  was used as a nitrogen source. both yeast strains were grown on "regular" and "heavy" medium, containing 15n labeled ammoniumsulphate and 15n labeled amino acid supplements . after growth on selective plates, both strains were cultured in shake flasks to a similar optical density in the exponential growth phase . subsequently cells were harvested, washed twice with water and subjected to lyophilization.

sample preparation
wildtype and mutant lyophilized material  was mixed 1: <dig> based on dry weight. a total of  <dig> mg mixed biomass was resuspended in  <dig> μl of lysis buffer containing 4% sds, 25% glycerol,  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig>  and  <dig> mm dtt. after the addition of glass beads, the solution was kept on ice and subsequently vortexed  <dig> times for  <dig> min to solubilize proteins. the supernatant was then centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> min. solubilized proteins were cast in a polyacrylamide gel matrix without electrophoresis. the gel was cut into small pieces, fixed  and washed extensively with  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate. reduction and alkylation was carried out as previously described for in gel digestion using lys-n and trypsin <cit> ,  <cit> . after overnight digestion, peptides were extracted from the gel by the addition of 100% acetonitrile, which was removed from the sample by vacuum evaporation prior to strong cation exchange chromatography of peptides.

strong cation exchange
approximately  <dig>  mg of peptide material was loaded onto  <dig> c <dig> opti-lynx cartridges, using an agilent  <dig> hplc system, at a flow rate of  <dig> μl/min in  <dig> % fa. elution from the trapping cartridges was achieved using 80% acetonitrile/ <dig> % fa and loaded onto a polysulfoethyl a column  <dig> ×  <dig>  mm  for  <dig> minutes at the same flow rate. the different peptide populations were separated using a non-linear  <dig> minute gradient at  <dig> μl/minute of solvent a  and solvent b . from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes isocratic flow of 100% solvent a was performed, from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes a linear gradient up to 26% solvent b, from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes a linear gradient to 35% solvent b from  <dig> to  <dig> minutes a linear gradient to 60% solvent reaching 100% solvent b at  <dig> minutes. the column was then washed for  <dig> minutes with 100% solvent b and finally equilibrated with 100% solvent a for  <dig> minutes. fractions were collected at one minute intervals for  <dig> minutes, dried and re-suspended in  <dig> μl 10% formic acid.  <dig> μl of each fraction  were used for further analysis.

mass spectrometry
the lc-ms/ms analysis was performed using a nano lc-ltq-orbitrap  and an agilent  <dig> series lc system equipped with a  <dig> mm aqua c <dig> trapping column  and a  <dig> mm reprosil-pur c18-aq analytical column . trapping was performed at  <dig> μl/min for  <dig> min in solvent a , and elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 10-35% b  for  <dig> minutes with a total analysis time of  <dig> minutes. the flow rate was passively split to  <dig> nl/min during the gradient analysis. nanospray was achieved using a distally coated fused silica emitter   biased to  <dig>  kv. a 33mΩ resistor was introduced between the high voltage supply and the electrospray needle to reduce the ion current. the ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching between ms and ms/ms. full scan ms spectra  were acquired with a resolution of  <dig>  at  <dig> m/z and accumulation to a target value of  <dig> . the five most intense peaks above a threshold of  <dig> were selected for collision induced dissociation in the linear ion trap at normalized collision energy of  <dig> after accumulation to a target value of  <dig> .

data processing
as described in reference  <dig>  all ms and ms/ms spectra were searched using the mascot search engine  against the yeast sgd database  containing  <dig> entries. 15n metabolic labeling was selected as quantitation mode in mascot. trypsin and lys-n were chosen appropriately as proteolytic enzyme allowing one missed cleavage. n-terminal acetylation was chosen as a variable modification. additionally, the data was searched using semi-trypsin or semi-lys-n as enzyme and n-terminal acetylation as variable modification. calculation of false-discovery-rates  was performed according to  <cit> . for phosphopeptide identification, the data was searched using trypsin and lys-n as enzyme and phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine residues was chosen as variable modifications. a ptm score was assigned for each phosphopeptide above with msquant version  <dig> a <dig>  <cit> . relative quantification of 14n and 15n peptide ms <dig> intensities was performed using msquant version  <dig> a <dig>  ratios were subsequently 2log transformed and averaged between the two experiments. only regular and n-acetylated peptides showing a mascot ion score above  <dig> were kept in the datasets to ensure a fdr below 1%. for phosphopeptides a minimum mascot score of  <dig> was chosen. to evaluate reproducibility, a 95% confidence interval was calculated for peptides quantified in both biological replicates  <cit> . network analysis was performed using string v <dig>  on high stringency setting  <cit>  and the extraction of main protein interaction clusters was performed using mcode v <dig>   <cit>  and cytoscape v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . prediction of kinases was performed using networkin v <dig>   <cit>  and protein localization information was retrieved from the sgd database. amino acid frequency analysis of n-terminal peptide sequences were calculated using weblogo http://weblogo.berkeley.edu. corrected p-values for overrepresented predicted kinases were calculated using the pearson's chi-square test.

n-terminal amino acid conservation
to determine the level of site conservation of the natb substrate recognition motifs, md, me and mn, the orthologous sequences of  <dig> natb substrates were retrieved from eggnog v <dig>   <cit> . only eukaryotic species  were included for analysis. per species it was counted which percentage of the total sequences started with md, me or mn to obtain the level of natb substrate conservation. additionally this was also determined for every natb substrate across species to determine if certain proteins are more evolutionary conserved. the top five proteins that showed the highest conservation were separately analyzed as above to determine if these proteins show higher cross-species conservation.

RESULTS
yeast n-acetylome and primary nat3Δ effect
to investigate the primary and secondary effects of the loss of natb mediated protein n-acetylation, we conducted a systemic quantitative proteome analysis using differential 15n labeling of wt and nat3Δ strains. trypsin and lys-n digestions were performed to increase proteome coverage and a refined strong cation exchange chromatographic separation was employed to separate and enrich n-acetylated, phosphorylated and unmodified peptides. cumulatively, we identified  <dig> unique peptides . these corresponded to  <dig> proteins and  <dig> unique n-acetylated protein n-termini . up to now  <dig> protein n-termini have been reported to be fully or partially acetylated in yeast . in our data we could confirm  <dig> of these termini and additionally, we expanded the known n-acetylated yeast proteome by additional  <dig> n-termini providing the most comprehensive catalogue of yeast protein n-terminal acetylations to date.

using 14n/15n peptide ion intensities from wt and nat3Δ we obtained quantitative information on  <dig> unmodified proteins ,  <dig> acetylated protein n-termini and  <dig> phosphorylated sites  . quantification data from the biological replicates showed very consistent and reproducible results since only a low number of outliers  were observed outside a 95% confidence interval. 15n/14n ratios revealed that n-acetylated peptides with a natb specific n-terminal sequence  showed drastic down-regulation in the nat3Δ strain, verified in the biological replicate . in total,  <dig> n-terminal peptides corresponding to  <dig> unique proteins  were detected with very significant decreased levels in the nat3Δ strain  . they all possessed the natb specific n-terminal sequence. since only  <dig> natb substrates had been reported up to date, this is quite an expansion of experimentally verified natb substrates. of these  <dig> we could find  <dig> back in our study . strikingly, at the protein expression level, the detected natb substrates were for the most part unchanged in the nat3Δ  suggesting that the expression and/or degradation of these proteins is not significantly affected by n-acetylation. this indicates that natb mediated n-acetylation does not act as a general degradon signal as suggested by hwang et al.  <cit> . an initial network and clustering analysis of these  <dig> natb substrates indicated that they can be found indiscriminately in different cellular localizations, e.g. the nucleus , the endoplasmatic reticulum/golgi  and the cytoplasm .

table listing identified n-acetylated peptides displaying the natb consensus sequence at the n-terminus . their 15n/14n ratios  were averaged across biological replicates and show significant down-regulation in the nat3Δ strain compared to the wt.

notably, our targeted analysis also revealed extensive n-acetylation of peptide n-termini, not originating from the predicted ultimate or penultimate gene-starting position , as earlier reported to occur also in human cells  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit> . figure  <dig> displays "internally" n-acetylated peptides of pma1p, a proton pump located in the plasma membrane and of ura2p a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the first two steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis. the ms/ms cid spectra of these peptides, which appear in the acetylated and non n-acetylated form, show a similar fragmentation behavior. furthermore the  <dig> da mass shift of the entire b-ion series clearly indicates the location of the acetyl group at the peptide n-terminus. utilizing semi-tryptic and semi-lys-n database search strategies, we identified  <dig> of such peptides with a minimum mascot score of  <dig> . such data provides information to improve protein annotations in databases and offers the ability to study protein processing events on a systemic level. further analysis of our data intriguingly indicates that n-acetylation can also occur as a genuine post-translational modification instead of co-translational.

amino acid frequency analysis of the acetylated residues of these over  <dig> "internal" acetylated n-termini showed that there was no clear consensus sequence, in sharp contrast to proteins that are acetylated at position  <dig> or  <dig>  i.e. specifically by the n-acetyltransferase complexes nata or natb . this might infer the presence of an alternative and more promiscuous n-acetylation mechanism. strikingly, several proteins such as cdc19p, fba1p, ura2p, and pgk1p contain several of these "internal" n-acetylated termini. for instance, for ura2p we detected  <dig> n-acetylated internal residues apparently at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, for some of these proteins the same internal termini could be detected in their non-acetylated form . these findings point to that some of these protein variants seem to be partially acetylated on n-terminal residues like asparagine, proline, leucine, aspartic acid, or isoleucine , all not the usual targets of the common n-acetyl transferases. network analysis of these internally cleaved and modified protein variants revealed three main clusters with a prominent representation of the proteasome, the chaperone network of the hsp <dig> family and energy metabolism . obviously, many of these proteins are also highly abundant, which may also play a role in the explicit observation of the internally cleaved, and n-acetylated, forms of these proteins. interestingly, for  <dig> of those protein variants we also could detect the regular acetylated n-terminus at position  <dig> or  <dig>  examples for this are rpn2p, which is part of the proteasome and ssa3p, ssb1p and sti1p, which belong to the hsp <dig> chaperone family. it remains to be seen whether this category of internally cleaved and n-acetylated protein variants are generated co-translationally or are cleavage products of proteases, but their appearance cannot be discarded. of these peptides  <dig> do either start or are preceded by a methionine, which would indicate an alternative translation start site . it should be noted that the isotopic ratios of most of these internal termini between wt and nat3Δ did not change. four n-acetylated internal peptides from the proteins vma22p, sti1p, fum1p and srn2p, however, displayed down-regulation in the nat3Δ. interestingly, those peptides show the n-terminal natb target sequence  indicating that the corresponding genes have most likely alternative translation start codons as indicated by the n-terminal methionine of these peptides. thus, such genes apparently produce protein variants that are co-translationally modified by the natb complex.

next, we shifted our attention to the impact of nat3Δ on general protein and protein phosphorylation levels. protein levels  showed a quite narrow centered distribution with only  <dig> %  of quantified proteins displaying a more than 3-fold increase in abundance while only  <dig> %  showed down-regulation . in sharp contrast, protein phosphorylation levels were clearly and significantly increased in the nat3Δ strain. 23%  of all quantified phosphorylated peptides displayed a more than 3-fold up-regulation , whereas only  <dig> %  displayed decreased levels. notably, this increased phosphorylation was clearly evident in both biological replicates, including the isotope label swap.

effect of nat3Δ on protein levels
the phenotype of the nat3Δ strain is quite complex and the consequences on growth rate suggest that changes in overall protein levels could be expected. to investigate nat3Δ downstream effects on the cell we were able to quantify  <dig> proteins  and subjected proteins displaying a more that 3-fold change  to a network and cluster analysis. in contrast to proteins with decreased abundance levels, proteins with increased levels showed interesting associations and localization. amongst the higher expressed proteins in the nat3Δ strain we detected a cluster of nuclear proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis . interestingly, even though the biogenesis of the ribosome seems to be affected, ribosomal proteins themselves did not display a change in abundance .

other proteins with increased expression in the nat3Δ strain are involved in cytokinesis and budding such as the kinase hsl1p, which is involved in septin assembly and linkage of morphogenesis to mitotic entry  <cit> . another protein, chs1p is responsible for the synthesis of the chitin ring involved in bud emergence and cytokinesis  <cit> . this is particularly intriguing since it is known that the phenotype of the nat3Δ strain shows abnormal budding behavior such as multiple buds  <cit>  and coincides with finding up-regulation of proteins like the glucanases sun4p and scw10p or the endochitinase cts1p, which are associated with cell wall separation and therefore morphogenetic events such as budding.

effect of nat3Δ on protein phosphorylation
the nat3Δ strain displays a very clear increase in phosphorylation levels. a localization analysis of proteins that display this increase in phosphorylation levels showed that the main effects seem to take place mainly in the cellular bud  but also in the nucleus  and the mitochondria , while the cytoplasmic compartment is underrepresented  . to dissect the underlying kinase networks, we used several tools to predict the kinases responsible for the sites displaying increased phosphorylation levels. the results of these predictions are listed in the additional file  <dig>  to pin-point the prominence of particular kinases we calculated the contribution  of each predicted kinase to elevated phosphorylation sites. this percentage was then normalized by the contributions of the respective kinases to the unchanged nuclear phosphorylation sites. these analyses point out that the serine/threonine kinase snf1p is most prominently involved in the observed elevated nuclear phosphorylation levels  . a similar trend for snf1p could be observed when looking not only at the nuclear subset of elevated phosphorylation sites but at the complete dataset  indicating a general increased activity of snf1p, which can be localized in various cellular compartments  <cit> . snf1p influences a large protein network and is, amongst other things, responsible for energy regulation and glucose derepression by transcriptional activation  <cit> ,  <cit> .

in agreement, network analysis illustrated that the effects of the nat <dig> deletion affects a large phosphorylation network, stretching to various cellular locations and functions . alongside structural and scaffold elements such as proteins involved in transport e.g. hxt3p and tom6p or protein folding e.g. ssc1p, elevated phosphorylation levels are also observed for proteins involved in cell cycle control, for example slt2p, ms1p or cdc28p. the main protein clusters extracted from this network analysis consisted of nuclear proteins involved in rna processing such as the proteins pno1p, cbf5p, sik1p rrp12p and utp14p. other proteins belonging to this cluster play important roles in the biogenesis of ribosomal proteins. other relevant elevated phosphoprotein clusters were found to be involved in the structural elements of the nucleus such as the nuclear pore complex , and proteins involved in dna metabolism , cell cycle progression  and transcriptional regulation . these results suggest possibly a primarily nuclear localized effect of nat3Δ on protein complexes and networks involved in rna processing .

discussion
the yeast n-acetylome and natb substrates
using a comprehensive quantitative proteomics approach enabled us to characterize protein level changes in a nat3Δ yeast strain leading to the experimental observation of  <dig> acetylated protein n-termini, of which  <dig>  substrates of the natb complex, expanding the list of natb substrates significantly. our data confirmed that natb has a very high specificity in yeast and exclusively n-acetylates protein sequences starting with md, me and mn. analysis of the yeast genome revealed that  <dig> n-terminal protein termini should theoretically be detected using our proteomics approach .  <dig>  of the theoretically observable proteins display an n-terminal natb target sequence . the discrepancy between the theoretically possible and experimentally detected protein n-termini and natb targets can be attributed to several sources. first of all, we primarily only enrich n-acetylated protein termini and it has been shown that in yeast only 60-70% of the protein termini are modified in this way. thus it is very likely that not all proteins that possess the n-terminal natb target sequence are actually n-acetylated in-vivo. moreover, proteins of very low abundance  may not be detected, even by our targeted approach.

the different known n-acetyltransferases have conserved specificities across species and act on a largely identical subset solely determined by the first  <dig> or  <dig> n-terminal amino acids  <cit> . we assessed the conservation in this ultimate n-terminal region of the here detected natb substrates across several species. therefore, we extracted orthologous protein sequences from various species and aligned and compared their n-terminal sequences. surprisingly, the targets of natb do not show a particular conservation across the phylogenetic tree and only a few highly conserved proteins  are apparently showing a consistent n-terminal natb substrate consensus sequence , indicating that the n-terminal protection by an acetyl group may not be very tightly associated with a specific n-acetyltransferase. for instance, an alignment of orthologous sequences of the phosphatase glc7p, which was found to be a natb target, shows that the protein is in general very well conserved; however, the n- and c-terminal regions display a much lower degree of conservation , making glc7p not a natb substrate in even closely related species. this analysis indicates that caution should be taken when translating phenotypic results from an n-acetyltransferase deletion strain from s. cerevisiae to other organisms.

nat3Δ downstream effects
one of the main reasons for performing this work originates from the fact that the complex phenotype of the nat3Δ strain in s. cerevisiae cannot be easily explained by just the previously described natb substrates. in our analysis, we identified several "new" natb substrates involved in processes impaired in the nat3Δ strain. the natb target bud27p, for example, is involved in bud site selection and its ko leads to a random budding pattern similar to the budding behavior in the nat3Δ  <cit> . the kinase hsl1p, which is involved in septin ring formation during cell division  <cit>  was found with elevated levels in the nat3Δ and could also be involved in the impaired budding phenotype. however, since the underlying mechanism of bud27p function is not well characterized, also the impact of its  n-acetylation status remains elusive.

the reported inability of the nat3Δ strain to form functional actin cables is likely due to the loss of the n-acetyl group in actin, but we also found two other natb substrate proteins functionally associated with actin , that could further contribute to the loss of function. the observed increase in temperature sensibility  <cit>  of the nat3Δ strain could be related to the heat shock protein hsp104p, a natb target and involved in thermo tolerance and stress response  <cit> . further, the defect in mitochondrial inheritance observed when disrupting the natb complex  <cit>  could be attributed to the loss of the n-acetyl group of ugo1p, a protein which is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane where it is required for mitochondrial fusion  <cit> .

one of the most intriguing findings in this work is that we detected glc7p, a serine/threonine phosphatase  <cit> , as a natb target. this protein is an important regulator and involved in many processes including energy metabolism and g2/m cell cycle progression  <cit> ,  <cit>  and interestingly regulates snf1-mediated phosphorylation, which was observed to be increased significantly in the nat3Δ. considering the slow growth rate displayed by the nat3Δ mutant, our data, as well as data from caesar et al.  <dig>  <cit> , suggests that defects are not simply caused by the loss of functional actin cables. instead the interplay of a variety of natb substrates and further downstream effects may have even larger effects on for instance cell cycle control, cell metabolism and morphology. especially changes in phosphorylation networks may mediate signals and control cellular functions such as the cell cycle  <cit> ,  <cit> . there is no obvious direct link between the identified natb substrates and the observed drastic effect of the nat <dig> deletion on protein and phosphorylation levels. analysis of phosphorylation levels in the wt and nat3Δ revealed a clear increase of phosphorylation levels in the nat3Δ strain. evaluation of protein networks derived from elevated phosphorylation sites in the nat3Δ strain showed that the main affected phosphoprotein clusters could be found in the nucleus of the cell. furthermore, kinase prediction indicates that the snf1p kinase is significantly  involved in phosphorylating elevated nuclear  sites. our data, however, also shows that protein levels of snf1p do not change significantly in nat3Δ. snf1p becomes activated during glucose deprivation  <cit> ,  <cit>  and gets then localized to the nucleus, where it is involved in controlling transcriptional activators, repressors and rna polymerase ii. as such snf1p has a strong influence on the regulation of the cellular metabolism  <cit> , leading to the derepression of glucose related genes, inducing adaptation to a nutrient poor environment by e.g. increased glycogen accumulation  <cit> . as a consequence, proteins such as hxt7p, which belongs to the hexose transporter family and is normally repressed at high glucose levels  <cit> , will be derepressed. strikingly, we found hxt7p to be around 3-fold up regulated in the nat3Δ strain. reg1p, a known regulator of the glc7p phosphatase, is known to be phosphorylated by snf1p during glucose limitation and becomes de-phosphorylated by glc7p after glucose addition.

snf1p mutations result in the inability of yeast to accumulate glycogen as energy storage, when grown on rich media  <cit> . in our context, however, we see a hyperactivity of snf1p which in turn could lead to an activation of glucose repressed genes. the resulting increase in glycogen accumulation is indeed one of the phenotypic characteristics of the nat3Δ strain  <cit> . a likely explanation for this nat3Δ effect could be a disruption of the regulatory interaction network between the phosphatase glc7p, reg1p and the kinase snf1p. we clearly show that glc7p is a natb substrate, its n-terminus being acetylated in the wt strain. we suggest that the loss of n-acetylation could impair the proper function of this phosphatase in the nat3Δ strain. we observe hyper-phosphorylation of reg1p  indicating that the interaction and subsequent de-phosphorylation by glc7p is impaired. this is known to affect the phosphorylation status of the snf <dig> kinase  <cit> . in agreement, we found increased phosphorylation of snf <dig> at sites s <dig> and s <dig>  both of these residues are localized in the snf4-interacting domain of snf1p  <cit>  suggesting that phosphorylation at these residues regulates interaction with snf4p and hence snf4p-mediated release of auto-inhibition of the snf <dig> kinase  <cit> . as a result, various targets of the snf1p kinase could display elevated phosphorylation levels in the nat3Δ strain, as observed in our data. alternatively, there is the possibility that glc7p acts directly on snf1p substrates. an impaired glc7p function in the nat3Δ strain could then also have a more direct effect on the phosphorylation levels.

CONCLUSIONS
we applied a system-wide proteomics strategy to identify substrates of the n-terminal acetyltransferase natb in saccharomyces cerevisiae uncovering  <dig> proteins lacking n-acetylation in a nat3Δ strain. a bioinformatics survey of protein orthologous of these identified substrates in various species showed that the conservation of natb mediated n-acetylation is infrequent throughout the phylogenetic tree. further, we present evidence of protein variants with non-annotated n-termini that are also n-acetylated; however their n-terminal sequence doesn't seem to contain conserved motifs in contrast to regular n-termini and may be results of none-co-translational n-acetylation. in addition, we investigated the downstream effects of nat <dig> deletion on protein and protein phosphorylation levels to gain insights into the biological role of n-acetylation. we revealed a clear elevation of phosphorylation levels in the nat3Δ strain showing, for the first time, an influence of n-acetylation on phosphorylation networks. the kinase snf1p is apparently a key element responsible for this effect.
