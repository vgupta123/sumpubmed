BACKGROUND
clinical use of monoclonal antibodies  to treat autoimmune diseases, transplantation and cancer is having a tremendous medical impact  <cit> . more than  <dig> mabs have been approved for clinical use in the united states and europe and a large number are currently in development  <cit> . initially, mabs were produced by the immunization of laboratory animals, principally mice and rats. human recipient immune response against murine mabs is an important obstacle to their use due to their rapid clearance  <cit> . to solve this problem, several strategies have been developed including the modification of antibody protein sequences to decrease immunogenicity, such as generation of chimeric mouse-human or humanized antibodies, however, these strategies increase the cost of production and often decrease their affinity  <cit> . one solution is to generate human mabs and several strategies are available. one of them is to use human b or plasma cells  <cit> , however this technique is restricted to antigens, such as infectious agents following natural infection, and excludes many important targets that are either normal constituents of the organisms and for which there is immune tolerance or antigens that are harmful if administered, such as toxins. another technique is the use of phage or yeast display but this generates antibodies with weak affinities, and strategies to increase affinity are costly, time consuming and not always successful. a more recent and effective technique is the use of transgenic animals for human immunoglobulin genes and in which their endogenous immunoglobulin genes are deleted  <cit> . these immunoglobulin humanized animals can then be immunized with human proteins since their t and b cells will not be tolerant towards these antigens and human antibodies are produced through normal immune responses. the majority of the human mabs approved for therapy in recent years have been generated in human immunoglobulin transgenic mice  <cit>  but other immunoglobulin humanized transgenic animals, including rats  and cattle  <cit>  have been described. overall, current efforts have focused on the use of human mabs that have reduced immunogenicity after injection in humans compared to chimeric or murine antibodies.

recently developed human immunoglobulin transgenic animals, such as the rats used in this study , do not express rat immunoglobulins following genome editing using zinc-finger nucleases and express chimeric immunoglobulin molecules with human antibody recognizing domains and constant regions of rat origin. this allows optimal interaction of cell membrane immunoglobulin receptors with other components of the b-cell receptor , with generation of antibodies of optimal affinity and diversity displaying extensive mutational changes that accumulate even in rapid immunization schemes. at the same time, it is easy to clone the human antibody sequences in expression vectors containing human constant regions and therefore obtaining fully human antibodies.

until now, all human mabs from mouse or rat human immunoglobulin transgenic animals have been generated using the classical hybridoma fusion of total b cells with a myeloma cell line. it results in low frequency of b cell fusing with the myeloma and is followed by intensive cell culture and screening of many cell clones. the procedure is even more complicated when an antibody able to discriminate between highly homologous proteins is required. thus, the technique of hybridoma generation is time consuming as well as costly and there is need for techniques that will increase efficiency of mabs generation.

in this study, we describe a procedure allowing selection and isolation of single antigen-specific b cells from a heterogeneous population of b cells based on the use of three color tetramerized antigens , previously used for the isolation of peptide-major histocompatibility  specific t cells . we demonstrate the presence of naturally circulating pmhc-specific b lymphocytes in all human peripheral blood samples tested and generated a human mab against the hla-a2/pp <dig> peptide complex derived from human cmv  but that displayed of low affinity. we extended this strategy to human immunoglobulin transgenic rats and show that a rapid immunization method  <cit> , followed by single antigen-specific b cell sorting and expression cloning, allowed to obtain fully human igg high affinity mabs against four different antigens in ~6– <dig> weeks. the mabs, obtained from rats immunized with soluble hla-a2/pp <dig> complex showed increased affinity compared to the one produced from human peripheral blood lymphocytes  while conserving high peptide discriminative properties. furthermore, from two animals immunized with human cd <dig>  it was possible to generate at least  <dig> human mabs. thus, the technique of antigen-specific b cell sorting from immunoglobulin humanized rats allowed efficient generation of human mabs with high affinity and discriminative capacity, likely against any desired antigen. this tetramer-based antigen-specific b cell sorting technique is a faster and more versatile alternative to the use of hybridoma fusion and could also be used in other human immunoglobulin transgenic species.

methods
donor samples
cytapheresis samples were obtained from donors seronegative for hcmv, hcv, and hiv and presumably not at risk for infection and with no melanoma .

animals and immunisation
human immunoglobulin transgenic rats were rendered deficient for rat heavy, lambda and kappa chain expression using zinc-finger nuclease technology  <cit>  and were made transgenic for human vh, dh and jh gene segments linked to the rat heavy chain region as well as fully human light kappa and lambda chains. these rats expressed a diversified repertoire of antibodies with full human idiotypes  <cit> . experimental protocols were approved by the french regional ethical committee for animal experimentation. following a method previously described that yielded high affinity antibodies  <cit> , human immunoglobulin transgenic rats were immunized at day  <dig> at each side of the tail base  with 100 μg of protein in complete freund adjuvant  and at day  <dig> with 100 μg of protein in pbs, then lymph nodes and spleens were harvested at day  <dig> 

proteins and pmhc multimers
the following proteins were biotinylated with a dsb-x™ biotin protein labeling kit : β-galactosidase , cd22-fc , cd <dig>  and ovalbumin . the hla-a*0201–restricted peptides pp <dig> , mela <dig> , ns <dig> , gagp <dig>  were purchased from gl biochem . soluble pmhc monomers were synthesized as previously described  <cit>  hla-a*0201 h chains used in this study carried a mutation in the α <dig> domain , that reduces cd <dig> binding to mhc class i. biotinylated proteins and pmhc monomers were tetramerized with either phycoerythrin - or allophycocyanin -labeled premium grade streptavidins  or with brilliant violet  <dig> -labeled streptavidin  at a molar ratio of 4: <dig> 

tetramer-based enrichment protocol and cell sorting
sorting of human specific b cells
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were obtained by ficoll density gradient centrifugation  and split for tetramer staining into tubes containing 200x <dig> cells. cells were incubated with 200 μl pe-, apc and bv421-conjugated tetramers diluted to 10 μg/ml in pbs plus 2% fbs for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with 15 ml ice-cold sorting buffer . the tetramer-stained cells were then enriched using anti-pe and apc ab-coated immunomagnetic beads  <cit> . the resulting enriched fractions were stained with anti-human cd3-bv <dig>  and anti-cd19-percpcy <dig>   mabs. stained samples were then collected on an aria cell sorter cytometer  and single cd19+ cd3− pe+ apc+ bv421− tetramer cells were collected in individual pcr tubes containing 10 μl of 1x pbs, 10 mm dtt  and  <dig> units of rnase out  per well. single cells were frozen at -80 °c immediately. the total number of tetramer-positive b cells was divided by the total number of b cells within the starting pmbc sample to calculate the frequency of pmhc-specific b cells. counting beads  were used to normalize results.

sorting of rat specific b cells
spleen and iliac lymph nodes were harvested from immunized or unimmunized human immunoglobulin transgenic rats 21 days after immunization and cell suspensions prepared. red blood cells were removed by standard erythrocyte lysis. cells were then stained with anti-rat igg  and anti-tcr  mabs for 30 min at 4 °c. stained cells were then collected on an aria cell sorter cytometer and single igg+ r <dig> − pe+ apc+ and bv421− multimer cells were collected in individual pcr tubes as for human specific b cells.

RESULTS
detection of pmhc-specific human b cells from healthy human donors
for the detection of human b cells specific for pmhc tetramers, we adapted a tetramer-based sorting strategy described to measure the frequency of naive cd8+ t cells directed against various hla-a*0201/peptide complexes in human healthy individuals . quite surprisingly, during these analyses, we observed a low but sizable fraction of cd3−cd19+ cells brightly stained by the various hla-a2/peptide tetramers tested. these included hla-a2/pp <dig>  mela <dig> derived from melanoma antigen  and gagp <dig> derived from hiv, suggesting that b cells expressing specific-bcr might exist in the peripheral blood of healthy donors. the enumeration of these pmhc tetramer+ b cells was assessed in a cohort of  <dig> healthy donors after gating on cells positive for cd <dig> and negative for cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and 7aad. relevant tetramers with two different flurochromes were used in order to efficiently exclude non-ag-specific b cell binders presumably recognizing flurochromes as shown in fig. 1a. importantly, an irrelevant tetramer associated with a third flurochrome was used to enable exclusion of b cells that could not discriminate the targeted ag . average frequencies of antigen specific cells within b lymphocyte pools were in the range of 5 × 10−6-1 × 10− <dig> irrespective of the peptide presented in the binding groove of hla-a <dig>  and the large majority were igm+igg− . proper specificity of tetramer+ b cells was then assessed through single cell sorting of rare b cells targeting hla-a2/pp <dig> without any previous expansion from one donor, followed by a reconstruction of the antibody expressed by rt-pcr cloning. using this strategy, we were able to successfully produce one hla-a2/pp <dig> specific antibody starting from  <dig> sorted single b cells for which ab-reconstruction was successfully performed . although elisa assays clearly demonstrated this mab discriminated pp <dig> peptide presented by hla-a <dig> from other peptides , it was not able to recognize hla-a2+ target cells exogenously loaded with a relevant peptide . furthermore, its binding affinity, determined by surface plasmon resonance , was low  . we thus described a sensitive protocol allowing detection of even scarce ag-specific b cells and the generation of highly discriminative human mabs starting directly from human pbl. nevertheless, the fact that isolation was performed from non-immune healthy donors and most tetramer+ b cells were igm+igg− likely reduces chances to obtain good ag-binders. we therefore implemented our strategy to an immunoglobulin humanized rat previously described for the generation of human mabs by the hybridoma fusion technique  <cit> .fig.  <dig> detection of hla-a2/pp <dig> specific b cells from human pbmc. a gating strategy for hla-a2/pp <dig> specific b cells. after immunomagnetic enrichment with hla-a2/pp <dig> tetramers and staining with additional fluorescent mabs, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. cells were gated first on viable singlet lymphocytes, then on cd19+cd3− cells. b cells that stained with both hla-a2/pp65-pe and hla-a2/pp65-apc tetramers were gated. cells were also stained with hla-a2/irrelevant peptides to exclude b cells that were not against hla-a2/pp <dig>  b the frequency of hla-a2/mela , hla-a2/pp <dig> , hla-a2/gagp <dig>  specific b cells was determined among total peripheral b cells in healthy donors

tetramer-based isolation of antigen-specific b cells from human immunoglobulin transgenic rats
for the generation of human mabs in transgenic rats, we deliberately selected antigens of variable difficulty: notably, mabs that could discriminate between hla alleles and different peptides loaded on the same allele, such as hla-a <dig> and hla-a <dig> loaded with pp <dig>  in this last case, a specific antibody has indeed to recognize both the peptide and the mhc molecule and to discriminate the peptide in the mhc binding groove. we also selected two other antigens, human cd <dig> and bacterial β-galactosidase .

rats were immunized with these purified reagents and lymph nodes tested for the presence of ag-specific b cells. oligomerization of ags was performed using fluorescently tagged streptavidins for pmhc complexes, cd <dig> and β-gal proteins. all fluorescently labeled complexes were used with a set of mabs for identification of igg+ b cells.

detection and isolation of ag-specific b cells from transgenic rats by cytometry was similar to the one used for human samples shown in fig.  <dig>  except the use of an anti-tcr  antibody for t cell-exclusion and anti-igg <dig> and 2b antibodies for positive selection of igg-expressing b cells . these latter cells were more abundant in immunized transgenic rats than in naive ones  . igg1/2b+ b cells stained by relevant tetramers were detected after immunization of rats with all the antigens tested while these b cells were not detectable in non-immunized animals . once again, the relevant antigens were, labeled with two different fluorochromes and used in association with an irrelevant antigen labeled with a third fluorochrome enabling exclusion of non-antigen specific b cells. this exclusion was performed using an irrelevant tetramer of ovalbumin  protein for the detection of β-gal and cd <dig> specific b cells, a hla-b7/irrelevant peptide complex for the detection of hla-a <dig> specific b cells and a mix of hla-a2/irrelevant peptides complexes for the detection of anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> specific b cells. as expected, this last exclusion strategy was very important as the desired discriminative property of the b cells for the ag increases. in particular, selection of b cells able to discriminate the hla-a2/pp <dig> complex specifically required this negative selection strategy  as we observed that most b cells stained by the hla-a2/pp <dig> complex were also able to recognize peptide-loaded hla-a <dig> complexes, most-likely because they recognized β2-microglobulin or hla-a <dig> specific-epitopes. the tetramer-based strategy thus allows a precise identification of ag-specific b cells from immunized animals and an initial screening for b cells capable of discriminating between highly homologous proteins before expression cloning and production of specific mabs as depicted in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> detection and isolation of ag-specific igg1/2b+b cells from immunized human immunoglobulin transgenic rats. after immunomagnetic enrichment with ag tetramers and staining with fluorescent mabs, cells were analyzed on flow cell sorter. a dots plots show viable and singlets lymphocytes stained with anti-igg1/2b and anti-tcr . mabs from one unimmunized and one immunized human immunoglobulin transgenic rats is shown. b dots plots show b cells stained with relevant ag tetramers on unimmunized  and immunized  human immunoglobulin transgenic with β-gal, cd <dig> and hla-a2/pp <dig> ags. cells were also stained with irrelevant ag tetramers to exclude unspecific b cells. cells from human immunoglobulin transgenic rats immunized with β-gal and cd <dig> were stained with ovalbumin tetramers to exclude streptavidin specific b cells. cells from human immunoglobulin transgenic rats immunized with hla-a2/pp <dig> were stained with hla-b7/irrelevant peptide tetramers to exclude streptavidin and pan class i mhc-specific b cells, or with hla-a2/irrelevant peptide tetramers to exclude streptavidin and hla-a <dig> specific b cells




binding properties of human mabs from single b cells
single igg1/2b+ b cells were isolated for every ag tested and specific mabs were obtained in every instance . the proper specificity of these mabs was analyzed and results show exquisite specificity for their respective ligands such as discrimination between the fc and cd <dig> moieties of the fc-cd <dig> molecule used for immunization and between pmhc in a peptide-dependent manner . affinity was measured by spr and all antibodies showed high binding affinities: anti-β-gal mab, kd = 1 × 10− <dig> to 1 × 10−7m; anti-cd <dig>  kd =  <dig>  × 10−9m; anti-hla-a <dig> mab, kd =  <dig>  × 10−8m; anti-hla-a2/pp65 = kd:  <dig>  × 10−7m and  <dig>  × 10−8m . in the latter case, a  <dig> log fold increase in affinity was observed between hla-a2/pp <dig> specific mabs generated from humanized rats versus human b cells, highlighting the efficiency of the humanized rat system.table  <dig> analysis of isolated antigen-specific b cells

anti-hla-a <dig> and anti-hla-a2/ppp <dig> mabs generated with transgenic rats were further examined in order to evaluate their ability to discriminate specific ligands from other highly related ags  in more physiological contexts. the anti-hla-a <dig> mab  was first tested in a luminex assay against microbeads loaded with class i antigens. as shown in fig. 5c, this antibody recognized hla-a* <dig> and all the hla-a group but was poorly or not reactive against most hla-b or -c antigens, demonstrating its ability to discriminate between mhc-groups but not between hla-a alleles. although b cells after immunization of human immunoglobulin transgenic rats were initially selected for their ability to bind hla-a* <dig> tetramers, this global anti-hla-a specificity was at least in part expected as the initial exclusion strategy of ag-specific b cells was performed using hla-b <dig> complexes and not other hla-a alleles. the anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> mabs  were not able to recognize any mhc class i loaded beads in luminex assays .

both anti-hla-a and anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> mabs were then tested for their ability to  recognize target cells expressing or not hla-a <dig> loaded with relevant or irrelevant peptides  inhibit specific-t cell activation in a mhc or pmhc restricted manner and  specifically bind hla-a or hla-a2/pp <dig> complexes generated under naturally occurring physiological ag-processing  . while the anti hla-a mab  was able to recognize hla-a2+ target cells and block activation of hla-a <dig> reactive t cell clone or lines, in a mhc group-a dependent manner but irrespective of the loaded-peptide, the anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> mabs  were dependent on both the peptide and the expression of hla-a <dig> . human embryonic fibroblasts, expressing or not hla-a <dig>  were next infected with the hcmv laboratory strain toledo at a moi of  <dig> . seventy-two hours later, a strong decrease in the expression of hla-a on the surface of the virus-infected cells was observed, in agreement with the previously documented hcmv-induced downregulation of mhc expression   <cit> . although the overall mhc-expression on infected cells was strongly affected, the anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> mab  <dig>  was able to stain infected cells in an hla-a <dig> dependent manner, demonstrating its ability to recognize a naturally generated viral peptide/mhc ligand .fig.  <dig> use of mabs generated from human immunoglobulin transgenic rats immunized with hla-a2/pp <dig> in functional experiments. a t <dig> cells  were loaded for 4 h with different peptides at 50 μg/ml or not , then stained with purified anti-hla-a or anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> mabs  at 1 μg/ml. a secondary ab anti-human igg-pe was added at 1 μg/ml. cells were analyzed on a bd facs canto ii cytometer. specific anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> staining was observed with mabs  <dig>  and  <dig> . b one a2/pp <dig> specific t cell line, one a2/pp <dig> specific t cell clone and one a2/mela specific t cell line were stimulated with t <dig> cells loaded o/n respectively with pp <dig> or mela peptides in the presence of  <dig>   <dig> or 100 μg/ml of isotype control mab, purified mabs to be tested or positive control mabs , anti-pan classi; bd biosciences). the percent inhibition of t-cell activation is indicated in the figure . three independent experiments were performed. c mrc- <dig> cells infected  or not with cmv virus  were stained 72 h post-infection with purified mab  <dig>  at  <dig> or 10 μg/ml or not . a secondary ab anti-human igg-pe was added at 1 μg/ml . percentages of pe+ cells are indicated on dot plots in black, as well as the geometric mean of pe fluorescence in purple. staining with an anti-hla-a <dig> mab  was also performed on non-infected  or infected mr- <dig> cells ; dotted lines represents unstained cells respectively 




our strategy shows that human immunoglobulin transgenic rats can efficiently generate high affinity human mabs against all tested antigens, and these are capable of discriminating between highly homologous proteins without cell culture techniques.

overall yield recovery of human mabs from transgenic rats
the initial screening of selected b cells was performed for various antigens but on a limited number of cells. from a total of  <dig> single isolated b cells , couples of heavy and light chain segments for a single b cell clone were amplified 50% of the time, irrespective of the targeted ag . sequence analysis of amplified heavy chain encoding segments confirmed that all purified b cells expressed igg . we also observed a variety of different vj or vdj segments , in agreement with the previously demonstrated ability of humanized rats to produce diverse b cell responses  <cit> . most analyzed sequences revealed the presence of somatic hypermutations, indicating that these cells had undergone affinity maturation . efficient production of corresponding recombinant mabs was obtained for all specificities with a global recovery yield of 42% , but with large variations depending on the ag-“complexicity”. as an example,  <dig> anti-β-gal mabs were generated from  <dig> couples of heavy and light chains segments , while only  <dig> anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> mabs were obtained from  <dig> couples , underlining the difficulty for these mabs to recognize both the peptide and the mhc molecule.

although we were able to obtain ag-specific mabs in all cases , a deeper analysis of the yield recovery was performed from two rats immunized against human cd <dig>  three weeks after immunization, the lymph nodes were collected and among igg1/2b+ b lymphocytes,  <dig> were specifically stained by cd <dig> tetramers. single cell rt-pcr was performed on  <dig> of these b cells resulting in amplification of both heavy and light chains encoding segments in the same b cell in  <dig> of them . sequence analysis confirmed the induction of a polyclonal secondary b-cell response in the immunized rat and the presence of many somatic hypermutations . these  <dig> mabs were then produced by expression cloning and transfection followed by screening for their ability to recognize cd <dig> by elisa and cytometry . from these  <dig> paired sequences,  <dig> specifically recognized cd <dig> protein by elisa analysis , reacting with different intensities that were not correlated by levels of igg expression in each transfectant . analysis by cytometry showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> mabs reacted against cd22+ target cells and not against cd22− target cells and these were among the  <dig> depicted by elisa . the absence of cd <dig> detection by cytometry by some mabs  is possibly explained by detection of epitopes presented by denatured cd <dig> proteins used in the elisa analysis, not expressed in the natural cell membrane conformation, or due to low antibody affinities. from these  <dig> mabs, further analyses of  <dig> of them randomly chosen showed for all a high affinity  and all recognized human blood b cells. an additional file shows this in details .fig.  <dig> cd <dig> specificity analysis of antibodies by elisa and flow cytometry. supernatants from hek  <dig> cells transfected with light and heavy chain coding constructs from single anti-human cd <dig> b cells were analysed for reactivity against human cd <dig>  a human cd <dig> or β-gal were coated at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in 96-well plates. 50 μl of igg expression supernatants collected 5 days after transfection were used pure or diluted at 1: <dig> in pbs and used as the primary antibody. biotin conjugated anti human igg h + l antibody was used as the secondary antibody. streptavidin hrp was used for detection. od <dig> read from blank control was deducted from all wells. cell culture supernatants from human anti-β-gal h + l  and cd <dig> h + l  transfected cells were used as positive controls in β-gal and cd <dig> elisa, respectively. non-transfected cell culture supernatant was used as the negative control. b representative flow cytometry analysis of heavy and light chain co-transfected hek cell culture supernatants. supernatants from the indicated heavy + light chain positive transfections in elisa  or negative  and were used as primary antibodies on ramos cd22+ and nk <dig> cd22− cell lines. cell culture supernatants from human anti-cd <dig> h + l  transfected cells and a commercial mouse mab anti-human cd <dig>  were used as positive controls. biotin conjugated anti human igg h + l antibody was used as a secondary antibody and streptavidin alexa <dig> was used for cytometry detection. histograms for transfected cell supernatant shown in black non-transfected cell supernatant in filled grey. control ramos and nk <dig> cell lines were labelled with a commercial mouse anti human cd <dig> fitc  or with an isotype control 




discussion
using multiparametric single cell sorting of highly antigen-specific b cells from the blood of human donors followed by expression cloning of immunoglobulin genes, we generated human mabs. these mabs were highly specific since they discriminated between different pmhc complexes. nevertheless, they were of tcr-like affinity . indeed, most b cells isolated from human blood and against a protein target were naïve , in agreement with the fact that human donors were not immunized against these particular ag. immunoglobulin humanized transgenic rats produced highly diverse and near normal expression levels of antibodies with human idiotypes  <cit> . using a classical long immunization protocol into the footpad resulting mainly in antigen-specific b cells in the spleen followed by the hybridoma technique, we previously showed the generation of human mabs against several proteins  <cit> . although well established, this immunization protocol takes more than 6 weeks and requires administration of 400 μg of antigen  <cit> . furthermore, the hybridoma technique is costly and time consuming. thus, we developed a rapid and efficient immunization protocol allowing rapid production of antigen-specific b cells in the draining lymph nodes followed by the same single cell multiparametric sorting of antigen-specific b cells and expression cloning of immunoglobulin genes used from human pbmcs. in three weeks using 200 μg of antigen, it has been described that high affinity antibodies are generated  <cit>  and we show here that specific b cells could be isolated from medial iliac lymph nodes. single cell rt-pcr and sequencing of the immunoglobulin genes of these b cells showed a high proportion of mutated igg sequences with high affinity, regardless of antigen provenance  and regardless of the size of proteins. this rapid affinity maturation has already been described  <cit> .

the gating strategy to isolate ag-specific b cells required three colors for antigen labeling . similar techniques using only two colored ags allowed isolation of antigen-specific b cells from immunized wild type mice   <cit>  or from hiv-specific blood b cells from hiv+ patients   <cit>  have been described. compared with the latters, the  <dig> color gating strategy improved the antigen-specificity of the sorted b cells since the  <dig> antigen-specific colors allow exclusion of fluorochrome-specific b cells, while the third irrelevant/related ag allows to gate-out streptavidin and biotin-specific b cells and could offer the possibility to identify b cells able to discriminate between highly related-ags. this latter point is best exemplified by our ability to generate hla-a2/pp65-specific human mabs from human pbl or humanized rats. in that particular case, the use of an hla-a2/irrelevant peptide complex is mandatory to eliminate or reduce, biotin, streptavidin, β2-microglobulin, but also hla-a <dig> specific b cells that do not discriminate the peptide in the hla-a <dig> binding groove. the use of  <dig> colored ags has recently been performed to isolate anti-citrullinated-specific b cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients  <cit>  but has not been yet exploited to isolate b cells able to discriminate between related/homologous antigens and to produce corresponding human mabs from human or animals. one anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> mab tested recognized the epitope with high affinity  allowing detection in cmv infected cells and thus could be a useful reagent for diagnostic or even therapeutic purposes. this antibody will be tested in the future for its capacity to kill cells by adcc or by using its antigen-binding domain to generate a chimeric-antigen receptor then expressed by cytotoxic t lymphocytes. it is noteworthy that this hla-a2/pp65-specific mab showed a two log increase affinity compared to the one that we obtain from human pbl and one log over an anti-hla-a2/pp <dig> generated by phage display  <cit> . these observations underlie the power of human immunoglobulin transgenic animals system where immunization with virtually any human or microbial protein could be easily performed. moreover, we readily obtained high affinity mabs  against the other antigens targeted in our study .

previous studies have questioned the suboptimal performance of human immunoglobulin transgenic animals, such in transgenic mice, both in terms of the diversity and affinity of the antibodies generated  <cit> . indeed, an imperfect interaction between the constant region of the human immunoglobulin, expressed on the b cell membrane, and the mouse b-cell receptor  signaling machinery, could decrease the efficacy and quality of antibody production  <cit> . a successful strategy to overcome this has been to generate transgenic animals carrying a heavy immunoglobulin transgene locus in which human immunoglobulin vh, dh, and jh segments have been linked to mouse  <cit>  or rat  <cit>  heavy immunoglobulin constant chain loci. in this situation, membrane antibodies with a constant region from the transgenic species interact optimally with other components of the bcr. these transgenic rats also harbor an entirely human immunoglobulin light chain transgene locus. we demonstrate in the present study that b cells from human immunoglobulin transgenic rats express a normal diversity of antibodies with human idiotypes of high affinity against various ags. these can be easily converted to fully humanized abs by cloning the variable sequences in an expression vector containing human constant heavy chain sequences  <cit> .

the cell sorting strategy of positively selecting igg+ specific b cells resulted in a high percentage of specific mabs. for example, following cd <dig> immunization,  <dig> % of igg+ cells were cd <dig> specific, with β-gal immunization, 100% of igg+ cells were β-gal specific and with hla-a2/pp <dig> immunisation,  <dig> % of igg+ cells were hla-a2/pp <dig> specific. in comparison,  <dig> to 14% of total hybridomas are estimated to be ag specific using the hybridoma technique  <cit> . twenty-seven anti-cd22-specific mabs were obtained using 58% of the total number of antigen-specific b cells from  <dig> animals. assuming that all the antigen-specific b cells would have been analyzed from a given animal, a recovery estimate of  <dig> specific mabs could be inferred per animal. compared to hybridoma generation, multiparametric cell sorting of ag specific b cells followed by single cell rt-pcr analysis, sequencing and cloning in expression plasmids, considerably reduces the time required to isolate specific mabs by eliminating cell culture to isolate and expand hybridomas. a drawback of our technique is that it relies on the availability of purified antigen to be labelled with biotin and perform b cell sorting. importantly, the immunization step could be replaced by dna immunization or using cells expressing a given antigen.

because plasma cells secrete high affinity antibodies, it would be very desirable to isolate antigen specific plasma cells. by using a reticulum endoplasmic marker and fluorescent antigen staining, kurosawa et al. demonstrated the feasibility of isolating polyclonal plasma/plasmablast cells by facs from humans and several wild-type animals  <cit> . subsequent expression of heavy and light chains allowed them to produce mabs. as they demonstrated the capacity of plasma cells isolation from rats, this technique is reasonably foreseeable for transgenic rats. other techniques have been applied to generate mabs, such as immortalization of human b cells with epstein barr virus  <cit>  but this strategy has drawbacks linked to the use of human b cells described above. another technique used in immunized animals is next generation sequencing coupled to bioinformatic analysis to pair the more abundant heavy and light chains  <cit>  but this technique needs extensive bioinformatic analysis as well cloning and expression of sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
the use of human immunoglobulin transgenic rats, the rapid immunization followed by an efficient single cell sorting of antigen-specific igg+ b cells, allowed production of human igg mabs against all antigens tested, with high yield affinity and discrimination, in a rapid manner. this technique could be easily implemented to other immunoglobulin humanized species and adapted to virtually any desired antigens which should open interesting perspectives both for basic research and immunotherapeutic purposes.
