BACKGROUND
paenibacillus larvae is a spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium, studied for the past century due to its ability to cause american foulbrood , a larval disease of honey bees  <cit> . the host is most vulnerable during an approximately 48-h window in the life cycle - the early larval stage - where arguably an undeveloped immune system and/or a lack of energy stores result in death. during this period, the oral ld <dig> ingestion is  <dig>  spores  <cit> ; death occurs due to systemic infection after the germinated bacterial spores proliferate in the midgut and then breach the midgut epithelium via a paracellular route  <cit> . the antibiotics oxytetracycline and tylosin are used both prophylactically and to treat symptoms; however, widespread drug resistance is evident  <cit>  and their registered use is being withdrawn in many countries since residues can show up in honey. even in susceptible isolates though, it is extremely difficult to completely eliminate from a hive, so without definitive knowledge of the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis, the design of specific treatments is significantly hindered. in  <dig>  a draft of the p. larvae genome was published at an estimated 5-6x coverage  <cit> ; here we extend this coverage and further annotate the genome sequence with a combination of bioinformatics and proteomics.

RESULTS
assembly of the p. larvae genome
using the illumina gaii platform and the abyss assembler, together with the previously collected sanger reads  <cit> ; we achieved 182x coverage of the p. larvae genome and generated an initial assembly with a contig n <dig> of  <dig>  kb. this statistic describes the contiguity of an assembly, and denotes that 50% of the reconstructed genome is contained in contigs equal to or larger than the given value. contigs were joined into scaffolds using abyss and anchor   to achieve a scaffold n <dig> of  <dig>  kb. the largest contig size was  <dig>  base pairs. there were  <dig> contigs with a size less than  <dig> kb,  <dig> contigs with length between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb,  <dig> contigs with length between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb and  <dig> contigs larger than  <dig> kb. the total length of the assembled contigs was  <dig> , <dig> base pairs. assembly statistics are listed in table  <dig> 

this whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession adzy <dig>  with the latest version being adzy <dig>  genome annotation and downstream analysis described below is based on the first version, adzy <dig>  despite high sequence coverage, the assembly was relatively fragmented . this fragmentation appears to be due primarily to long genomic repeats that could not be bridged by our sequencing strategy, as indicated by a preponderance of repetitive sequence occurring at contig ends . many of these repeats are similar to known bacterial insertion sequences and exceed  <dig> kb in length . as a result, the majority of contigs were 1- <dig> kb in length.

given the fragmented nature of the assembly and the potential contribution of transposable elements to chromosome re-arrangements, we used tblastx and mummer to investigate the level of synteny between p. larvae and the congeneric soil bacterium p. jdr <dig>  although the completely sequenced p. jdr <dig> genome is  <dig>  mbp, substantially larger than our assembly , the species share ~93% identity at 16s ribosomal loci. figure 2a shows that, despite the difference in assembly size, gene-level synteny is generally conserved with p. jdr <dig> across the entirety of many p. larvae contigs. some regions have excellent conservation . this suggests that p. jdr <dig> can be a useful reference for comparative genomics and to order p. larvae contigs for genome finishing. divergent regions between the two genomes are also of interest because they may harbor species-specific genes that are ecologically important in soil and beehive environments, respectively. for example, contig seq <dig>  which lacks synteny with p. jdr- <dig> , contains two gene regions not present elsewhere in p. jdr- <dig> that are potential virulence factors . interesting, the same contig was also poorly conserved in another bacterium p. vortex , thereby strengthening the claim that genes in this contig are unique to p. larvae. p. vortex is a pattern-forming soil bacterium with a  <dig>  mbp genome  <cit> , so as expected, its overall level of synteny with p. larvae is quite high , though slightly lower than observed when compared against p. jdr- <dig> 

within the regions unique to p. larvae, one includes several open reading frames  with strong homology to the synthetases of the antibiotic plipastatin, which inhibits phospholipase a <dig>  <cit>  and surfactin  <cit> , which possess hemolytic activity  <cit> . the region also contains putative type i polyketide synthetases whose products are secondary metabolites, some of which have antibiotic, immunosuppresant, or toxic effects  <cit> . the second region encodes homologs of a putative iron-siderophore abc transporter, which enables iron uptake from the medium, an important process for many bacterial infections  <cit> .

annotation of putative p. larvae proteins
using glimmer to predict genes from the p. larvae assembly and blast  <cit>  searches against bacillus or streptococcus to provide annotation information , we identified  <dig>  gene models . using shotgun proteomics methods to analyze p. larvae lysates, we identified  <dig> proteins , thus confirming the expression of 35% of the predicted proteins. details regarding the identities of these proteins can be found in additional file  <dig>  as a major aim of this project is to find potential virulent factors and unique genes for this niche-specific bacterium, we describe below the genome content of p. larvae for several pathways considered to be important in this regard. the putative functions of the proteins were predicted by searching for matches against the conserved domain database , and the complete results are tabulated in additional file  <dig> 

flagellar system
p. larvae is a flagellated bacterium and  <dig> genes associated with this system are detected in this assembly , based on comparisons to two other fully-sequenced organisms. this group includes motor/switch, flagellar rings, rod hook and filament proteins, along with proteins involved in regulation and as chaperones. when compared against the bacillus subtilis  and escherichia coli  flagella, p. larvae has orthologs for nearly all of the genes. those that are missing, such as the l and p ring proteins flgh and flgi in the outer membrane of the gram-negative e. coli, are not necessary for the gram-positive p. larvae since it only has one membrane  <cit> . however, it appears to be missing some players needed for assembly of the flagellar hook, a structure that acts both as a joint and motor for each individual flagellum. the hook itself, made of monomers, requires the monomer scaffolding protein flgd  <cit> ; this was not found in the p. larvae genome. also missing is flik, which acts essentially as a checkpoint for the flagellum's correct length prior to export. this may mean that this species has evolved ways to proceed with hook assembly despite their omission, or the enzymes were simply not detected by our current methods; as with many negative results, however, our inability to detect such genes does not imply p. larvae is completely incapable of quality control functions. besides the flagellar structure, another important aspect is the control of its movement. directionality is largely dictated by the che gene family and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins  <cit> , which can also be found in the p. larvae genome. the base of the flagellum consists of assembly and regulatory components, which are made of fli and mot gene families in e. coli  <cit> . again, orthologs for most of these can be seen in p. larvae.

toxins
our search for p. larvae genes that can encode toxins returned three matches to sixteen proteins . a domain of the clostridum perfringens epsilon toxin  was observed in efx <dig> and efx <dig>  which forms pores on host cells  <cit>  leading to cell death. p. larvae appear to possess classic binary toxins: the first factor is a membrane component that makes the host cell permeable to a second factor - the enzymatic component. seven proteins matched the clostridial binary toxin b domain , the membrane component. we also saw that four proteins matched the vip <dig> domain , which is the enzymatic component of a bacillus toxin capable of adp ribosylation on actin. in both the clostridial and bacillus toxins, the associated partners of these binary toxin-pairs were not observed.

hemolysins
in the mid to late stage of the p. larvae infection cycle, bacteria circulate in bee hemolymph which contains hemocytes. hemolysins are a class of bacterial toxins with lytic activity against blood cells. four hemolysin domains were matched by proteins from the p. larvae genome. . three proteins contained regions that were highly similar to the hemolytic domain tylc  and concomitantly to other domains such as cbs_pair_corc_hylc_assoc and duf <dig> , implying that these are very similar proteins. efx <dig> was matched to the hlyiii domain, an integral membrane protein from bacillus cereus which forms channels on host cells  <cit> . efx <dig> appears to be related to hemolysin tlya  with an indirect pore-forming role. one protein  showed similarity to duf <dig> with unpublished claims of hemolysin activity in aeromonas hydrophila.

proteases
the occurrence of proteases in larval scales  has already been well documented  <cit> . a more recent study hints on a definite possibility that one or more such proteins can act as the virulence factor  <cit> . since it has been shown that vegetative rods residing in the host midgut can traverse the epithelium by a paracellular route, p. larvae may generate proteolytic activity that can disrupt epithelial cell-to-cell junctions. we searched the proteins for domains with this function, and after excluding ones with roles that are not directly implicated in pathogenesis , we list the matches in table  <dig>  based on the information provided by the cdd, several proteins may conceivably serve as virulence factors. the clp protease complex, in particular, has been linked to virulence factor production in gram-positive bacteria, as well as degradation of misfolded proteins  <cit> . proteins efx <dig>  efx <dig> may be capable of cleaving the transmembrane regions of substrate proteins . given that tight junctions between epithelial cells are mainly composed of occludin and claudin proteins, both of which have transmembrane domains  <cit> , they may be specific substrates for p. larvae proteases. these points, however, are merely speculative, and the many proteases in table  <dig> await experimental evidence to prove whether or not they actually contribute a real role in virulence.

antibiotic resistance
p. larvae infections have been treated with tetracycline for decades. it has been shown that resistance against this antibiotic can be conferred by the pma <dig> plasmid  <cit> . more recently, the macrolide tylosin has now been registered as a new antibiotic in the u.s. for use when tetracycline is no longer effective  <cit> . since antibiotic resistance is inevitable  <cit> , new therapeutics will eventually be required. realizing that p. larvae appears to encode a plethora of drug efflux proteins  may help in the selection of useful drugs.

it is known that the bee midgut contains a vast array of bacteria, some of which can inhibit p. larvae growth in vitro  <cit> , presumably by the production of lantibiotics. in our search we were able to find a number of different drug and lantibiotic efflux pumps and modifying enzymes , and it is likely that these proteins are enlisted by p. larvae during interactions with co-occurring antagonistic bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article we report an update on the p. larvae genome to 182-fold coverage, and estimated the ordering of contigs based on comparison against the p. jdr <dig> genome. we predicted more than  <dig> genes and provided these with functional annotation. of great interest are enzymes that allow the bacterium to traverse the midgut epithelium after ingestion, a process which can contribute to its virulence. proteases have been thought of as a key factor  <cit> , and this is supported by the large repertoire of such enzymes which we have seen from the predicted gene products. damage to the host is likely the result of mixed effects from the hemolysins and toxins that can be encoded by p. larvae. its ability to survive in the host by evading the immune system, as well as protecting itself against other gut bacteria, is likely made possible due to the antibiotic proteins that may be expressed.

this improved version of the p. larvae genome and the more detailed annotations will be tremendously useful for improving our understanding of this species; for example, in designing primers to clone genes, or mutate them by site-directed mutagenesis. especially for the field of proteomics, which often relies heavily on a database of protein sequences to make identifications, the current genome update will be a very powerful tool. computer-based modeling techniques can be employed to predict the structure of virulence factors, which can guide drug design. ultimately, the genome will pave the way to more effective prevention; or better yet, a cure for afb. given the bee population is under severe strain from the widely publicized colony collapse disorder, attributable to multiple biotic and abiotic factors, it is important to continually improve our knowledge of the key threats that burden worldwide bee health.
