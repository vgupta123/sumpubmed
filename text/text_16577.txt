BACKGROUND
the first monoclonal antibody therapeutic was approved for use in the united states in  <dig>  the mouse anti-cd <dig> molecule muromonab that reduces organ transplant rejection  <cit> . since then, nearly  <dig> full-length therapeutic antibodies and  <dig> fragment antigen-binding  antibodies have been approved in the united states or europe, with hundreds more in preclinical and clinical development  <cit> . therapeutic antibodies are used in a myriad of disease settings, including oncology, autoimmune, and neurological disorders. there are four major antibody types used as therapeutics: fully non-human , chimeric   <cit> , humanized   <cit> , and fully human  <cit> . therapeutics have evolved to include more human sequences, since in general the more human sequence that is present in the antibody, the less immunogenic the antibody will be once introduced to humans  <cit> . immunogenicity refers to the ability of a therapeutic antibody to induce the formation of anti-drug antibodies  when administrated into a human. adas are immune system generated antibodies against the therapeutic that can reduce the efficacy of the drug, and more importantly they can also cause adverse effects ranging from a rash at the site of injection to a systemic inflammatory reaction that can be fatal  <cit> . therefore it would be extremely valuable to know whether an antibody may be immunogenic prior to clinical trials are initiated.

the complementarity determining regions  of an antibody are the most variable segments of the variable domain that are essential for the antibody-antigen binding specificity and affinity  <cit> . the cdrs and the surrounding framework segments comprise the full variable sequence of an antibody. several attempts have previously been made to calculate a humanness score of the variable region sequences of antibodies, since a vital use for such a tool is to aid in identifying antibody sequences that are likely to have reduced immunogenicity when introduced to humans. first, abhinandan and martin  <cit>  developed the h-score, which calculates the average sequence identity of a given antibody sequence as compared to a small database of human variable region sequences. using these data, however, the authors were unable to find a clear correlation between h-score and immunogenicity of a small set of therapeutic antibodies. second, pelat et al.  <cit>  defined a germinality index that is the proportion of framework residues that are identical between a given antibody variable region sequence and the closest related human germline sequence. the score was used to analyze humanized forms of a macaque anthrax toxin antibody. third, thullier et al.  <cit>  developed the g-score, which is similar to the h-score expect that the score attempts to classify which germline framework sequence the input antibody was originally derived from. the authors used this tool to study the humanness of multiple macaque antibody sequences.

the germinality index only compares sequences to a single germline sequence, and the databases for the h-score and g-score were composed of a small set of ~ <dig>  antibody sequences. further, after assigning h-scores to a set of mouse antibody sequences, nearly all mouse heavy chain sequences scored in the same range as human heavy chain sequences, and more than half of the mouse light chains scored in the same range as human light chain sequences  <cit> . if an antibody humanness scoring method is unable to clearly distinguish a human and mouse sequence, it is not possible to definitely state how human a given sequence really is by these scoring methods. here we have developed a new tool to determine the humanness of antibody variable region sequences, termed the t <dig> score analyzer. after refining the input antibody databases, we found that the t <dig> score can clearly separate human sequences from mouse sequences and many other species as well. the t <dig> score was used to conduct a thorough analysis of a large set of therapeutic antibodies, revealing surprising similarities between human-like humanized antibodies and fully human antibodies. the t <dig> score analyzer is available for free use online: http://abanalyzer.lakepharma.com.

RESULTS
t <dig> score analyzer development
first, we curated a large database of ~ <dig>  human antibody variable region sequences in order to develop a new tool to analyze human antibody variable region sequences. the variable region sequence of antibody sequences were numbered using the kabat numbering system  <cit>  and the cdr and framework regions were annotated. sequences for variable heavy chain , variable kappa light chain , and variable lambda light chain  were stored as full-length sequences or as framework only sequences  to obtain the all human databases . starting with a single input variable region antibody sequence , protein blast  <cit>  was performed against all sequences in the respective database. following blast the matching sequences were sorted from high to low based on the percent identity with the input sequence. the percent identity of the top  <dig> matched sequences were averaged to obtain the t <dig> score , where the t <dig> score is a measurement of how human-like the variable region of an antibody looks, with  <dig> being the highest possible score; most antibodies analyzed with this method scored at least  <dig>  when the t <dig> score was obtained for each sequence from the curated all human databases and then the scores were sorted from high to low, a relatively normal distribution was observed for both full-length and framework only sequences .

an antibody humanness score should possess the ability to distinguish human antibody sequences from other species' antibody sequences, such as mouse, with high specificity. to determine the ability of the t <dig> score to differentiate human antibody sequences from mouse, we scored thousands of mouse antibody sequences with the t <dig> score analyzer using the all human databases . most of the scores for human and mouse sequences had clear separation; however some amount of overlap remained between human and mouse vh and vk sequences. one potential reason to explain why many of the mouse sequences are scoring higher t <dig> scores is due to their similarity with the human sequences that had the lowest t <dig> scores, i.e. the mouse sequences could be similar to the human sequences that looked the least human-like. if this was correct, we predicted that if the least human-like sequences were removed from the database and the mouse sequences were re-scored, this would create a clearer separation between mouse and human sequences. to test this, we removed the bottom 15% of human sequences from each database to obtain t <dig> cutoff human databases . this created a t <dig> score cutoff, which is the t <dig> score where sequences above this cutoff are considered human-like. we then re-scored the mouse sequences using the t <dig> cutoff human databases and found a striking reduction in the t <dig> scores for the full-length and framework only mouse sequences, with minimal overlap between human and mouse sequences . importantly, despite removing many human sequences from the databases, re-scoring all human sequences with the refined databases lead to very little change in their t <dig> scores . therefore by developing a humanness analysis tool that focused on the top 85% of human antibody sequences, we were able to clearly separate human and mouse antibody sequences with excellent specificity, and defined human-like sequences as those scoring above the t <dig> score cutoff. from here on, the t <dig> score only refers to sequences scored with the t <dig> cutoff human databases.

t <dig> score analysis of a collection of antibody sequences
to determine the reproducibility of the t <dig> score distinguishing most human and mouse sequences based on their variable region sequences, an independent set of human and mouse antibodies were evaluated. for both full-length sequences  and framework only sequences , the t <dig> score was able to accurately classify the vast majority of human sequences as human-like and most if not all mouse sequences as not human-like. this validated the t <dig> score as a reproducible method to classify the humanness of an antibody sequence with high specificity.

we next analyzed the variable regions of human and mouse germline sequences, and while there was some variability depending on the chain type being analyzed, in general the t <dig> score accurately classified the human germline sequences as having high t <dig> scores with the mouse germline sequences having scores mostly below the human-like t <dig> score cutoff; similar trends were seen for both full-length and framework only germline sequences . we further found that human antibodies produced in mice that were transgenic for human igg genes  <cit>  produced human antibodies with high t <dig> scores that were similar to germline sequences. by this metric these human antibodies from mice were indistinguishable from fully human antibodies. overall, these data further validate the t <dig> score as a means to consistently and accurately classify antibody sequences as human-like or not.

to determine the humanness of antibody sequences from other species, t <dig> scores were calculated for full-length and framework only sequences for  <dig> additional species ranging from fish to non-human primates . generally, the non-human primate antibody sequences had high t <dig> scores and thus many of them are difficult to distinguish from human sequences, with the rhesus macaque and chimpanzee having the highest scores. fish sequences showed the lowest t <dig> scores, while mammals and amphibians were somewhere in between. no antibody sequences from non-primates besides mice and rats looked human-like .

the humanness of therapeutic antibodies
we curated a set of  <dig> mouse, chimeric , humanized, and fully human antibody sequences that are either approved for clinical use or in various stages of clinical development. we only focused on antibodies with kappa light chain sequences since very few therapeutic antibodies had lambda light chains. we first determined how well the t <dig> score could detect changes in the variable region sequence of therapeutic antibodies that underwent humanization. of  <dig> antibody pairs analyzed, only the light chain of one sequence showed no change in the t <dig> score while all others showed an increase in their t <dig> scores upon humanization . interestingly, for the full-length sequences after humanization, half of the antibody sequences looked human-like, despite the inclusion of non-human sequences in the cdrs and framework regions. for the framework only sequences, nearly all humanized antibodies had framework sequences that looked human-like. this was generally expected since human germline framework sequences are typically utilized as donor sequences for the humanization process  <cit> , and most germline sequences have very high t <dig> scores .

we next calculated the average t <dig> score for each type of therapeutic antibody. as anticipated the humanness of mouse and chimeric antibodies were nearly identical for both full-length and framework only sequences . for full-length sequences, the humanness of humanized heavy and light chain sequences increased strongly, and the t <dig> score analyzer was sensitive enough to detect a further significant increase in the humanness of fully human antibodies . in contrast for framework only sequences, the humanness of both humanized and human sequences were very similar .

to compare the effectiveness of the t <dig> score to classify the humanness of antibodies as compared to other antibody humanness scoring tools, we determined the h-score  <cit>  and g-score  <cit>  for the  <dig> therapeutic antibodies. when the t <dig> score and h-score or g-score were directly compared for the same antibody sequences, the scores were positively correlated for both heavy and light chain sequences . despite the positive correlation with the t <dig> score, the h-score and g-score were unable to separate the humanness of the therapeutic antibody groups as well as the t <dig> score . in particular the differences between mouse/chimeric and humanized or human antibodies, and the differences between humanized and human sequences, were much less significant with the h-score or g-score as compared to the t <dig> score. and although the average h-score and g-score for human antibodies were trending higher than humanized antibodies, when individual sequences were analyzed separate from their group, these scoring methods were not able to clearly distinguish most of the humanized antibodies from fully human antibodies to the same extent as the t <dig> score . these data reveal that the t <dig> score is more reliable at classifying antibodies as human-like with better specificity than alternative antibody humanness analysis tools.

correlation of humanness and immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies
of the  <dig> therapeutic antibodies curated above,  <dig> of them had available data on the antibody immunogenicity from human clinical trials . when the t <dig> scores of all therapeutic antibodies were directly compared to their immunogenicity, there was a clear negative correlation for both full-length and framework only sequences: the higher the t <dig> score, the lower the immunogenicity of the antibody . when these antibodies were separated into the respective antibody class, specific patterns emerged that were similar for full-length and framework only, heavy and light chain sequences. although mouse and chimeric antibodies had similar t <dig> scores, on average there was a strong decrease in the immunogenicity of chimeric antibodies compared to mouse . a further increase in t <dig> score seen with humanized antibodies resulted in a further drop in the immunogenicity. and although fully human antibodies have an even further increase in t <dig> score for full-length antibody sequences compared to humanized antibodies, there was little subsequent decrease in their immunogenicity . one exception was the humanized antibody daclizumab that had a strong immunogenic response in 24% of patients ; when this antibody was removed from the analysis, the minor difference in the immunogenicity of humanized and human antibodies disappeared . these data suggest that because the immunogenicity of humanized and fully human antibodies are nearly identical, with minor exceptions, there may not be an extra benefit of obtaining fully human therapeutic antibodies as long as the humanized antibody has a higher t <dig> score than its mouse/chimeric parental sequence.

the benefit of performing antibody humanization was further evidenced by following the humanness and immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies prior to and after humanization. within our curated therapeutic antibody database, there were three mouse antibodies that underwent humanization and were included in clinical trials as both mouse and humanized antibodies. all three mouse antibodies initially had high levels of immunogenicity with low t <dig> scores . the humanness of the antibody heavy and light chain sequences increased following humanization, and this increase correlated with a shift to no detectable immunogenicity in all three cases, underscoring the critical importance of performing antibody humanization prior to conducting clinical trials. the data suggest that the framework only t <dig> score of the humanized heavy and light chains should be equal to or above the t <dig> score cutoff . in contrast, the full-length sequence appears to only need to increase its humanness t <dig> score, as it does not have to look human-like in order to benefit from antibody humanization and have similar immunogenic properties as a fully human antibody. therefore quantifying the humanness of therapeutic antibody sequences with the t <dig> score analyzer is a powerful tool that can be a valuable asset during the antibody drug development process.

discussion
a critical issue with therapeutic antibodies in the clinic is reducing the potential immunogenicity of the final therapeutic form  <cit> . one of the more recent tactics to avoid possible immunogenicity issues is by using fully human antibodies, either produced in transgenic mice  <cit>  or using phage display technology  <cit> , which are often difficult processes compared to traditional monoclonal antibody development  <cit> . data presented here revealed that despite a significant difference in the humanness of humanized and fully human antibody sequences, with minor exceptions the immunogenicity of the antibodies was nearly indistinguishable. this was shown in detail for three antibodies that started with high levels of immunogenicity as mouse antibodies, and after their humanization they became non-immunogenic antibodies; the decreased immunogenicity was correlated with an increase in the humanness score of both the heavy and light chains of each antibody. therefore an additional mechanism to decrease the chance of a humanized antibody being immunogenic in humans is verifying that both the heavy and light chains of the humanized antibody have increased t <dig> scores over the parental sequence and are thus more human-like. while it is possible that humanized antibodies with lower t <dig> score will not be immunogenic in the clinic, in general non-human-like antibodies were associated with increased immunogenicity .

the unique ability of the t <dig> score analyzer to specifically determine the humanness of the framework regions of an antibody sequence is especially useful when performing antibody humanization, where the cdr sequences are purposely left as parental sequences and only the framework region is transformed into a human-like sequence. for example, the humanness of an antibody framework sequence can be followed throughout the process of performing humanization, where each subsequent change to the framework region can be scored and tracked. our own antibody humanization efforts revealed that despite the high t <dig> scores for most donor human germline framework sequences , re-introducing specific parental framework sequences into a human germline sequence is sometimes sufficient to revert the t <dig> score of the humanized framework sequence to the same score as the initial parental framework sequence . since the t <dig> score analyzer would be simple to implement during the therapeutic antibody development process, it can be used to prevent antibody sequences with low humanness scores from progressing along the pipeline.

other methods have been developed to predict antibody immunogenicity, such as experimentally screening molecules for antigen specific activation of t-cells or experimentally searching for t-cell epitopes followed by their removal through targeted substations  <cit> . however these methods require a combination of in vitro experimentation in addition to in silico prediction tools. we propose that these complicated and time-consuming methods are not necessary since it appears that increasing the humanness of the variable region sequence is sufficient to remove most cases of immunogenicity, which can be directly monitored with the t <dig> score analyzer.

researchers have utilized phage display technologies to express synthetic repertoires of antibodies that can be screened for binding to specific antigens  <cit> . during the screening process it would be useful to predict whether these synthetic antibodies would be immunogenic in humans or not, for example by utilizing the t <dig> score to analyze the sequences. we used the t <dig> score analyzer to determine the humanness score of a small set of synthetic antibodies and compared these to human antibodies. surprisingly, the average and range of t <dig> scores observed for the variable regions of synthetic antibodies was very similar to human antibodies . due to the absence of immunogenicity data from synthetic antibodies, we were unable to directly correlate the t <dig> score of synthetic antibodies with immunogenicity. however since the t <dig> scores of synthetic and human antibodies are similar, we suggest that the t <dig> score may be able to predict the immunogenicity of synthetic antibodies to a similar extent as human antibodies.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have developed the t <dig> score analyzer to calculate the humanness of variable region sequences of monoclonal antibodies with high specificity and reproducibility. in addition to providing a score for the full-length antibody sequence of heavy, kappa light, and lambda light chains, the tool can exclude the cdr regions to calculate a separate score focusing only on the framework regions. we used this tool to study therapeutic antibodies that have been approved for clinical use or are currently in clinical development. of note we observed consistent decreases in the immunogenicity of antibodies that underwent humanization that resulted in increased t <dig> scores, suggesting that the t <dig> score may be used as a metric to determine whether an antibody has been truly humanized. we further found that the t <dig> score analyzer was better at assessing the differences in the humanness of therapeutic antibodies compared to previously published humanness scoring methods. this tool will be a valuable asset to accurately measure the humanness of the variable region of new therapeutic antibodies during their preclinical development.
