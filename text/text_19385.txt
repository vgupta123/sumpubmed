BACKGROUND
studying non-random positioning of chromosome territories in interphase nuclei has led to an understanding of the spatial control of gene expression, in addition to gene and regulatory element sequence and chromatin modification  <cit> . meaning that the position of a chromosome territory within an interphase nucleus may contribute to the control of gene expression  <cit> . in our studies of human tissue culture cells we have demonstrated that chromosome positioning is correlated with mostly with gene density in young proliferating cells  <cit> , which changes to a size associated distribution of chromosome territories once the cells have exited the cell cycle  <cit> . it could be further hypothesised that specific chromosomes and/or gene loci would change their nuclear location before or after changes in regulation associated with cell differentiation. indeed there is evidence in the literature that interphase positioning of chromosome territories may be tissue-specific and alter after differentiation. in human tissue culture cells the interphase positioning of most human chromosomes is conserved in both skin fibroblasts and lymphoblasts with the exception of two chromosomes,  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . cell types derived from similar differentiation pathways such as small lung cells and large lung cells, or lymphocytes and myleoblasts also exhibited similar overall chromosome positioning but with some distinct tissue-specific chromosome locations apparent between the different cell types  <cit> . human and porcine chromosomes have also been demonstrated to change nuclear location after induced adipogenesis  <cit> , and during normal spermatogenesis  <cit> .

the majority of studies on chromosome positioning have focussed on human cells however it appears that in all species so far studied, that the positioning of chromosome territories is non-random  <cit> , including human  <cit> , birds  <cit> , snail  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , cow  <cit> , and non-human primates  <cit> . even in lower organisms such as hydra and bacteria – distinct organisation of the genome has been observed  <cit> .

to date, there have not been many chromosome positioning studies on porcine cells despite the pivotal role of pigs. indeed the pig has much to offer as a model for human disease, for example, in diabetes and obesity, fertility, infectious disease resistance and maternal aggression. the pig is an important organism given its physiological similarities to human and its agricultural significance  <cit> . pigs and humans also share numerous similarities with respect to their genomes with comparable genome sizes  <cit> , karyotypes  <cit> , and synteny  <cit>  and the first draft of the porcine genome sequence is now near completion. studies so far have positioned chromosomes in porcine spermatozoa  <cit> , mesenchymal stem cells and differentiated adipocytes  <cit>  and resting and activated neutrophils  <cit> . many of these studies however are on single or small numbers of cell types and have yet to provide much insight into what properties or characteristics are involved in porcine genome behaviour in interphase nuclei. nonetheless, they have all revealed that chromosome behaviour in pig cells is responsive to external stimuli during proliferation or differentiation.

in this study, we have assessed the interphase genome behaviour of individual porcine chromosomes in a range of porcine cells and tissues. such studies will allow us to understand more about the spatial influences on genome function in differentiation, development and disease. thus, in order to understand more about porcine genome behaviour, we have positioned individual whole chromosomes in different cell types such as a newly generated adult porcine fibroblast line , an embryonic fibroblast cell line , ex vivo lymphocytes and ex vivo bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells . further, we have then developed methods to permit the 3d positioning of chromosome territories in frozen porcine tissue sections. this has allowed a comparison between tissues derived from different germ layers in the embryo; and a further comparison between cells grown in tissue culture and cells directly from the animal.

RESULTS
interphase chromosome positioning in porcine tissue culture cells
interphase chromosome positioning for nearly all porcine chromosomes was assessed in two lines of porcine fibroblasts derived from adult and embryonic tissue, mesenchymal stem cells derived from porcine bone marrow, and lymphocytes directly isolated from porcine blood . chromosome positions in human interphase nuclei are different in non-proliferating cells and can even be found in alternative locations reversibly quiescent or irreversibly senescent cells  <cit> . in order to be sure that the cells we were analysing were in the proliferative cell cycle, we used cells that were in s-phase due to a short pulse of brdu for incorporation into newly synthesised dna during dna replication . this was not possible for lymphocytes as they were isolated directly from pig blood. figure  <dig> displays representative images of chromosome territory delineation and position in the four analysed cell-types in 2d flattened proliferating nuclei. fifty images of each cell type, with each chromosome paint, apart from ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  and sscy  due to probe availability, were subjected to an erosion analysis script that divides the nucleus into five concentric shells of equal area . the percentage of dna signal intensity and the percentage of chromosome signal intensity were measured for each shell. to normalise the data the chromosome signal intensity measurement per shell was divided by the dna intensity measurement of the same shell. the mean chromosome position was determined from the distribution of normalised hybridisation signal across the five concentric shells, with shell  <dig> being the nuclear periphery and shell  <dig> the nuclear interior. these data were plotted in histograms and their relative position in nuclei determined , such that where the histograms display more normalised signal in shells  <dig> and  <dig> we state that the chromosomes are located more towards the nuclear periphery. if the histograms display more normalised signal in shells  <dig> and  <dig> then we state that the chromosomes are more towards the nuclear interior. an intermediate positioning is revealed when shell  <dig> displays more normalised signal then other shells, giving a bellshaped curve. the distribution of chromosome signal using this method was fairly easy to categorise for a number of graphs but for others it was not so straightforward and thus we have a bimodal distribution for chromosome  <dig> in adult fibroblasts and equally distributed for chromosome  <dig> also in adult fibroblasts. the data for each specific shell from the different cell types was collated and compared using a one-way anova . the statistical analysis clearly shows no significant difference in the interphase positions of porcine chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x in each of the cell types. interestingly, when the lymphocyte data was removed from the one-way anova test, there were also no significant differences for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . it is notable that lymphocytes tended to have fewer chromosomes signal at the nuclear periphery  compared with any other cell type. the statistical analyses shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrate that, in general, the spatial positioning of whole chromosomes between the different cell types is generally conserved. 2d chromosome territory positioning analyses were confirmed in 3d fixed culture cells with a sub-set of chromosome paints .

statistical analysis of 2d fish data using one-way anova. data for each specific shell from the different cell types  was pooled and compared for each chromosome. key: s –significant; ns – not significant.

table shows detailed data from the statistically significant nuclear shells. the cell type that causes the statistical difference is highlighted accordingly in bold. the p value shows comparisons with each cell types excluding the statistically different shell using one-way anova.

this table displays comparisons between the chromosome territory positioning of actual porcine chromosomes from 2d fish in sob cells relative to predictions from synteny with human chromosomes, epigenetic markers, in silico gene data and chromosome size. this allows a comparison to show how the positioning of whole porcine chromosomes within the nucleus fit with the size and gene density theories of organisation.  <dig> synteny between the human and porcine genome  was used to predict the analogous porcine chromosome territory position from human chromosome territory data  <cit> .  <dig> the assignment of human epigenetic markers   <cit>  can be used through synteny studies as markers to predict the gene density of chromosomes. a projection of chromosome territory positioning can be made according to the gene-density theory of organisation, since more gene-rich chromosomes would be expected to occupy internal nuclear positions, and gene-poor chromosomes having more peripheral localities.  <dig> porcine epigenetic markers  were used to predict potential chromosome positioning according to the gene density theory of organisation. the last two columns show the chromosomes and their categorised nuclear locations in order of gene density and size. key, p – peripheral; i – intermediate; int – interior; eq – equally distributed.

chromosome positioning in 3d ex vivo tissue sections
the cultured cell types used to investigate chromosome territory organisation were all derived from mesodermal origin, and thus followed a similar differentiation pathway. this may account for the similarities in analogous chromosome territory positioning between the different cell types analysed. to investigate how genome organisation is influenced in cell types derived from divergent differentiation pathways, chromosome positioning was ascertained in tissues, namely kidney , lung , and brain  .

the nuclear positioning of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x was analysed. these chromosomes were chosen to represent different sizes of chromosome i.e. ssc  <dig>  ssc  <dig>  and ssc  <dig> and x for their behaviour in other cells i.e. ssc <dig> was found in a different nuclear position in each cell-type whereas x was always at the nuclear periphery. new methods were developed to perform 3d-fish with whole chromosome painting probes on porcine tissue. optical sections of the tissue were captured using confocal microscopy  and the digital images analysed in imaris. the distances of the centre of the chromosome territory to the nearest nuclear edge were measured and this measurement was normalised by the longest width of the nucleus. figure  <dig> demonstrates the relative nuclear position of these four chromosomes. the small chromosome  <dig> had a more intermediate/internal position in all of the tissue types examined. the other chromosomes, which include the large chromosomes  <dig> and the intermediate sized chromosomes x and  <dig>  were all located towards the nuclear periphery. this was confirmed via statistical analysis using an unpaired, unequal variance, two-tailed student t-test. comparison of the chromosome positions between the different tissue types, at the 95% confidence level showed no statistical difference in the nuclear positioning of chromosome territories for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or x in brain, kidney, or lung tissue sections.

discussion
attention has been focused towards mapping the position of whole porcine chromosome territories in interphase nuclei in a quest to understand further how and why the genome is organised in the way that it is, within the nuclear environment. in this study, the position of porcine chromosomes within interphase nuclei from a number of cell types was mapped and correlated to both gene density and size theory of chromosome positioning.

this study has determined that, like many other genomes studied, the porcine genome is highly organised into territories that are non-randomly positioned within the nucleus. indeed, this is the largest study so far to investigate porcine genome organisation and the nuclear positioning of porcine whole chromosomes. this study has mapped the position of the majority of porcine whole chromosome territories in a number of different cell types, surpassing that of any other species. it remains unclear however how chromosomes assume these nuclear positions.

existing evidence shows that there are correlations between the nuclear positioning of a chromosome and its gene density  <cit>  or size  <cit> . we have, for the purposes of this study, attempted to calculate the gene density of each chromosome via the distribution of porcine cpg islands  <cit> , h <dig> isochores  <cit> , using synteny to the human genome with respect to cpg island distribution, early and late replicating dna and the known nuclear positioning of syntenic chromosomes   <cit>  and via the current gene assignments mapped to porcine chromosomes on e!ensembl  , it should be noted that the genome has not yet been fully annotated. table  <dig> displays our predicted porcine chromosome territory interphase positioning according to these various estimates of gene density of each porcine chromosome or known positioning of human chromosomes in proliferating fibroblasts or lymphoblasts. with these correlations, less than half of the porcine chromosomes actual positions fit with the predicted positions. although the porcine genome has been sequenced, the assignment of a number of genes still needs to be determined.

in silico information with the current  number of genes mapped and predicted for the porcine genome derived from e!ensembl . each gene category has been added together to show the total number of genes assigned to each chromosome. the table shows individual porcine chromosome size in mbp  <cit>  and length sequenced in mbp. the predicted gene density of each chromosome was calculated by: the total number of genes/chromosome size. the higher the gene density value, the more gene dense the chromosome.

using the latest porcine genome information we have calculated a gene-density value for each chromosome by dividing the possible genes on each chromosome by the mbp size for that chromosome. these values range from  <dig>  for porcine chromosome  <dig> to  <dig>  for chromosome  <dig> . in table  <dig> we display the chromosomes and their categorised position in sob adult fibroblasts in descending order of gene density and the correlation between gene density and position is weak with the poorest gene dense chromosome being in the nuclear interior and the richest at the nuclear periphery. given that the genome sequencing is only near completion there may still be a gene density distribution that presently remains elusive. however, the correlation appears much more convincing for size with the three smallest chromosomes being found in the nuclear interior and the two largest chromosomes at the nuclear periphery. it should also be noted that these are proliferating cells but they are all in s-phase. for humans no difference in chromosome positioning for human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> was revealed in s-phase  <cit> .

our studies allowed comparison in the positioning of homologous chromosomes in kidney fibroblasts derived from both adult and embryonic tissue. it was revealed that chromosomes had comparable interphase nuclear locations. since cells from the embryonic lineage had already differentiated to kidney fibroblasts and followed the same differentiation pathway as the adult kidney fibroblasts, then similar chromosome positioning was perhaps likely.

the more interesting comparison perhaps is the comparison between the ex vivo lymphocytes and the tissue culture cells, since lymphocytes are derived from haemopoietic lineage and therefore may also exert distinct tissue specific control of genome organisation. despite over 95% of cultured lymphocytes being deficient in a-type lamins and the difference in stem cell lineage, the majority of chromosomes occupied similar nuclear locations. we did however note that we found less chromosome signal at the nuclear periphery in shell  <dig> for lymphocytes, which may be due to the role a-type lamins play in anchoring the genome to the nuclear periphery  <cit> . however, the amount of total chromatin as stained by dapi was not dissimilar to other cell types used in this study.

the use of pig tissues and development of a 3d fish protocol has allowed us also to perform pig chromosome territory delineation and position analysis in cells in 3d preserved frozen tissue sections. so to determine whether the spatial positioning of chromosomes within nuclei is tissue specific, the nuclear position of four porcine chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x were ascertained in three different tissues types including brain, kidney, and lung. although each tissue type arose from different origins  and contained specialised cells, analogous porcine chromosomes occupied equivalent interphase nuclear positions in each of the tissue types analysed. these data differed to a previous study that investigated genome organisation in nuclei derived from specific mouse tissues  <cit> . parada and colleagues found that although some chromosomes shared similar interphase nuclear positions, many exhibited a tissue specific organisation, particularly cells that followed divergent differentiation pathways  <cit> .

from this study it is apparent that chromosomes occupy similar interphase nuclear positions regardless of in vitro or in vivo conditions. comparisons between chromosome positioning of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x in cultured nuclei  and nuclei within ex vivo tissue sections, reveals that chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and x occupy peripheral positions, whereas chromosome  <dig> is localised at more internal nuclear locations . nuclear positioning data for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x verify that chromosomes share analogous nuclear positions between in vitro cultured nuclei and in vivo nuclei. however, variations in culture conditions, such as serum starvation, can substantially affect relative interphase chromosome positioning as demonstrated with human chromosomes becoming repositioned from a peripheral nuclear location to an internal location upon quiescence  <cit> . considering the possible influence of altered culture conditions on genome organisation, serum was removed from adult porcine fibroblasts cultures for several days in an effort to quiesce cells. unfortunately, we were unable to quiesce the cells via a decrease in serum levels to  <dig> % or via contact inhibition since apoptosis was induced and many cells were lost, a phenomenon previously reported in cultured pig cells  <cit> . therefore we could not determine if chromosome territories were repositioned within the nuclei in quiescent porcine cells. nevertheless, despite the proliferation status of in vivo cells in tissue sections being undetermined, equivalent chromosome positions within nuclei were exhibited regardless of their proliferation status. the brain is composed of two main cell types neurons and glial cells, with glial cells representing 90% of brain cells. brain cells are terminally differentiated and have ceased cell division  <cit> , however, despite their quiescent nature no alterations in the nuclear position of specific porcine chromosomes were ascertained. the conditions used to make in vitro cells quiescent, such as serum starvation or contact inhibition do not typically mimic in vivo conditions of quiescent cells. thus, in vitro quiescent cells may exhibit altered chromosome territory position due to specific signal transduction pathways not normally activated or silenced in in vivo cells. although the pig seems an excellent animal model it is also possible that species-specific differences may arise resulting in conflicting data. this is evident when using the mouse as a model for genome organisation. the mouse genome is uniform in size and gene density and chromosomes are positioned at different nuclear locations within mouse nuclei compared to the nuclear position of syntenic human chromosomes in human nuclei  <cit> .

in summary, the porcine genome is non-randomly organised with most chromosomes occupying similar nuclear positions despite developmental origin or lineage and regardless of being cultured in vitro or from in vivo tissue. from epigenetic data, projected gene assignments and chromosome size, it would appear presently that the porcine genome does not fit completely into either the size or gene-density model of chromosome positioning. we will assess gene-density correlated positioning again in the future when the porcine genome is well established. thus it appears that other parameters also influence the positioning of whole chromosomes within the nucleus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has established the pig as a model organism for genome organisation. the majority of porcine chromosomes have been positioned in a number of different cells types surpassing that of any other organisms. it has allowed comparison between in vivo and ex vivo material with respect to chromosome positioning and between cell types. it is thus an important study for the interphase genome organisation field but also for the porcine genome community.
