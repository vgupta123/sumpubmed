BACKGROUND
selecting elite parents is of paramount importance in cross- and hybrid-breeding programs. the selection of parents from a phalanx of inbred lines, however, is extremely laborious and time-consuming and can be random. adding to this complexity, parents with excellent agronomic traits do not always pass those traits on to their progeny. to evaluate breeding parents, sprague and tatum  introduced the concepts of general combining ability  and specific combining ability , which allow the study and comparison of the performances of inbred lines in hybrid combination. gca is used to designate the average performance of an inbred line in hybrid combination, and sca is used to designate those cases in which certain combinations do relatively better or worse than would be expected on the basis of the average performance of the lines involved  <cit> . gca and sca effects have been successfully used as criteria to evaluate elite parents in conventional crossbreeding and the performance of hybrid combinations.

since the introduction of the gca concept in  <dig>  very limited genetic studies on gca have been conducted even though gca is widely used in breeding programs for evaluation of the parents in early generations  <cit> . a few quantitative genetic loci with gca have been identified recently. qu et al. analyzed the qtls of  <dig> agronomic traits for gca using recombinant inbred line  populations with three testers in three testcross populations and a backcross recombinant inbred line  population of rice  <cit> . they detected a large number of additive effects of qtlgca loci. qi et al. found that several genetic loci responding for gca and sca for five yield-related traits using a set of testcrosses with introgression lines  of maize under different environmental conditions. total of  <dig> significant qtlgca loci have been mapped  <cit> . these studies have revealed that gca effects, like the traits, are genetically controlled. at the molecular level, however, how the phenotypes associated with gca effects are passed on to the f <dig> hybrids remains unknown.

high-throughput genome-wide analysis approaches such as microarray analysis and next generation sequencing have been used in the study of phenotypes such as hybrid vigor  <cit> . genome-wide gene expression profiles related to heterosis have been studied  <cit> . stupar et al. studied the gene expression profiles between maize f <dig> hybrids and their parents, and approximately 75% of the differentially expressed genes showed additive expression patterns between f <dig> hybrids and parents  <cit> . they studied the genetic diversity and transcriptional variation with different maize hybrids and found that the genetic diversity was correlated with transcriptional variation, and little  of the gene expression in f <dig> hybrids was outside the parental range  <cit> . wei et al. studied the gene expression profile between the super hybrid rice lyp <dig> and its parents and suggested that the differentially expressed genes might correlate with heterosis. moreover, riedelsheimer et al. have analyzed metabolic pathways in maize hybrids and were able to predict gca scores using genome-wide association analysis  <cit> . they have used  <dig> crosses derived from the diverse inbred lines of maize with two testers and predicted their combining ability for seven biomass- and bioenergy related traits using  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and  <dig> metabolites. the prediction accuracies were from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for snps and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for metabolites. a genome-wide analysis of the association between gca and gene expression profiles has not been investigated. the contribution of the elite parents with gca effects to their offspring also remains unexplored.

in the present study, we constructed a diallele crossing population with five rice parents and 10 f <dig> hybrids. we evaluated the gca effects of three agronomic traits related to grain yield, heading date, plant height and grain number from five elite rice varieties. the results showed that 93– <dig> and teqing  have positive gca effects, and guangluai 4# , aijiaonante  and zhenshan  <dig>  showed negative gca effects. the analysis of the transcriptome profiles of the leaves from three f <dig> hybrids, gl × 93- <dig>  gl × tq and 93-11 × tq, and their parents revealed that transcriptome profiles were correlated to the positive-gca-effects parent, showing obvious parental bias. further analysis found that the expression levels of most of the degs were obviously biased towards to the positive gca effect parent. analysis of the gene expression patterns of gibberellic acid  and flowering-time signaling pathways for plant height and flowering time validated the transcriptome bias to the positive gca effect parents. our results also indicated that the h3k36me <dig> modification showed bias to the positive gca effect parent and demonstrated that phenotypes of the positive gca effect parents were attributed to transcriptome bias. these results will be helpful in understanding the parental gene contribution to f <dig> hybrids and the molecular basis of gca.

RESULTS
evaluation of general combining ability of elite rice varieties
five inbred rice varieties representing different breeding objectives from the 1970s to the present were chosen. ten f <dig> hybrids were obtained from five varieties using a diallele crossing design . three important agronomic traits related to grain yield  were evaluated based on the phenotypes of f <dig> hybrids from the diallele crossing populations . the results revealed that the gca scores for the two rice varieties 93– <dig> and tq were positive, whereas negative gca scores were observed for the varieties gl, zs and aj . further analysis revealed that the phenotypes of the three agronomic traits in the f <dig> hybrids were always similar to or higher than 93– <dig> and tq, when either was used as one parent in the cross . in contrast, the phenotypes of f <dig> hybrids derived from gl , aj and zs  were significantly different compared to 93– <dig> and tq. the parental phenotypes were significantly correlated with the f <dig> hybrids crossed to 93– <dig> and tq  but less significantly with the f <dig> hybrids resulting from crosses to gl, zs and aj  . these results indicated that the gcas for the three agronomic traits relevant to grain yield in parents 93– <dig> and tq were significantly higher than those of the varieties gl, aj and zs.

p 
the phenotype bias toward the positive gca effect parent is attributable to transcriptome bias
as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  gl had an earlier heading date  and had a shorter plant height , whereas tq and 93– <dig> had later heading dates  and had a taller plant height . the heading dates  and plant heights  in the f <dig> hybrids derived from tq and 93– <dig> were obviously biased toward tq or 93– <dig>  to understand the relationship between the f <dig> phenotype and the positive gca effect parent, we conducted a transcriptome profile analysis of the three parents, gl, 93– <dig> and tq, and their three f <dig> hybrids, gl × 93- <dig>  gl × tq and 93-11 × tq, using rna sequencing technology   <cit> . a cluster analysis indicated that the transcriptomes of gl × tq and gl × 93- <dig> are similar to those of the positive gca effect parents, tq and 93– <dig>  respectively, and are significantly different from those of the negative gca effect parent gl . the transcriptome profile of 93-11 × tq was more similar to 93– <dig> that had the higher positive gca effect than to tq . the transcriptome similarity of the f <dig> hybrids to either the 93– <dig> or tq parent was consistent with the phenotypes of the three traits in 93– <dig> and tq. to explore the transcriptome profiles of the parents in the f <dig> hybrids, we analyzed the gene expression level in f <dig> hybrids. the results showed that  <dig> % of the gene expression profiles in gl × tq were similar to gl and  <dig> % were similar to tq . analogous results were found for the gl × 93- <dig> and 93-11 × tq  . of  <dig> % expressed genes in 93-11 × tq were similar to those in 93– <dig> and  <dig> % of the genes bias to tq . therefore, the phenotypes of the f1s derived from the positive gca effect parents are correlated with a transcriptome bias in the f1s.

differentially expressed genes in the f <dig> hybrids are those preferentially expressed in the positive gca effect parent
differentially expressed genes  have been recognized to play important biological functions in heterosis  <cit> . to explore whether degs contribute to the positive gca effect parent in the f <dig> hybrids, we analyzed the deg profiles from three f <dig> hybrids. a total of  <dig> - <dig>  genes were expressed in the f <dig> hybrids and their parents . we found that  <dig> % to  <dig> % genes were differentially expressed in the f <dig> hybrids comparing gl × tq, gl × 93- <dig> and 93-11 × tq with their parents, respectively  moreover,  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the degs between the f <dig> hybrids and the parents had similar expression levels to one parent . of these,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the gene expression levels were similar to the positive gca effect parents tq and 93– <dig> in gl × tq, gl × 93- <dig> and 93-11 × tq, respectively . the expression levels of the remaining genes were similar to the negative or lower gca effect parents gl and tq .  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the degs expression level in the f <dig> hybrids were out of the parental ranges, whereas  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the degs showed mid-parent expression levels, but showing significant difference to both parents . these results reveal that the expression levels of the majority of the degs were similar to those of the positive gca parent.

expression patterns of the genes in the regulatory pathways controlling flowering time and plant height in rice
to further support the observed correlation between the positive gca effect phenotype in the parent and transcriptome bias in the f <dig>  we chose the genes in two well-known signaling pathways controlling flowering time  and plant height in rice. the expression of early heading date <dig>  and early heading date <dig>  and repression of heading date <dig> , heading date3a  and rice flowering locus t <dig>  are activated in a cascade to initiate rice flowering  <cit> . expression of the rice pseudo-response regulators  <dig>  and grain number, plant height and heading date <dig>  involves a delay in the flowering time and an increase in the plant height and grain number  <cit> . we found that the expression levels of osprr <dig>  hd <dig> and ghd <dig> were very high in tq, 93– <dig>  gl × tq, gl × 93- <dig> and 93-11 × tq versus gl . by contrast, the expression levels of rft <dig>  hd3a, ehd <dig> and ehd <dig> were higher in gl . these results showed that the expression patterns of the flowering regulation genes were consistent with transcriptome bias towards the positive gca effect parents in the f <dig> hybrids.

the expression patterns of the other set of genes involved in gibberellic acid  metabolism and the signaling pathway that controls plant height in rice were also analyzed between f1s and parents  <cit>  . in plants, bioactive gas are synthesized from the precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase  and ent-kaurene synthase , followed by ent-kaurene oxidase  and ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase . at the final stage, ga20-oxidase  and ga3-oxidase  catalyze the conversion of ga53/ga <dig> and ga1/ga <dig>  the bioactive gas and the precursors elongated the uppermost internode and were deactivated by ga2-oxidase  and   <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  three genes, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase , ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase  and ga2-oxidase  <dig>  had the higher expression levels in tq, 93– <dig>  gl × tq, gl × 93- <dig> than in gl. in contrast, expression levels of the other three genes, ga3ox <dig> and ga20ox <dig> were less in tq, 93– <dig>  gl × tq, gl × 93- <dig> and 93-11 × tq than in gl. the expression profiles of those genes exactly matched the feedback and feed-forward regulation mechanism of gas synthesis  <cit> . our results are consistence with the results reported in wheat hybrids  <cit> . the results again demonstrated that the expression patterns of the genes corresponding to plant height exhibited a bias toward the positive gca effect parents. taken together, the data validated the transcriptome bias toward the positive gca effect parents through individual metabolism pathways for plant height and heading date in rice and further demonstrated that the phenotype bias to the positive gca effect parent in f <dig> hybrids is due to the transcriptome bias toward the positive gca effect parents.

transcriptome bias toward the positive gca effect parent regulated by h3k36me <dig> modifications
previous studies have described the histone modifications involved in the regulation of the transcriptome  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that the trimethylation of histone h <dig> on lysine  <dig>  in gene body represses gene expression  <cit>  and trimethylated histone h <dig> on lysine  <dig>  in the gene body activated gene expression  <cit> . to further explore the mechanism of transcriptome bias to the positive gca effect parent in f <dig> hybrids, we analyzed the patterns of methylation at h3k36me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in f <dig> hybrids. genome-wide histone modifications of h3k36me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in gl × 93- <dig>  gl × tq and their parents, gl, 93– <dig> and tq, were analyzed with the aid of a dna library prepared after chromatin immunoprecipitation . the results showed  <dig> %- <dig> % genes were overlapped between h3k36me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> modifications. however, an obvious parental bias of h3k36me <dig> modification was detected. in gl × 93- <dig>   <dig> % of the genes with h3k36me <dig> modifications were similar to 93– <dig> , whereas  <dig> % were similar to gl  .  <dig> % of h3k36me <dig> modifications in gl × tq were found to prefer tq , and  <dig> % of h3k36me <dig> preferred gl . for h3k27me <dig> modifications,  <dig> % of the genes in gl × 93- <dig> with modifications were similar to gl , and  <dig> % were biased to 93– <dig>  . in gl × tq,  <dig> % genes with the h3k27me <dig> modifications preferred tq , whereas only  <dig> % of h3k27me <dig> modifications were biased to gl  . there was no significant correlation of h3k27me <dig> between positive gca effect and negative gca effect parents in two f <dig> hybrids. taken together, the results indicated that h3k36me <dig> modifications exhibited a bias toward the positive gca effect parent in the f <dig> hybrids, which suggested that epigenetic regulation could involve regulation of the phenotypes and transcriptome bias toward positive gca effect parents.

furthermore, we analyzed the modification patterns of cryptochrome  <dig> , pseudo-response regulator  <dig> and  <dig>  in f <dig> hybrids . these genes are involved in the regulation of rice flowering time and adaptability. cry <dig> is a photolyase-like blue-light receptor that mediates light responses in plants via interaction with the cib <dig>  protein to promote cry2-dependent floral initiation  <cit> . the prr <dig> gene is involved in the down-regulation of hd3a gene expression to suppress flowering under long-day conditions. the varieties harboring nonfunctional alleles of prr <dig> flower extremely early under natural, long-day conditions  <cit> . we found that the h3k36me <dig> modification levels of three genes in gl × 93- <dig> or gl × tq biased toward the positive gca effect parents, tq or 93– <dig> . the results are consistent with the heading date phenotype bias toward high gca effect parents in the f <dig>  again, our data demonstrated that the phenotype and transcriptome biased toward the positive gca effect parents were epigenetically regulated by both global modification and specific signaling pathways in rice.

discussion
the gca concept has been studied for more than 70 years  <cit> . it has being successfully applied in crop and livestock breeding for the evaluation of parent performance  <cit> . however, in spite of this, the genetic analysis of the gca is very limited  <cit> , and the molecular mechanism of the gca has not been documented. in the present study, we found that certain phenotypes in rice f <dig> hybrids were always biased toward the positive gca effect parents in the traits tested . further studies showed that the transcriptome profiles in f <dig> hybrids were the same as phenotypes that are biased to the parents with positive gca effect. the expression patterns of individual genes corresponding to plant height and flowering time demonstrated that the phenotype bias toward the positive gca effect parent is attributed to the transcriptome profile and the specific epigenetic modification. our data revealed that the phenotype bias in f <dig> hybrids could be attributed to transcriptome and h3k36me <dig> modification bias. our findings provide molecular clues as to why and how the positive gca effect parent has been widely used for crop and livestock improvement in breeding programs for half a century.

although gca is widely recognized and applied to crop and livestock improvement by breeders, it is based largely on breeding experiences, and therefore, it highly is unpredictable. our findings provide molecular evidence of gca through transcriptome and epi-genome analysis. this study first revealed that the transcriptome and epigenome in rice f <dig> hybrids are similar to the parent with the positive gca performance, but significantly different from the negative gca effect parents. we also found that the positive gca effect parents showed better performance with regard to agronomic traits in f <dig> hybrids compared to the negative gca effect parents. in the previous studies, a large number of genetic loci with dominance effect were detected in f <dig> hybrids  <cit> . eqtl analysis revealed that the gene expression regulation was an complicated regulation networks  <cit> . so, the phenomena of the phenotypes and the transcriptomes biased to high gca parents in f <dig> hybrids might be consequence of the accumulation of the loci with dominance effect in the elite parents through artificial selection. our results suggested that the transcriptomes profile in f <dig> hybrids could be optimized during elite parent selection, which give rise to elite agronomic traits, such as increase of biomass and grain yield. during the parent improvement process, these alleles corresponding to the agronomic traits satisfying different breeding objectives had been selected or kept. for instance, a representative elite variety of gl that met the breeding objectives of more panicle and less grain number per panicle had been developed in the 1970s in china. later, an ideal plant type that has less panicle numbers and more spikelet per panicle was raised, and the breeding objectives of higher grain yields required high biomass that was due to later heading date and higher plant height. to meet the requirements of the breeding objective, the alleles corresponding to late heading date and higher plant height were accumulated and optimized through artificial selection pressure. therefore, the modern elite parent 93– <dig> has a longer flowering time and taller plant height that produces higher biomass resulting in higher grain yield. consequently, the alleles corresponding to later flowering time and taller plant height were selected and maintained in the genome of the elite parent. our results again demonstrated the significance of selecting elite parents with excellent gca performance in crossbreeding program.

several studies have indicated that the mechanism of the allelic-specific expression could be regulated by epigenetic modification, including dna methylation and various histone modifications  <cit> . previous studies have detected maternal alleles for some imprinted genes were hypomethylated in the endosperm, which contributed to the parent-of-origin expression pattern in reciprocal hybrids in maize <cit> . however, very few parent-of-origin effects were detected in plant vegetative tissues  <cit> . our global gene expression analysis has not found any parent-of-origin genes, but almost of genes expression in rice leaves showed as genotype-dependent fashion  <cit> . in present work, the specific genes involved in plant height and circadian rhythms are matched to phenotype bias as well, suggesting that epigenetic regulation is highly selective and complicated. limited data obtained in the present work may have led to finding the h3k36me <dig> modification only on the partial genes that were associated with the gca effect, and these modifications did not match the expression level of the genes analyzed. the results of h3k27me <dig> modification profile biased to tq in gl × tq, but not bias in another f <dig> hybrids gl × 93- <dig> suggested that epigenetic modifications could be dynamic changes depending on genetic backgrounds, developmental stage, environment etc. therefore, more research into epigenetic modifications, such as other histone modifications, acetylation and dna methylation, are needed to fully understand the genome-wide regulation network.

extensive studies have revealed that a large number of genes exhibited differential expression level between f <dig> hybrids and their parents  <cit> . however, the regulation of gene expression profiles in the heterozygous state remains unknown. our data revealed that the positive gca effect parent in the f <dig> hybrids could determine the phenotypes of the important agronomic traits, such as plant height and heading date. plant height and heading date are very important agronomic traits that affect rice grain yield  <cit> . regulation of the genes in the signal transduction pathway and syntheses of metabolic products have been reported to occur through snps in these gene sequences that could be optimized to the gene expression profiles in elite varieties  <cit> . our results indicated that the phenotypes of parental bias in f <dig> hybrids could be the consequence of transcriptome profile or some specific gene expression level.

one of the most important characteristics of the elite parent with high gca effect is its wide adaptability. the wide adaptability of the elite parent could be due to both photoperiod and temperature neutral in order to adapt different ecological environments. therefore, rice plant could maintain a constant growth period so that it can develop higher biomass and grain yield in different ecological environments. previous study has reported the osprr <dig> had involved in the regulation network of the adaptability to grow in different latitudes  <cit> . in present work, we found the h3k36me <dig> modification patterns of the osprr gene family, osprr <dig> and osprr <dig>  showed similar patterns in f <dig> hybrids, high gca parents 93– <dig> and tq. the results indicated that the specific modification patterns of h3k36me <dig> in high gca parents might contribute to the adaptability for elite parents and their offsprings. it is reasonable to assume that the prr gene family could play an important role in controlling the adaptability of an elite parent that is responsible for gca effects in rice.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here revealed that the transcriptome profiles and degs in the f1s were highly related to phenotype bias to the positive gca-effect parent. the transcriptome bias was also demonstrated by analyzing the genes that controlling the specific phenotypes of plant height and flowering and h3k36me <dig> modification on global modification or specific signaling pathways. our results indicated the molecular basis of gca is both on transcriptome and epigenetic level.
