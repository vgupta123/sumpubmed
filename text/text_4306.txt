BACKGROUND
a particularly devastating complication of hiv infection is a pervasive form of damage to the brain, had  <cit> . the overall incidence of severe had is estimated at about 30% of the hiv infected population  <cit> . however, had occurs more often in hiv-positive iv drug users than hiv-positive non-drug users  <cit> . neuroimaging and autopsy studies demonstrate that the basal ganglia and frontal lobes are preferentially affected by had  <cit> . these structures may degenerate with chronic psychostimulant  abuse  <cit> , eventually leading to a parkinson type syndrome  <cit> . injection of abused drugs, such as cocaine, has been noted to accelerate the progression of hiv infection to aids status and to had  <cit> .

in the united states, cocaine use plays a larger role in hiv transmission to women than it does to men  <cit> . hiv infected women have lower initial viral loads than men, progress to aids status at the same rate as men, yet have higher mortality and lower life expectancy than men  <cit> . how sex differences contribute to the progression to had is largely unknown. however, female gender or estrogenic steroids are recognized as protective against several neurological insults, including animal models of ischemia, oxidative stress, and psychostimulant-induced neurotoxicity  <cit>  and human neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease  <cit>  and parkinson's disease  <cit> . tissue culture studies have found that the estrogenic steroid, 17β-e <dig>  is protective against neurotoxic hiv proteins  <cit> . collectively, these gender/hormonal effects suggest that gonadal hormones may play a differential role in effects of drug abuse, hiv infection, and had.

neurotoxic interactions between the hiv proteins, tat and gp <dig>  and abused psychostimulant drugs have been previously reported  <cit> . more recently, 17β-e <dig> proved neuroprotective in vitro  <cit> ; however, it is unknown whether this neuroprotection is specifically estrogenic, or also effected by prog, and whether it contains an androgenic component. therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine which gonadal steroids provide neuroprotection against the synergistic neurotoxicity of hiv proteins in the presence of cocaine. we investigated the potential for neuroprotection by t, whether this is mediated through an er mechanism and the potential concentration-dependent neuroprotection by prog, dht and cholesterol.

we report here concentration dependent neuroprotection by t mediated through an ici  <dig> -sensitive mechanism. incomplete neuroprotection at the concentrations  tested was also provided by prog, dht, and cholesterol.

RESULTS
17β-, not 17α-estradiol, protects against hiv proteins plus cocaine synergistic neurotoxicity
clear and robust synergistic neurotoxicity of the hiv proteins tat and gp  <dig> was repeatedly observed when combined with a physiologically relevant dose of cocaine . false color visualization of the intensity of trypan blue within neurons verified the assay for cell death and demonstrated the synergistic toxicity of cocaine with the hiv proteins . furthermore, this neurotoxicity is precluded by pretreatment with  <dig> nm dose of 17β-e <dig>  but not with 17α-e <dig>  neither the hiv proteins, tat plus gp <dig>  nor cocaine alone were more toxic than the locke's buffer control; however, in combination they produced synergistic neurotoxicity . the anova confirmed the presence of a significant interaction of the hiv proteins with cocaine  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n =  <dig> each point) . the presence of this significant neurotoxic effect was demonstrated in every experiment at p <  <dig> . the stereoisomers of estradiol demonstrated a significant treatment effect against this toxicity  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). the 17β-stereoisomer of estradiol demonstrated significant neuroprotection  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n = at least  <dig> each point). the percent neuronal death with 17α-e <dig> treatment was not significantly different from the synergistic toxicity control .

dmso at  <dig> nm  served as the solvent for 17α-e <dig> and for ici- <dig> ; therefore, it was tested for toxicity and was not significantly different from locke's buffer incubation . β-cyclodextrin  served as an encapsulating carrier to enhance solubility for the steroids 17β-e <dig>  t, prog and cholesterol and was therefore tested for neuroprotection. when coincubated with the toxic combination of hiv proteins plus cocaine, this carrier also had no significant effect on cell death .

progesterone provides partial neuroprotection against hiv proteins plus cocaine synergistic neurotoxicity
to study the effect of prog on hiv protein and cocaine synergistic toxicity we treated cultures with  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, and  <dig> nm doses of prog prior to adding the toxic combination of hiv proteins and cocaine . prog demonstrated significant neuroprotection  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n =  <dig> each point). there was no concentration-dependent effect on percent neuronal death  <  <dig> ). further, the neuroprotection was incomplete at these concentrations as the magnitude of cell death was significantly greater than that observed with locke's buffer control . fig.  <dig> left panel shows the significant interaction of the hiv proteins with cocaine confirming the presence of synergistic neurotoxicity  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n =  <dig> each point;).

testosterone completely protects against hiv proteins plus cocaine synergistic neurotoxicity
concentrations of  <dig> pm,  <dig> pm,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm of t were tested against the synergistically neurotoxic combination of hiv proteins and cocaine . a significant interaction of the hiv proteins with cocaine  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n = at least  <dig> each point) confirmed the presence of synergistic neurotoxicity . t treatment provided significant neuroprotection  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n = at least  <dig> each point). specifically, there was a concentration-dependent effect of t with a significant linear decrease in percent neuronal death as a function of increasing dose  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) . the neuroprotective effect of t was characterized against the negative control of locke's buffer vehicle and the positive control of the synergistically toxic combination of hiv proteins with cocaine. a ceiling effect of maximal neuroprotection at t concentrations of  <dig> nm or greater, was noted; magnitude of cell death was not significantly different from incubation with locke's buffer vehicle. a floor effect was identified at the lowest concentrations tested,  <dig> pm or less, with the magnitude of cell death not significantly different from that observed by the toxic synergism of the hiv proteins with cocaine.

dihydrotestosterone provides limited neuroprotection against hiv proteins plus cocaine synergistic neurotoxicity
dht, the androgen receptor  active metabolite of t, was tested for neuroprotection in the linear range of the t concentration-effect curve,  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, against the toxic synergism of hiv proteins with cocaine . dht treatment was confirmed to provide significant neuroprotection  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n = at least  <dig> each point). however, there was no concentration-dependent effect on percent neuronal death  < <dig> ). further, the neuroprotection was incomplete across these concentrations as the magnitude of cell death was significantly greater than that observed with locke's buffer control  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) . because the dht treatments were run in parallel with the t concentration effects, the control values are the same for both sets of treatments. that is, the presence of synergistic neurotoxicity was indicated by the same significant interaction of the hiv proteins with cocaine  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) as it was for the t treatments . ethanol at  <dig> nm  served as the solvent for dht; therefore, it was tested for toxicity and was found not to differ significantly from locke's buffer incubation .

ici- <dig>  blocks testosterone's neuroprotection against hiv proteins plus cocaine synergistic neurotoxicity
the cultures were pretreated with the specific er antagonist, ici- <dig>  at  <dig> nm before addition of t  then challenged with the hiv proteins plus cocaine synergistic toxicity . a significant interaction of ici- <dig>  with t was observed  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n = at least  <dig> each point). importantly, the ici compound was not more toxic to the cultures than was locke's buffer; nor was it neuroprotective against the toxic challenge. t at  <dig> nm provided neuroprotection  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), which was not significantly different from incubation with locke's buffer vehicle alone. this neuroprotective effect of t was fully blocked by pretreatment of the cultures with ici- <dig>   . a significant interaction of the hiv proteins with cocaine indicated the presence of synergistic neurotoxicity  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n =  <dig> each point) .

cholesterol provides concentration dependent neuroprotection against hiv proteins plus cocaine synergistic neurotoxicity
cholesterol was added to the cultures at concentrations of  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm, and  <dig> nm prior to treatment with the synergistic toxic combination of hiv proteins plus cocaine . significant neuroprotection by cholesterol against this synergistic toxicity was observed  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ; n = at least  <dig> each point) . there was a concentration-dependent effect of cholesterol with a significant linear decrease in percent neuronal death as concentration increased  =  <dig> . <dig>  p <  <dig> ). the neuroprotection afforded by the high dose  of cholesterol was asymptotic to a ceiling effect; the magnitude of cell death was not significantly different from that observed by locke's buffer incubation. because the cholesterol treatments were performed concurrently with the ici- <dig>  treatments, the control values are the same for both sets of treatments. the presence of synergistic neurotoxicity was indicated by the same significant interaction of the hiv proteins with cocaine as it was for the ici- <dig>  treatments  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) .

discussion
neuroprotection is clearly afforded by physiological concentrations of 17β-e <dig> in this human fetal neuronal model of gp <dig> and tat hiv protein neurotoxic synergism with cocaine  <cit> . in the current studies, we have replicated and extended these findings to examine the ability of other gonadal steroids to provide neuroprotection against this combined insult. we now show robust neuroprotection mediated through the er is provided by t while prog, dht and cholesterol provide only partial or incomplete neuroprotection in the same concentration range.

there are at least two mechanisms for the neuroprotective actions of estradiol: receptor mediated cellular events; and non-receptor mediated anti-oxidant effects. stereo-specific neuroprotection by estradiol  suggests a receptor-mediated mechanism rather than global scavenging of reactive oxygen species  by the phenolic ring. both of the estradiol stereoisomers, but not prog, t, dht, nor cholesterol contain the phenolic moiety of estradiol. in contradiction to our results, neuroprotection by neutralization of ros would be exhibited by both estradiol isomers but not the other steroid compounds tested. moreover, the phenolic ring's efficacy in quenching ros usually requires higher concentrations than needed for receptor-mediated activity  <cit> . our data suggest that there is a specific er modulation of the neurotoxic cascade preventing neural death, rather than nonspecific scavenging of ros by estrogens.

in these studies, the neurons were exposed to estrogens for  <dig> hours. this time course  does not preclude estrogen-mediated genomic activity; however, estrogens are known to act through both genomic and non-genomic pathways  <cit> . nevertheless, the lack of effect by the transcriptionally inactive stereoisomer of estradiol  provides evidence for a genomic neuroprotective mechanism. neuroprotection by 17α-e <dig> has been reported in human neuronal cultures  <cit> . this neuroprotection, which was not seen in our model, was realized in some non-genomic manner such as activation of signal transduction. research reports also support three other non-genomic actions of steroids that may protect neurons from toxic insults  <cit> : 1) an indirect effect due to structural and functional perturbation of membrane properties by the intercalation of the cholesterol moiety comprising the steroids; 2) a direct activation of membrane-bound steroid specific protein recognition sites; and 3) modulation of classical neurotransmitter receptor activity. furthermore, neuroprotection conferred by an individual agent may not be attributable to a single mode of action. all steroid hormones, including 17α-e <dig>  might be expected to modulate neurotransmission by altering the relative steroidal composition of the neuronal membrane. since 17α-e <dig> failed to show neuroprotection, these nonspecific membrane effects are ruled out, but activity at a membrane receptor or modulation of neurotransmitter activity is not. we tested six steroids  at physiologically relevant nanomolar  concentrations against the synergistic neurotoxic challenge to delineate neuroprotection by steroids in this model of had, while considering that each steroid may operate by different as well as pleiotropic means.

treatments with prog may be neuroprotective  <cit> . the neuroprotective capability of prog in the physiological range  <cit>  was also exhibited against our neurotoxic challenge . although prog's neuroprotection was significant, it was incomplete in the nm concentration range tested, as prog was significantly different from the negative control . the linear regression analysis confirmed the significance of the neuroprotection. however, prog as well as some of its metabolites are known to act both as agonists at the intracellular and membrane prog receptors and as allosteric modulators of some neurotransmission  <cit> .

in contrast, t  produced neuroprotection of a similar magnitude to that achieved by 17β-e <dig> . a log plot of the data  describes a linear function between  <dig> pm and  <dig> nm. no protection is seen at  <dig> pm, whereas concentrations above  <dig> nm show maximal protection, thus establishing the ec <dig> for the neuroprotective effect of t between  <dig> pm and  <dig> nm. the pharmacokinetics of a concentration-dependent effect are consistent with a receptor-mediated mechanism of neuroprotection. because t can be aromatized to estradiol by p <dig> aromatase expressed by astrocytes  <cit>  and by neurons  <cit>  in rat brain, it is not entirely surprising to see a robust neuroprotective effect of t, as was seen with 17β-e <dig>  such neuroprotection could be produced through activation of the er. therefore, the question remained whether an androgenic component to the presumptive steroid receptor-mediated neuroprotection is operating.

t is not specific in identifying the receptor mediating its effects because it is the prohormone for both dht, the principal ligand at the ar, and 17β-e <dig>  the principal ligand at the er. dht is a useful androgen for evaluating the relative contributions of ar and er-mediated neuroprotective effects because it does not serve as an agonist at the er nor can it be converted to estradiol. our toxic challenge test results with dht suggest that the ar may mediate neuroprotection, but do not exclude the possibility of effects by other means . to clarify whether t was acting at the ar or the er, we used the specific er antagonist, ici- <dig> , while treating the cultures with t and the toxic combination of hiv proteins and cocaine. the er antagonist completely blocked t's neuroprotection thus demonstrating that the effect is mediated through the er  at physiological concentrations  <cit> . if an ar-mediated component were active in t's neuroprotection it would have been revealed when t was tested while the er was pharmacologically blocked by ici- <dig> . therefore, we conclude that t's neuroprotection is mediated through the er with no portion attributable to ar activation or to non-genomic pathways.

as a control for general steroidal structural and receptor activation we tested cholesterol, which is known to modulate membrane fluidity but is neurally inactive. we saw that cholesterol's concentration-dependent neuroprotection against synergistic toxicity of the hiv proteins with cocaine is more efficacious than that of prog and dht  in that  <dig> nm cholesterol was fully neuroprotective whereas the same dose of prog or dht was not. however, cholesterol is less potent than the gonadal steroids, 17β-e <dig> and t in that  <dig> nm cholesterol was not fully neuroprotective, whereas the same dose of the steroids was. the mechanism of this protection is interesting because the cholesterol moiety is common to all steroids, but 17α-e <dig> was not neuroprotective. furthermore, the ici- <dig> -sensitive neuroprotection provided by t does not accommodate a nonspecific cholesterol-mediated component. in this model, cholesterol may not promote neuronal survival by any intrinsic activity of its own, but may be serving as a synthesis precursor for an explicitly protective steroid, e.g., 17β-e <dig>  others have also shown increased bioavailability of cholesterol to interact with effects mediated by steroids in the brain  <cit> . evidence for all the necessary enzymes of synthesis in human brain has been reported  <cit>  except for one, which has been identified in rat brain  <cit> . because we use primary cell cultures derived from human fetal brain, it is likely that the metabolic machinery is present, operational and facilitating cholesterol's neuroprotection through an estrogenic end product. in support of our findings, neuroprotection by locally synthesized estrogen has recently been demonstrated  <cit> , which when considered with the current findings, suggests possibilities for steroid prodrugs serving as neuroprotective therapeutics. however, others have demonstrated that cholesterol significantly reduces the neurotoxicity of gp <dig> by modulating membrane fluidity. in human neuroblastoma cells enriching cholesterol significantly reduced gp <dig> binding and consequently, the biochemical events triggered by the viral protein leading to necrotic death, while depleting cholesterol had the opposite effect  <cit> . therefore the physiochemical properties of the membrane in mediating neurotoxicity/protection may be as significant as some pharmacological agents.

synergistic neurotoxicity of the hiv proteins gp <dig> and tat with cocaine was demonstrated in each experiment. although neither the hiv protein combination nor cocaine alone was more neurotoxic than the locke's buffer media, the simultaneous incubation of cells with both the hiv proteins and cocaine produced significant neuronal death. the mechanism by which cocaine facilitates the hiv protein toxicity is not well characterized. recombinant variants of tat protein  are known to induce neuronal degeneration by mechanisms that involve triggering of apoptotic cascades  <cit> . cocaine was recently shown to enhance gp <dig> induced neuronal apoptosis in vivo via a mechanism implicating glutamate excitotoxicity and inos expression with abnormal no production in the neocortex of rat  <cit> . in vitro work in our lab with rat hippocampal cells supports a similar mechanism for cocaine's enhancement of tat mediated toxicity by augmentation of ros production and mitochondrial depolarization  <cit> . likewise cocaine at very high concentrations in vitro may induce neuronal apoptosis  <cit> . accordingly, estrogen neuroprotection could be via stimulation of the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins  <cit> , or alternatively suppression of pro-apoptotic gene transcripts  <cit> , although both of these interesting possibilities await further experimentation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we demonstrated that t provides neuroprotection through an ici- <dig> -sensitive mechanism against the synergistic toxicity of gp <dig> and tat hiv proteins with cocaine. additionally, we show that prog, dht and cholesterol provide some less efficacious neuroprotection than do the steroids, 17β-e <dig> and t. it is conceivable that gonadal steroids may provide biologically based gender-specific prophylaxis and/or amelioration either in the time of onset or symptomology of had and drugs of abuse. these results have implications for the innovation of therapeutic strategies, including steroid based neuroprotective prodrugs. moreover, given that the neuropathology of had may have commonalities with dementias of other etiologies, the development of successful pharmacology for had would surely have applications for other equally devastating and costly neurodegenerative conditions.
