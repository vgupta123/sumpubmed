BACKGROUND
rapidly growing mycobacteria  infections in immunocompetent persons, as well as in persons with predisposing factors or who are immunosuppressed, are being reported more frequently  <cit> . particularly, of the rgms, mycobacterium abscessus − complex is commonly associated with wound infections and abscess formation and is the most frequent rgm causing chronic lung disease  <cit> . recent application of the combinatorial taxonomy including biochemical tests, anti-microbial susceptibility test, and multi-locus sequencing approach have suggested that the m. abscessus − complex is actually subdivided into three species: mycobacterium abscessus subsp. abscessus, m abscessus subsp. massiliense, and m. abscessus subsp. bolletii; which exhibit clinically relevant differences in their antibiotic sensitivity profiles  <cit> . in south korea, infection by members of the m. abscessus − complex is the most prevalent of rgm infections and second to the m. avium − complex of non-tuberculous mycobacteria   <cit> .

ntm has long been known to have both rough and smooth colony phenotypes  <cit> . this may be due mainly to the expression levels of glycopeptidolipids . gpls are produced by several ntms, including rgms, such as m. abscessus, m. chelonae and m. smegmatis,  <cit>  and m. avium − complex  members, such as m. avium and m. intracellulare <cit> . gpls are responsible for smooth colonies and contribute to colonization of ntms in the environment via biofilm formation; while, loss of gpls is correlated with rough colonies and facilitates survival in macrophages  <cit> .

in the m. abscessus − complex strains, smooth phenotypes have occasionally spontaneously reverted to rough morphotypes after several passages on agar plates or via in vivo passage into mice  <cit> . it was reported that there is a positive correlation between colony morphology and virulence, with rough variants generally being more virulent than smooth variants  <cit> . this may be due primarily to the reduced expression of gpl, resulting in excessive secretion of tnf-α by the macrophage  <cit> . recently, targeted deletion of a gene, mmpl4b, in the m. abscessus is also reported to lead to loss of gpl and to show enhanced invasive abilities  <cit> .

a recent molecular epidemiology study based on partial hsp <dig> sequences  indicated that m. massiliense  of m. abscessus complex strains was more prevalent than m. abscessus  in south korea  <cit> . interestingly, infections in  <dig> of  <dig> korean patients  with m. massiliense, were found to be caused by a distinct type ii genotype not encountered in other areas  <cit> .

the most characteristic feature of this novel genotype is that all its strains showed the rough colony morphotype. this suggests that its rough colony phenotype may be due to an irreversible genetic factor rather than the reversible spontaneous reversion from smooth to rough morphotype previously introduced as a major mechanism for acquisition of the rough phenotype in m. abscessus − complex strains  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to prove our hypothesis that the rough colony phenotype of the new m. massiliense type ii genotype may be genetically determined. for this purpose, we first compared the gpl biosynthesis related gene loci of m. massiliense asan  <dig>  belonging to the type ii genotype for which we recently provided a complete genome, with those of other rgms  <cit> . second, to check whether gpl deletion is distinct for m. massiliense type ii genotype of m. abscessus − complex strains, pcr assays for the detection of gpl deletions were applied to the m. abscessus complex clinical strains, including a variety of groups.

RESULTS
differences between gpl expression patterns of m. massiliense type i and type ii strains
to check out the differences in the gpl expression patterns of m. massiliense type i and type ii strains, purified gpls were examined and analyzed using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry . pronounced differences in the maldi-tof ms profiles were found between the gpls of the two genotypes. in the case of m. massiliense type i strain asan  <dig>  the maldi-tof ms profiles showed two distinct clusters of peaks ranging from m/z  <dig> to m/z  <dig> and from m/z  <dig> to m/z  <dig>  corresponding to diglycosylated gpl and triglycosylated gpl, respectively . all four of the other type i strains also showed maldi-tof mass spectrometry profiles similar to strain  <dig> . however, the maldi-tof ms profiles of gpls from m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig>  were showed unusual, with significantly lower intensity of the peaks corresponding to the putative gpls, compared to the profiles of the type i strains . also, all four of the other type ii strains showed maldi-tof ms profiles similar to strain  <dig> . this means that there was loss of gpls in the cell wall components of the m. massiliense type ii strains.

comparative genomic analysis of the gpl biosynthesis related locus
to check out whether the gpl loss in m. massiliense type ii is genetically determined or not, we performed comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> gpl biosynthesis related genes  from m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig>  and four other rgms,   <cit> .

when compared with m. abscessus cip 104536t and m. massiliense ccug 48898t, or m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig>  the percentage of identity of amino acids between  <dig> strains ranges between  <dig> and 100% . similar to the m. abscessus cip 104536t, m. massiliense ccug 48898t or m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig> have gpl biosynthesis related genes which were divided into two clusters. in the genome of m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig>  one cluster of ~ <dig> kbp covering  <dig> genes , one cluster of ~ <dig> kbp covering  <dig> genes  and five distributed genes  were found among the gpl-biosynthesis related genes. interestingly, compared to other rgms, there are no counterparts of  <dig> gpl biosynthesis related genes in the genome of m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig> . all the deleted genes were found in the region corresponding to the first larger gpl cluster in m. abscessus cip 104536t or m. massiliense ccug 48898t. genes atf <dig> and atf <dig>  which are responsible for acetylation  <cit> ; gtf <dig> and gtf <dig>  which are involved in the glycosylation of the lipopeptide core  <cit> ; rmt <dig>  rmt <dig>  and rmt <dig>  which are involved in the o-methylation of the various hydroxyl groups of the rhamnosyl unit; fmt, which is also involved in the o-methylation of the lipid moiety  <cit> ; and mps <dig> and mps <dig>  which are responsible for assembling the tripeptide-aminoalcohol moiety  <cit> , were deleted from the gpl locus of m. massiliense type ii asan  <dig> .

considering that gpls are related to formation of smooth colonies, these deletions represent the phenotypic characteristics of m. massiliense type ii, which only occurred in rough colonies  <cit> .

pcr confirmation of gpl biosynthesis related genes from m. massiliense and m. abscessus clinical isolates
to check the presence of the gpl biosynthesis related genes from m. massiliense and m. abscessus clinical isolates, dnas from 76 m. abscessus related strains were amplified by pcrs using  <dig> primer sets , which targets  <dig> deleted genes in asan  <dig> genome: atf <dig>  atf <dig>  fmt, gtf <dig>  gtf <dig>  rmt <dig>  rmt <dig>  rmt <dig>  mps <dig>  and mps <dig> and  <dig> conserved genes as pcr positive controls: gap and rmlb genes, which were found in the genome of all m. abscessus related strains including asan  <dig>  of  <dig> strains,  <dig> strains of m. massiliense type ii were not amplified by pcrs targeting  <dig> deleted genes in asan  <dig> genome, but amplified by pcrs targeting  <dig> conserved genes, suggesting the loss of corresponding gpl genes in all 21 m. massiliense type ii strains. but, all the remaining  <dig> strains were positively amplified by pcrs targeting  <dig> deleted genes as well as  <dig> conserved genes, suggesting the presence of targeted gpl biosynthesis genes in their genome. it should be noted that all the  <dig> strains with rough colony morphotype  except for m. massiliense type ii produced positive amplifications in pcrs targeting  <dig> deleted genes, suggesting there may be the disparity between m. massiliense type ii and other related strains in mechanism leading to rough colony phenotype .

discussion
infection by m. massiliense strains of rgms has gained importance together with its increasing prevalence over the world  <cit> . in particular, a recent study based on whole genome sequencing revealed the first evidence of human to human transmission in ntm infection, by proving its transmission between cystic fibrosis patients; suggesting unusually high infectivity of humans by m. massiliense strains  <cit> . in south korea, a distinct epidemiologic trend was reported  <cit> , of higher prevalence of m. massiliense strains ; part of which may be attributed to the presence of the m. massiliense type ii genotype found only in korean patients  <cit> .

the combination of our genomic and molecular epidemiologic data in this study proved that all the strains belonging to a novel m. massiliense type ii genotype, showed loss of genes related to gpl biosynthesis  , resulting in irreversible rough phenotypes. our pcr data targeting  <dig> gpl biosynthesis genes suggested that there may be the disparity between  <dig> groups, m. massiliense type ii and other m. abscessus related strains in evoking rough colony phenotypes. unlike the former acquiring rough phenotype via a genetically determined mechanism, it cannot be excluded that gpl loss of the latter may be mediated by a not-yet determined non-genetic mechanism leading to the transient gpl loss, as reported in other papers  <cit> . but, the exact mechanism related to rough colony phenotype of the latter has to be elucidated in the future.

to our knowledge, this is the first report regarding this genetic defect of gpl biosynthesis in ntms. unlike for the m. tuberculosis − complex strains capable of transmission from human to human, in general, ntms can infect humans only from environmental sources, although infection between cystic fibrosis patients by m. abscessus − complex strains has recently been reported  <cit> . therefore, gpl is generally necessary for ntm survival in the natural environment , and for human infection from environmental sources  <cit> . particularly, in m. abscessus strains, the change of colony morphology from smooth to rough type, which provides an advantage for survival within a host macrophage, has so far been reported to happen spontaneously after host infection by reduction of gpl expression; not by irreversible genetic loss  <cit> .

given that m. tuberculosis − complex strains are strict pathogens that do not harbor gene loci related to gpl biosynthesis within their genomes, it is inferred that strains belonging to the m. massiliense type ii genotype may be more adapted to human infection than other members of m. abscessus complex. after sub-cultures of more than  <dig> generations on 7h <dig> broth or 7h <dig> agar plates, the reversion of rough to smooth type was not found in any type ii strains . this further supports our hypothesis that the rough morphotype of type ii, like m. tuberculosis, may be an innate  trait derived from a smooth strain by evolutionary events, rather than a transient trait acquired during an in vivo infection.

collectively considering our data only for the selective separation of the m. massiliense type ii genotype, we recommended combinatorial pcrs targeting both gpl deletion and conserved genes , because they can be used for simple separation of the genotypes without additional procedures such as sequencing or pcr restriction analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data showed that the m. massiliense type ii genotype showed gene loss related to gpl biosynthesis within its genome, resulting in a rough colony phenotype. to our knowledge, this is the first report of an ntm with a rough colony phenotype genetically determined by gpl gene loss.
