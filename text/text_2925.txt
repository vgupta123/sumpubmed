BACKGROUND
neurogenesis persists in the mammalian subventricular zone  throughout adulthood. under physiological conditions, neural stem cells from the svz migrate to the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream  and differentiate into granule and periglomerular neurons  <cit> . several studies have shown that stroke can induce neurogenesis in the adult svz  <cit> . growth and neurotrophic factors, usually administered by the invasive intracerebral route, have been shown to enhance neurogenesis after stroke  <cit> . this suggests that they have the ability to modify endogenous neural stem cells and their potential for self-repair after ischemia.

although neurotrophic factors contribute to adult neurogenesis, it is difficult for these large peptides  to be transported across the blood-brain barrier  into the central nervous system   <cit> . intracerebroventricular  and intraparenchymal administration are not clinically practical because of the diffusion limitations, invasiveness, cost and safety concerns  <cit> . intranasal administration of growth factors provides an effective, non-invasive method for bypassing the bbb to deliver drugs to the brain along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways  <cit> . one recent study has demonstrated that intranasal fibroblast growth factor- <dig>  or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor  increase neurogenesis in the normal adult mouse brain  <cit> , but the effect of intranasal neurotrophic factors on neurogenesis in animals after stroke has not been investigated.

transforming growth factor-β <dig>  is a versatile cytokine capable of modulating multiple functions, such as cell growth and differentiation, inflammation and cell repair  <cit> . it also has been shown to protect neurons from various injuries, including hypoxia/ischemia, excitotoxic injury and neurotoxins  <cit> . even though endogenous tgf-β <dig> expression can be up-regulated following stroke  <cit> , ischemia-mediated elevation of tgf-β <dig> is insufficient and transient  <cit> . whether or not tgf-β <dig> plays a role in the regulation of neurogenesis after brain ischemic damage remains unknown. as a peptide with large molecular weight and short plasma half-life  <cit> , exogenous tgf-β <dig> cannot cross the intact bbb and may cause organ fibrosis following intravenous injection  <cit> . intrathecal administration of tgf-β <dig> in mice or overexpression of tgf-β <dig> in the cns in a transgenic mouse model affect the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, resulting in communicating hydrocephalus  <cit> .

our previous studies demonstrated that intranasal tgf-β <dig> enters the cns where it alters gene expression  <cit> . intranasal insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  has been reported to reduce infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion  and improve functional recovery  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the effects of intranasal tgf-β <dig> on infarct volume and neurogenesis in the adult mouse svz following focal cerebral ischemia.

RESULTS
tgf-β <dig> improves neurological functional outcomes
to evaluate the neurological functional outcomes of tgf-β <dig> treatment, we applied the modified neurological severity scores  test. no significant differences in nss between control and tgf-β <dig> groups were observed before mcao. all animals subjected to mcao showed severe behavior deficits  <dig> day after ischemia, and there was a progressive improvement over time until  <dig> days after insult. however, tgf-β1-treated mice had significantly lower nss at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after stroke, compared with the saline-treated group  .

tgf-β <dig> reduces infarct volume after mcao
the infarct volumes measured by hematoxylin-stained sections are shown in fig.  <dig> quantitative assessment of infarct size revealed a significant reduction in infarct volume in mice receiving tgf-β <dig> compared to the control group at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after mcao .

tgf-β <dig> decreases cell death after mcao
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labeling  staining was preformed to confirm the antiapoptotic effect of tgf-β <dig>  at  <dig> days after mcao, a large number of tunel positive cells with condensed nuclei were observed in the lesioned striatum of the control groups , whereas tgf-β <dig> treated mice had significantly less tunel-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum . quantitative analysis showed an ~ <dig> % of reduction of the number of tunel-positive cells after intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> .

tgf-β <dig> increases brdu- labeled cells in svz and striatum
to determine whether tgf-β <dig> affects the amounts of progenitors in the svz, bromodeoxyuridine , the thymidine analog incorporated into the dna of dividing cells during s-phase was used to label dividing cells. quantification of brdu incorporated cells in the ipsilateral svz revealed that brdu-labeled cells increased temporally, peaking at day  <dig> after stroke and declined thereafter. on day  <dig> post-ischemia, significantly more cells were labeled with brdu in the svz of tgf-β <dig> -treated mice  than in that of the control mice . significant differences were also observed between the two groups at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after mcao . moreover, the number of brdu labeled cells in the svz stabilized after day  <dig> with numerous brdu-immunopositive cells present at  <dig> days after intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> . similar brdu labeling was observed in the injured striatum of both groups. however, in the ipsilateral striatum at  <dig> days after surgery, intranasal tgf-β <dig> gave rise to more brdu-positive cells  compared with saline-treated animals . mice treated with tgf-β <dig> showed markedly increased numbers of brdu-labeled cells at each time point, while the number of brdu-positive cells remained at basal level in the control group  .

tgf-β <dig> stimulates neurogenesis in ischemic brain
to further ascertain the phenotype of brdu-labeled cells in response to tgf-β <dig>  we performed double immunostaining with antibodies against brdu and other specific cell marker proteins, i.e. doublecortin , neuronal nuclei  and glial fibrillary acidic protein .

confocal microscopy showed that brdu immunoreactivity in ipsilateral svz and striatum was associated with the expression of dcx , but no brdu immunopositive cell was double-labeled with neun or gfap at early metaphase after ischemia in both groups. at day  <dig> in the control group,  <dig> ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % of brdu-labeled cells were co-labeled with dcx in the svz and striatum, respectively. the number of brdu-dcx double-labeled cells declined to  <dig> ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % at  <dig> days, respectively . in contrast to the control animals, almost complete overlap between brdu and dcx labeling was found either at  <dig> days and  <dig> days in both regions of tgf-β <dig> treated mice .

at  <dig> days following the insult,  <dig> ±  <dig> % and  <dig> ±  <dig> % brdu-incorporated cells expressed neun in the svz and striatum after intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> , while in the mice treated with saline, only  <dig> ±  <dig> % in the svz and  <dig> ±  <dig> % in the striatum were co-expressed neun . however, there were only a few brdu-positive cells co-labeled with gfap in the control group .

discussion
the major finding of this study is that intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> reduces infarct volume, improves functional recovery and enhances neurogenesis in the adult mouse svz after transient focal ischemia.

because the delayed administration of neuroprotective agents following ischemia is usually ineffective  <cit> , we adopted early post-ischemia intranasal treatment in this study. our data showed that there is a significant reduction in infarct volume in mice treated with tgf-β <dig>  which is consistent with previous findings  <cit> . tunel labeling indicated that ischemia induced dna degradation was also decreased after intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig>  simultaneously, tgf-β1-treated animals exhibited progressive improvement on the nss test compared with controls. all these support the hypothesis of a neuroprotective role for intranasal tgf-β <dig> in stroke. in addition to its function as a neuroprotective agent, tgf-β <dig> is a key regulator in development and cell cycle control  <cit> , suggesting that the functional recovery after stroke may be mediated by some other mechanisms. to our knowledge, this is the first time that the effect of intranasal tgf-β <dig> on neuroprotection and ischemia-induced neurogenesis in the svz was evaluated.

adult neurogenesis consists of one or more of the following processes, including proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation  <cit> . it is known that the number of brdu immunoreactive cells in the svz increased with a peak at  <dig> days after ischemia, and then decreased gradually  <cit> . the loss of brdu-positive cells may be attributed to dilution of brdu, apoptosis, and cell migration. in the present study, we demonstrated that intranasal treatment with tgf-β <dig> significantly increased brdu-labeled cells both in the svz and striatum ipsilateral to the ischemia at each time point from  <dig> days after stroke. despite the subsequent dilution of brdu-labeling due to continued division or death of labeled cells, we also observed an increase in brdu-positive cells at day  <dig> and day  <dig> after mcao. apart from enhancing survival of newborn cells, the increased number of brdu-labeled cells in the injured striatum of tgf-β1-treated animals may result from an accelerated migration of nascent neurons from svz. different from icv administration, tgf-β <dig> may localize high concentration in the striatum  <cit>  rather than adjacent svz after intranasal administration, and lead to enhanced migration from svz into ischemic region. as expected, double immunostaining showed that after treatment with tgf-β <dig>  most brdu-labeled cells were co-labeled with dcx, a microtubule-associated protein expressed in migrating neuroblasts, which confirmed the previous assumption. furthermore, we found an increased number of brdu/neun double-labeled cells in the svz and affected striatum of tgf-β <dig> treated group at the anaphase after stroke, whereas only a few cells were gfap positive, which suggest that intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> also promoted progenitor's differentiation towards a neuronal lineage. taken together, above findings indicate that stroke-induced neurogenensis is facilitated after intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> 

endogenous tgf-β <dig> is distributed in the proliferative zone, and its two receptors tβri, tβrii are expressed by migrating neurons and radial glia  <cit> . recently, we reported that intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> may exert its biological effects by regulating gene expression of tβri and tβrii, but did not affect mrna level of tgf-β <dig> itself, suggesting that the enhanced neurogenesis by tgf-β <dig> might be mediated through its receptors  <cit> . it is known that neurogenesis is linked to the cell cycle, and neural stem cells may assume their particular neuronal or glial fates by exiting the cell cycle  <cit> . in addition, modification of molecular morphogens and signals in the microenvironment of developing brain affects stem cell survival and differentiation  <cit> . tgf-β <dig> promotes exit from the cell cycle exit by upregulating the expression of the cell cycle protein, p <dig>  <cit> . exogenous administration of tgf-β <dig> may interact with the endogenous system  <cit> , upregulate cell adhesion molecule  expression  <cit> , increase the potency of other neurotrophic factors involved in neurogenesis  <cit> , modulate their action, and affect the signaling of classic neurotrophins  <cit> , and thus enhance stroke-induced neurogenesis. the exact mechamisms for the effects of tgf-β <dig> on neurogenesis are still remain to be proven.

in concert with our results, a recent report showed that tgf-β <dig> also increased neurogenesis both in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of the adrenalectomized rats and in neural stem cells cultures even at physiological concentrations  <cit> . interestingly, some data from in vivo and/or in vitro studies indicate an adverse role of tgf-β <dig> in regulating neurogenesis. wachs et al. reported that tgf-β <dig> induced a long-term inhibition of neurogenesis in the lateral ventricular wall and the dentate gyrus after  <dig> days of icv infusion to adult female fischer- <dig> rats  <cit> . buckwalter et al. observed that chronic overproduction of tgf-β <dig> also inhibited age-related neurogenesis in the hippocampus of aged transgenic mice  <cit> . these discrepancies may be related to the dose of tgf-β <dig>  in contrast to other neurotrophins, tgf-β <dig> has been shown to produce a marked effect in a concentration-dependent manner. in developing cortex, cell migration was promoted by tgf-β <dig> at low concentrations whereas at high concentrations it impaired migration  <cit> . the decision of whether a community of progenitors undergoes predominantly neurogenesis or apoptosis is dependent on the concentration of tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . it is likely that the effect of tgf-β <dig> on neurogenesis is also dose-dependent, related to the concentration achieved in the brain and also to the period of time that it remains elevated.

as a non-invasive method which bypasses the bbb, intranasal administration is an alternative drug delivery strategy for targeting the brain  <cit> . using this method, neuropeptides can be delivered to the brain directly from the nasal cavity for the time and treatment period needed. two possible mechanisms shown to directly deliver drugs from the nasal mucosa to the brain along the neural pathway are the extracellular and the intracellular routes. extracelluar transport along perineuronal and perivascular channels has been proposed to explain delivery of drugs to the brain within minutes  <cit> , whereas intracellular delivery requiring internalization of the drug within the neurons followed by axonal transport takes more than a few hours for drug distribution within the brain  <cit> . we previously reported that tgf-β <dig> concentrations were significantly increased in several brain regions within  <dig> minutes after intranasal administration, while no increase was detected in the plasma and peripheral organs, suggesting that intranasal tgf-β <dig> is mainly transported into the cns via extracellular neuronal pathways. moreover, it was observed that the concentration of tgf-β <dig> following nasal delivery was sustained for at least  <dig> hours in some brain regions, such as striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and cortex, suggesting long-term stability of tgf-β <dig> tissue concentration when given via the nasal route  <cit> . thus, intranasal administration of tgf-β <dig> represents a promising modality for facilitating neuroprotection, neurogenesis and recovery of function after stroke. whether direct neuroprotection, neurogenesis, or both contribute to the reduction of infarct volume and the improvement in neurological function requires future investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that neuroprotection, neurogenesis in the svz and functional recovery of the adult mouse brain are enhanced by intranasal tgf-β <dig> and may contribute to long-term repair following brain ischemia. intranasal tgf-β <dig> may be an effective strategy for treating cerebrovascular disorders.
