BACKGROUND
members of the p. fluorescens species-complex have versatile metabolic capabilities, allowing them to thrive in a large range of environments . strains of p. fluorescens produce a wide-range of secondary metabolites that are important for their association with plants, such as phenazine, polyketides, cyclic lipopeptides, biosurfactants, phytohormones and metabolites that alter plant hormone levels. however, many traits of p. fluorescens also benefit its survival in a mammalian host, such as the production of siderophores and bioactive metabolites and the ability to form biofilms. while environmental strains of p. fluorescens have optimal growth temperatures between 4 °c and 28 °c, there are documented cases of p. fluorescens strains with an expanded growth temperature range that allow them to colonize humans  or interact with human cells in vitro .

an increasing amount of evidence suggests that some strains of p. fluorescens are members of the human microbiota and interact with the human host in ways that contribute to certain chronic diseases . for example, there is a strong link between the presence of circulating antibodies to the p. fluorescens-specific peptide i <dig> and such autoimmune diseases as crohn’s disease, celiac disease, chronic granulomatous disease and ankylosing spondylitis. we have previously reported that in the absence of acute disease, p. fluorescens is cultured from clinical respiratory specimens at a low rate in a hospital setting and is common in asymptomatic lung transplant recipients  <cit> . p. fluorescens strains are often isolated from respiratory specimens from individuals with cystic fibrosis , though this is often unreported . additional culture-independent analyses have identified p. fluorescens as a low-abundance member of the human microbiome.

there is a large degree of genetic diversity among bacterial strains classified as p. fluorescens, which likely reflects the wide range of growth capabilities in these bacteria. using multi-locus sequence analysis  and 16s rrna gene classification approaches, the p. fluorescens-species complex can be divided into three smaller taxonomic subclades . loper et al., used ten housekeeping genes  to divide seven fully sequenced strains within the p. fluorescens-species complex into these three distinct subclades  <cit> . subclade i includes p. chlororaphis 30– <dig>  p. chlororaphis o <dig> and p. protegens pf-5; subclade ii includes p. fluorescens pf0- <dig>  p. fluorescens q2- <dig> and p. brassicacearum q8r1-96; subclade iii includes p. fluorescens a <dig>  p. fluorescens sbw <dig>  and pseudomonas sp.  bg33r. as expected, strains within a subclade share a higher proportion of conserved domains than the species-complex as a whole. while the core genome of the p. fluorescens species-complex was found to be comprised of  <dig>  genes, the core genomes of subclades i, ii and iii were found to be comprised of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively  <cit> . comparative genomic analysis revealed that these subclade divisions correlate with potentially important functional differences. for example, the genes necessary to produce a type-iii secretion system  were found in subclades ii and iii, but not subclade i  <cit> .

much work has been done on the taxonomy and genomics of the p. fluorescens species-complex, but as of yet, no strain isolated from a mammalian source has been sequenced. here we present the first comparative genomic analysis of p. fluorescens strains isolated from humans. the seven p. fluorescens clinical strains were isolated from respiratory specimens from individuals with cystic fibrosis , and represent the first publically available draft genomes of human-associated p. fluorescens strains. phylogenetic analysis reveals that these seven clinical strains fall within subclade iii of the p. fluorescens species-complex. our analysis reveals an extremely high degree of similarity between the clinical and environmental isolates; however, there are a number of genomic differences between the clinical and environmental subclade iii strains, likely reflecting selective pressures unique in the cf lung.

RESULTS
collection of p. fluorescens isolates
the clinical strains of p. fluorescens described in this analysis were isolated over a seven-year period from respiratory samples collected at five different hospitals across the united states between march  <dig> and january  <dig>  six were isolated from adults with cf . one was isolated from an infant with cf . initial sequence-based analysis of the 16s rrna-encoding gene at the time of isolation was consistent with p. fluorescens and indicated that they were not p. aeruginosa . since each isolate came from different cf patients from five different hospitals across a seven-year period, each isolation likely represents a distinct bacterial strain.table  <dig> date, location and source of p. fluorescens strains

phenotypic and growth properties
the phenotypic and growth properties of the newly sequenced clinical strains were compared to those of a previously sequenced representative p. fluorescens strain, sbw <dig>  the clinical strains all displayed phenotypic characteristics of bacteria within the p. fluorescens-species complex, e.g., motile, gram-negative, coccobacillus, lactose-fermentation negative, citrate growth positive, and fluorescence under ultra violet  light . while the clinical strains were phenotypically similar to the environmental strains in the above listed traits, they differed in their ability to grow at temperatures above 30 °c. environmental strains of p. fluorescens typically have an optimal growth range between  <dig> and 28 °c  <cit> . after 24 h, all of the clinical strains were able to grow at 34 °c or higher in the laboratory, while the environmental subclade iii strain sbw <dig> was unable to grow at this elevated temperature . other investigators have reported that human isolates of p. fluorescens have an increased temperature range for growth , consistent with our observations. the newly sequenced clinical strains are able to grow at temperatures at or above 32 °c but otherwise show the same phenotypic and growth characteristics of previously studied strains of p. fluorescens.

genomic assembly
the seven clinical p. fluorescens strains were sequenced on the illumina hiseq platform. genomic dna was prepared for each strain and the paired-end read sequences were partially de novo assembled using dnastar’s seqman ngen software. assembly statistics of each of the newly sequenced strains are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  contigs were assembled into scaffolds. average coverage across genome ranged from 44x  to 68x . as a methodologic control , we also sequenced and de novo assembled sbw <dig>  which was included in our subsequent analyses.

genomic features
a summary of the genomic features of the p. fluorescens strains is shown in table  <dig>  genome size of the clinical strains ranged between  <dig>  megabase pairs  and  <dig>  mbps. this is similar to the range seen in environmental strains . the gc content per genome was also similar between clinical and environmental strains . all of the 16s rrna gene sequences in the clinical strains were >97 % nucleotide identical to that found in p. fluorescens strain a <dig>  with some being >99 % nucleotide identical .table  <dig> genomic features of the p. fluorescens strains in this study



phylogenetic analysis
to classify the newly sequenced clinical strains, we utilized a multi-locus sequence analysis  approach, modified from the scheme described by loper et al.  <cit>  . all publically available genomes from the p. fluorescens species-complex, and some additional strains within the pseudomonas genus, were included in the phylogenetic analysis. the diverse environmental sources of the fully sequenced p. fluorescens isolates have been summarized in a recent review  <cit> . in our analysis, the previously sequenced strains of p. fluorescens formed three distinct phylogenetic subclades within the tree, consistent with the initial publication of the phylogenetic analysis of these strains   <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the p. fluorescens strains in this study. multi-locus sequence analysis of the following eight housekeeping genes was used to infer the phylogenetic tree: dnae ; ppsa ; reca ; rpob ; gyrb ; guaa ; mutl ; pyrc  and acsa . the concatenated sequences were aligned with mafft as described in the materials and methods. clinical strains are highlighted in red  <cit> 



all seven clinical strains were placed within subclade iii of the p. fluorescens species - complex . strain au <dig>  isolated from cf sputum in seattle, wa , segregated closest to environmental strain a <dig>  which was taken from a leaf surface isolate in california  <cit> . clinical strain au <dig>  isolated from a patient in salt lake, ut in  <dig>  segregated closest with strain sbw <dig>  isolated from a sugar beet in england. two separate sub-branches within subclade iii contained only clinical strains. au <dig>  au <dig> and au <dig> branched together on one sub-branch while au <dig> and au <dig> branched together on a second, clinical-only sub-branch. figure  <dig> presents the phylogenetic analysis of sequenced clinical strains of p. fluorescens alongside sequenced environmental strains.

additional phylogenetic analysis of the clinical isolates was performed using average nucleotide identity  and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  clustering . ani uses the shared nucleotide identity between bacteria genomes to infer taxonomic relationships, where 95 % is considered the cut-off for species delineation  <cit> . the percent ani shared between members of subclade iii ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  % . the ani between p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  and every p. fluorescens subclade iii strain was below 79 %. both of these numbers corresponded to previously determined intra- and inter-species shared ani  <cit> . in summary, both mlsa and ani analysis clearly revealed that each of the clinical strains belong within subclade iii.fig.  <dig> phenogram based on average nucleotide identity  between subclade iii strains. phenogram created based on a similarity matrix of the average nucleotide identity  between subclade iii strains. clustering performed using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean  analysis



secondary metabolites
members of the p. fluorescens species-complex are well-documented to produce numerous secondary metabolites necessary for living on plants and in the soil and rhizosphere  <cit> . the genetic sequence of every gene known to be involved in the production of the secondary metabolites listed in table  <dig> was used to screen the newly sequenced clinical p. fluorescens strains using the standalone blastn function provided by ncbi  <cit>  . the panel of genes involved in the production of secondary metabolites found in the clinical strains agrees with what has been reported from previously sequenced p. fluorescens subclade iii strains, in terms of presence, absence and variable presence  <cit> . none of the strains screened contained the genes necessary to make any of the seven p. fluorescens-associated antibiotics . in contrast, every strain contained the full gene cluster to produce the siderophore pyoverdine  <cit>  . in addition to the major siderophore pyoverdine, p. fluorescens strains produce multiple secondary siderophores. the genes necessary to produce the secondary siderophore, pseudomonine, were found in clinical strain au <dig> and environmental strains a <dig> and bg33r. another secondary siderophore, hemophore, is involved in the chelation of heme from eukaryotic hosts  <cit> . the gene cluster required for the biosynthesis and efflux of this siderophore was found in clinical strains au <dig> and au <dig> and environmental strains ss <dig> and bg33r <dig>  the environmental strains a <dig>  ss <dig> and bg33r <dig> are all known to produce chitinase  <cit>  . three clinical strains, au <dig>  au <dig> and au <dig>  also contained the gene cluster necessary to produce this enzyme. every member of subclade iii contained all four genes of the exoprotease apra gene cluster. our analysis revealed that clinically derived subclade iii strains contain the secondary metabolite gene clusters known to be present in environmentally-derived subclade iii strains.table  <dig> secondary metabolite genes and gene clusters in subclade iii strains

pan, accessory, core genomes
to determine the pan, accessory, and core genomes of the subclade iii p. fluorescens strains, we calculated the number of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  shared among the strains. on average, the strains in our study contained  <dig> cogs per genome, with a range of 5332– <dig>  the pan genome, which includes all cogs, shared and unshared, among all the genomes, consisted of  <dig>  individual cogs . the core genome, which refers to only those cogs that are shared between all genomes, contained  <dig> cogs . the accessory genome, which is all the cogs not part of the core, contained  <dig> individual cogs. comparison of the genomes of the clinical strains and the environmental isolates revealed that they share the same general assortment of cogs. clinical strains were found to have additional copies of cogs involved in metal-resistance, in particular, those of the czc-gene family . proteins produced through the czc gene cluster are important in regulating resistance to potentially toxic metals, such as zinc, copper, cobalt and cadmium, in gram-negative bacteria . though members of the czc gene family were also found in environmental strains, clinical strains had up to twice as many members of this gene family per genome . this suggested that either duplication or genetic transfer of the metal-resistance gene cluster occurred recently in the clinical strains. while the identity of the conserved protein families was the same across the subclade iii genomes, cogs involved in metal resistance were found in significantly higher numbers in the clinical strains.fig.  <dig> the pan, accessory and core genomes in subclade iii strains. each of the  <dig> cogs was analyzed to determine how many genomes encoded that particular cog . then the number of cogs encoded by only one genome, two genomes, etc. was determined . the pan genome contains the accessory and core. the average number of cogs per genome is  <dig> . the pan genome and its compartments was calculated using the cogtriganle clustering algorithm in get_homologues  <cit>

metal resistance genes
environmental strains contained on average  <dig> genes belonging to the czc gene cluster , while clinical strains contained on average  <dig> czc-related genes . the czccba gene cluster encodes for a resistance nodulation cell division -type efflux pump that actively shuttles the metal cations out of the bacterial cell  <cit> . the expressed czca protein constitutes the inner part of the of the rnd efflux pump, and is a chemiosmotic cation/proton antiporter driven by a h+ gradient  <cit> . focusing on just the gene that encodes for the czca protein, environmental strains contained three czca homologues each, while clinical strains contained between three and eight czca homologues . to determine whether the presence of additional copies of the czca gene was due to recent gene acquisition, the gc content across each czca homologue was compared to the gc content across the entire genome of each strain. in the environmental strains, the czca homologues had had similar gc content as that found across the entire genome . in contrast, in the clinical strains, there were czca homologues that had significantly lower gc content than that found across the entire genome. three czca homologues  had more than a  <dig>  % difference in gc content when compared to the entire genome, while two czca homologues  had more than a 12 % difference in gc content . this level of difference in gc content suggests that these czca gene clusters could represent recent events of horizontal gene transfer.fig.  <dig> neighborhood-joining phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequence of czca homologues. czca homologues from clinical strains are highlighted in red; homologs from environmental strains are highlighted in green; homologues from other pseudomonas spp. are highlighted in blue. amino acid sequences of the proteins expressed from czca homologues discovered in rast  <cit> . all other bacteria species are publically available on rast. the amino acid sequences were aligned with mafft  <cit> 



to further investigate whether the clinical strains gained additional czca homologues through horizontal gene transfer, we built a phylogenetic tree containing the predicted amino acid sequences of the expressed czca proteins from clinical and environmental subclade iii strains, as well as the amino acid sequences of representative pseudomonas and non-pseudomonas strains . each clinical strain had three czca homologues that grouped with the three czca homologues in the environmental strains . additionally, the clinical strains contained a czca protein whose most similar neighbor was the czca protein from p. putida. the proteins expressed from czca gene homologues with significantly lower gc content are labeled on the tree. the three czca proteins expressed from genes with a gc content difference of more than  <dig>  % all grouped together in the tree, and are most closely related to the czca proteins from p. putida strains f <dig>  kt <dig> and gb- <dig>  as well a czca protein from p. fluorescens a <dig> and au <dig>  the czca proteins expressed from czca genes with more than 12 % difference in gc content did not branch off with any czca homologue from a pseudomonas strain, but instead, branched with a protein from bradyrhizobium japonicum usda <dig> , further suggesting that these gene copies were acquired through recent horizontal gene transfer. clinical subclade iii strains contain homologues of czca that show evidence of recent horizontal transfer from non-pseudomonas bacteria strains.

gc islands
we performed total and segmented gc content scans across the genomes of the newly sequenced clinical subclade iii strains to look for genomic regions of recent horizontal gene transfer. the range in total gc content of the newly sequenced clinical strains  was similar to the range seen in the previously sequenced environmental strains  . however, the segmented gc scans revealed genomic regions where the gc content dropped drastically from the overall average . we referred to the regions of lower gc content as lower gc islands  and those with more than a 15 % difference from the overall genome gc average were selected for further investigation. we used the coordinates of the lgcis provided by the gc-profile tool to select the nucleotide sequence of the lgci from each isolate’s genome. this nucleotide region was then used to screen the non-redundant nucleotide database on ncbi with the online megablast function . the results of the lgci nucleotide screens are presented in additional file 6: table s <dig>  the nucleotide screens revealed that some of the lgcis are more genetically similar to pseudomonas species outside of the p. fluorescens species-complex, suggesting regions of recent horizontal gene transfer into the clinical strains.

the pfit/i <dig> region
although pfit/i <dig> has been identified as a p. fluorescens- specific immunostimulatory protein, no one has yet characterized the pfit/i <dig> sequence in the genomes of fully sequenced p. fluorescens strains. the pfit/i <dig> region of p. fluorescens encodes for an antigenic peptide , which has superantigen properties and is highly associated with various enteric and autoimmune diseases  <cit> . to investigate differences at the amino acid level, we screened each subclade iii strain using a local blastp search with the published pfit amino acid sequence  <cit>  and the top hit was selected from each genome to create a multiple protein sequence alignment . the original published p. fluorescens pfit protein sequence was used as a reference and the residues that differ from the reference were highlighted in the figure. just  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acids  showed any variation between the strains. seven of these amino acid changes were seen in just one of the subclade iii strains. most notably, two residues were altered in every strain: a threonine to an isoleucine at position  <dig> and a lysine to a glutamic acid at position  <dig>  the pfit protein was previously determined to belong to the tetr-family transcriptional regulators and none of the substitutions that occurred in the pfit sequence from subclade iii strains occurred in residues known to be important for dna binding  <cit> . thus, pfit/i <dig> is highly conserved at the amino acid level in all the p. fluorescens strains analyzed in our study.fig.  <dig> alignment of the pfit amino acid sequences from subclade iii strains. amino acid sequence of the pift protein aligned using muscle  <cit> . published sequence of pfit used as reference   <cit> . only amino acids differing from reference are shown and colored. percent nucleotide consensus match visualized in green underneath alignment. alignment visualized with dnastar megaligpro



secretion systems
type ii secretion system
the type ii secretion system , also known as the general secretion  pathway, is a highly conserved secretion system within gram-negative bacteria and is prevalent among gamma-proteobacteria  <cit>  and the pseudomonas genus  <cit> . the t2ss contains twelve core components: an outer membrane secretin ; a cytoplasmic atpase ; an inner membrane protein ; major  and minor  pseudopilins, proteins that assist with atpase attachment to the inner membrane and form an inner membrane platform ; a pre-pseudopilin peptidase/methyltransferase  and a protein possibly involved in substrate recognition or secretion interactions   <cit> . gamma-proteobacteria can contain either one  <cit> , or multiple , set of t2ss genes . every subclade iii strain but au <dig> contained between one and three t2ss gene clusters . these results agreed with what has been previously reported for t2ss gene clusters in subclade iii strains  <cit> . clinical strain au <dig> was missing five general secretion genes . these missing genes are necessary for the standard pilus structure of the t2ss  <cit>  and, therefore, au <dig> likely does not contain the standard type-ii secretion system found in other p. fluorescens strains.fig.  <dig> genes that encode the type-ii, iii, iv, vi and wci secretion system in subclade iii strains. genes annotated using the rast pipeline  <cit> . full gene names listed in additional file 7: table s6



type iii secretion system
type-iii secretion systems  are needle-like structures that bacteria use to deliver effector proteins directly into nearby host cells  <cit> . t3sss fall into multiple families based on the genetic structure and the macromolecular structure of the needle complex. the hrp <dig> t3ss  <cit>  is the most common t3ss found in the p. fluorescens species-complex . the environmental subclade iii strains sbw <dig>  bg33r, a <dig>  ss <dig>  and the subclade ii strains q8r1- <dig> and q2- <dig>  all contained at least one copy of a hrp <dig> family t3ss  <cit> . however, this system was not found in all p. fluorescens strains, as both pf0- <dig> and pf- <dig> did not have an hrp <dig> t3ss gene cluster  <cit> . a list of the genes annotated as belonging to the hrp <dig> t3ss in the subclade iii p. fluorescens strains is reported in fig.  <dig>  with the full annotated gene name shown in additional file 7: table s <dig>  the genes hrpd, hrpg, hrpq and hrpt all vary in whether or not they are included in the hrp <dig> t3ss gene cluster. environmental strain sbw <dig> has been reported to contain a functional t3ss  <cit> , even though our analysis shows that it lacks hrpd and hrpq, suggesting these two genes are not required for t3ss function. whether or not hrpg and hrpt are required cannot be concluded until the functionality of a t3ss in additional subclade iii strains is tested. genes related to the hrp <dig> t3ss were found in each of the subclade iii strains analyzed. in summary, this is the first report demonstrating that the genomes of clinically-isolated strains of p. fluorescens encode for a t3ss.

type-iv secretion system
in p. aeruginosa, the t4ss genes pilabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy1y2z are required for twitching motility  <cit>  and the subclade iii strains analyzed here were missing between one and seven of the t4ss genes required for twitching motility in p. aeruginosa . the type-iv secretion system , also known as the type-iv pili or fimbria, is a three-dimensional filament on the surface of bacteria that is important in adhesion, protease secretion and motility  <cit> . as was seen in the t2ss gene cluster , au <dig> was missing the largest number of t4ss-associated genes, lacking homologues to pilbdghlrt and the genes that encode for the adhesins, fima and fimd. due to the large number of t4ss gene homologues missing in au <dig>  it is likely that this isolate does not contain a functional t4ss. the number of gene homologues for the t4ss proteins adhesin, fima and fimd, varied considerably between the subclade iii strains. fima, a type iv fimbria major subunit protein, shows the largest variation in gene homologues per genome, ranging from none  to four per genome . thus, every clinical subclade iii strain contained a majority of the genes known to be required for twitching motility in p. aeruginosa, with the strain au <dig> missing the highest number of t4ss related genes.

we further analyzed the fima genes from a sample group of subclade iii strains . we aligned the genetic sequences of fima from a <dig>  au <dig> and au <dig> using the mafft algorithm . the alignment revealed that the genes annotated as fima fall into two major groups: fima ‘a’ group and fima ‘b’ group. subclade iii strains a <dig> and au <dig> contained fima homologues in both these two genetic groups. in addition, a <dig> and au <dig> both contained fima homologues that fell within the same group but varied by single point mutations. this analysis revealed that p. fluorescens subclade iii strains contained multiple homologues of the fima gene and homologues can vary by point mutations along the sequence. as the fima gene has only been annotated in a select number of pseudomonas spp.  it is not possible to know if this level of redundancy is seen across the p. fluorescens species-complex or the rest of the pseudomonas genus. further analysis is required to understand the function of multiple fima genes in the subclade iii strains.

widespread colonizing island  / tad locus
the wci has not previously been studied in p. fluorescens. due to its importance in colonizing new environmental niches, the locus containing the tad genes is referred to as the ‘widespread colonization island’   <cit> . the tad locus is a newly described subtype of type ii secretion system  <cit> . proteins expressed by the tad locus are important for biofilm formation and colonization of hosts in multiple bacterial species. in p. aeruginosa, the genes within the wci are regulated by the same quorum sensing circuit that regulates multiple virulence factors  <cit> . all subclade iii strains contained the ten wci-associated genes: cpaabce and tadabcdg . based on the presence and order of the genes in the tad locus, the p. fluorescens subclade iii strains analyzed in this study can be predicted to encode a functional wci.

type vi secretion system
here we surveyed the type- iv secretion system  across the subclade iii strains, and found that each strain carried between 1– <dig> t6ss gene clusters . the t6ss is a macromolecular complex that either transports bacterial effectors directly into target cells or releases them into the extracellular medium  <cit> . many of the t6ss genes found in the p. fluorescens strains are highly conserved across all bacterial strains that contain a t6ss  <cit>  . every p. fluorescens strain within this analysis contained at least one copy of impabcdghijk, vasdh, ppa, ppka, dotu, icmf, clpb, clpv <dig>  vgrg <dig> and vgrg <dig> genes. it has been reported that at least  <dig> structural proteins and two effector proteins  are required to assemble a functional t6ss  <cit> . each subclade iii strain also contained multiple copies of the effector proteins hcp and vgrg. multiple copies of effector proteins are thought to be tied to the multiple utilizations of the t6ss within a bacterial cell, allowing a bacterium to differently utilize the t6ss depending on environmental conditions  <cit> . the newly- sequenced human-associated subclade iii strains contained multiple copies of the structural t6ss genes, and a large number of t6ss effectors, similar to what has been reported in other p. fluorescens strains.

the number of vash homologues annotated in the subclade iii strains ranged from two  to five . vash is a sigma- <dig> dependent transcriptional regulator that has been shown to regulate transcription of the t6ss . the sigma factor  <dig> is an alternate sigma factor that functions as a global regulator in multiple plant and animal associated bacteria  <cit> . sigma factor  <dig> interacts with rna-polymerase and a sigma- <dig> dependent transcriptional regulator  to initiate transcription at sigma- <dig> dependent promoters  <cit> . in order to investigate the differences between these vash gene homologues, we did a multiple sequence alignment of the vash genes from a <dig>  au <dig>  au <dig> and au <dig> and assembled a phylogenetic tree . the separate vash homologues fell into four separate groups based on nucleotide sequence similarity, labeled as groups ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ and ‘d’. the vash ‘a’ homologues showed the highest similarity to the vash from vibrio cholera. au <dig> also contained an additional copy of a vash homologue that branches with the vibrio cholera vash. au <dig> also has two copies of a vash homologue, one in branch ‘c’, and one in branch ‘d’. this analysis revealed that the different homologues of vash fell within distinct evolutionary groups based on nucleotide similarity comparison.

CONCLUSIONS
we present the first comparative genomic analysis of pseudomonas fluorescens isolates from clinical samples. previously, all sequenced p. fluorescens strains had been isolated from environmental samples, such as the soil, plant leaves and loam  <cit> . comparing the genome of seven strains of p. fluorescens isolated from the lungs of individuals with cf  to four previously sequenced environmental strains within the same subclade , we found that all eleven strains were very similar in regard to global and individual genomic features . however, the clinical strains analyzed in this study differed from the environmental strains in two important ways. firstly, the strains isolated from clinical samples had an increased temperature growth range that allowed them to grow between 32 °c and 37 °c, while the representative environmental strain sbw <dig> could not grow above 28 °c. the finding that the clinical isolates studied in this paper can grow at 32 °c or higher agrees with other accounts of strains of p. fluorescens isolated from mammalian samples . changes in temperature often signal a change in environmental context, and bacteria have multiple mechanisms to sense these changes, including signaling through two-component sensor  systems  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether differences in a specific tcs may account for this difference.

the clinical strains also differed significantly from environmental strains in the number of protein-coding genes involved in the resistance nodulation cell division -type of efflux pump that regulates zinc, cadmium and cobalt ions in many gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . efflux pumps control the concentration of metal ions that pass through a bacterial cell and there is strong evidence for a link between resistance to metal ions and antibiotics  <cit> . metals, such as zinc, are necessary for bacterial growth in trace amounts. however, when in abundance, metal cations become toxic to the bacterial cell. zinc will bind to free thiol groups, which can disrupt protein function  <cit> . the rnd-type efflux pump produced by the czccba proteins is regulated by the czcr-s two-component system  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, treatment with zinc leads to the expression of the czcrs operon, which then leads to transcriptional activation of czccba  <cit> . there is a link between the metal resistance conferred through the czccba efflux pump and resistance to antibiotics, such as imipenem. the same two-component regulator that turns on transcription of czccba also negatively regulates the gene oprd. this gene encodes for the specific porin, oprd, which is the primary route by which carbapenems, such as impienem, enter into a bacterial cell  <cit> . in laboratory conditions, exposure to zinc can lead to spontaneous mutations in the czcs sensor gene in p. aeruginosa, making the bacteria resistant to imipenem exposure  <cit> . increased resistance to antibiotics has been seen in multiple different metal-contaminated environments, such as freshwater streams  <cit> , costal areas  <cit> , and metal-contaminated ash settling basins  <cit> . gc content and phylogenetic analysis of the czca gene involved in zinc, cadium and cobalt resistance suggested that clinical strains obtained additional copies through horizontal gene transfer from bacteria outside of the pseudomonas genus.

our findings that the clinical strains were highly similar to environmental strains within the same phylogenetic subclade is in itself significant because it highlights that many of the qualities that p. fluorescens bacteria utilize to succeed in the environment also benefit survival in a human host. environmental and clinical strains of p. aeruginosa are often very similar genomically  <cit> , with a few notable differences that include increased temperature growth range  <cit>  and the acquisition of additional antibiotic resistance traits . the clinical strains analyzed in our current study all fell into subclade iii of the p. fluorescens species complex; further studies will likely that reveal clinical strains of p. fluorescens in each of the phylogenetic divisions. the very definition of an “environmental”, “clinical” or “human” strain is in fact an artificial construct; bacteria will colonize and persist in any niche that provides the requirements necessary for growth. as more clinical strains of p. fluorescens are discovered, sequenced and analyzed, our understanding of what genetic attributes are important for the various lifestyles of p. fluorescens in its different niches is likely to expand and become more refined.
