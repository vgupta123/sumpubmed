BACKGROUND
with the advent of next-generation sequencing  technology, genomic data acquisition has become much easier, especially for non-model organisms  <cit> . the generation of transcriptomes from non-model organisms has also benefitted from ngs advances. transcriptomic datasets can facilitate genome annotation, single-nucleotide polymorphism  analysis  <cit> , marker development for population genetic and adaptive evolutionary studies  <cit> , as well as functional classification  <cit>  in non-model species. the application of transcriptome deep sequencing in metabolic pathway reconstruction and gene marker development has already shown great promise in camellia sinesis <cit> , cicer arietinum <cit> , sphenodon punctatus <cit> , and anopheles funestus <cit> .

this method is also valuable for relatively understudied species, such as favia corals. though corals are high in economic and ecological value, limited genomic resources are available, largely because samples are difficult to obtain. because ngs requires only small amounts of animal tissue, it is possible get large amounts of information from very small samples . recently, anthropogenic threats such as climate change, metal pollution and oceanic acidification  <cit>  have led to rapid declines in worldwide coral populations, lending increased urgency to the need for genomic data. detailed understanding at the genomic and transcriptomic level will allow for the development experimental studies to assess how the intensity and frequency of disturbances affects coral health and abundance.

several studies have reported ngs long reads transcriptome sequencing of coral species such as acropora millepora <cit>  and pocillopora damicornis <cit> . in addition, other recent studies have used the short sequence reads  platform  <cit> , or combined ssr and long reads approach to explore whole transcriptome modulation in response to low ph in adult pocillopora damicornis <cit> , and in early life stages of acropora millepora <cit> . yet, these coral clades are quite phylogenetically divergent from favia <cit> .

this favia genus is one of the most widely and uniformly distributed of all coral genera and is phenotypically presented as massive, dome-shaped and flat. in many cases favia species exhibit cryptic species complexes and their phylogeny has been parodied as being a “bigmessidae”  <cit> . favia are in the faviidae family that contains twenty-four genera, more than any other coral family  <cit> . faviidae is one of the highly fragmented families and indo-pacific members appear to be distinct from atlantic counterparts. therefore, adding more molecular markers to resolve their phylogeny will add further resolution to coral systematics.

we sequenced and assembled  <dig> mbp of illumina cdna reads from two coral favia samples, termed “fav1” and “fav <dig> ” that were collected at 65 m in the northern red sea . reads were assembled into contigs and annotated to: 1) identify protein family clusters using the proteome of nematostella vectensis as a reference; 2) assign functions to the protein family clusters using nematostella vectensis go, interpro and kog functional annotation; 3) identify homologous proteins in acropora digitifera using sequence-based similarity searches; 4) identify symbiont-derived contigs in our assembly; and 5) conduct phylogenetic assessment using three molecular markers  and eleven full-length fluorescent proteins. the resulting data provide a valuable resource for future studies in faviids and other corals.

RESULTS
de novo assembly
holobiont cdna libraries were synthesized from the rna of two individual adult favia sp. collected from the gulf of eilat in the red sea. illumina runs performed on each separate, normalized, cdna pool generated approximately  <dig> million reads per sample with average quality scores > q <dig> at each base. the first step of assembly was carried out with abyss  <cit> , a de brujin graph assembler. in order to recover transcripts across a range of expression levels, we carried out assembly across a range of k-mer values. transcripts with low depth  are best recovered with low k-mer values, while high depth  transcripts are best recovered with high k-mer values  <cit> . using a range of k-mer values also allows for the identification of expressed splice variants arising from a single gene. as the illumina read length was set to 75 bp, we chose initial k-mer values ranging from  <dig> to 45 bp for each sample run.

we evaluated various assembly parameters  as a function of k-mer length. the three k-mer values  with the highest n <dig> length  <cit>  were selected as being most informative. in each sample, we eliminated contigs shorter than  <dig> bp  <cit>  in the two k-mer assemblies with the shortest median contig length, but kept all the contigs in the assembly with the longest median contig length in order to retain any information useful for bridging in the subsequent assembly steps. within each sample, the three k-mer assemblies were then combined, and the combined contigs were assembled with cap <dig> , which computes overlaps to correct errors in constructing contigs and generates consensus sequences for contigs  <cit> , thus eliminating redundant contigs. it has been suggested that assembly of abyss followed cap <dig> yield better contigs  <cit> . as a result, the n <dig> length distribution improved after using cap <dig>  and the best n <dig> values increased from  <dig> to  <dig> in fav <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> in fav <dig> . the final assembled datasets, which were used for all subsequent analyses, contained  <dig>  sequences in fav <dig> and  <dig>  sequences in fav <dig>  the n <dig> values of these two datasets were higher than previous short-read publications  <cit>  , suggesting that the quality of our data was comparable to results in other non-model species .

homologous clustering of expressed coral transcripts
after using the emboss package  <cit>  to generate all possible open reading frames  from stop to stop for each assembled contig, the resulting predicted orfs were searched for sequence similarity against the n. vectensis proteome  <cit> , using reciprocal blastp   <cit>  . for the  <dig>  predicted orfs longer than 150 bp,  <dig>  unique orfs in fav <dig> showed considerable sequence similarity to  <dig>  existing protein sequences in n. vectensis. similarly,  <dig>  unique orfs in fav <dig> showed similarity to  <dig>  n. vectensis protein sequences . the top blast hits for each sample were saved in a pre-clustering list using a perl script . these lists were then used in tribe-mcl  <cit>  to identify homologous protein family clusters in a comprehensive and uniform way . the main clustering parameter, inflation value , was selected as default . fav <dig> and fav <dig> had similar numbers  of protein family clusters homologous to unique n. vectensis proteins. these clusters were subjected to further functional annotation.

in order to evaluate the completeness of our annotation using n. vectensis as the reference as opposed to using another available cnidarian non-annotated proteome , we applied a newly-developed completeness metric  <cit>   to determine the proportion of the reference proteome covered by our sets of assembled transcripts. only those orfs with length coverage ≥80% of the matched protein from the n. vectensis or a. digitifera proteome were included. completeness measurements in fav <dig> and fav <dig> compared to n. vectensis were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively; when the same procedure was carried out using the unannotated proteome of a. digitifera as a reference .

functional annotation and characterization of the isoform clusters in fav1
to identify the putative function of  <dig>  isoform clusters, gene ontology  and protein domain  searches were performed using the functional annotation of the n. vectensis. . the clusters were assigned gene names based on the gene name annotation of the best blast match for the sequences . this process successfully assigned gene names for  <dig>   clusters using go term, kog description, and interpro description. among  <dig>  annotated best hits,  <dig>   gene names were assigned to sequences. these provide a rough estimate of the number of different genes expressed in fav <dig> libraries. broadly, the putative homologs of genes involved in various cellular processes and pathways found to be functionally conserved.

based on go terms assignment to clusters, a total of  <dig>   clusters were assigned at least one go term, among which 11% were assigned at least one go term in biological processes, 48% in molecular function and 6% in cellular component category . among the various biological processes, protein metabolism, and electron transport were mostly highly represented . protein metabolism is also highly represented in other transcriptome characterization studies  <cit> .

according to assigned kog descriptions to fav <dig> clusters, a total of  <dig>   clusters were assigned at least one kog description. however, this was  <dig>   with inerpro description assignment. this implies that the kog description was most useful in assigning domain description to our dataset compared to interpro. the top most frequently detected domain, associated with kog and interpro assignment, include conserved domain associated with predicted e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, fibrillins and related proteins containing ca <dig> + −binding egf-like domains, fog: zn-finger, gpcr rhodopsin, and ras gtpase superfamily. one of the utilities of domain annotation is that it provides quick access to homologs of genes with known roles in intercellular signaling pathway. the representation of genes involved in intracellular signaling pathway was very similar to that of a. millepora <cit> . however, a few families showed the events of expansion  and contraction  indicating their functional significance .

further, we identified major transcription factors encoding transcripts. in comparison to a. millerpora <cit> , the represented genes were somewhat similar. however, a few families were newly reported in our dataset  .

annotation of symbiodinium-derived contigs
holobiont coral tissues also contain eukaryotic dinoflagellate endosymbionts of the genus symbiodinium <cit> . we therefore determined the contribution of symbiont-derived transcripts in our analysis. first, we extracted the regions of cdna contigs that corresponded to each individual annotated orf in two datasets . furthermore their similarity search against two symbiodinium transcriptomes  was performed using blastn. in order to define an e-value as a cutoff threshold, a reciprocal blastn search between the n. vectensis genome and the two symbiodinium transcriptomes showed an average e-value of e- <dig>  thus all contigs with similarity higher than this threshold to symbiodinium were defined as likely to be symbiont-derived. based on these results, 9% of the annotated orfs  of fav <dig> were labeled as symbiont sequences, and  <dig> %  of fav <dig>  fasta files of these non-symbiont transcripts are reported . finally, we performed blastx  on the non-symbiont derived cdna fragments against the n. vectensis proteome to confirm correct initial annotation by blastp. all the cdna sequences matched to the same n.vectensis ids that were predicted using blastp.

phylogenetic assessment
molecular markers are essential tools for population genetic studies. typically, combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers are used to examine the species relationships. in order to generate a favia molecular marker dataset, we downloaded favia related sequences from ncbi. similarity searches were carried out against this favia dataset. among various molecular markers, we chose coi, cytb and 28s. individual sequence regions were identified and extracted from the cdna contig files in both samples. dna alignments for each locus were generated using clustalw <dig> with default parameters  <cit>  . consequently, a matrix of these three loci was generated using fasconcat  <cit> . a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis  was carried out  <cit> . maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis using three loci  suggests that these favia samples belong to faviids . morphological analysis places them as f. albidus <cit> , a species that is not yet represented in ncbi. for example, out of  <dig> favia species that have been described morphologically, only  <dig> of them have molecular data in ncbi. f. albidus, f. helianthoides, and f. marshae lack molecular markers in ncbi. based on geological distribution  <cit>  and morphology, we suggest these two species belong to f. albidus. in fact, f. helianthoides has no morphological similarities with our samples, and f. marshae habitat has never been reported in red sea  <cit> . however, further skeletal samplings are required for final validation  <cit> . regardless, this study increases the protein information of the faviids from  <dig> proteins to over  <dig>  proteins in ncbi.

characterization of one exemplary homologous protein cluster
from the protein clustering results, we chose to characterize a protein family with a natural fluorescent property. one of the benefits of utilizing scleractinian corals as our model organism is that they posses genes for fluorescent proteins , a rare characteristic in most other phyla’ besides cnidaria  <cit> . in n. vectensis, six protein ids encode for fps  <cit> . a search among the homologous sequence clusters with e values of at least 2e- <dig> in each transcriptome led to the identification of one protein cluster group per sample representing potential fluorescent proteins . a total of  <dig> new potential fps were identified, six belonging to the fav <dig> sample and four belonging to the fav <dig> sample. one additional sequence, s23contig9635- <dig> was found by increasing the e-value to 2e- <dig> in fav <dig>  the alignment of these sequences with n. vectensis fluorescent protein sequences , branchiostoma gfpa <dig> <cit>  and gfp of aequorea victoria  showed a considerable homology . the conserved chromophore region is located at the residues  <dig> to  <dig> based on the top sequence. our data shows that one of the newly identified potential fluorescent protein sequences  is  <dig> amino acids longer at the n-terminus  and two of them were shown to be  <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids  longer than the consensus length of reported sequences in ncbi  . this extended region does not seem to interfere with the proper folding and expression of fp, however further studies are required to reveal the function of these upstream domains.

furthermore, the maximum likelihood trees were generated from the alignment of  <dig> fluorescent sequences, including the  <dig> newly identified sequences . there was a strong bootstrap support for basal clade relationships within tree. this includes the order ceriantipatharia, and pennatulacea, although low bootstrap support for fps within order scleractinia. ctenophore fp clustered with hydrozoan fp, therefore the cnidarian clade was not monophyletic. others have shown that incongruence with taxonomy is not unusual in fluorescent proteins  <cit> . for better visualization, a smaller maximum likelihood sub-tree was generated from  <dig> scleractinian fp sequences . although the bootstrap values improved compared to additional file 18: figure s <dig>  some branches still exhibited low bootstrap values. nonetheless, using raxml  <cit> , we categorized the newly identified sequences into four clades and using prottest  <cit>  we identified “protgammawagf” as the best-fit model.

in order to evaluate our assembly method and the possible impact of abyss-specific errors on the annotation accuracy of the long candidate fp sequence, we performed both trans-abyss  <cit>  and trinity  <cit>  on reads from fav <dig>  both assembly programs led to the generation of sequences identical to fav <dig> s23contig16657- <dig> as predicted using abyss and cap <dig>  .

validation of the identified protein clusters as fluorescent proteins
the intrinsic fluorescence of fps includes a unique chromophore that is formed post-translationally within the protein upon autocatalytic cyclization and oxidation of residues x-tyr-gly  <cit> . the fluorophore is located almost at the center of the cylinder and is inaccessible to outside enzymes  <cit> . the gfp fluorophore is capable of forming under a wide range of conditions and once formed is highly stable. the entire structure is very resistant to denaturation by heat and denaturants. the three sequences with longer n-terminal domains  were cloned into mammalian expression vectors. we used kozak analysis  <cit>  to pick the best potential start codon, and reading frames were generated using gene synthesis. the start codons are underlined in red in additional file 21: figure s <dig>  the synthesized sequences were optimized for expression in mammalian cell lines. the synthesized sequences showed fluorescence when expressed in hek- <dig> mammalian cells, thus validating them as genuine fps .

in silico quantification of faviids transcripts
in order to rule out the possibility of promiscuous domain assembly, we assessed the quality of the de novo assembly of fp sequences, as well as all other transcripts, by mapping reads on assembled contigs for each sample. such read alignment to contigs is necessary to provide support for new transcript identification as well as for determining gene expression levels  <cit> . in order to measure the reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads   <cit> , a sub-fasta cdna region, corresponding to each orf, within each contig was generated. reads were aligned to these annotated cdna regions. coverage  measurements were determined using a perl script . the results are reported . the mapping of all the reads onto the annotated faviids transcript showed that the number of reads corresponding to each transcript ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> reads per transcript in fav <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  reads per transcript in fav <dig>  indicating a wide range of expression level of faviids transcripts. it also indicates that very low expressed annotated faviids transcripts were also represented in our assembly. the minimum coverage  of an annotated fav <dig> transcript was  <dig>  and maximum of  <dig> . <dig> with an average of  <dig> . the rpkm ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  in fav <dig>  the average and the range of rpkm per transcript is similar and somewhat higher  than other whole transcriptome studies  <cit> .

all the cdna regions annotated for fluorescent property had reasonable coverage, including the long candidate cdna sequence  . based on the calculated rpkms for each of the identified fluorescent protein in both samples, s23contig19691- <dig> in fav <dig>  and s62contig57475- <dig> in fav <dig> had the highest coverage level .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrate a gene clustering strategy and utilize this in conjunction with ngs contig assembly, sequence conservation measurements, annotation and expression quantification for de novo assembled transcriptomic data. working with two uncharacterized faviid corals, we report  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts to a genus whose sequence data was previously limited to  <dig> in public databases. these results provide greatly enhanced access to the expressed genes in faviidae reef building corals, a potentially valuable resource of genetic/functional markers for population structure and functional genomic studies. we also took advantage of the optical properties of these corals expressed fluorescent proteins to validate our annotation methods to show that these sequences were indeed bonafide fluorescent protein genes. these methods reported in this study are available via open source software programs as well as our provided scripts.
