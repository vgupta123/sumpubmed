BACKGROUND
the photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbiodinium sp. is a significant endosymbiont of a wide range of marine invertebrates and is a major contributor to the ecological success of reef-building corals in shallow tropical seas  <cit> . in vitro cultivation of coral symbionts allowed their identification as gymnoid dinoflagellates and led to their description as symbiodinium microadriaticum in the middle of the 20th century  <cit> . however, subsequent studies on cellular ultrastructure, cell morphology and physiological features suggested that symbiodinium microadriaticum might in fact represent more than one species  <cit> . through the application of molecular genetic tools, the genus symbiodinium was revealed to contain a high degree of diversity, where genetic distances between symbiodinium taxa are greater than between orders of non-symbiotic dinoflagellates  <cit> . currently, nine major symbiodinium clades , based on nuclear ribosomal dna sequences and chloroplast 23s rdna are established  <cit> . with the exception of clade e, multiple symbiodinium types are recognized within each clade , primarily based on sequence variations in the faster evolving internal transcribed spacer region  <dig>   <cit> . the now established phylogenetic relationship that designates main symbiodinium clades and types within each clade is well supported by a number of different genetic markers  <cit> . due to the multicopy nature of its <dig> and the resulting intragenomic variation, the application of an operational taxonomic unit  framework based on a statistical cluster-based approach with defined cut-offs, might be the closest approximation of a species definition in the genus symbiodinium to date  <cit> . for important symbiodinium clades, such as clade c that represents the major clade in indo-pacific corals, some authors have provided support that its <dig> types indeed represent evolutionarily distinct species by complementing the phylogenetic analysis with ecological, geographic and population genetic data  <cit> .

the environmental sensitivity of the mutualistic association between symbiodinium types and scleractinian corals has gained considerable attention over the last few decades through the phenomenon of coral bleaching. bleaching results from a decline in endosymbiont density and/or photosynthetic pigment content in response to environmental stress, causing a paling of the coral  <cit> , and can potentially lead to death of the coral colony. large scale coral bleaching with subsequent mortality as a result of climate change-induced warming of the oceans represents a major threat to the functioning of coral reef ecosystems  <cit> .

variability in bleaching susceptibility and severity between different coral-symbiodinium associations under similar temperature regimes has highlighted the role of symbiodinium diversity in determining the performance of the coral “holobiont” . while the physiological mechanisms of bleaching are not yet fully understood, the generation of reactive oxygen species  in the symbiont population under stress is thought to play an important role in the cellular bleaching cascade  <cit> . in this context, differences in ros generation or antioxidant defences between different symbiodinium types might contribute to the varying bleaching susceptibility between different coral species or even between populations of the same species.

potentially damaging ros, such as superoxide  or hydrogen peroxide , occur as side-products of photosynthesis and respiration  <cit> , and antioxidants play an important role in preventing oxidative damage and, more generally, in maintaining redox homeostasis. the concerted response of the antioxidant network involves a number of pathways, and the scavenging of superoxide by superoxide dismutase  is considered the first line of defence. sod is expressed in a number of metalloforms of which some are organelle-specific in higher plants . downstream defences, such as peroxidases and catalases, deal with the end product of sod activity, hydrogen peroxide. the activity of these peroxidases is linked to the availability of low molecular weight antioxidants, such as ascorbate and glutathione, which act as important cofactors and are essential to the h2o <dig> metabolism of photosynthetic organisms  <cit> .

changes in activity of sod, ascorbate peroxidase  and the bacterially-derived enzyme catalase peroxidase  have all been shown to be involved in the response to light and temperature stress in populations of both cultured and in hospite symbiodinium  <cit> . information on the protein structure and regulation of antioxidant gene expression, however, has been largely limited by a lack of nucleic acid sequence data, though the first steps towards this have been undertaken  <cit> . the application of sanger sequencing and high-throughput sequencing technologies to the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis has now provided a large body of transcriptomic data for a number of coral species  <cit> , but only for a few symbiodinium types  <cit> . the responses of a number of oxidative stress-targeted genes, such as ferritin, heat shock proteins, glutathione s-transferase, mnsod and catalase have been documented in coral hosts exposed to environmental stress  <cit> , though the mrna expression of only one antioxidant gene  has been quantified in symbiodinium   <cit> . considering their pivotal role in coral biology, it is essential to broaden the transcriptomic toolkit to allow the assessment of antioxidant expression patterns in a variety of different symbiodinium types.

the focus of this study was therefore to compile and characterize gene transcripts from four major enzymatic antioxidants  from different symbiodinium clades. a more thorough analysis was done within clade c specifically, by looking at sequence similarities between its <dig> types. degrees of sequence variation at the amino acid level, as well as phylogenetic relationships across different clades, were investigated. furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of these data by measuring antioxidant gene expression and its corresponding enzyme activity in symbiodinium b <dig> under short-term thermal stress.

superoxide dismutases
both, mnsod and fesod represent dimeric forms that were highly conserved across clades. transcripts of fesod were only successfully amplified from symbiodinium b <dig>  e and f <dig>  while none were found in any of the available est libraries. obtained partial sequences of symbiodinium fesod  covered 66-74% of the encoded total protein length of  <dig> aa , as determined from a previously published symbiodinium clade a sequence  . encoded protein sequence length within each mnsod isoform was similar across clades , but absolute length between isoforms varied by up to 19% . mean pairwise protein identities across clades were highest for symfesod , symmnsod <dig> , and symmnsod <dig> , with near identical amino acid sequences  for mnsod <dig> within clade c  . the predicted tertiary monomer structure of symmnsod <dig> from symbiodinium b <dig> and c <dig> was also highly similar . i-tasser modelling returned bacterial sods as the top five structural protein data bank  analogues for both types. pairwise identities between clades were lower for symmnsod <dig>  and other mnsod  sequences, partially due to limited sequence data for the latter ones . the lowest pairwise identities between full-length sequences were usually encountered between symbiodinium of clade d and all other clades .figure  <dig>

dinoflagellate spliced leader sequences were located 45–53 bp upstream of the start codons of symmnsods. signal peptides, but no transmembrane domains were found in all n-terminal domains . however, prediction strength of their subcellular locations given by targetp  <dig>  was low for symmnsod <dig> and  <dig> , assigning them to the mitochondrial or secretory pathway . the remaining mnsod isoforms were identified as part of the secretory pathway. variants of the prominent ancient plastid-targeting “fvap”-type motif  were found in the transit peptide region of almost all sequences . no signal peptide was found for symfesod.

ascorbate peroxidase
a total of  <dig> apx sequences were obtained from pcr amplifications and est library entries, and they were grouped according to their amino acid sequence characteristics  as long as members of these six groups were found in at least two symbiodinium clades . symapx <dig> and  <dig> were identified as hybrid ascorbate-cytochrome c peroxidases , whereas all others matched common ascorbate peroxidase sequences . n-terminal signal peptides were only found in symapx <dig> and  <dig>  and two unclassified sequences, assigning symapx <dig> and  <dig> to either secretory or mitochondrial pathways . targetp did not recognize the phobius-predicted signal peptide in the two unclassified sequences. all other apx sequences appear to be cytosolic. overall protein length varied considerably between cytosolic isoforms , and multiple start codons could be found within the same orf. nevertheless, atgpr software’s prediction of the “true” start codon in symapx <dig> was supported by the location of the spliced leader, found 58 bp upstream of the coding sequence in the symapx <dig> isoform of symbiodinium f <dig> . this was, however, the only apx sequence where the spliced leader primer, in conjunction with a reverse primer, successfully amplified a gene fragment.

length differences between apx isoforms  were driven by a number of deletions in the n-terminal domain  and between residues 397– <dig> , but also by large insertions around residues 275– <dig>  and 339– <dig>  . pairwise amino acid identities were considerably lower than for sods, but varied depending on isoform. full-length comparison of symapx <dig> showed pairwise identities of 63-64% , 64-67%  and 76% , or even lower values . in comparison, the similarities of symapx <dig> between a <dig> and d were 73-74%. variation in symapx <dig> within clade c was predominantly found in c <dig> , whereas c <dig> and c <dig> were nearly identical . functionally important residues involved in binding of heme and hydrogen peroxide, as well as the formation of the catalytic site, were largely conserved within each apx isoform, with the exceptions of symbiodinium c <dig> and f <dig>  where trp <dig> and his <dig> in the hydrogen peroxide binding site of symapx <dig> were replaced by phe <dig> in c <dig> and asn <dig> in both . in symbiodinium f <dig> , five of the seven ascorbate binding site residues and two of the six heme binding site residues differed from those of other clades.figure  <dig>

catalase peroxidase
the two katg isoforms found in symbiodinium differed mainly by two insertions in symkatg <dig> between the consensus residues 88– <dig>  202– <dig> and 321– <dig> . the proximal heme-ligand signature motif  differed slightly between both isoforms, but was highly conserved in each one. signal peptides for the secretory  and/or mitochondrial pathway  were found . targetp reliability of the assigned pathway was, however, highly variable between sequences. mean pairwise identities across clades was 80% ± 9% for symkatg <dig>  and 77% ± 2% for symkatg <dig> , respectively. symbiodinium c <dig> and c <dig> shared the highest pairwise identity .figure  <dig>

comparison with bacterial katgs revealed that symkatgs are, in general, shorter and cover only the n-terminal domain of the bacterial form. residues of the distal  and proximal triad , as well as the met-tyr-trp adduct are, however, all conserved. structural modelling of the symkatg from symbiodinium b <dig>  identified the crystal structure of the bacterial catalase-peroxidase from haloarcula marismortui  as the best structural analog . in comparison to bacterial katgs, symkatgs contain up to three sequence extensions  at positions 210– <dig> , 267– <dig>  and 322– <dig> . superimposition of the symkatg from b <dig>  with haloarcula marismortui  indicates that these inserts form large loops, primarily on the surface of the protein . inserts  <dig> and  <dig> were also the main source of sequence variability between symbiodinium types, with multiple amino acid inserts or deletions .figure  <dig>

protein phylogeny
symbiodinium fesod sequences were most similar to those of the dinoflagellate lingulodinium polyedrum. the fesod proteins from both of these dinoflagellates were, however, more closely related to cyanobacterial sequences  than to the general alveolate cluster; the latter also included the dinoflagellate sequence from crypthecodinium cohnii . cryptophyte and bacilliariophycean sequences formed a separate branch outside of the alveolate cluster, with another cyanobacterial sequence at its root. overall tree robustness was low for both sod metalloforms, with strong node support only present in lower branches.figure  <dig>

symmnsod <dig> and  <dig> were grouped into a single cluster, with the pelagophyte aureococcus anophagefferens as closest relative. within this symbiodinium cluster, only symmnsod <dig> from b <dig> were identified as a basal group, while all other sequences lacked any cladal resolution. symmnsod <dig> was most closely related to another dinoflagellate, noctiluca scintillans, grouping it together with ectocarpus siliculosus as well as the bacillariophycean cluster .figure  <dig>

symbiodinium apx sequences expressed a strong dichotomy relative to the rhodophyte outgroup. the tip of the lower branch  separated the two clusters of symapx <dig> and symapx <dig>  with the latter also containing sequences from thalassiosira sp.  and emiliania huxleyi . the symapx <dig> cluster expressed some degree of cladal separation, with sequences from clades a and b usually located basally to more derived its <dig> types. symapx3- <dig>  including unclassified symapx, formed well-separated clusters at the tip of the upper branch that comprised all dinoflagellate sequences used in the analysis. with a chloroplastic pfiesteria piscicida sequence at its base, the dinoflagellate branch also enclosed two apx sequences from perkinsus marinus and ostreococcus tauri . node support for cladal separation  within each symapx isoform was very high .figure  <dig>

relative to the original bacterial cluster, which also contained bacilliariophycean sequences, dinoflagellate katgs form a strongly supported sister branch to a branch that contains chlorophyte, oomycete and phaeophycean sequences . while symkatg <dig> and  <dig> form separate branches within the dinoflagellate cluster, the phylogenetic distance relative to other dinoflagellates is especially high for symkatg <dig>  in fact, the patristic distance between symkatg <dig>  and symkatg <dig>  is about the same as the distance between symkatg <dig>  and the cyanobacterium synechococcus sp. . cladal separation was evident for both isoforms. resolution for symkatg <dig> was limited though, indicating only a basal symbiodinium f <dig> sequence, relative to a cluster of sequences from clades b, c, and e.figure  <dig>

protein activity and gene expression responses of enzymatic antioxidants in symbiodinium b <dig> under short-term thermal stress
exposure to 33°c led to an arrest of cell population growth, relative to the control , and a 16% decline in fv/fm . this was, however, not accompanied by a decline in chlorophyll a  content. while no significant effect of temperature on chl a or protein content was found over time, protein content per cell on day  <dig> tended to be higher at 33°c , so we normalized enzymatic activity to cell number rather than protein content. a significant temperature effect on antioxidant enzyme activity was only found for apx, whose activity at 33°c was approximately 30% higher after three days .table  <dig>

discussion
the large diversity in the dinoflagellate genus symbiodinium has been inferred from the extensive variation in the rdna its <dig> region  <cit> . while different genetic markers have been studied in the context of taxonomic resolution and phylogenetic links within the genus, individual gene phylogenies might not always be evolutionary identical . however, to what degree this genetic diversity is reflected on the amino acid level of functionally important genes, such as antioxidant genes, has never been investigated. this study provides, for the first time, an overview of the intrageneric diversity of the antioxidant repertoire in the genus symbiodinium. protein sequence characteristics and phylogenetic analyses indicated a high degree of sequence conservation at the amino acid level for sod isoforms, but considerable variation in peroxidases. gene expression and protein activity of mnsod, apx and katg were successfully measured in symbiodinium b <dig> at different temperatures. significant changes in protein activity at high temperatures were, however, limited to apx and not associated with increases in expression of the underlying gene.

sod isoforms are highly conserved between symbiodinium types
structurally, all symbiodinium mnsods and fesods found here are dimeric, a characteristic that is generally found in prokaryotes rather than eukaryotes, in which mnsods are usually tetrameric  <cit> . at least three mnsod isoforms exist in symbiodinium, agreeing with the electrophoretic detection of three to four mnsod isoforms in symbiodinium from two different host species  <cit> . the monomeric weights for the symmnsods  and symfesod  correspond roughly to previously reported native  weights of  <dig>  kda  and  <dig>  kda   <cit> . interestingly, no fesod sequence was found in any of the est libraries queried and it was not possible to readily amplify and sequence mrna from some of the symbiodinium types. this could be related to the fact that fesod seems to be expressed at a very low level, as high ct-values and problems with non-specific amplification thwarted attempts to reliably quantify expression of this gene in symbiodinium b <dig>  the difficulties encountered in amplifying fesod prevent conclusions being made as to the true diversity of this form, though at least two protein isoforms were reported for symbiodinium of the sea anemone anemonia viridis  <cit> . while previous studies have established the proteomic presence of all three sod isoforms  in symbiodinium  <cit> , the random primer approach used here detected only the manganese and iron sod forms.

sequence homology between symbiodinium types was very high for both mnsod and fesod. as a result, these enzymes seem to be structurally almost identical between symbiodinium types, suggesting similar catalytic properties. this homology is also reflected in the fact that it was not possible to phylogenetically distinguish any of the seven its <dig> types within the symmnsod1 +  <dig> cluster. the high degree of sod amino acid conservation, despite the genetic radiation of the genus, shows the limitations of genetic variation in this functional gene, as mutation to critical residues involved in structural characteristics and catalytic functions might be lethal, given the pivotal role of sod as the first line of antioxidant defence  <cit> . although the dimeric nature of both sod metalloforms indicates a bacterial origin, the protein phylogeny reflects a close relationship to cyanobacterial sequences only for fesod. all of the mnsod isoforms, on the other hand, have evolved within the stramenopile cluster, consistent with a red-algal origin. interestingly, a mnsod from the hacrobian cryptophyte guillardia theta  was also found within this cluster.

the suggested secretory nature of  <dig> of the  <dig> symmnsod sequences with a complete n-terminal domain requires further investigation with regard to the subcellular locations of these forms due to the low reliability of the prediction strength using the “plant” setting in targetp  <dig>  and the peculiar nature of transit peptides in dinoflagellates  <cit> . interestingly, a variant of the plastid-targeting “fvap”-type motif was found in almost all sequences and it should be noted that despite the predicted mitochondrial location, symmnsod <dig> and  <dig> fulfilled two of the three proposed cut-off criteria for transit peptides of potential plastid-targeted proteins . with mitochondrial and chloroplast signal peptides having a number of common sequence features  <cit> , further localisation studies beyond the bioinformatical level applied here, are required. similarly, the absence or low reliability of a chloroplastic target signal in photosynthetic and heterotrophic dinoflagellate fesods from symbiodinium of clade a , crypthecodinium cohnii  and lingulodinium polyedrum  emphasizes the need for such investigations, but also raises the question as to what extent plastid targeting signals differ in dinoflagellates, potentially assigning them to multiple compartments  <cit> , or whether these fesods represent cytosolic forms, as suggested for heterotrophic dinoflagellates  <cit> .

extended loops and a shortened c-terminal domain characterize symbiodinium catalase peroxidases
catalase peroxidases  are bifunctional heme peroxidases which, in contrast to other peroxidases, display both catalase and peroxidase activity. these enzymes are of bacterial origin and resulted from a gene duplication event in which both protein domains remained fused while the c-terminal domain lost its catalytic activity  <cit> . while the exact function of this domain is unknown, it is suspected to stabilize the protein and its absence affects the spatial layout of the heme-binding residues in the catalytic domain  <cit> . the reduction or absence of the c-terminal domain has been previously observed in other dinoflagellates  <cit> . evolutionarily, dinoflagellate katgs belong to the minor katg clades, which are intermediate between bifunctional katgs and uni-functional peroxidases like apx  and cytochrome c peroxidases  <cit> . the observed symkatg inserts  <dig> and  <dig> are essentially an extension of the characteristic first and second katg loop  <cit> , while symkatg insert  <dig> is a unique feature only shared by prorocentrum minutum. the observed sequence variability between symbiodinium types in these loops might be of evolutionary importance, since loops  <dig> and  <dig> are structurally relevant for the access of hydrogen peroxide to the prosthetic heme group and thus catalytic activity  <cit> . structural modifications, with alteration of amino acid residues involved in substrate and cofactor binding, can alter catalytic rates and activity of these enzymes  <cit> , and might therefore be under selective pressure. further research is clearly needed to bridge the gap between sequence variations and their functional consequences in different symbiodinium types. purifying and characterizing these enzymes biochemically will allow further investigations on the thermal stability and substrate affinity  of these enzymes.

sequence evolution of peroxidases reflect genetic radiation of the genus symbiodinium
isoforms of apx and katg expressed a greater number of amino acid substitutions between symbiodinium types than did sod metalloforms, which indicates a higher rate of sequence evolution for these two phylogenetically-related heme peroxidases. apx and katg phylogenies distinguished separate symbiodinium clades within their respective isoform clusters, even to the point of resolving subcladal diversity between c <dig>  c <dig> , and c <dig>  given that clade a sequences tended to be basal to most clusters, it is conceivable that these two enzymes have co-evolved with the genetic radiation of the genus. further data are, however, required to validate this. sequence divergence of both heme peroxidases within the genus symbiodinium is nevertheless large , and is much higher than the protein divergence seen at the genus level of higher plants . however, while consistent features of cytosolic apxs of higher plants were found in symapx1 +  <dig>  in downstream defence lines, such as the removal of hydrogen peroxide, could provide ‘evolutionary space’ for alterations in peroxidase sequences to occur. this antioxidant redundancy, demonstrated in mutants of higher plants  <cit> , has not yet been shown for symbiodinium, partially due to the lack of available sequences for most of these genes. however, on an evolutionary scale, this redundancy might have provided the opportunity for the development of the observed sequence alterations if they become evolutionarily relevant in providing the means to more effectively detoxify ros. variability in downstream antioxidant responses, related to the removal of hydrogen peroxide, has already been shown to be a key difference between different symbiodinium types under thermal stress at the protein level  <cit> .

the presence of multiple, nuclear-encoded class i peroxidases  in the transcriptome of symbiodinium, with separate modes of sequence evolution for specific isoforms, suggests that these were acquired by endosymbiosis or horizontal gene transfer . for example, apx isoforms symapx3- <dig>  located within the alveolate cluster, are in stark contrast to symapx1- <dig>  which were closely related to proteins from bacillariophyceae and haptophytes. symbiodinium belongs to a cluster of dinoflagellates, called the gymnodiniales-peridiniales-prorocentrales  complex, which contains a number of genera, whose genes were derived from plastid acquisition from bacillariophyceae and haptophytes  <cit> , as well as through secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis   <cit> . our results add to other findings that symbiodinium is no exception with regard to “foreign” genes  <cit> . for katgs, a transfer of ancestral bacterial katg genes into marine eukaryote genomes through horizontal gene transfer has been suggested; specifically, katg acquisition from cyanobacteria or marine bacteria in diatoms has been proposed  <cit> . symkatgs demonstrate, however, a more reduced c-terminal region in comparison with diatoms. the suggested common katg ancestry of dinoflagellates with evolutionarily distant stramenopile and chlorophyte proteins  could suggest multiple independent gene transfer events for katgs.

antioxidant gene expression in symbiodinium b1
in order to normalize antioxidant expression, a number of potential hkgs were chosen that had previously been shown to be suitable for thermal experiments with symbiodinium c <dig>  <cit> . the normfinder analysis for expression stability agreed with this previous study, in that tub is the least stable hkg candidate for studying thermal stress. however, expression of cal and cox was more stable in symbiodinium b <dig> than sam, in contrast to the findings for c <dig>  large variation in gene expression between replicates was evident in this study and, though natural variation in gene expression has been shown for in hospite symbiodinium populations in situ  <cit> , there is no obvious explanation as to why this occurred under the controlled lab settings used here. changes in gene expression in symbiodinium under stress have consistently been found to be small  <cit> ; thus, minimizing variation between replicates is crucial to resolve small, but potentially biologically meaningful changes in gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
the physiological traits that are associated with particular symbiodinium genotypes have profound implications for their hosts, especially in obligate associations such as the coral-symbiodinium symbiosis. the use of a consistent genetic classification of symbiodinium types provides the foundation for any systematic investigation of the link between genetic identity and ecophysiology. however, genetic differences, as assessed by fast-evolving markers such as its <dig>  should not a priori lead to the assumption of fundamentally different physiologies. differences in “machinery”  between types has been well studied, but to what extent differences in “hardware”  contribute to the particular physiology of different symbiodinium types should also be considered. this study shows that superoxide dismutase enzymes are structurally highly similar across the investigated clades and types, whereas hydrogen peroxide-scavenging peroxidases display considerable variation in predicted amino acid residues. intriguingly, these findings correlate to some extent with the observed similarity in sod baseline activities between different types, but higher variability in downstream antioxidant enzymes under the same environmental settings  <cit> . considering the role of oxidative stress in coral bleaching, and the connection between differential bleaching susceptibility and symbiont diversity, the presented dataset provides an important tool for further comparative studies related to the functioning and regulation of antioxidant genes in symbiodinium.
