BACKGROUND
during mammalian embryogenesis, the development of skeletal muscle is mediated by a co-ordinated series of events that begins with commitment of mesodermal precursor cells to the skeletal muscle lineage, followed by myoblast fusion and the subsequent progression of a programme of muscle specific gene expression  <cit> . a specialised group of transcription factors control this process of myogenic specification and differentiation. these factors, designated the myogenic regulatory factors , include four basic helix-loop-helix  e-box binding proteins: myod, myf <dig>  myogenin and mrf <dig>  <cit> . during development myod and myf <dig> dictate myoblast specification while myogenin and mrf <dig> regulate terminal differentiation  <cit> . in collaboration with the mrfs, the mads-box myocyte enhancer factor  family of proteins contribute to the programme of muscle specific gene expression  <cit> .

serum response factor , a mads box transcription factor related to the mefs, also regulates skeletal muscle gene expression through binding of a dna sequence known as the serum response element  or carg box  <cit> . in addition to binding and regulating numerous muscle specific promoters  <cit> , perturbation of srf activity severely impairs myoblast fusion and differentiation  <cit> . confirming an important role for myogenic srf activity, a conditional skeletal muscle specific knockout of srf results in severe skeletal muscle myopathy that results in perinatal lethality  <cit> .

srf activity is dependent on its interaction with a range of cell-type specific and signal responsive co-factors  <cit> . myocardin, the founding member of a family of extraordinarily powerful myogenic srf co-activators  <cit> , has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for cardiac and smooth muscle specific gene expression  <cit> . unlike myocardin, the myocardin-related transcription factors , mrtf-a  and mrtf-b , are expressed in skeletal muscle in addition to multiple other cell types  <cit> .

a requisite role for the mrtfs in skeletal muscle development has been inferred from experiments in cultured muscle cells, in which rnai mediated knock-down of mrtf-a repressed srf-dependent gene expression resulting in impaired myoblast fusion and subsequent formation of multinucleated myotubes  <cit> . transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative form of mrtf-a displayed a phenotype reminiscent of the skeletal muscle srf knock out mice supporting an important role for the mrtfs in the control of muscle fiber growth and maturation  <cit> . in contrast to myocardin, which is constitutively nuclear, the mrtfs shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus with nuclear accumulation required for srf trans-activation. muscle specific mechanisms, which promote mrtf nuclear accumulation, represent important regulatory pathways in the process of myogenic differentiation via the mrtf/srf signalling axis  <cit> .

we, and others, have previously identified a novel striated muscle specific actin binding protein, myocyte stress  <dig>   <cit>  which has the ability to synergistically activate srf-dependent transcription through a rho-a dependent mechanism. kuwahara and colleagues subsequently demonstrated that stars  activates srf dependent transcription by inducing the nuclear accumulation of mrtf-a and -b through a rho-a dependent mechanism  <cit> . stars perturbation via rnai resulted in a significant attenuation of muscle specific srf activity suggesting that endogenous stars is an important component of the muscle specific mrtf/srf transcriptional pathway  <cit> . in support of this we have shown that ectopic ms <dig> expression results in an increased expression of characterised mrtf/srf target genes   <cit> . interestingly, we have recently shown that morpholino knockdown of zebrafish ms <dig>  resulted in severe musculoskeletal deformities with curvature and shortening of the longitudinal axis  <cit> . this data supports the previous studies and demonstrates that ms <dig> is a central component of the evolutionary ancient muscle specific mrtf/srf signalling axis.

despite the important role of ms <dig> in skeletal muscle formation and function, little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing its expression. the proximal  <dig>  kbp 5'-flanking sequence has recently been shown to be able to direct lacz expression in adult cardiac and skeletal muscle, with two mef <dig> responsive motifs within the proximal flanking sequence essential for the observed cardiac specificity  <cit> . however, the factors, motifs and regulatory mechanisms governing the skeletal muscle specific expression profile remain unknown. understanding such mechanisms will give us an exquisite insight into how the mrtf/srf signalling axis is regulated during myogenesis in addition to expanding our knowledge of the genetic circuits involved in mygenic differentiation.

in this study we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the ms <dig> gene during myogenic differentiation using the c2c <dig> myoblast cell line as an established model system. we have shown that two myogenic e-boxes, located within evolutionary conserved regions in the ms <dig> promoter, play distinct roles in recruiting myod and subsequently activating the ms <dig> promoter during myogenic differentiation.

RESULTS
ms <dig> transcript is differentially expressed during myogenic differentiation
ms <dig> expression is restricted to striated muscle with early developmental expression during myogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate models  <cit> . in order to evaluate ms <dig> expression during myoblast differentiation in vitro, cultured c2c <dig> cells, a myoblast cell line established from the leg muscle of the c3h mouse  <cit> , were used. c2c <dig> is a myoblast cell line, which remains proliferative in the presence of high concentrations of fetal bovine serum. upon serum depletion, these myoblasts differentiate and fuse with each other into myotubes  <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr was conducted using  <dig> μg of total rna obtained from subconfluent c2c <dig> myoblasts  and from c2c <dig> myotubes differentiated for  <dig> days . as shown in figure 1a, there is a significant increase in ms <dig> transcript in differentiated c2c <dig> cells compared to confluent proliferating c2c <dig>  suggesting a differentiation dependent up-regulation of ms <dig> mrna.

the temporal expression profile of specific genes expressed during myogenic differentiation can give us an exquisite insight into both the function of the gene and the regulatory processes governing its expression  <cit> . we have therefore measured the temporal expression profile of ms <dig> transcript during the controlled differentiation of c2c <dig> myoblasts over a three-day period. rt-pcr using rna isolated on consecutive days during differentiation shows that ms <dig> transcript is significantly induced within the first day of the differentiation process with a maintained increase in expression over the subsequent three days . ms <dig> can thus be regarded as an early wave myogenic transcript  <cit> , with this temporal profile having implications for its role and regulation during myogenic differentiation.

analysis of the ms <dig> 5' upstream dna sequence
the transcriptional up-regulation of ms <dig> during myogenic differentiation suggests its expression might be targeted by differentiation promoting transcription factors. during myogenesis, differentiation is under the control of e-box binding myogenic basic helix-loop-helix  and mads domain mef <dig> proteins  <cit> , with all myogenic genes containing binding motifs for these transcription factors in their promoters and associated regulatory loci. we therefore, by means of comparative sequence analysis, proceeded to analyse the rat ms <dig> 5' upstream sequence for enrichment of myogenic transcription factor binding motifs. using the vista software  <cit>  we compared  <dig> kbp of 5' upstream sequence from rat, with the orthologous locus in human. this compares sequences that shared a common ancestor over  <dig> million years ago and it has been shown empirically that conserved non-coding sequences, also known as evolutionary conserved regions , identified between these species represent ideal candidates as functional transcription factor binding motifs and regulatory domains  <cit> .

our in silico analysis  identified two ecrs, α and β , within the flanking  <dig> kbp of 5' upstream sequence. ecr a encompassed the proximal  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site  and we propose represents the proximal promoter. within this proximal ecr a putative tata box  was found with optimal interspacing from tss  <cit> , hence suggesting that this constitutes the core promoter. of particular interest, two e-box sequences  and a mef <dig> motif  were identified within this ecr. further sequence comparisons, aligning orthologous sequences obtained from ensembl, confirms full sequence conservation of these identified myogenic motifs across multiple species , supporting a conserved functional role for these motifs .

in addition to the proximal ecr, a fully conserved e-box was also identified in the distal ecr β, located  <dig>  kbp upstream of the tss . this ecr may represent a skeletal muscle enhancer, with such enhancer's common upstream of other myogenic genes including desmin and muscle creatine kinase  <cit> . in summary our comparative analysis suggests that the cis hardwiring required for myogenic specific expression is contained within the  <dig> kbp 5'-upstream sequence with myogenic motifs identified in ecrs α and β.

cell specific activity of the ms <dig> promoter
on the basis of the comparative in silico analysis, a  <dig> bp fragment of rat genomic dna  was obtained by pcr. this dna fragment, encompassing the α and β ecrs, was sub-cloned into the promoterless pgl <dig> basic reporter plasmid and the activity of the resulting p-1585/+ <dig> construct was analysed in vitro. the p-1585/+ <dig> wild type promoter reporter  is approximately four times more active in the c2c <dig> myoblasts than in the nih 3t <dig> mouse fibroblasts. this data suggests that there is sufficient myogenic cis information encompassed within the promoter reporter to drive cell-specific activity in a myogenic cellular environment.

myogenic factors can modulate the ms <dig> promoter
since putative e-box and mef <dig> binding motifs are located within ecr α and β, the sensitivity of these motifs to the over-expression of their cognate binding proteins was determined. the rat ms <dig> promoter  was transfected into c2c <dig> myoblasts in the presence or absence of the specific mrfs and mef2d. in the presence of myod, ms <dig> promoter activity was dose dependently increased seven fold compared with control . myogenin alone or in combination with mef2d, shown to synergistically activate other myogenic promoters  <cit> , did not significantly activate the ms <dig> promoter . mef2d alone had no overall activating effect on the ms <dig> promoter.

to determine whether these effects were observed at the endogenous ms <dig> promoter, mrf and mef2d proteins were ectopically expressed in h9c <dig> cells, a rat myoblast cell line which can enter the skeletal muscle differentiation programme and expresses an array of skeletal muscle specific contractile and calcium handling proteins  <cit> . the expression level of endogenous ms <dig> mrna in both control  and mrf transfected h9c <dig> cells was determined by quantitative real-time pcr. myod over-expression  significantly increased ms <dig> mrna levels by two fold . myogenin and mef2d alone, or in combination, had no effect on endogenous levels of ms <dig> transcript, suggesting myod is the primary myogenic activator of the endogenous ms <dig> promoter in a myoblast cellular context. these results suggest that myod can target the ms <dig> promoter to enhance its activity, both in vitro and in vivo.

site directed mutagenesis of the ms <dig> promoter
myod activates target promoters via heterodimerisation with ubiquitous e2a proteins , which allows a stable dna binding complex to bind the e-box sequence . in order to asses the contribution of the three conserved e-boxes  in mediating myod sensitivity, we executed site directed mutagenesis of their binding sites within the ms <dig> promoter reporter construct .

*mutated oligonucleotides are indicated in bold and underlined.

reporter constructs containing mutated sequences for the three e-boxes, singular and in combination , were co-transfected with the myod over-expression plasmid into c2c <dig> myoblasts. mutating e <dig>  reduced promoter sensitivity to ectopic myod expression by 50% , suggesting this e-box  is important for promoter sensitivity to myod. the additional mutation in e <dig>  further attenuated promoter sensitivity to  <dig>  fold  . the combined triple e-box mutant  did not result in a further decrease in promoter sensitivity to myod compared to the double mutant . these results suggest that both e <dig> and e <dig>  but not e <dig>  are required for myod activation of the rat ms <dig> promoter.

the putative tata box  was also mutated exchanging the adenine, at second position for a guanine . this resulted in a dramatic 95% decrease in promoter activity  in c2c <dig> myoblasts. comparable loss of activity was observed in h9c <dig> myoblasts and nih 3t <dig> fibroblasts  suggesting loss of activity is not cell type specific. this suggests that this proximal tatt sequence represents a bona fide tata box.

in vitro binding of myod at distal and proximal e-box sequences
the present mutagenesis analysis suggests that e <dig> and e <dig>  but not e <dig>  play an important role in mediating myod sensitivity to the rat ms <dig> promoter. to further elucidate the biological importance of the e <dig> and e <dig> sequences, we synthesised specific oligonucleotides  containing the e-box elements present in ecr α and β, e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  these digoxigenin -labelled double-stranded oligonucleotides were then incubated with a cold myod binding consensus e-box sequence control in emsa experiments with whole cell extracts from c2c <dig> myoblasts. as shown in figure  <dig>  incubation of c2c <dig> whole cell extracts with both myod consensus and e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> sequences results in a specific dna-protein band shift.

the e <dig> and e <dig> shifted bands were successfully competed with excess unlabelled myod consensus sequence, suggesting these probes were bound by myod protein. in contrast, e <dig> could not be competed with unlabelled excess of myod consensus suggesting other e-box binding proteins are shifting e <dig> in vitro. all three e-box shifted bands were competed with unlabelled excess of self, confirming shifted bands were specific to each sequence .

in agreement with our mutagenesis analysis, our emsa data suggests that myod can target e <dig> and e <dig>  but not e <dig>  other e-box binding proteins expressed in c2c <dig> myoblasts are able to bind e <dig>  future experiments are aimed at determining their identity.

direct binding of myod to the endogenous ecrs within the ms <dig> promoter
our results suggest that the e <dig> and e <dig> sites are essential for ms <dig> reporter gene function. we then utilised chromatin immunoprecipitation  to determine whether myod is physically recruited to the endogenous ecrs in vivo, and determine the temporal dynamics of myod recruitment during c2c <dig> differentiation.

an ecr-specific quantitative pcr  was performed on formaldehyde-crosslinked, sheared chromatin isolated during c2c <dig> differentiation, which was immunoprecipitated with myod and igg specific antibodies. as shown in figure 6b, myod appears to be constitutively bound at the e <dig> domain during differentiation, thus myod binding precedes the induction of ms <dig> transcript . interestingly myod is not bound to e <dig> until day  <dig> , which coincides with transcriptional induction of ms <dig> during the differentiation process. a five-fold enrichment in relative binding of myod is present at day  <dig> compared to day  <dig>  with this level of enrichment maintained at e <dig> during the subsequent three days. these data suggest that myod targets both the e <dig> and e <dig> domains in vivo during c2c <dig> differentiation. however, temporal binding at e <dig> coincides with differentiation dependent transcriptional induction. we speculate that the ecr β represents a differentiation-dependent skeletal muscle enhancer, with temporal binding required for differentiation-dependent transcriptional induction of the ms <dig> promoter.

discussion
understanding the mechanisms through which srf activity is regulated during myogenesis is important if we want to expand our knowledge of the gene regulatory pathways and networks that drive skeletal muscle determination and differentiation. targeting and activation of muscle specific genes by srf is dependent on specific association with the powerful co-activators, mrft-a and -b, and rho-a signalling. we, and others, have recently shown the actin binding protein, ms <dig> , to be both required and sufficient for muscle specific activation of the rhoa/mrtf/srf signalling axis. therefore, understanding the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms governing ms <dig> expression will give us a key insight into how the mrtf/srf axis is regulated during myogenic differentiation.

as a first step towards understanding the transcriptional mechanisms governing ms <dig> expression in muscle differentiation, we analysed ms <dig> expression in differentiating c2c <dig> cells. a robust induction in ms <dig> expression was observed during the first day of differentiation suggesting ms <dig> is an early 'wave' myogenic transcript  <cit> . fernandez and colleagues  <cit>  have reported that c <dig>  myoblast fusion and differentiation is dependent on srf, as a consequence of its role in regulating myod expression. in addition, myod and srf have been shown to physically interact and syngerstically activate target promoters, with consensus sres enriched in bona fide myod target promoters  <cit> . considering this, one would expect srf activity to coincide with myod during early myogenic differentiation. we propose this early expression of ms <dig> drives muscle specific activation of the mrtf/srf axis, coupling this pathway with myod expression and activity.

an in silico comparative sequence analysis suggested that the proximal  <dig>  kbp 5'-upstream sequence would be capable of driving muscle specific transcription. within this region, two evolutionary conserved regions were identified, both of which were enriched with ultra conserved binding motifs for key myogenic regulatory factors. the proximal ecr also contained a conserved tata box located at the correct distance from transcription start site suggesting it constitutes the core promoter. this  <dig>  kbp promoter fragment was significantly more active in a muscle versus a non-muscle cell type  supporting the in silico derived hypothesis. it is of interest that in a recent study the proximal  <dig>  kbp 5'-upstream region of the mouse stars gene was able to direct transgenic lacz expression in adult skeletal muscle in vivo, thus supporting our in vitro data  <cit> .

we speculated that the ultra conserved myogenic regulatory motifs encompassed within this promoter fragment would be important for muscle specific activity. a significant increase in promoter reporter activity was observed with the ectopic expression of the mrf, myod. however myogenin and mef2d were not able to activate the ms <dig> promoter reporter in this myoblast cellular environment. this pattern of sensitivity was also the same at the level of endogenous ms <dig> transcription.

the observed specific sensitivity to myod complements the endogenous ms <dig> expression profile during c2c <dig> differentiation. myod is responsible for myogenic gene activation during early stages of differentiation  <cit> , the time at which ms <dig> transcription is induced. myogenin and mef <dig> proteins are themselves subsequently induced by myod, and in a combinatorial manner drive expression of late myogenic genes as well as consolidating and maintaining expression of early myogenic genes  <cit> . in addition this specific sensitivity may suggest that only myod and not myogenin can target the myogenic e-boxes within the ms <dig> promoter in a myoblast cellular environment. this is not uncommon, for example, myod targets myogenic e-boxes within the chicken mlc- <dig> promoter, which cannot be bound by myogenin  <cit> .

it is of interest that mef2c binding to the mef <dig> consensus sequence identified in our comparative analysis  has been shown to mediate basal and stress inducible cardiac specific promoter activity both in in vitro and in vivo . in addition, skeletal muscle specific deletion of the mef2c isoform at early, but not late times of embryogenesis, results in mice with disorganised myofibers that are perinatal lethal . our data  suggest that this mef <dig> motif in the ms <dig> promoter is not required for the initial myod mediated induciton of ms <dig>  however, our data do not preclude the possibility that mef2d may contribute to ms <dig> expression later in myogenesis or that other isoforms of mef <dig> may contribute to ms <dig> activation.

we hypothesised that the observed myod sensitivity was via specific targeting of myod to the ultra conserved e-box's, e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig>  located within the two evolutionary conserved regions. indeed, via site directed mutagenesis and electromobility shift assays, we demonstrated that e <dig> and e <dig>  but not e <dig> appear to be targeted by myod. surprisingly a significant level of myod sensitivity was retained in the triple e-box mutant. this may suggest the presence of other non-conserved e-boxes targeted by myod within the promoter reporter or alternatively be a result of the up-regulation of other myogenic transcription factors by myod, which subsequently target and activate the ms <dig> promoter at other motifs. it is of interest to note the presence of a conserved sre within the proximal ecr, which can be bound by srf in cardiomyocytes in vivo . myod upregulation is predicted to increase the activity of srf  <cit> , so it is possible for srf to target and increase activity of ms <dig> promoter independent of myod binding at e <dig> and e <dig>  it is also interesting to consider the up-regulation of the muscle specific isoform of mef2d , which we suspect may target the ms <dig> promoter in late stages of differentiation.

many muscle specific genes are activated at different times during the myogenic differentiation process. numerous studies suggest that this differential expression of each target gene is a product of specific temporal binding of myod at distinct e-boxes within the cis regulatory domains of the gene, which itself is coupled to chromatain modification and remodelling  <cit> . we therefore used chip to measure in vivo binding of myod at the ms <dig> e <dig> and e <dig> domains during c2c <dig> differentiation. our analysis shows that myod is constitutively bound at the proximal e <dig> domain during differentiation, with binding preceding the induction of ms <dig> transcript at day  <dig> . myod is capable of binding target sequences prior to gene activation, acting in a repressive manner via the specific recruitment of repressive chromatin remodelling complexes. interestingly, ms <dig> transcriptional induction at day  <dig>  coincides with myod binding at e <dig>  located within the ecrβ . this suggests myod targeting at e <dig> is required for transcriptional activation of ms <dig> and we therefore propose that ecrβ could represent a differentiation-dependent skeletal muscle enhancer.

prior to activating transcription, myod associated with hdacs serves to mark myogenic genes for subsequent differentiation cues and thus activation  <cit> . it is conceivable that myod binding at the ms <dig> promoter prior to differentiation primes the promoter in a 'poised' myogenic state. the recruitment of hdacs by myod causes the local chromatin environment to be compacted and will prevent the association of myod and other activating factors with specific cognate binding sites. however appropriate differentiation signals can stimulate myod to toggle between hdac and hat recruitment in addition to association with differentiation-specific myogenic factors  <cit> . this facilitates binding of myod with other e-boxes  and allows the formation of activating transcriptional complexes.

myod acetylation has recently been implicated as a central mediator of the temporal activation of muscle specific gene expression during myogenesis  <cit> . we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that during c2c <dig> differentiation an acetylated myod form with increased dna binding efficiency  <cit>  is capable of binding the e <dig> domain, resulting in the temporal activation of ms <dig> transcription. it is of interest that preliminary data indicate that trichostatin a, a hdac inhibitor, is able to increase ms <dig> transcript abundance in h9c <dig> myoblasts .

taking the present data together, we propose a model whereby myod binding at the ms <dig> proximal ecr in myoblasts represses ms <dig> transcription via the recruitment of hdacs. this proximal binding is essentially priming the ms <dig> promoter, placing it in a poised state for sensing appropriate differentiation cues. upon differentiation myod associates with hats and swi/snf, which subsequently causes remodelling of the local chromatin environment, allowing myod to bind e <dig> within the distal ecr or alternatively, temporally acetylated myod binds the e <dig> domain. further targeting of hats and specifically swi/snf complexes  can facilitate binding of tbp and other factors involved in polymerase ii pre-initiation complex formation and promote transcriptional elongation  <cit> . we thus speculate that temporal targeting of myod at e <dig> is required to establish the optimum environment for pol ii action and robust transcription.

in summary our data suggests that ms <dig> is a key component of a myod generated feed-forward regulatory circuit, where factors induced by myod  feed-forward to regulate late myod activity  at subsequent target genes, therefore acting to temporally pattern the timing of gene expression during skeletal myogenesis. this myod-ms1-srf feed-forward network would serve to consolidate and amplify the myogenic cascade. indeed srf itself acts in combination with myod to activate many downstream genes, thus, through the specific regulation of ms <dig>  myod is able to synchronize srf activity with its own and thus collaborate to mediate the temporal activation of downstream genes.

we believe this is the first study to demonstrate a direct link between myod activity and srf transcriptional signalling, with ms <dig> serving as the nodal point to integrate these two central myogenic regulatory networks. it is of interest that in cardiomyocytes ms <dig> serves a similar function in that it integrates the mef <dig> and srf signalling networks, providing a link for crosstalk between them  <cit> . this is thus a conserved emerging paradigm for ms <dig> function both in cardiac and skeletal muscle. in addition we have data to suggest that ms <dig> is capable of integrating the gata <dig> cardiogenic network with srf activity  <cit> .

this study also has implications for myogenic disease phenoptypes. igf- <dig> and il- <dig>  both central mediators of post-natal skeletal muscle regeneration are regulated by srf in response to stress  <cit> . therefore understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating ms <dig> expression may allow us to identify and develop therapeutic strategies for the up-regulation of ms <dig> gene expression in a disease phenotype, which would facilitate regeneration via stimulation of srf activity and resulting up-regulation of il- <dig> and igf- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
identification of direct transcriptional targets of myod and de-convolution of the transcriptional regulatory networks that operate in muscle cells represent an essential target if we are to understand not only how muscle differentiates but also how it responds to stress and damage, therefore allowing regeneration. we have demonstrated that via temporal binding of myod at distinct e-boxes within the ms <dig> promoter, ms <dig> potentially serves to integrate the myod and srf myogenic regulatory circuits, thus driving a feed-forward auto-regulatory circuit that consolidates and amplifies the myogenic phenotype. we believe this is the first study to describe a direct link between myod activity and srf signalling, with ms <dig> allowing cross talk to occur between these two independent myogenic networks. this implicates ms <dig> as a key factor involved in myogenic differentiation and potentially regeneration.
