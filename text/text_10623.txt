BACKGROUND
the endoplasmic reticulum  is an organelle in which the synthesis of secretory proteins and the folding and assembly of newly synthesized premature proteins occurs. when these functions are perturbed by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the er, the cells incur er stress conditions. er stress then induces countermeasures in cells referred to as the er stress response. the er stress response is a mechanism that maintains er homeostasis by balancing the folding capacity and folding demands imposed on the er through the induction of genes encoding chaperones and protein folding-related enzymes, the attenuation of translation, er-associated degradation, or regulated ire1-dependent decay   <cit> . severe er stress in cells ultimately induces programmed cell death. the mechanisms of the er stress response are conserved in eukaryotes such as yeast, mammals and plants.

the er stress response comprises several signaling pathways. in animals, er stress is sensed by the bzip-type transcription factor atf <dig>  a transmembrane protein activated by er stress-mediated proteolysis via site  <dig> and  <dig>  proteases  <cit> . perk , a transmembrane kinase, phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eif2a, resulting in a reduction of protein synthesis and the loading of proteins entering the er  <cit> . in rice, osbzip <dig> and osbzip <dig> may be regulated in a similar manner to that of atf <dig>  as truncated recombinant proteins lacking the c-terminal putative transmembrane domain  induce the er stress response  <cit> . furthermore, the membrane-associated bzip-type transcription factors atbzip <dig> and atbzip <dig> in arabidopsis also play key roles in inducing the er stress response  <cit> . atbzip <dig> and atbzip <dig> are also similar to atf <dig> in terms of structure and mode of action  <cit> . on the other hand, counterparts of perk have not been identified in plants.

ire <dig>  an er stress sensor protein, is highly conserved in eukaryotes, yeast, mammals and plants. ire <dig> is a transmembrane protein that has a kinase domain and a ribonuclease domain in its c-terminal cytosolic region. accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the er lumen induces dimerization of ire <dig>  autophosphorylation of the kinase domain and activation of the rnase domain  <cit> . activated ire <dig> is implicated in the unconventional cytoplasmic splicing of mrna encoding key transcription factors. substrates of the rnase activity of ire <dig> in yeast, mammals, arabidopsis and rice  include mrna encoding the hac <dig>  xbp <dig>  atbzip <dig> and osbzip <dig> bzip-type transcription factors, respectively  <cit> . the splicing of these mrnas results in the appearance of an activation domain  or a nuclear localization signal  through frame-shift of their translation products  <cit> . recently, ridd of mrnas was reported as a new type of er stress response in mammals, drosophila and arabidopsis. in ridd, ire <dig> mediates the degradation of mrnas encoding proteins that traverse the secretory pathway under er stress conditions  <cit> . in rice, we previously reported that ridd may cause a reduction in the number of mrnas encoding secretory proteins in er-stressed cells  <cit> .

we recently generated transgenic rice plants in which the single copy of genomic osire <dig> was replaced by two types of missense alleles by homologous recombination, leading to a deficiency of the kinase or ribonuclease  activity of osire <dig>  <cit> . this result was achieved by amino acid substitution of the essential lys residue of the kinase or rnase domains with ala . homozygous transgenic rice lines of k519a are not viable, whereas homozygous k833a lines exhibit normal vegetative growth in normal growth conditions  in spite of the loss of rnase activity , suggesting that the kinase activity of osire <dig> plays a vital role that is independent of its ribonuclease activity. on the other hand, in arabidopsis, double t-dna insertion mutant of atire1a and atire1b is viable, although this is more sensitive to er stress treatment than the wild type  <cit> . therefore, osire <dig> may have some unique characteristics that arose through the evolutionary process. we previously performed a dna microarray screen for osire1-dependent genes using osire <dig> knocked down rice plants in er stress condition  <cit> . however, the experiment was preliminary and did not covered whole er stress responsive genes.

in this study, we used rna sequencing as a tool to obtain detailed expression profiles of genes involved in the initial step of the er stress response in rice plants. microarray analysis is commonly used as a tool for transcriptome analysis. this technique has provided important information regarding the gene expression profiles of various biological species. however, although much valuable information has been obtained in rice by microarray analysis using the agilent 44 k microarray chip  <cit> , it remains possible that probes coding for some unidentified mrnas and non-coding rnas may not have been included in this chip. on the other hand, as data obtained from rna sequencing analysis can theoretically cover the complete transcriptome, data from rna sequencing is expected to complement and extend the current microarray data. thus, based on rna sequencing-mediated gene expression analysis, we performed a comparison of comprehensive expression profiles of wild-type and k833a rice plants under er stress conditions. using this rna sequencing technique, we identified novel er stress response-related transcripts.

RESULTS
comprehensive screening of er stress-responsive genes
to obtain detailed information about the expression profiles of genes involved in the er stress response in root tissues of rice seedlings, especially during the initial stages of the er stress response, we compared the expression profiles of plants in three pairs of treatment groups:  wild type without tunicamycin  treatment vs. wild type with a short period  of tm treatment;  wild type with dmso  vs. wild type with tm treatment; and  wild type with tm treatment vs. k833a with tm treatment. in addition, we constructed cdna libraries from plants in five different treatment groups  and sequenced 100 bp paired-end  reads from the libraries using illumina rna-seq technology. a total of  <dig> %- <dig> % of the total illumina reads aligned to the irgsp- <dig>  reference rice genome  sequence, while  <dig> – <dig> % aligned uniquely to the rice genome ,  <dig> – <dig> % represented unique junctions , and  <dig> – <dig> % returned multiple hits to the genome. approximately  <dig> million quality evaluated reads aligned to the rice genome and were used for further analysis . we estimated that the expression of  <dig>  genes was investigated in this rna sequencing analysis , which covered the entire rice transcriptome, based on its calculated size. thus, considering that  <dig>  genes can be investigated using the currently available rice 44 k microarray   <cit> , rna sequencing data are expected to be far superior to data provided from microarray analysis. in addition, rna sequencing is not limited to the detection of transcripts that correspond to annotated genes, allowing the identification of new genes.

first, we identified genes from the expression profile data with expression levels that were statistically altered by er stress. to eliminate the effect of solvent  on the expression profile data as much as possible, data from both the wild type vs. wild type with tm treatment, and the wild type with dmso only vs. wild type with tm treatment, were used for this analysis. while only three genes were differentially expressed in response to dmso in the wild type, robust changes in gene expression in response to tm were observed under our experimental conditions . thus, as dmso has little effect on the transcriptome of the root tissue of rice seedlings, accurate data regarding the er stress response could be obtained from the comparison of the wild type with dmso vs. wild type with tm treatment groups in the present study.

we identified  <dig> er stress-responsive transcripts that were unique matches to the sense sequences in the rice annotation project database  updated on april  <dig>   <dig>  and exhibited statistically significant changes in gene expression in response to er stress. furthermore, we identified six er stress-responsive transcripts that were not annotated by rap-db. therefore, a total of  <dig>  er stress-responsive transcripts were found by the statistical analysis of rna sequencing data. gene cluster picked up  <dig> candidates of er stress responsive genes, which included a few non-coding rna as well as normal genes encoding protein. among these transcripts, the expression of  <dig> genes was upregulated by tm treatment, whereas the remaining  <dig> genes were downregulated by this treatment . transcripts with expression levels that changed more than 5-fold  in response to tm treatment are shown in table  <dig>  further, same data are also shown as heat map . the profiles of er stress-responsive genes obtained from rna sequencing were quite similar to data that we previously obtained using microarray analysis, especially the upregulation of protein folding-related genes such as binding protein , heat shock protein  <dig>  protein disulfide isomerase-like , er oxidoreductase  <dig> , and calnexin  <cit> .

we used gene ontology  classification to assign the functional categories of rap-annotated, tm-responsive transcripts using go terms in the biological process category . these categories included transcripts for the oxidation-reduction process , which respond to oxidative stress  in a manner similar to that of the general stress response. transcripts for proteolysis , protein folding  and transmembrane transport  were also detected, which clearly validated the rna-seq expression profiling data obtained from rice tissue under er stress conditions.

among the  <dig> er stress-responsive transcripts annotated by rap-db, we identified  <dig> transcripts  that were not contained in the probe set on the rice 44 k microarray chip. therefore, we examined the relationship among the rap id numbers of these  <dig> transcripts, as well as their annotation regions, probe sequences on microarray chips, and mapping data from rna sequencing using visual observation . these  <dig> transcripts were divided into the following three categories:  the array probe sequence is localized outside of the cistron predicted by rap-db, but the mapping data from rna sequencing includes the region of the array probe sequence ;  the transcript is predicted to represent both the sense and antisense strands for one locus ; and  the array probe could not detect the transcript . it should be noted that in the rna sequencing method that we utilized , cdna libraries were primarily produced and were sequenced using an illumina high-seq  <dig>  thus, for case  <dig> transcripts, it was difficult to determine whether the transcript was derived from the sense or antisense strand at the mapped site unless the positions of exons and introns were quite different between the sense and antisense transcripts. therefore, we removed the transcripts corresponding to case  <dig> from the group of candidates for er stress-responsive genes. as a result,  <dig> of the  <dig> transcripts were ultimately considered to be candidates for er stress-responsive transcripts . additionally, table  <dig> is replaced with heat map data in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  on the other hand, six transcripts were identified as er stress-responsive transcripts that were not annotated in the rap-db. the rna sequencing mapping pattern of these transcripts on the rice genome showed that five of the six transcripts were apparently derived from genes. four transcripts were clearly upregulated by er stress and the rest were downregulated. one of the five transcripts was approximately 12 kb long. this gene has an approximately  <dig>  kb long terminal repeat  at both the 5′ and 3′ ends and includes domains encoding reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease h  in its internal region. at least ten copies of similar sequences are interspersed in the rice genome. these features are typically observed in copia-like class retrotransposable elements  <cit> . although this retrotransposable element is present in multiple copies with high homology in the rice genome, only one locus  exhibited an altered mapping pattern under er stress conditions. since this sequence has some clear characteristics of retrotransposable elements, further analysis of the relationship between this sequence and er stress will be performed in the near future. the remaining  <dig> transcripts  were identified as novel er stress-responsive transcripts from rna sequencing data, the rap-db and probe information of microarray . these  <dig> transcripts could not have been identified without the use of rna sequencing analysis.

transcripts named by os number are anotated by rap-db. the others  are non-anotated transcripts.

then, we performed quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis to determine whether these  <dig> genes exhibited the expected changes in expression under the same er stress conditions used for rna-seq analysis . as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression patterns of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were similar to those observed using rna sequencing. it should be noted that  <dig> of the genes have already been annotated on the rice genome in the rap-db, while the others have not yet been annotated . on the other hand, specific rt-pcr product could not be obtained from the remaining eight genes even under various pcr conditions because it is difficult to design of specific primer. alternatively, in light of the notion that our data theoretically include all possible transcripts in the rice tissue that was examined, some of the transcripts may have been derived from genes with faint levels of expression, resulting in the failure to produce pcr product by qrt-pcr amplification for these eight genes.

we also investigated expression levels of these  <dig> genes in k833a line treated or non-treated with tm . in eight er stress-upregulated genes, os07g <dig> os01g <dig>  xloc_ <dig> and xloc_ <dig> expression showed lower induction by tm than wild type with tm treatment but the other four genes were not observed an effect of k883a mutation on their expression changes under er stress condition. on the other hand, in nine er stress-downregulated genes, expression levels of os03g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os09g <dig>  os02g <dig> and xloc_ <dig> became less intense their reduction in k833a compared with wild type with tm. the other four genes were not detected clear difference their expression changes between the wild type and k833a .

the relationship between er stress-responsive gene and two er stress-response induction pathways
the induction of er stress response-related genes in plants is mainly controlled by two pathways, which in rice includes a pathway involving the osbzip <dig> and osbzip <dig> transcription factors, as well as the osire1/osbzip <dig> pathway  <cit> , while in arabidopsis, these pathways involve atbzip <dig> and atbzip <dig>  and atbzip60/atire <dig>  to discuss whether the  <dig> er stress-inducible genes  revealed by rna sequencing are regulated by the former  or latter  pathway, we compared the expression patterns of these genes in wild type vs. k833a plants treated with tm. if osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig> and/or unknown factor exclusively induce some gene expressions, fold changes between the wild type with tm and k833a with tm would be shown as similar level. on the contrary, in the case of that osire1/osbzip <dig> pathway exclusively induces some gene expression, their gene expressions would be increased in wild type with tm but be little changed in k833a with tm. if not only osbzip <dig> and osbzip <dig> but also osire1/osbzip <dig> pathway were involved in some gene expression, expression levels would be increased by tm treatment in both of wild type and k833a but their fold changes in wild type must be higher than k833a. however, there may be some exceptional genes. we consider that  <dig> er stress-upregulated genes isolated by rna seq analysis can be categorized into above four patterns.

we predictably observed four different types of expression patterns:  genes whose expression was induced by tm treatment in both the wild type and k833a ;  genes whose expression in k833a was moderately suppressed by tm treatment ;  genes whose expression in k833a was strongly suppressed by tm treatment ; and  genes with inconsistent expression patterns . we postulate that genes exhibiting the type  expression pattern are exclusively induced by osbzip <dig> and/or osbzip <dig>  but not by osire1/osbzip <dig>  whereas genes exhibiting the type  expression pattern are controlled by both pathways. furthermore, perhaps genes exhibiting the type  expression pattern are exclusively induced by the osire1/osbzip <dig> pathway under er stress conditions. ten representative genes exhibiting each type of expression pattern and their heat map are shown in table  <dig> and additional file 6: figure s <dig>  further, original data of the basis of table  <dig> is also shown as additional file 7: table s <dig>  incidentally, qrt-pcr analysis suggests that os01g <dig>  os01g <dig>  os11g <dig> and os11g <dig> are controlled by osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig> and/or unknown factor rather than osire1/osbzip <dig> pathway. os07g <dig>  os01g <dig> and xloc_ <dig> would be controlled by not only osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig> and/or unknown factor but also osire1/osbzip <dig> pathway. xloc_ <dig> may be exclusively regulated by osire1/osbzip <dig> pathway . the categorization results of os01g <dig>  os01g <dig> and os11g <dig> were not identical between the rna seq and qrt-pcr due to slight differences of their fold changes. because most of genes newly isolated as er stress responsive gene in this study show a tendency of relative lower level of expression in rice root, experimental error might be conspicuous in these genes.

* <dig> these genes are exclusively controlled by osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig> and/or unknown factor , namely, these genes showed little effect of k833a mutant on gene expression under the er stress condition. thus fold change between wt vs. wt with dtt and k833a vs. k833a with dtt showed similar in ‘little’ category genes.

* <dig> these genes are controlled by not only osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig> and/or unknown factor but also osire <dig> because these gene expressions are induced by tm treatment in even k833a plant but their expression levels are lower than wild type with tm treatment.

* <dig> these genes are exclusively controlled by osire <dig> pathway when er stress is occurred because these gene expressions are little induced by tm treatment in k833a plant but their expression levels are increased in wild type with tm treatment.

expression patterns of candidate ridd target genes
we previously reported that the transcript levels of some genes were reduced by ridd-like behavior under er stress conditions  <cit> . in the current study,  <dig> genes in the wild type were downregulated by 2 hr of tm treatment. ridd-like changes in expression were observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, i.e., the mrna levels of these ten genes were not clearly suppressed in the k833a line treated with tm . one of these ten genes, os03g <dig>  had already been considered a candidate ridd target gene in a previous study using microarray-mediated screening  <cit> . on the other hand, other candidate ridd target genes  that were characterized in previous studies did not exhibit ridd-like changes in expression in the current study. on the other hand, although only  <dig> genes as candidate of ridd target could be detected by analysis of rna seq data, os03g <dig>  os05g <dig>  os09g <dig>  os02g <dig> and xloc_ <dig> that were newly isolated as stress responsive genes by qrt-pcr analysis between the wild type and k833a may be also candidate ridd target genes from their expression pattern . since ridd-like changes in the expression of these genes had clearly been detected in response to 4 hr of tm treatment or 2 hr of 2 mm dtt treatment in rice root tissues  <cit> , perhaps clear ridd-like behavior of these genes was not detected in the current study because we only used 2 hr of tm treatment. in arabidopsis seedling, 5 μg/l tm treatment for 2 hr is sufficient to induces ridd response  <cit> . sensitivity against er stress inducer such as tm may be different between the arabidopsis and rice seedling. on the other hand, we initially expected that genome mapping of rna sequencing data would be able to reveal the initial stages of ridd since this technique reveals changes in the mapping patterns of genes even if their apparent expression levels are not altered. however, unfortunately, the expected data were not obtained by examining the mapping pattern of rna sequencing data under our experimental conditions. one possible explanation is that mrna degradation by ridd may be quite smooth reaction, so that we failed to detect mrnas which were partially digested by rnase activity of osire <dig> 

orthologous genes of newly identified er stress-responsive genes in arabidopsis
we examined whether orthologous sequences of these  <dig> transcripts exist in the arabidopsis genome by searching the arabidopsis information resource  database , and we investigated whether any such genes are also induced by er stress in arabidopsis. from data reported by nagashima et al.  and mishiba et al.   <cit> , nine transcripts  were assigned as homologs of genes 0in the arabidopsis genome, but homologs of the other eight transcripts were not detected. interestingly, os01g <dig>  os01g <dig> and os10g <dig> were reported as er stress-responsive genes in previous reports  <cit> , and the expression patterns of these individual homologous genes in response to the er stress inducer tm were similar between rice and arabidopsis.

prediction of micro rna target transcripts in er stress responsive genes
recently, mirna-mediated regulation in er stress response is reported  <cit> . thus we preliminary searched mirna target from  <dig> er stress-responsive transcripts using the search tool ‘psrnatarget’ on web page ‘mirbase database’  . fifteen  and  <dig>  genes were predicted as mirna target . further experiments need to verify the relationship between the mirna and these predicted genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed rna sequencing-mediated transcriptome analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the er stress response in rice. novel er stress-responsive genes that were not detected by microarray chip analysis were identified by rna sequencing. furthermore, we also obtained detailed expression profiles of genes involved in the er stress response by examining a unique disrupted osire <dig> line  deficient in rnase activity generated by homologous recombination as well as wild-type plants that were treated with the er stress inducer tm. the data provide important information regarding the osire1-mediated er stress response in rice. furthermore, the rna sequencing data obtained in this study will help improve the rap-db and enhance the development of a new microarray chip in the future.
