BACKGROUND
polyunsaturated fatty acids  are fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in their backbone. they include many important compounds such as essential fatty acids  that human beings and animals cannot synthesize and need to acquire through food. fish oil and vegetable oil supplements are the main sources of pufas. vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, contain about 7 % alpha-linolenic acid   and 52 % linoleic acid    <cit> . the optimal dietary fatty acid profile includes a low intake of both saturated and omega- <dig> fatty acids and a moderate intake of omega- <dig> fatty acids  <cit> . however, the majority of vegetable oils contains excessive amounts of omega- <dig> fatty acids but are deficient in omega- <dig> fatty acids, except for camelina oil and linseed oil. modulation of omega-3/omega- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios has important implications for human health.

camelina sativa is a flowering plant in the family brassicaceae and is usually known as camelina. this plant is cultivated as an oilseed crop mainly in europe and north america. the dominant fatty acids of camelina oil are omega- <dig> fatty acid  and omega- <dig> fatty acid   <cit> . importantly, camelina oil also contains high levels of gamma-tocopherol , which protects against lipid oxidation  <cit> . the fatty acid composition of camelina oil is especially suitable for human health. however, the mechanisms of polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis in c. sativa are still unknown. in recent years, researchers have paid more and more attention to camelina. hutcheon et al.  <cit>  characterized two genes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, fatty acid desaturase   <dig> and fatty acid elongase   <dig>  which revealed that c. sativa be considered an allohexaploid. the allohexaploid nature of the c. sativa genome brings more complexity in the biosynthesis of pufas. moreover, the functions of three csfad <dig> were further studied soon after  <cit> . furthermore, the genome of c. sativa has been sequenced and annotated  <cit> . c. sativa could also be used as a recipient to overexpress pufa synthesis genes and produce more pufas, such as omega- <dig> or omega- <dig> fatty acids  <cit> . in previous studies, the transcriptome analysis of c. sativa had carried out by  <dig> sequencing, illumina gaiix sequencing and paired-end sequencing  <cit> . however, the mechanism of pufa biosynthesis in c. sativa remains unclear and difficult to predict.

to comprehensively understand the molecular processes underlying the seed development of c. sativa, we characterized the transcriptome of seeds at different developmental stages. we generated  <dig>  clean reads and obtained  <dig>  unigenes from seed samples. we then matched the unigenes to  <dig> pathways and identified  <dig> pufa biosynthesis related genes. we verified the expression levels of  <dig> randomly selected genes from  <dig> up-regulated genes,  <dig> of which showed the same results in both qrt-pcr and sequencing. to our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide study of transcript profiles in c. sativa seeds at different developmental stages. the assembled, annotated unigenes and gene expression profiles will facilitate the identification of genes involved in pufa biosynthesis and be a useful reference for other c. sativa developmental studies.

RESULTS
lipid accumulation at different stages during seed development
to characterize the polyunsaturated fatty acid  synthesis genes in camelina, we quantified the lipid contents in camelina seeds harvested from  <dig> to 40 days after flowering . after testing, we found that the lipid content was very low in seeds at  <dig> daf. the lipid contents increased dramatically during  <dig> to  <dig> daf, reached a maximum level at  <dig> daf, and then remained steady until  <dig> daf . according to this result,  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf seed samples were used for transcriptome sequencing analysis to explore pufa synthesis genes.fig.  <dig> changes in lipid content during seed development. lipid content was determined every 5 days. values are means ± se . significant difference compared with the control  is indicated with an asterisk 



sequencing output and assembly
total rna was extracted from the seeds of c. sativa. the quality of rna and cdna were examined by electrophoresis and agilent <dig>  which were shown in additional file 1: fiugre s <dig>  the cdna libraries form  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf were subjected to  <dig> pyrosequencing. after sequencing, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  high-quality transcriptomic raw sequence reads were obtained from the  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf samples, respectively . to obtain clean reads, contaminating sequences, low quality reads, short reads, highly repetitive sequences and vector sequences were filtered out. finally,  <dig>  and  <dig>  clean reads were obtained from  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf with average lengths of 630 bp and 654 bp. furthermore,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were assembled based on the clean reads of these two samples. the size distribution of these unigenes is shown in fig.  <dig>  the longest unigene was  <dig>  bp. most of the unigenes  were distributed in the 200– <dig>  bp region, while unigenes of  <dig> – <dig>  bp length accounted for  <dig>  % of the total. of these genes,  <dig>  were unique to  <dig> daf and  <dig>  were unique to  <dig> daf . the differences in unique genes were of interest because of their potential importance at each stage.table  <dig> overview of sequencing, assembly and data statistics

transcriptional profile analysis of unigenes during seed development
differentially transcribed sequences were analyzed in the  <dig> daf and  <dig> daf samples to characterize the pufa synthesis genes. of the  <dig>  total genes,  <dig>  up-regulated genes  ≥ 1) and  <dig>  down-regulated genes  ≥ 1) were predicted to be significantly differentially expressed genes  in the  <dig> daf sample compared with  <dig> daf . the transcriptional levels of  <dig>  % of unigenes increased more than 2-fold in  <dig> daf and  <dig>  % of genes increased more than 2-fold in  <dig> daf . the differences in the expression of shared genes were of interest to discover pufa synthesis genes active throughout seed development. next, the unigenes were analyzed using the cog and kegg pathway databases for functional annotation.fig.  <dig> analysis of differentially expressed genes in the two samples. a conventional log <dig> ratio threshold  was used to identify the degs



functional annotation and classification
to identify which pathways they belonged to, the unigenes were annotated using the cog, kegg and other databases. the number of matched proteins in different databases was summarized in the additional file 2: table s <dig>  twenty-five functional categories were identified by cog classification . general function proteins represented the largest category, comprising about  <dig>  % of all unigenes. the next largest category was the “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones” group . “lipid transport and metabolism”, which we focused on, comprised about  <dig>  %. furthermore, gene annotation based on the degs was carried out. there were more up-regulated genes  ≥ 1) than down-regulated genes  ≥ 1) in all categories, except “cytoskeleton” .fig.  <dig> cog function classification of all unigenes. the unigenes were classified into different functional groups based on cog annotations

in the kegg pathway annotation,  <dig> pathways were matched as shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  kegg pathway network analysis showed that there are  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated unigenes in the “fatty acid biosynthesis” pathway in  <dig> daf  and  <dig> daf  samples, respectively. many genes encoding enzymes were found in this pathway, such as acetyl-coa carboxylase , enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase , 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase  and acyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase  . fabf, which catalyzes the condensation reaction of fatty acid synthesis by the addition of two carbons to an acyl acceptor, was down-regulated in this pathway. in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated genes were found in  <dig> daf  and  <dig> daf  in the “biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids” pathway . however, the only one gene encoding acyl-coa thioesterase  was matched to  <dig> reactions .fig.  <dig> fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in camelina. red rectangles indicate up-regulated genes and green rectangles indicate down-regulated genes. fabf: 3-oxoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase ; fabg: 3-ketoacy-acyl-carrier-protein reductase ; fabi/fabk: enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase ;  <dig> . <dig> / <dig> . <dig> : acetyl-coa carboxylase ;  <dig> .192: acyl-acp desaturase 



degs related to pufa biosynthesis
after gene functional annotation, we searched for fatty acid synthesis genes among the unigenes. we found  <dig> up-regulated fatty acid biosynthesis genes in the  <dig> daf sample . in this group,  <dig> pufa synthesis related genes were discovered . most of them were annotated as omega  <dig> fatty acid desaturase , delta- <dig> acyl-lipid desaturase  and long chain acyl-coa synthetase . omega  <dig> fatty acid desaturase and delta- <dig> acyl-lipid desaturase are desaturases that remove two hydrogen atoms from a fatty acid, creating a carbon/carbon double bond. they play an important role in pufa synthesis. long chain acyl-coa synthetase can activate long chain and very long chain fatty acids to form acyl-coas. all of these genes are worthy of further investigation in future studies of pufa synthesis.table  <dig> degs involved in the pufa synthesis pathway



validation of degs by quantitative real-time pcr
to confirm the expression data from  <dig> pyrosequencing, quantitative real-time pcr  was performed to analyze the expression of candidate genes. eleven up-regulated fatty acid biosynthesis related genes in  <dig> daf were selected for this verification, and 18s rrna was used as an internal control. only unigene <dig> was not consistent with the sequencing results. the other  <dig> unigenes showed largely consistent results between qrt-pcr and  <dig> pyrosequencing .fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr validation of selected unigenes. the fold changes of the unigenes were calculated as the log <dig> ratio  for qrt-pcr. kprm was selected to represent the  <dig> pyrosequencing results. values are means ± se with three replicates for each sample in qrt-pcr



discussion
oils extracted from plants have been widely used since ancient times in many countries. in addition, vegetable oils contain enhanced levels of health-promoting natural compounds and are associated with human health. however, researchers have found that a high intake of saturated and omega- <dig> fatty acids can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease  and cancer, in particular breast cancer, in recent years  <cit> . at the same time, omega- <dig> pufas were shown to have chemopreventive properties against various cancers and their complications, including colon and breast cancer  <cit> . these results suggest that a well-balanced omega-3/omega- <dig> fatty acid ratio will be beneficial for people’s health. therefore, it is essential to increase the content of omega- <dig> fatty acids and reduce the omega- <dig> fatty acid contents in vegetable oils. fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies and sardines, are a significant source of omega- <dig> long-chain pufas in the human diet  <cit> . with ocean exploitation increasing, reducing the amount of fish oil obtained from aquaculture is critical for sustainability and economic reasons  <cit> . a replacement for fish oil needs to be discovered urgently.

much work has been done to engineer a sustainable land-based source of omega- <dig> long-chain pufas. recently, the achievement of a high omega-3/omega- <dig> ratio through genetic and plant engineering was reported. the results indicated that both arabidopsis and camelina transgenic plants contained fish oil-like levels of dha  <cit> . therefore, mining and characterization of pufa biosynthesis genes are essential to improve the fa contents in plants by genetic engineering. in this study, our objective was to characterize the pufa biosynthesis pathway genes active during seed development using  <dig> pyrosequencing. the expression levels of fa biosynthesis genes are induced before the early events of seed development  <cit> . our results showed that lipid content increased significantly from  <dig> to  <dig> daf. thus,  <dig> and  <dig> daf samples were selected for expression profiling of camelina seeds. these results are in agreement with data published by lee et al.  <cit>  and luo et al.  <cit> .

by transcriptome sequence analysis, we obtained  <dig>  clean reads, from which  <dig>  predicted genes were subjected to blast annotation. the genome of c. sativa was sequenced recently and a total of  <dig>  protein-coding genes were annotated  <cit> . this result confirmed the quality of our sequencing of camelina seeds. to investigate the pufa biosynthesis pathway, we searched for fatty acid synthesis-associated genes across our sequencing results and found  <dig> up-regulated fatty acid biosynthesis genes in  <dig> daf sample. among them, several genes were characterized as key enzymes in fa biosynthesis . 3-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase  was reported to be an essential enzyme for type ii fatty acid biosynthesis and catalyzes an nadph-dependent reduction of 3-ketoacyl-acp to the -3-hydroxyacyl isomer  <cit> . another key enzyme, enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase , found in the fa biosynthesis pathway plays a determinant role in establishing the rate of fasii  <cit> . these results indicate that the genes shown in fig.  <dig> would play an important role in fa biosynthesis. further studies are needed to determine the functions of these genes.

in a previous study, oleic acid , la and ala were used as substrates for conversion to the beneficial omega- <dig> long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid  epa and dha  <cit> . the content of unsaturated fatty acids in camelina is higher than in most other plants. in this study, we found  <dig> up-regulated pufa biosynthesis-related genes in camelina seeds . twenty-one fad genes were found and  <dig> of them were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . ten up-regulated omega- <dig> fad genes were found during seed development . all of them were annotated as fad <dig>  which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum  membrane-bound desaturase catalyzing conversion of oa to la. similarly, the expression levels of most fad <dig> genes were consistent with the results of hutcheon et al.  <cit> . fad <dig> was characterized to have a key role in the pufa biosynthesis pathway in higher plant  <cit> . la account for about 93 % omega- <dig> fatty acid  in camelina seeds  <cit> , it will be mainly catalyzed by the omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturases. on the other hand, ala makes up about 30 % of the total fatty acid in camelina seeds  <cit> . three fad <dig>  and three fad <dig>  were found in camelina transcriptome . however, only one fad <dig>  was up-regulated during seed development. the expression level of unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> were induced slightly in  <dig> daf sample. unigene <dig>  unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> did not express in the  <dig> daf sample, but they specifically expressed in  <dig> daf sample. these results are consistently observed in the genome-wide analysis of fad <dig> in gossypium hirsutum. the transcript level of ghifad3- <dig> could be detected only in the early stage of g. hirsutum seed development  <cit> . in developing cotton fibers, the expression of ghifad3- <dig> was down-regulated in both wild and domesticated g. hirsutum varieties  <cit> . these results suggest that ala could be synthesized in the early stage of camelina and cotton developing seeds.

other genes involved in pufa biosynthesis were also found in this study, such as phosphatidylcholine diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase  and acyl-coa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase . triacylglycerol  can be formed via an acyl-coa-dependent or acyl-coa-independent process which catalyzed by pdat and dgat. the transcripts of  <dig> pdat and  <dig> dgat genes were found during camelina seed development stage . all of them were up-regulated in  <dig> daf sample. in previous study, overexpression of linum usitatissimum pdat and dgat gene were characterized to produce more ala in yeast strain h <dig>  <cit> . moreover, overexpression of lupdat in arabidopsis seed resulted in an enhanced level of pufas  <cit> . these results indicated that both pdat and dgat might have critical role in the tag and pufa biosynthesis in camelina seeds. additionally, long chain acyl-coa synthetases  are key enzymes responsible for the conversion of acyl-amp to acyl-coa during fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . here, we characterized  <dig> acsl genes and  <dig> of them were up-regulated during seed development . therefore, the identified changes in gene expression in c. sativa may facilitate pufa biosynthesis and the identification of related genes. this study will provide a resource for further studies on individual genes associated with fatty acid biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
according to the pyrosequencing,  <dig>  clean reads were obtained and  <dig>  unigenes were predicted. all unigenes were analyzed with gene annotations from cog, kegg, nr, nt and swissprot databases. among them,  <dig> up-regulated genes were identified as fa synthesis related genes ,  <dig> of them are involved in pufa biosynthesis . fifty-nine unigenes encoding fad <dig>  fad <dig>  pdat, dgat and acsl genes were found in the camelina transcriptome, most of them were up-regulated in the  <dig> daf seeds. this transcriptome results provide a novel insight into the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. this research might represent a powerful tool to understand the molecular mechanisms of seed development and the result might be helpful for further gene expression, functional genomic studies and camelina molecular breeding.
