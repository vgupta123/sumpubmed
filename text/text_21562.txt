BACKGROUND
anopheles funestus is widely distributed in africa from south of the sahara desert to northern south africa  <cit> . the highly anthropophilic and endophilic behaviors of this vector make it an efficient vector of malaria, and in many places, parasite infection rates of an. funestus exceeds those of an. gambiae. in south africa, indoor house spraying with the insecticide ddt had successfully eradicated malaria transmission by an. funestus. however, after ddt was replaced by pyrethroids in  <dig>  resistance to the latter insecticides developed rapidly, and there was a dramatic increase in malaria transmission in kwazulu/natal province, accompanied by the finding of an. funestus resting inside insecticide sprayed houses  <cit> . subsequent surveys of southern mozambican an. funestus also showed high levels of resistance to a variety of pyrethroids  and the carbamate propuxur  <cit> , suggesting that the pyrethroid resistant an. funestus in south africa had arrived from neighbouring mozambique where an. funestus has remained abundant  <cit>  and transmits malaria perennially  <cit> .

the two major causes of insecticide resistance are alterations in the target sites and increases in the rate of insecticide metabolism. three enzyme families, the cytochrome p450s, the esterases and glutathione s-transferases , are primarily responsible for metabolic resistance  <cit> . both field populations and a laboratory-selected colony of an. funestus from mozambique show elevated levels of cytochrome p450s in pyrethroid resistance populations  <cit> . cytochrome p450-based pyrethroid resistance also occurs in east and west african an. gambiae  <cit>  although in west africa the p <dig> mechanism is at a much lower frequency than the altered target site  resistance mechanism  <cit> . the appearance of a p450-based pyrethroid resistance in southern african an. funestus had an immediate and significant effect on malaria transmission in south africa prompting a switch back to ddt in south africa and the introduction of the carbamate, bendiocarb in mozambique  <cit> . however, resistance to these alternative insecticides has already developed in an. arabiensis in south africa  <cit>  and hence effective resistance management strategies are imperative in this region. identification and characterization of the specific p <dig> genes involved in pyrethroid metabolism in resistant insects is an important step towards this goal.

the cytochrome p <dig> enzyme family is very extensive in insects  <cit> . only a small subset of these enzymes is likely to be involved in insecticide metabolism. partial sequences of approximately thirty p <dig> genes from three families  have already been identified in an. funestus  <cit> , and here we report the physical mapping of a subset of these genes to the an. funestus polytene chromosomes. we also describe the first application of quantitative trait locus  mapping in this malaria vector. qtl mapping techniques have been successfully used in other mosquito vectors to examine complex phenotypes including vectorial competence  <cit>  and insecticide resistance  <cit> . the qtl approach has never been used in an. funestus mainly because of the difficulties associated with colonization of this species and the lack of available genetic markers. however, the recent establishment of two laboratory colonies of an. funestus  <cit>  and the construction of a preliminary genetic map  <cit>  have paved the way for the current study. in this paper we report the genetic and physical map position of a qtl associated with pyrethroid resistance in an. funestus.

RESULTS
linkage mapping
data from the eleven families were used to build a combined genetic linkage map by genotyping a total of  <dig> f <dig> individuals at  <dig> loci . three linkage groups were resolved instead of four in the previous map  <cit> , with each linkage group corresponding to one of the three chromosomes. the linkage map of the x chromosome with  <dig> markers was  <dig> cm in length compared to  <dig> cm for five markers previously.  <dig> markers were mapped to chromosome  <dig> for a genetic distance of  <dig> cm compared to  <dig> cm for  <dig> markers previously. one linkage group was resolved for chromosome  <dig> instead of two previously with  <dig> markers giving a genetic distance of  <dig> cm which is well below the total distance of  <dig> cm for  <dig> markers observed in the first map. the average resolution for each chromosome is  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm respectively for chromosome x,  <dig> and  <dig>  the total length of the current map is  <dig> cm with an average resolution of  <dig>  cm/marker.

qtl mapping
genotype-phenotype associations
we used χ <dig> goodness-of fit tests to identify loci statistically  associated with pyrethroid resistance in each family, the null hypothesis being that resistance or susceptibility to pyrethroids is equal in each genotype class. significant loci are indicated in table  <dig> 

for family  <dig>  we found significant associations between four loci and resistance to pyrethroids. two of these loci  were semi-informative  for this family and the others  were fully informative. for 7p6p <dig>  83% of f <dig> individuals with an "aa" genotype  and 30% of f <dig> heterozygous "ab" died after  <dig> h exposure to permethrin. these values are significantly different and also oriented in the anticipated direction. this trend is repeated for marker 3p6p <dig> where 100% of homozygous "aa" and 44% of heterozygous "ab" f <dig> individuals died after exposure to permethrin. for locus ache, mortality rates of 80% for f <dig> "aa" homozygous individuals, 64% for heterozygous "ab" and 23% for homozygous "bb"  were obtained. a similar pattern is seen for locus afnd <dig> .

for family  <dig>  statistically significant associations were found between genotypes at three loci  and the resistance trait. these loci showed a similar pattern of association with pyrethroid resistance as in family  <dig>  a high mortality rate was observed in "aa" homozygous f <dig> individuals  while mortality was low in "bb" individuals .

for family  <dig>  only two markers  were statistically associated with pyrethroid resistance. again, the mortality rate was higher in f <dig> "aa" homozygotes  than in f <dig> "bb" homozygotes .

this analysis indicates some important factors linked to the inheritance of pyrethroid resistance trait. all four loci associated with the resistance trait are located on chromosome 2r  suggesting that a locus or loci that affect resistance to pyrethroids is located within this region of the genome. furthermore, plotting resistance against genotypes  also suggests that alleles at these loci are additive in their effect on resistance.

we next used interval mapping , composite-interval mapping and multiple-interval mapping to predict the location of this qtl. three families with a sample size of more than  <dig> f <dig> progeny  were independently analyzed for the presence of qtl associated with pyrethroid resistance.

for family  <dig>  a qtl was detected at the end of chromosome 2r with both im and cim  between markers 7p6p <dig> and 3p6p <dig> already found to be associated with pyrethroid resistance by χ <dig> goodness-of fit tests. the lod scores associated with this qtl are  <dig>  and  <dig> by im and cim respectively. no qtl were detected on chromosome x and chromosome  <dig>  multiple-interval mapping confirmed the presence of this qtl  and estimated that its genetic variance  accounted for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance  for pyrethroid resistance . most of the genetic variance  was attributable to additive effects . two additional qtls were detected in this family after refining the mim model by searching and testing for new qtls. these were located at  <dig> cm on chromosome x between markers g <dig> and funq and at position  <dig>  cm on chromosome  <dig> between markers nd <dig> and fub <dig> . these qtl were not detected by any other analysis method, nor were they found in other single family analysis.

for family  <dig>  using im and cim, we detected a qtl on chromosome 2r between markers 7p6p <dig> and 3p6p <dig>  at a similar position to that in family  <dig>  this qtl was located at  <dig>  cm with 7p6p <dig> as the nearest marker. the lod scores for this qtl were  <dig> and  <dig>  with im and cim respectively . with mim, only one significant qtl was detected which, in this family, accounted for  <dig> % of phenotypic variance  . additive effects accounted for the majority of the genetic variance. we have named this qtl rp <dig> for resistance to permethrin  <dig>  no qtl was detected on chromosome  <dig> and no genetic linkage was constructed for chromosome x in this family due to a lack of informative markers on this chromosome.

in families  <dig> and  <dig> , the markers 7p6p <dig> and 3p6p <dig> were not informative and only low lod scores were observed at markers at the end of 2r chromosome. however when using multiple-interval mapping, we detected the same qtl as that observed in families  <dig> and  <dig>  the lod score for this qtl in family  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively with composite-interval mapping, which is considerably smaller than that observed for families  <dig> and  <dig>  this is probably due to the small sample size  and the lack of informative markers in this region of the genome. in families  <dig> and  <dig>  as in family  <dig> , additive effects accounted for the majority of the genetic variance.

physical mapping of rp <dig> qtl
the genes implicated in insecticide resistance in other species  were physically mapped to the an. funestus polytene chromosomes in order to locate possible candidate resistance genes within the boundaries of the qtl. the location of these genes is shown in figure  <dig> and the map position of these genes and of their orthologs in an. gambiae is shown in table  <dig>  there is a high level of synteny between an. funestus and an. gambiae in the location of these genes. with the exception of cyp6m <dig> and cyp6p <dig>  all of the an. funestus probes hybridized to the expected chromosome arms according to the established synteny between the two species  <cit> . cyp6m <dig> in an. funestus is found on chromosome 2r instead of the predicted 2l and cyp6p <dig> was located on 2l arm and not 2r as expected.

five cyp <dig> p450s physically mapped to chromosome arm 2r, within the region of rp <dig> qtl . these included cyp6p <dig> and cyp6p <dig> from which two snp loci,  were identified. in agreement with the physical mapping data, we found that these snps were closely linked to rp <dig> in all families for which these markers were informative.

the kdr locus is located on chromosome 3r, division  <dig>  and is not linked to pyrethroid resistance in the fumoz-r strain of an. funestus. again this agrees with the chromosomal location determined for this gene in a. gambiae . no amino acid substitutions were found in the amplified  <dig> bp fragment of the voltage gated sodium channel gene in the fomuz-r strain compared to the field samples of an. funestus and the classical kdr leucine substitution at position  <dig>  associated with pyrethroid resistance in many insect species, was not found in an. funestus.

the fragment of the ache gene sequenced encompasses the common ace- <dig> mutation site associated with insensitive ache in an. gambiae  <cit> . we did not detect this mutation in the an. funestus ache.

discussion
to detect qtl associated with resistance to pyrethroids in an. funestus, we constructed a linkage map of this species using combined data from  <dig> families generated from reciprocal crosses between a susceptible and permethrin resistant strain. the average resolution of  <dig>  cm/marker is similar to the resolution of the published an. gambiae microsatellite map  <cit> . the present an. funestus genetic map uniformly covers the entire genome of an. funestus with a similar marker density for chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  this genetic map represents a significant improvement from the previous published map of  <cit> .

the rp <dig> qtl that affects an. funestus susceptibility to pyrethroids was consistently identified in both reciprocal crosses and in the majority of the families , demonstrating the importance of this qtl. generally the lod scores associated with the rp <dig> qtl were well above the thresholds determined by permutation analysis using both interval mapping and composite-interval mapping. the rp <dig> qtl was most closely associated with markers 7p6p <dig> and 3p6p <dig> on chromosome 2r regardless of the analytical method employed . such correlation between different methods and consistency between different families represent a strong indication that the qtl identified in this study reflects the detection of a true locus involved in resistance to pyrethroids in an. funestus. the percentage of phenotypic variance explained by rp <dig> differed significantly between families. the different genetic backgrounds of these families could explain the differences observed. the variance explained by rp <dig> in family  <dig>  could also represent a better reflection of the percentage of variance explained by this qtl than that observed in family  <dig> , as the two closest markers to rp <dig>  7p6p <dig> and 3p6p <dig>  were fully informative in family  <dig> but only semi informative in family  <dig>  hence, only half of the genetic information at these loci was available in family  <dig>  the rp <dig> qtl appears to present a major effect since it explains more than 60% of the variance for pyrethroid resistance. in general, our results suggest that resistance to pyrethroids is a quantitative trait under the control of at least one qtl.

the family sizes used in this study were generally low because it is difficult to colonize an. funestus. the low sample sizes may have prevented the identification of additional qtls of minor effect. small sample sizes are more adequate to detect qtl with large effect such as rp <dig> but have limited power to detect smaller qtls  <cit> . this may explain why only one confirmed qtl has been identified in this study. a denser marker map might also have a greater power to detect minor qtl and to separate any linked genes located within rp <dig>  the numbers of actual qtl have been underestimated in studies involving qtl of large effect  <cit> .

in family  <dig>  two additional qtls other than rp <dig> were identified on chromosome  <dig> by multiple-interval mapping. however when the genotypes of markers linked with these qtls were tested for association with pyrethroid resistance using the χ <dig> goodness-of fit test, no association was found. results from interval mapping and composite-interval mapping did not indicate the presence of qtl around the positions indicated by these mim results. we believe that these additional qtls are spurious and need to be confirmed in larger families with a greater number of genetic markers.

the region of the genome where the rp <dig> qtl was identified contains a cluster of cytochrome p <dig> genes belonging to the cyp <dig> family. indeed, the two snp markers  most closely linked to rp <dig> are located within two cyp <dig> genes. elevated cytochrome p <dig> activity has been implicated as the major mechanism conferring pyrethroid resistance in an. funestus  <cit> . the molecular basis of cytochrome p450-mediated insecticide resistance may involve cis or trans regulation of the transcription of a p <dig> gene  <cit> . it is also possible, although uncommon, that resistance may be caused by a change in the p <dig> amino acid sequence increasing the affinity of a p <dig> for pyrethroids  <cit> . in an. gambiae, a qtl has been mapped in the vicinity of a p <dig> gene  shown to be over-expressed in a resistant strain  <cit> . to study the molecular mechanism of the pyrethroid resistance in the fumoz-r strain, and to see if additional minor pyrethroid resistance qtls exist in the population, we are establishing advanced intercross lines and identifying additional genetic markers to better define the interval in which the rp <dig> qtl is mapped.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study reports the first qtl mapping study in an. funestus, one of the most important malaria vectors. this study suggests that metabolic resistance mechanism is playing a significant role in pyrethroid resistance in an. funestus since we did not found any evidence either from direct sequencing or qtl mapping, that mutations in the target site are involved in pyrethroid resistance in an. funestus. the rp <dig> qtl identified here represents a first step toward a fine mapping of genes involved in this resistance trait and by combining this approach with functional characterization of p <dig> genes on chromosome 2r we will elucidate the molecular basis of pyrethroid resistance in this malaria vector.
