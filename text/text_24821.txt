BACKGROUND
one of the loci responsible for feather development in chickens was described by serebrovsky in  <dig>  <cit>  and is designated by the symbol k, standing for 'kürzer flügel'   <cit> . the k allele is associated with the late feathering phenotype  that causes a retard in the emergence of primary and secondary flight feathers. the k+ allele is associated with the early feathering phenotype , resulting in the earliest emergence of feathers. the k allele appears to be incompletely dominant to k+, resulting in phenotypes with different intensities due to a dosage effect of the locus  <cit> . for more detailed information about the feathering loci, see the extensive review by chambers et al.  <cit> .

in birds, sex is determined by two chromosomes, z and w. males are homozygous zz and females are hemizygous zw. the k locus is located on the z chromosome and can be utilized to produce phenotypes that distinguish between the sexes of chicks at hatching, but also at the embryonic stage  <cit> . this method of sexing based on differences in the rate of feather growth provides a convenient and inexpensive approach.

although the lf phenotype facilitates the sexing of chicks, the k allele is also associated with a reduction in egg production, an increase in infection by lymphoid leucosis virus  <cit> , and an increase in the mortality rate  <cit> . these negative side effects may be caused by the presence of the endogenous retrovirus  <dig>   <cit> . concordance between expression of ev <dig> and the lf phenotype indicated a linkage of less than  <dig>  cm between k and the ev <dig> locus  <cit> . the ev <dig> locus consists of an integration site that can be occupied  or unoccupied . ef animals were found to have only one unoccupied site per z chromosome; whereas, lf animals have at least one z chromosome with an unoccupied and an occupied site  <cit> . a study on the organization of the k allele concluded the integration of ev <dig> into one of two large homologous segments located on the z chromosome of lf chickens  <cit> . ef revertants carrying an occupied site have been observed; therefore, it was concluded that ev <dig> itself could not be the sole cause of the lf phenotype  <cit> .

several tests have been developed to identify the ef and lf alleles  <cit> . these tests focused on the presence of the occupied and unoccupied site in the genome. unfortunately, even if these methods are fully informative when applied to females, they do not allow for differentiation between homozygous and heterozygous males. furthermore, the existence of ev21-positive ef animals will give false-positive results with these tests.

in this study we present a detailed molecular analysis of the k locus and develop a dna test to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous late feathering males.

RESULTS
molecular analysis of the k locus
a quantitative pcr  approach, as described by weksberg et al.  <cit> , was used to investigate the k locus. copy number variation was determined at fourteen markers  designed to surround the ev <dig> integration site . in two chickens, the most likely location of the duplicated block was mapped between markers sts_ <dig> and sts_ <dig> . marker sts_ <dig> and marker sts_ <dig> gave ambiguous results .

1genomic location on the z-chromosome in basepairs , 2marker sts_ <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig>  3in late feathering animals only.

 <dig> br: broiler, wl: white leghorn. normal font indicates a Δkct ≤  <dig> . an italic font indicates a Δkct > <dig>  and < <dig> . a bold font indicates a Δkct ≥  <dig> .

to determine the size and orientation of the duplicated block, forward and reverse primers were designed for both ends . a  <dig> bp product was obtained spanning the breakpoint junction  in two late feathering males. with this marker, no pcr product was obtained from the dna of the two ef birds. sequence analysis of the pcr product obtained from the two lf males provided the exact breaking point. based on the washuc <dig> assembly, the total length of the tandem duplication is  <dig>  bp . the tandem duplication of this region results in the partial duplication of two genes: the prolactin receptor  and the gene encoding sperm flagellar protein  <dig> . the duplicated block included exons  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> bp of exon  <dig> of prlr, and exons  <dig> to  <dig> of spef <dig> . no differences in the nucleotide sequences of the breakpoint junction fragments were observed between the broiler and white leghorn animals.

to validate the duplication, a pcr reaction was performed with a new marker spanning the breakpoint junction . the experiment was performed on twelve ef and twelve lf animals from eight different lines. no band was observed for the ef animals; whereas, all lf animals showed the  <dig> bp band corresponding to the breakpoint junction.

to obtain information about possible aberrations at the ends of the duplication, both regions were sequenced . no sequence differences were found between the lf and wildtype  animals.

dna test to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous late feathering males
the breakpoint junction was used to develop a taqman-based dna test that can distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous lf males . two taqman markers were used: one outside the duplicated block  was used as a control and one spanning the breakpoint junction  was used for investigating the duplication . two minor groove binding -probes were designed for these markers, the mgb-control probe  was labeled with the fluorescent dye vic and used for the control marker sts_control, and the mgb-break probe  was labeled with the fluorescent dye fam and used for the breakpoint junction marker sts_break. to validate the taqman k test,  <dig> animals were tested in duplicate. eight randomly selected reference animals  were used to determine the range of k/k and k/k+ animals in each experiment . seventeen animals with known genotypes were used to validate the ranges . in the first experiment, an animal was considered k/k if the Δct was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  or k/k+ if the Δct was between  <dig>  and  <dig> . for the second experiment, the range of Δct for k/k was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for k/k+. based on these calculations,  <dig> % of the animals in the first experiment were within the ranges of their known genotype , and  <dig> % were outside either range . no animals were false positive . in the second experiment,  <dig> % of the animals were correctly assigned,  <dig> % were unassigned and no animals were incorrectly assigned. in total,  <dig> of the  <dig> validation animals  were correctly assigned,  <dig> animals  were unassigned and no animals were incorrectly assigned.

the seventeen animals were validated based on the ranges found for k/k and k/k+. for experiment  <dig>  the Δct range for k/k was  <dig> – <dig>  and for k/k+  <dig> – <dig> . for experiment  <dig>  the Δct range for k/k was  <dig> – <dig>  and for k/k+  <dig> – <dig> .

discussion
the detailed molecular analysis presented in this study confirmed the presence of the duplication first described by iraqi and smith  <cit> . the total size of the tandem duplication is  <dig>  bp, which is in agreement with the estimated  <dig> kb  <cit> . sequence analysis found that the duplication is similar in both broiler and white leghorn lines, and all  <dig> lf animals showed the  <dig> bp breakpoint junction fragment  indicating that the duplication is similar in all animals. this suggests that the duplication was of the same origin for all three breeds, and that the duplication most likely occurred in a common ancestor. on the other hand, since the k allele is extensively used by breeders, it is also likely that this particular allele was introduced into all three breeds.

in theory, the values of unaffected and duplicated markers should be equal to  <dig> or  <dig>  respectively, in the qpcr experiments. however, Δkct varied from - <dig>  to  <dig> , and markers sts_ <dig> and sts_ <dig> had ambiguous results . this variation is likely to be due to biological variations and the fact that the experiment was only performed once with two animals.

the observed duplication could be the result of an unequal recombination event in the z chromosome. however, no apparent sequence homologies are found in the two areas involved in the duplication. therefore, the unequal recombination event is not supported by our data, although a nonhomologous recombination event can not be excluded. alternatively, integration of ev <dig> resulted in the duplication at the k locus. this raises the possibility of additional duplications at other locations in the chicken genome, which contains approximately  <dig>  copies of long terminal repeats  belonging to the vertebrate-specific class of retroviruses  <cit> . however, the actual ends of the duplicated block are located approximately  <dig> kb upstream and  <dig> kb downstream of the ev <dig> integration site, making this possibility less likely.

a pcr amplicon spanning the breakpoint junction is sufficient for distinguishing lf birds from ef birds. in males however, the challenge was to be able to differentiate between lf homozygous  and lf heterozygous  animals. in this study, we found that the duplicated block is specific for the k allele and it was used to develop a dna test based on the breakpoint junction. since the pcr reactions in the taqman k test are performed in a multiplex, the concentration of dna, theoretically, has no influence on the Δct. this contributes to the robustness of the test since variations in the concentration of dna between and within test and control animals does not have an influence on the results. the Δct value gives an indication of the haplotype of an animal. in theory, when Δct is equal to  <dig>  the animal is heterozygous, and when Δct is equal to  <dig>  the animal is homozygous . in the taqman k test experiments, the homozygous reference animals had an average Δct of  <dig>  and  <dig> , and the heterozygous reference animals had an average Δct of  <dig>  and  <dig>  . this difference from the theoretical value was most likely caused by the different efficiencies of the markers.

the aim was to develop a highly reliable test that is convenient for intensive use. the reliability of the test was defined by the percentage of correctly and incorrectly assigned animals. the taqman k test was validated using eight reference and seventeen validation animals in duplicate. of the validation animals tested,  <dig> % were identified correctly,  <dig> % were unassigned, and no animals were incorrectly assigned . based on the literature, no previous test has been capable of identifying lf homozygous and lf heterozygous males with this level of reliability.

although the lf phenotype facilitates the sexing of chicks at hatching, expression of ev <dig> is associated with the negative side effects of the k allele  <cit> . the establishment of a line where late-feathering is not associated with decreased egg production and tolerance to exogenous avian leucosis virus infection would be of prime commercial interest. obviously, the search for the k allele lacking the occupied site is an effective approach. this search for revertants and the establishment of a line can be done by combining the taqman k test and the ev <dig> test proposed by tixier-boichard  <cit> .

the observed duplication resulted in the partial duplication of two genes: prlr and spef <dig> . the genes are oriented in opposite directions; therefore, the duplication event does not result in a fusion gene. however, alternative transcripts of the partially duplicated genes may be found. interestingly, the transcript of both partially duplicated genes could contain the antisense sequence of the other gene, which could lead to rna interference and influence the translation of both the duplicated and original genes.

the membrane-bound prlr is closely related to the growth hormone receptor and is a member of the cytokine receptor family  <cit> . the pituitary hormone, prolactin , is a ligand of prlr. more than  <dig> separate biological activities have been attributed to prl: reproduction, endocrine signaling and metabolism, control of water and electrolyte balance, growth and development, neurotransmission and behavior, and immunoregulation and protection  <cit> . more detailed functions of prl include involvement in the control of seasonal pelage cycles  <cit> , egg production  <cit> , and the induction of molting  <cit> . furthermore, prl is involved in the immune system  <cit> , autoimmune diseases, and the growth of different forms of cancer  <cit> .

in prlr  knockout studies on mice, the normal progression of hair replacement and follicle development have been observed  <cit> . these knockout mice showed a change in the timing of hair replacement and molting, and both phenotypes are advanced compared to the wild type. it was concluded that knocking out prlr shortens the telogen phase of the hair cycle and advances the anagen phase of hair follicles  <cit> . therefore, it can be suggested that prlr plays an inhibitory role in follicle activation.

the relatively unknown protein, spef <dig>  is believed to play an important role in the differentiation of axoneme-containing cells  <cit> . truncation of the spef <dig> protein results in immotile short-tail sperm in pigs  <cit> . due to the presence of an atp/gtp binding site and a proline rich domain, it was suggested that spef <dig> might be involved in signal transmission  <cit> .

the actual cause of delayed feathering is still unknown. it can be speculated that prlr, due to its inhibitory role in follicle activation, is the major candidate gene involved in this delay. spef <dig> may be involved in the transmission of signals in the feather growth pathway. further research is needed to confirm the involvement of these genes, which could focus on 1) the truncated proteins formed by prlr or spef <dig> as a result of the partial duplication, 2) the transcripts of the partially duplicated genes and their influence on the expression and translation of the two original genes, and 3) the expression of  prlr and spef <dig> that may have changed due to the rearrangement, duplication, or deletion of regulatory elements.

although it has been extensively described that ev <dig> causes the negative side effects of the k allele, the findings of this study might also indicate involvement of prlr. as described above, prolactin and its receptor are involved in the growth of different forms of cancer  <cit> , egg production  <cit> , and in the immune system  <cit> . because the negative side effects of the k allele include an increase in infection by lymphoid leucosis virus, an increased mortality, and a reduction in egg production, it can be speculated that the partial duplication, altered expression, or altered translation of prlr might also be involved in the negative side effects. if the partial duplication of prlr is responsible for the delay in feather growth, and contributes to the negative side effects, it will not be possible to separate the advantageous and disadvantageous effects of the k allele.

CONCLUSIONS
the detailed molecular analysis presented in this study indicates the presence of a  <dig>  bp tandem duplication in the k allele. an identical duplicated block is found in broiler, white leghorn, and brown layer lines. the duplication results in the partial duplication of two genes: prlr and spef <dig>  due to its inhibitory role in follicle activation, prlr is the most likely candidate gene involved in the delay of feather growth. however, spef <dig> may be involved in the transmission of signals in the feather growth pathway.

in addition to the characterization of the k locus, a dna test was developed to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous late feathering males. the percentage of animals correctly assigned was  <dig> %, while  <dig> % were unassigned. no animals were incorrectly assigned. to date, this is the most reliable and robust dna test developed to differentiate between lf homozygous and lf heterozygous males, and would be indispensable in decreasing errors generated by crossing animals with incorrect genotypes.
