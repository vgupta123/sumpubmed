BACKGROUND
xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous  is a red-pigmented moderately psychrophilic growing yeast  <cit> . it is a basidiomycete classified among the tremellomycetes in the order cystofilobasidiales together with cystofilobasidium, xanthophyllomyces, and a clade containing mrakia/mrakiella and several anamorphic species of tausonia/guehomyces, itersonilia, and udeniomyces  <cit> . however, it is currently unclear whether the cystifilobasidiales are the most basal group in the tremellomycetes, or whether cystofilobasidiales should be excluded from tremellomycetes in order to assure its monophyly  <cit> . because the cytofilobasidiales are deeply rooted within the agaricomycotina, they may be of key importance for understanding the evolution of this group. xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous was originally isolated from exudates of betula species and other broad-leave trees  <cit> . later it was also isolated from leaves of nothofagus trees and stromata of the tree’s biotrophic fungal parasite cyttaria spp.  <cit> . xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous possesses a homothallic life cycle  <cit> . a sexual reproductive cycle can be initiated by application of sugar alcohols  <cit>  leading to sexual conjugation between cells of the same strain from which a long holobasidium with terminal spores is formed. most publications show that x. dendrorhous is diploid  <cit> . however, electrophoretic chromosome separation in another strain  <cit>  indicate that at least some strains may be haploid.

xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous has two evolutionary special metabolic features. one is the synthesis of astaxanthin which is considered unique among fungi. the other is the fermentation of sugar to alcohol under oxidative conditions  <cit> . astaxanthin serves as an antioxidant, quenching reactive oxygen species to protect x. dendrorhous from damage by oxidative stress  <cit> . its biosynthesis is via the mevalonate pathway to the formation of β-carotene with enzymes similar to other carotenogenic fungi  <cit> . however, all steps of 3-hydroxylation and 4-ketolation at both terminal β-ionone rings leading to the formation of astaxanthin are carried out by a very unique p <dig> monooxygenase. this protein, asy, belongs to the 3a subfamily  <cit> ; electrons are provided by a specific cytochrome p <dig> reductase  <cit> . although the astaxanthin concentration in wild-type strains of x. dendrorhous is too low for commercialization, attempts have been made to increase the astaxanthin yield developing x. dendrorhous as a production system for this carotenoid. the most promising yields were obtained by a combination of classical random mutagenesis followed by systematic engineering of the whole biosynthesis pathway  <cit> .

given the interesting position within the largest group of basidiomycetes, the agaricomycotina, its special metabolic features mentioned above related to acetyl-coa derived pathways and its biotechnological potential, it was the aim of this study to elucidate the genome sequence for a phylogenomic investigation for the agaricomycotina and to elucidate its acetyl-coa metabolism. the latter is important to obtain tools for the analysis and the modeling of these biotechnological import pathways.

RESULTS
genome assemblies, completeness assessment and repeat elements
three illumina libraries of insert size 250 bp , 3 kb  and 8 kb , were sequenced on an illumina hiseq machine with 100 bp paired-end chemistry to generate the whole genome sequence of x. dendrorhous. after filtering raw reads using  <dig> phred score as average read quality cutoff and a 100 bp length cutoff,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of reads were left in the 250 bp, 3 kb and 8 kb insert libraries, respectively. genome assemblies were done with the velvet genome assembler  <cit>  using the three different libraries with various k-mer lengths. the genome assembly resulted in a total of  <dig> scaffolds , the nuclear genome was of  <dig>  mb in size in  <dig> scaffolds and the mitochondrial genome of  <dig>  kb in  <dig> scaffolds. more than 70% of the genome was assembled into just  <dig> scaffolds, all of which were longer than  <dig>  mb, and 98% of the genome was represented by  <dig> scaffolds .figure  <dig>

after generating the genome assembly, all three libraries were mapped to the assembled genome, and around  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the used reads could be mapped back to the assembled scaffolds. the genome completeness and continuity of the assembled genome were assessed by using the cegma pipeline. around  <dig> % of the  <dig> core eukaryotic were recovered, indicating the high quality of the genome assembly. repeat element predictions revealed  <dig> % of repeat elements in the genome of x. dendrorhous. classification of repeat elements was done by using transposonpsi, and as the most abundant ones,  <dig> gypsy and  <dig> ty1_copia retrotransposons were predicted in the assembled genome.

protein encoding genes and annotations
both ab-initio and transcript alignment-based methods were used to generate the gene models for x. dendrorhous. these predictions generated  <dig> protein coding genes. functional annotations of the predicted proteome using panther and interpro revealed  <dig>  and  <dig>  protein sequences, respectively, which could be assigned with a function.

protein subcellular localization
the subcellular localization of x. dendrorhous proteins was predicted using protcomp <dig>  and  <dig> proteins with mitochondrial,  <dig> with peroxisomal,  <dig> with nuclear,  <dig> with cytoplasmic and  <dig> with plasma membrane localisation were predicted. secretome predictions using signalp <dig> , targetp, and tmhmm resulted in a set of  <dig> proteins predicted to be secreted.

coa-related pathways
the two major acetyl-co a derived biosynthesis pathways in x. dendrorhous are terpenoid and fatty acid biosynthesis. typically, terpenoids in fungi are synthesized via the mevalonate pathway  <cit> . as outlined in figure  <dig>  this pathway starts with the condensation of three molecules of acetyl-coa and proceeds via mevalonate and its diphosphorylation to isopentenyl pyrophosphate. the reactions of this pathway are catalyzed by six enzymes. all of these could be identified in the x. dendrorhous genome by comparison to the corresponding genes from related fungi . the gene numbers are given next to the corresponding reactions in figure  <dig>  an alternative non-fungal route to isopentenyl pyrophosphate is via deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate  <cit> . all genes of this pathway are absent from the x. dendrorhous genome.figure  <dig>

after isomerization of isopentenyl pyrophosphate to dimethyl allyl pyrophosphate, the prenyl pyrophosphate chain is extended by condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate molecules with an allylic partner . in addition to the gene encoding isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase, two different prenyl transferases genes were detected encoding the enzymes for the formation of either farnesyl pyrophosphate the direct precursor of sterols or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate the direct precursor of carotenoids . the genes encoding isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase  <cit> , geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase  <cit>  and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase  <cit>  have been cloned before from x. dendrorhous. recently, it has been shown that these prenyl transferases act sequentially  <cit>  as indicated in figure  <dig>  ergosterol is the dominating sterol especially in higher fungi  <cit> . its biosynthesis pathways is established in figure  <dig> corresponding to the identified erg genes. the genes assigned and listed in table  <dig> encode the enzymes of the early steps including squalene synthesis, epoxidation and cyclisation to lanosterol and the genes involved in modification of this sterol. the reaction sequence involves a c- <dig> demethylase, a c- <dig> reductase, a c- <dig> dehydrogenase and a c- <dig> keto reductase yielding zymosterol. next conversions are by c- <dig> methyl transferase to fecosterol by a c- <dig> isomerase to episterol and by a c- <dig> desaturase and a c- <dig> reductase to the final pathway product ergosterol. among all genes of this sterol pathway, erg  <dig> is the only gene cloned before from x. dendrorhous  <cit> .figure  <dig>

in fungi, multiple fatty acid synthesis options are present which is structurally differently organized  <cit> . in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes, fatty acid synthesis operates with a multi-enzyme fatty acid synthase  comples  with discrete functional domains for the individual reactions organized on two polypeptides. in addition, an independent mitochondrial  synthesis pathway exists in fungi which uses independent enzymes  encoded by separate genes  <cit> . in x. dendrorhous, the dominating fatty acids are palmitic, oleic and linoleic acid . figure 4a shows the biosynthesis pathway to these fatty acids catalyzed by type i fas. the synthesis starts with the acetyl coa carboxylase and the acyl carrier protein . the following reactions, the formation of acetyl-acp and malonyl-acp, condensations, ketoacyl reduction, the dehydratase reaction, and enoyl reduction all the way to palmityl-coa are catalyzed two multi-enzyme complexes fas <dig> and fas <dig>  the sequences of the individual domains could be identified and located on both fas genes . the additional genes involved in the elongation of c <dig> to c <dig> fatty acid and the insertion of a delta- <dig> and a delta- <dig> double bond were also identified in the x. dendrorhous genome. for the latter desaturase, we found two candidate genes.figure  <dig>

secondary metabolism analyses
genes involving in the secondary metabolism apart from terpenoids were predicted by using the smurf  <cit>  online web server and secondary metabolite clusters were defined. only one polyketide synthase  like and two non-ribosomal peptide synthetases  like genes were predicted from the genome of x. dendrorhous. two candidate secondary metabolite clusters were predicted . backbone genes of these clusters have been listed in the additional file 1: table s <dig>  further interpro domain analyses of the pks-like gene predicted a beta-ketoacyl synthase  domain, an acyl transferase  domain and an acyl carrier protein  domain within xden_ <dig> 

orthology analyses among tremellales
xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous protein sequences were tested for orthology with the two other available tremellomycetes genomes, i.e. cryptococcus neoformans  and tremella mesenterica. a total of  <dig> orthologs are shared by all of the three genomes,  <dig> orthologs are shared by only x. dendrorhous and c. neoformans, while c. neoformans and t. mesenterica  share  <dig> orthologs not present in x. dendrorhous  , highlighting that x. dendrorhous is not closely related to c. neoformans, supporting the splitting of the tremellomycetes into the cystofilobasidiales on the one hand and the core tremellomycetes  on the other.

phylogenetic analyses
phylogenetic analyses were done using  <dig> fungal genomes , including the genome of x. dendrorhous. orthologs among these genomes were identified, and a total of  <dig> orthologs were predicted in all these  <dig> genomes. of these,  <dig> were 1: <dig> orthologs, which were used to perform the phylogenetic analyses. the maximum likelihood tree generated using raxml was supported by high to maximum support for all nodes and revealed a sister-group relationship of agaricomycotina and ustilaginomycotina . wallemia was placed basal within the agaricomycotina and x. dendrorhous appeared as sister taxon to c. neoformans and t. mesenterica. in general, the tremellomycetes with xanthophyllomyces, but without wallemia, were revealed as monophyletic and to be the sister clade to the remaining agaricomycotina. for the agaricomycotina, the dacryomycetes were confirmed as the sister-group to the agaricomycetes. within the agaricomycetes, the auriculales occupied the basal position, followed by the hymenochetales, which were revealed as the sister-group of the other agaricomycetes included with maximum support. boletales and agaricales were found to group together with maximum support and formed the sister group to a clade comprising the orders corticiales, gloeophyllales, russulales, and polyporales. within this group, which was supported by a 94% bootstrap support, the former as well as the latter two orders were grouped together with maximum and high support, respectively. this is also in line with the results of the bayesian phylogenetic inference .figure  <dig>

discussion
genome assembly and completeness
over the past few years next generation sequencing technologies have extensively been used to elucidate the whole genome and transcriptome of fungal species  <cit> . in this work illumina sequencing have been used for sequencing the genome and transcriptome of a red-pigmented yeast, xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. the of the fact that more than 70% of the genome were represented by only  <dig> scaffolds of more than  <dig>  mb in size and that 98% of the genome was covered by just  <dig> scaffolds highlights that the genome has been assembled almost to chromosome-length scaffolds. the high quality of the genome assembly is also suggested by a recovery of about  <dig> % of the core eukaryotic genes in a cegma analysis. this is most likely the result of using an appropriate combination of short paired-read as well as long distance mate-pair libraries and the fact that the strain we sequenced appears to be haploid. the low content of repeat elements of only about  <dig> % further facilitates the genome assembly.

secondary metabolite encoding genes have been described in several fungal genomes  <cit> . the x. dendrorhous genome encodes for only one polyketide synthase like gene and two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase like genes. this suggests a limited ability to produce biologically active substances as expected for species not depending on keeping other organisms at bay.

agaricomycete phylogeny
in line with earlier phylogenomic studies using fewer taxa  <cit>  a sister-group relationship of agaricomycotina and ustilaginomycotina was inferred. with respect to septal pore ultrastructure it was interesting to note that with the inclusion of the cystofilobasidiomycete x. dendrorhous, wallemia spp. remained in the most basal position within the agaricomycotina. the septal pore apparatus of wallemia with the typical tremelloid sacculate parenthesomes closely resembles that of the core tremellomycetes , whereas the dolipores of cystofilobasidiales lack parenthesomes  <cit> . thus either the typical tremelloid sacculate parenthesomes at the septal pores were lost in the cystofilobasidiales lineage, or have convergently evolved in wallemia and the core tremellomycetes, assuming that it is unlikely that the complex tremelloid parenthosomes have evolved twice, a loss of the tremelloid parenthosomes in the cytofilobasidiales seems to be the more parsimonious explanation. in this sense the evolution of the agaricomycotina was apparently accompanied by the evolutionary development of parenthesomes at the septal pores that may improve the cell to cell communication  <cit> .

in addition, our study shows with optimal support the monophyly of the group consisting of tremellomycetes and cystofilobasidiales. based on morphological, ultra-structural, chemical, ecological and molecular data, the monophyly of the tremellomycetes  has been suggested by various authors  <cit> . however, this had not been previously supported by molecular phylogenetic studies  <cit> .

within the agaricomycetes, the phragmobasidial auriculales were in a basal position and the hymenochaetales with holobasidia were placed basal to the crown-group of the class. in contrast to an earlier phylogenomic study  <cit> , phylogenetic relationships within the crown of agaricomycetes showed a high resolution. the recently-described orders gloeophyllales and corticiales  <cit>  were clustered together with maximum support, in line with the overview provided by hibbett  <cit> , and placed basal to a clade containing the agaricomycetidae  and a second clade that included polyporales and russulales. the sister-group relationship of polyporales and russulales was supported by a bootstrap support of 98% in the phylogenomic analysis and is in contrast to the result from a multi-locus dataset  <cit> , which discussed the order russulales as a sister group to the agaricomycetidae. the same topology was obtained using bayesian inference, with high support .

coa-related metabolic pathways and beyond
the two prominent terpenoid pathways in x. dendrorhous lead to the synthesis of sterols and carotenoids. they are of biotechnological importance due to the ongoing development of this fungus as a biological astaxanthin production system  <cit> . in addition, it offers the potential for the hetrologous synthesis of novel sesquiterpenes like α–cuprene  <cit>  or diterpenes instead of carotenoids. annotation of all genes of terpenoid synthesis in x. dendrorhous starting with the mevalonate pathway and ending with ergosterol and astaxanthin was successful . among these were the genes of two different prenyl transferases which sequentially provide c <dig> farnesyl pyrophosphate for sterol and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate for carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous possesses a unique astaxanthin synthase related the cytochrome p <dig> 3a subfamily with an unknown phylogenetic origin  <cit> . the highest similaritiy to fungal cytochrome p <dig> oxidases was found in cryptococcus neoformans, but with only 36% identity.

the genes for specific biosynthesis pathways are often clustered in fungal genomes. this is not the case for sterol and carotenoid biosynthesis in the genome of x. dendrorhous and is in contrast to carotenogenic fungi from other groups in which these genes are organized in clusters. all carotenogenic fungi possess the crtyb and crti genes. for example in phycomyces blakesleeanus and mucor circinelloides, both genes are found next to each other with a spacing of  <dig>  or  <dig>  kbp, respectively, but convergently transcribed  <cit>  and in fusarium fujikuroi, they are  <dig>  kbp apart and transcribed together in the same direction  <cit> .

another important group of compounds originating from acetyl-coa are the fatty acids. in the x. dendrorhous genome, the genes for the cytoplasmic pathway and the mitochondrial pathway could be discriminated . the latter operates on individual enzymes  <cit>  for which all genes could be annotated. the gene organization of the cytoplasmic pathway is more complex. in ascomycetes, the genes for two fatty acid synthase proteins  <dig> and  <dig> exist with all necessary eight enzymatic activities . in contrast, most basidiomycetes like laccaria, coprinopsis and ustilago possess a single very large protein with all necessary fatty acid synthesis activities  <cit> . however, this is not the case in x. dendrorhous. here, we found the genes for two distinct fatty acid synthase proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  which resembles the situation in the related species cryptococcus neoformans. however, we were unable to identify the subunit of the acyl-carrier protein, neither on fas <dig> as in yeast nor on fas <dig> as in c. neoformans  <cit> .

even under aerobic conditions, x. dendrorhous grows fermentative on glucose accumulating ethanol, which, at the beginning of the stationary phase, is re-used as growth substrate  <cit> . since carotenoid biosynthesis is highest in the oxidative phase, it is important to understand the unknown regulatory mechanisms responsible for optimum astaxanthin synthesis on different substrates. the whole genome sequence of x. dendrorhous now provides a source to address the genes of the primary metabolism, providing a basis for transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis. this should be helpful to look for regulatory circuits and metabolic networks which supply acetyl-coa as substrate. the current study also provides genomic data from a species of the agaricomycotina for setting up a basis for the comparison with other fungi to investigate how the c <dig> and c <dig> terpenoid pathways have developed.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study provides the first insights into a genome of a cystofilobasidiomycete and reveals that wallemia is the most basal agaricomycotinous lineage, followed by the tremellomycetes with a sister-group relationship between the cystofilobasidiales and the core tremellomycetes. thus, this study provides further insights into the evolution of agaricomycotina and suggests that the typical cisternal caps  at the septal pores represent an apomorphic characteristic for the argaricomycotina in general. accordingly, the lack of parenthesomes at the septal pores may be apomorphic only for the cystofilobasidiales. phylogenomic investigations also support a sister-group relationship of agaricomycotina and ustilaginomycotina. within the agaricomycotina, the phylogenetic relationships of the species included were resolved with high to maximum support and provided evidence for a sister-group relationship of polyporales and russulales. with respect to the biotechnological potential of x. dendrorhous, the genome sequence will extremely facilitate genetic pathway engineering of secondary products. all genes of acetyl-co a derived pathways could be annotated. they can be used to overproduce existing fatty acids and sterols in addition to carotenoids or extend these pathways yielding new products. furthermore, the accessibility of genes of the primary metabolisms is extremely helpful to model and engineer an optimum precursor supply.
