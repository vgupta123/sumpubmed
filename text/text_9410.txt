BACKGROUND
cholesterol oxidase  is a fad-dependent bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation and isomerization of cholesterol  to cholest-4-en-3-one  while dioxygen is finally reduced to h2o <dig> as by-product. the enzymatic overall cholesterol oxidation comprises three steps. in the first one the 3β-oh group of cholesterol is oxidized to the corresponding ketone  with the concomitant reduction of the fad cofactor. in a second step an isomerization of the double bond from the Δ5- <dig> position to the Δ4- <dig> position takes place. the fad is recycled in a redox reaction with dioxygen, yielding hydrogen peroxide 
 <cit> . the substrate range of described choa enzymes is not exclusively bound to cholesterol and the conversion of methanol, propan-2-ol and allylic alcohols has been described
 <cit> . the overall enzyme structure comprises two domains, the fad binding domain and the substrate binding domain. fad can either be bound non-covalently  or linked covalently to a histidine residue of the apoprotein . a conserved fad-binding sequence  has been described in the n-terminal region of choa from streptomyces sp., brevibacterium sp., and rhodococcus equi <cit> . however, the overall amino acid sequences of the two classes do not show high homology
 <cit> . cholesterol oxidases are found exclusively in bacteria and have been described in various species including brevibacterium sp., nocardia erythropolis, streptomyces sp., rhodococcus sp., and pseudomonas fluorescens. the enzymes from these organisms are all commercially available. in some cases the enzyme is secreted , but it can also be membrane-bound , or be produced intracellularly . the enzyme from brevibacterium sp. has been expressed recombinantly in e. coli and in streptomyces lividans <cit> . cholesterol oxidase producers can be divided into non-pathogenic bacteria, which use cholesterol as carbon and energy source, and pathogenic bacteria, which utilize cholesterol oxidase for infection by converting the cholesterol of membranes, thus causing damage by altering the physical structure of the membrane
 <cit> . therefore, and since no eukaryotic enzyme homologues exist, this type of bacterial cholesterol oxidase qualifies as potential target for a new class of antibiotics
 <cit> . an important diagnostic application of the enzyme is the determination of cholesterol in food and blood serum with electrochemical biosensors and based on a cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase coupled reaction
 <cit> . the enzyme has also been found to be insecticidal, and transgenic plants have been designed with in situ insecticide activity
 <cit> . moreover, the enzyme has been used as biocatalyst in the synthesis of high value intermediates for industrial steroid drug production and also as tool for studying biological membranes
 <cit> .

it has been reported that in biotransformation reactions whole cells of chryseobacterium gleum were successfully used for the biotransformation of cholesterol to androsta- <dig> -diene- <dig> -dione, which is a precursor of antifertility drugs , androgens and the diuretic drug spironolactone
 <cit> . this strain might therefore be an ideal candidate for strain engineering in order to optimize such biotransformation approaches. in this study, a novel cholesterol oxidase from chryseobacterium gleum dsm  <dig>  was cloned, expressed in e. coli, purified, and biochemically characterized. moreover, we confirm that enzymatic reactions with purified cgchoa and cholesterol as substrate yields cholest-4-en-3-one as reaction product by hplc-ms analysis. the isolated enzyme might thus be useful in fields focused on the biosensing of cholesterol.

RESULTS
in silico amino acid analysis of choa variants
for the identification of a novel bacterial cholesterol oxidase, a protein blast search was performed using the cholesterol oxidase amino acid sequence from streptomyces sp.  as template. protein sequences of choa were retrieved from public databases, aligned using the clustalw algorithm of the megalign software , and analyzed in order to identify conserved residues possibly important for the catalytic activity. out of numerous homologues, the gene choa encoding a hypothetical protein  annotated as cholesterol oxidase was found in the fully sequenced genome of chryseobacterium gleum atcc  <dig> . the gene was selected for cloning and recombinant expression in e. coli.

the amino acid sequence of cgchoa carries the typical sequence of the rossmann fold 2gxgxxgx28hxhe, where x is any amino acid and h an hydrophobic one, between v <dig> and e <dig> in the n-terminal region. this indicated that cgchoa is an fad-binding protein
 <cit> . alignment to selected well-studied cholesterol oxidases and phylogenetic analysis indicated a higher similarity of cgchoa to the non-covalent fad-dependent enzymes belonging to the class i family . the lack of a signal peptide indicated the intracellular localization of the enzyme in the native host. using sequence alignment, cgchoa was analyzed for the presence of residues reported to be important for the catalytic activity
 <cit> . more in detail, residues n <dig> and y <dig>  reported to contribute to the stabilization of the cofactor in the reduced form in the cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces sp. sa-coo were found conserved in cgchoa, e.g. n <dig> and y <dig>  similarly, amino acid e <dig>  corresponding to e <dig>  in the cholesterol oxidase from streptomyces sp. sa-coo, that is supposedly involved in the catalytic process by facilitating deprotonation of the substrate was conserved in cgchoa.

the cdna sequence encoding cgchoa was cloned into the expression vector pqe- <dig> such that the final construct pcgchoa coded for an n-terminal his-tag mrgshhhhhhgsac fused to cgchoa. the wild-type cgchoa amino acid sequence  of c. gleum dsm  <dig>  showed  <dig> % identity to that from streptomyces sp. ,  <dig> % identity to that from b. sterolicum ,  <dig> % to that from mycobacterium tuberculosis  and  <dig> % to that from chromobacterium sp. . the cgchoa cholesterol oxidase with the n-terminal his-tag consists of  <dig> amino acids and has a hypothetical molecular mass of  <dig>  kda.

expression of cholesterol oxidase from c. gleum choa in e. coli
the gene choa from c. gleum dsm  <dig> contains 8% rare codons with respect to the codon usage of e. coli. therefore, the expression host e. coli jm <dig> was additionally transformed with the prare <dig> plasmid, which encodes extra copies of genes coding for trnas recognizing the codons agg, aga, aua, cua, ccc, gga and cgg. e. coli jm <dig> cells producing cgchoa in the absence of prare <dig> showed only low activity. in the presence of prare <dig>  the choa gene was expressed at 30°c, but the protein was found in inclusion bodies. activity could only be detected in the insoluble fractions. only when the cultivation temperature was decreased to 16°c immediately after induction, soluble and active protein was present.

protein purification and characterization
protein purification was carried out using a ni-affinity chromatography and subsequently a size exclusion chromatography step. the apparent molecular mass of the expressed cgchoa was around  <dig> kda, when visualized on a sds-polyacrylamide gel . yields of around  <dig>  mg/l culture of purified and enriched cgchoa were usually obtained. protein bands obtained in sds-page were analyzed by tryptic digestion, subsequent ms analyses, and in silico processing using mascot search program . the band above 55 kda was confirmed to be cgchoa by tryptic digest and maldi-ms/ms. the lower band of approximately 30 kda of lane  <dig>  was found to be a houskeeping transferase and isomerase as proven by tryptic digestion and maldi ms/esi-ms. the molecular mass of the native protein cgchoa in solution was estimated to be about 85 kda by size exclusion chromatography on a superdex 200 pg column. the estimated mass was somewhat higher than 60 kda, but lower than for a theoretical dimer with 120 kda, which indicates that the functional enzyme is rather a monomer than a dimer in solution.
 <cit> . inset: sds-page before and after purification of cgchoa. lane 1: cell free extract; lane 2: protein after imac purification; lane 3: purified sample after sec. the band corresponding to cgchoa is indicated by the arrow.

purified cgchoa had a yellow colour and its spectrum showed the characteristic absorbance peaks of flavin-binding proteins . heat-treatment was used to assess the possible covalent binding of the flavin cofactor to cgchoa apoprotein
 <cit> . the purified enzyme sample after size exclusion chromatography was boiled in the dark for 5 min and centrifuged. a spectrum of the supernatant was recorded between 260–700 nm and showed a typical pattern of an fad spectrum with two absorption maxima at 370 nm and 470 nm
 <cit> . only fad that is non-covalently associated with the enzyme is detectable by this method, as covalently bound fad co-precipitates with the protein
 <cit> .after ni-affinity chromatography, the partially purified protein was subjected to a ph-screen for best activity in different buffers. first, various buffers were tested as shown in figure 
 <dig> . as the enzyme performed using  <dig>  m mops buffer, this buffer was tested between ph 6– <dig> and at molarities between  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m. it was found that cholesterol oxidase activity in the coupled assay was highest using  <dig>  m mops at ph  <dig> , as shown in figure 
 <dig> . all subsequent measurements were therefore performed in this buffer. a temperature dependency study was also performed in a similar way. cgchoa maximum activity was measured at around 35°c . the ph, molarity and temperature screens were performed with cholesterol oxidase from different purification batches that had been stored for different periods prior to use. calculated volumetric activities as presented in figure 
 <dig> can therefore not be compared directly. however, the overall trend is valid.

the cholesterol-oxidizing activity of purified cgchoa was assayed at 35°c using  <dig>  m mops, ph  <dig>  buffer in a horseradish peroxidase  coupled assay.  <dig> cholesterol solutions from  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  mm were prepared and cgchoa initial activity was determined. we tested abts, pyrogallol red and o-dianisidine as hydrogen peroxidase substrates and found only minor changes. however, the amount of co-solvent had a significant influence. as control also e. coli jm <dig> cells transformed with the pqe- <dig> vector as empty vector control were tested and additionally the e. coli jm <dig> transformed with pcgchoa after incubation and induction with iptg as described. after lysis of the cells no conversion of cholesterol could be detected in the empty vector control. no michaelis-menten behaviour was found for cgchoa preparations using cholesterol prepared and diluted in: only water, water with triton x- <dig>  and water with triton x- <dig> and taurocholate, and in these cases and sigmoidal-like curve was obtained when plotting the data obtained . when the substrate was prepared and diluted in water and taurocholate as sole surfactant, a michaelis-menten like curve could be fitted and an apparent kinetic constant km of  <dig>  mm was obtained. for the cholesterol dispersions diluted in water only, a bell-shape profile of the data between 0– <dig>  mm cholesterol  may indicate an activation/deactivation at a low concentration of substrate. a similar activation pattern was found when using a dilution of cholesterol stock solution containing triton x- <dig> and taurocholate in water or in water/triton x- <dig> and nonionic surfactants and bile acid salts have been described to affect the kinetic behavior at particular enzyme to surfactant ratios
 <cit> . the highest recorded specific activity for cgchoa was  <dig>  u/mg.

enzymatic conversion of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one
biocatalytic reactions were carried out using purified cholesterol oxidase and cholesterol at a concentration of 1 mm in the presence of 5% v/v triton x- <dig>  after 42 hours reaction time the product was extracted from the entire reaction batch with chloroform and analyzed. figure 
 <dig> shows the traces monitored by hplc-dad at  <dig> and 250 nm for the enzymatic reaction. the product cholest-4-en-3-one , but not cholesterol  shows an absorbance at 250 nm. the peak of the chromatogram at  <dig>  min at 200 nm corresponds to cholesterol with a mass signal of m/z  <dig>  +. the peak of the chromatogram at  <dig>  min at  <dig> and 250 nm corresponds to cholest-4-en-3-one  with a mass signal of m/z  <dig>  + and was only found in the reaction batch which contained cholesterol oxidase. signals at  <dig>  min derived from triton x- <dig>  there the mass pattern typical for peg derivatives  was observed. the hplc-ms analysis was performed for qualitative detection of the cholesterol conversion by cgchoa. additional background signals could not be assigned to relevant compounds by ms. commercially available cholesterol and cholest-4-en-3-one were used as reference substances.

discussion
searching for novel cholesterol oxidases is of great interest in fields such as biosensing and enzymatic synthesis. the oxidation of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one has been reported for cholesterol oxidase from whole cells of c. gleum, bacillus subtilis and streptomyces sp.
 <cit> . especially those enzymes with considerable low amino acid homology to already described ones may have novel optimal working conditions and thus be suitable for innovative applications.

with an approach similar to what reported for the production of other cholesterol oxidases , the gene coding for cgchoa was cloned into pqe- <dig> and expressed in e. coli in the presence of prare <dig> to produce an enzyme with an n-terminal his-tag. the reduction of temperature to 16°c post induction was necessary to obtain soluble protein. the cgchoa was purified and found to occur presumably as a monomer, like cholesterol oxidase from brevibacterium sp. and other bacteria
 <cit> . a maximum specific cholesterol oxidase activity of  <dig>  u/mg was found, which is in the same range of other recombinantly expressed cholesterol oxidases . a maximum specific activity of  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/mg has been described for chromobacterium sp. and brevibacterium sp.  respectively, both expressed without a his-tag
 <cit> . cholesterol oxidase from brevibacterium sp. expressed with an n- or c-terminal his-tag, however, showed reduced activity for each construct when compared to the non-tagged enzyme
 <cit> . it is therefore possible that a higher specific activity might be reached with a non his-tagged cgchoa and after more extensive purification. however, since the activity of the his-tagged enzyme was sufficient for characterization, we did not further investigate a non-tagged cgchoa.

the recombinant cgchoa was active between ph 4– <dig> with optimal activity in the neutral range similarly to other cholesterol oxidases , e.g. at ph  <dig>  using  <dig>  m mops buffer for the coupled hrp assay. at higher concentrations of mops, the activity declined steadily at any of the  <dig> ph values measured. mops buffer with a ph lower than  <dig>  has not been tested as it buffers only between  <dig>  and  <dig>  a temperature optimum between 32°c and 40°c was found, which is in the range of the cholesterol oxidase from corynebacterium cholesterolicum, but lower than that of streptomyces violascens or brevibacterium sp. enzymes, which showed optimum activity at around 50°c
 <cit> . the activity data obtained when the substrate was dissolved in the presence of triton x- <dig> and/or water only could not be fitted to the michaelis-menten equation, which is only applicable for enzymatic reactions in homogeneous solutions and therefore cannot be directly adapted to the heterogeneous reaction conditions that were applied here. the presence of the anionic surfactant taurocholate proved to affect the measured activity and an apparent km of  <dig>  mm was obtained for cgchoa and the substrate cholesterol. we cannot exclude for taurocholate an effect not only regarding an improved substrate solubilisation, and thus enhanced accessibility to the enzyme, but also an effect on the enzyme itself. in summary, the anionic surfactant taurocholate is sufficient as additive for monitoring the enzyme activity of cgchoa with regard to the natural substrate cholesterol, while the presence of the non-ionic additive triton x- <dig> did not affect the general kinetic behaviour. these data may be of special interest for developing biosensors for samples with at low cholesterol content as dilution in the presence of taurocholate might provide a linear correlation between the substrate concentration and the signal measured.

CONCLUSIONS
the cholesterol oxidase cgchoa from c. gleum was successfully expressed in e. coli jm <dig> co-transformed with pcgchoa and prare <dig>  the cgchoa carrying an n-terminal his-tag was purified and subjected to a ph and temperature screen. the highest specific activity was determined to be  <dig>  u/mg. michaelis-menten type kinetics could only be observed in the presence of taurocholate as single surfactant within the enzymatic assay. the cgchoa cholesterol oxidation product was identified as cholest-4-en-3-one by direct and rapid detection via hplc-ms. the rapid and robust hplc-ms assay developed in this study enables a more detailed study of cgchoa and other cholesterol oxidases. the described enzyme complements the set of available cholesterol oxidases for diverse applications such as bionsensing and synthesis of intermediates for drug synthesis. as successful biotransformation employing c. gleum as host organism has already been demonstrated
 <cit> , the future engineering of cgchoa for a broader substrate specificity might enable the application of this enzyme for the conversion of other steroid compounds.
