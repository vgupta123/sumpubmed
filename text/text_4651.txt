BACKGROUND
homeobox genes play fundamental roles in development, including patterning and cell fate determination, and in cell-specific gene expression in adults  <cit> . pitx <dig> along with pitx <dig> and pitx <dig> form the pitx/rieg sub-family of the paired-like class of homeobox proteins  <cit> . pitx <dig>  was originally cloned from a human craniofacial cdna library and was found to be mutated in patients with axenfeld-rieger syndrome   <cit> . ars is an autosomal-dominant disorder of morphogenesis, characterized by malformations of the eyes, teeth, and umbilicus  <cit> . the murine gene was cloned independently by several groups and assigned various names   <cit> . the pitx2/pitx <dig> gene is highly conserved across species. the human and murine coding regions share 91% nucleotide  sequence identity   <cit> .

during murine embryonic development, pitx <dig> is expressed in the heart, eye, pituitary, teeth, tongue, maxillary and mandibular epithelia, and in certain regions of the developing central nervous system  <cit> . expression in the eye, dental lamina and umbilicus is consistent with a role for mutations in pitx <dig> in the pathogenesis of ars. additionally, pitx <dig> is expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm and is expressed asymmetrically in several organs, contributing to differences in left-right patterning during embryonic development  <cit> . pitx2-deficient mice exhibit failure of body-wall closure, arrest in organ turning, ocular defects, right pulmonary isomerism, altered cardiac position, and perturbations in early determination events in anterior pituitary gland and tooth organogenesis  <cit> . mice with complete pitx <dig> loss-of-function mutations die by embryonic day  <dig> due to severe heart, craniofacial and pituitary gland defects  <cit> .

the pitx <dig> gene can generate different protein isoforms in humans and other mammals, the most thoroughly characterized of which are pitx2a, pitx2b, and pitx2c. orthologs of these proteins have also been described in other vertebrates such as zebrafish, xenopus and chicken  <cit> . another mrna isoform, pitx2d, was recentlycloned from a human craniofacial cdna library  <cit> . the pitx <dig> gene in human and mouse is comprised of six exons. pitx2a and pitx2b mrnas are produced through alternative splicing of the same pre-mrna. the pitx2a isoform contains exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . pitx2b is identical to pitx2a, but retains an additional exon, exon  <dig> , and thereby has a longer n-terminus . pitx2c is transcribed from an alternative promoter upstream of exon  <dig>  and therefore has a unique n-terminus, but shares its homeodomain  and carboxyl terminus with the other two pitx <dig> isoforms . in human and mouse, the pitx2a, pitx2b, and pitx2c proteins are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in length, containing  <dig> common amino acids encoding the homeodomain  and c-termini  <cit> . pitx2d derives from the same promoter as pitx2c, but is alternatively spliced at a cryptic 3' splice acceptor site within exon  <dig>  and thus has a truncated hd  <cit> . the pitx2d mrna has not been described in other species.

during development, the different pitx <dig> isoforms show both overlapping and distinct patterns of expression. both the qualitative  and quantitative  nature of their expression are critical to normal vertebrate development  <cit> . in adults, pitx <dig> proteins act as transcriptional regulators. in vitro studies show that all the three isoforms can trans-activate a variety of genes, including procollagen lysyl hydroxylase  <dig>  atrial natriuretic factor, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone β , and luteinizing hormone β   <cit> . because of its truncated hd, pitx2d does not bind dna but inhibits the transcriptional activity of other isoforms through direct physical interaction  <cit> .

several groups, including ours, have been investigating functional roles for pitx <dig> proteins in anterior pituitary cells  <cit> . pitx <dig> is required at several different stages of pituitary development with roles in early progenitor cell formation and later lineage specification of somatotrope, lactotrope, thyrotrope and gonadotrope lineages  <cit> . pitx <dig> proteins are expressed in all hormone secreting cell types of the mature anterior lobe with the exception of corticotropes  <cit> . in fact, these proteins have been described as pan-pituitary transcriptional regulators of various hormone-encoding genes  <cit> . in the context of our recent work on pitx protein regulation of fshb transcription  <cit> , we identified two novel pitx <dig> isoforms. here, we describe their characterization and examine their functions relative to the previously identified pitx <dig> isoforms.

RESULTS
alternative translation initiation sites in the pitx2c mrna give rise to two proteins
during the course of our studies on transcriptional regulation of fshb gene by pitx proteins in a murine gonadotrope cell line  <cit> , we observed more than the expected three pitx <dig> immunoreactive proteins on western blot analyses . we also consistently observed two pitx <dig> immunoreactive proteins derived from a murine pitx2c expression vector transfected into heterologous cho cells . both of these proteins bound to a pitx binding site in the murine fshb promoter in southwestern blot analysis  <cit> , suggesting that neither product was an artifact of the expression system. a review of the literature indicated that a human pitx2c expression construct similarly generated two proteins, though the nature of these proteins was not explored  <cit> .

we therefore hypothesized that the pitx2c mrna contains alternative translation initiation codons. we examined the murine pitx2c open-reading frame   for downstream aug codons in-frame with the canonical start site and observed two: met <dig> and met <dig>  during translation, small ribosomal subunits enter at the 5'-end of the mrna and migrate linearly until they encounter the first aug codon . in higher eukaryotes, the stop-scanning step is modulated by sequences flanking the aug. in mammals, the optimal consensus sequence, gccrccaugg , has been identified as the most efficient context for translation initiation  <cit> . mutations that perturb the consensus sequence, especially those that substitute a pyrimidine for a purine at position - <dig> , cause some 40s subunits to bypass the first aug and continue their search for an aug in more favorable context for translation initiation. this leaky ribosomal scanning is even more pronounced when the g at position + <dig>  is also altered. augstart codons are therefore designated strong  or weak based on conformity to the consensus sequence at positions - <dig> and + <dig>  <cit> .

in the murine pitx2c orf, the nucleotides flanking the codons for met <dig> and met <dig> do not match the consensus sequence and thus provide a weak context for translation initiation . however, the aug encoding met <dig> is flanked by a strong consensus sequence due to presence of gs at positions - <dig> and + <dig> . we predicted that the shorter form of pitx2c  is initiated from met <dig> and the longer  form  from met <dig>  to evaluate this hypothesis, we introduced point mutations into the wild-type  pitx2c expression construct . briefly, we changed the downstream met <dig> to leu  to confirm that the faster mobility isoform was initiated at this amino acid and to generate a construct that expresses pitx2cα exclusively. as predicted, the mutation eliminated pitx2cβ . to show that the weak initiation context of met <dig> permits leaky ribosomal scanning, we replaced the thymine  at the - <dig> position with an adenine . indeed, this construct expressed pitx2cα more and pitx2cβ less abundantly than wt ; however, some of the pitx2cβ isoform was retained. therefore, this single base change was not sufficient to stop leaky scanning altogether. this is likely because the + <dig> base was still less than optimal. because this was the first base of codon  <dig>  we could not change it without making a non-conservative amino acid substitution . because the t-3a mutation increased the abundance of pitx2cα, it is likely that translation of this isoform occurs from met <dig> and not met4; however, this needs to be confirmed experimentally .

to make a pitx2cβ expression construct, we mutated leu <dig> to a non-sense codon , thus terminating the protein translated from met <dig>  prematurely. this construct produced the pitx2cβ isoform exclusively and at a level equal to that from the wt construct . these data further confirmed that translation initiation could occur from met <dig>  for downstream applications comparing functional differences between the two isoforms, we generated a construct that produced pitx2cα exclusively and at a level comparable to that of pitx2cβ by introducing both the m35l and t-3a mutations .

the above results are consistent with the hypothesis that alternate initiation sites present in pitx2c mrna give rise to two, if not three, proteins by a context-dependent leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism. because the non-consensus  as well as consensus  nucleotides surrounding the different potential translation start sites are conserved in mammals  and in species as diverse as chicken and zebrafish , we predict that the long and short forms of pitx2c are expressed in other species, including humans. as mentioned above, previously published, though not fully appreciated, data similarly showed that two proteins, which we predict correspond to pitx2cα and pitx2cβ, are produced from a human pitx2c expression construct in cho cells  <cit> . the cdna sequence for murine pitx2cβ has been deposited in genbank .

similar to what we observe here, there are many examples in the literature of transcription factor mrnas that produce short and long forms of the protein by context-dependent leaky scanning . as with alternative splicing and multiple promoters, this mechanism permits biologically-relevant diversity in protein synthesis from individual genes .

a novel pitx2/pitx <dig> mrna variant produced through alternative splicing
alternative pre-mrna splicing gives rise to pitx2a and pitx2b isoforms, with exon  <dig> being skipped in pitx2a . in the course of amplifying full-length pitx2a and pitx2b cdnas from the murine gonadotrope cell line, lβt <dig>  we observed three, rather than the two expected amplicons . repeating the rt-pcr with dnased rna, to remove potentially contaminating genomic dna, showed a similar pattern . we cloned and sequenced all three products and confirmed that the top and bottom bands corresponded to pitx2b  and pitx2a, respectively. the middle band contained a novel sequence , highly related to pitx2b <dig>  aligning pitx2b <dig> with murine pitx <dig> genomic  and pitx2b <dig> cdna sequences  revealed that it employs the same 5' splice donor in the second intron as pitx2a and pitx2b <dig>  but utilizes an alternative 3' splice acceptor within exon  <dig> . as a result, the first  <dig> bp of exon  <dig> are absent from this isoform. the pitx2b <dig> protein is predicted have  <dig> amino acids, lacking the first  <dig> residues  encoded by exon  <dig>  but otherwise being identical to pitx2b <dig>  analysis of the sequence 5' to this novel acceptor site indicates the presence of consensus sequences for the observed splicing event   <cit> . our literature search did not shed light on possible factors that might regulate the alternative splicing choices  <cit> . we confirmed pitx2b <dig> expression by rt-pcr in murine pituitary, indicating that this splicing event is not an artifact restricted to the lβt <dig> cell line . the cdna sequence for murine pitx2b <dig> has been deposited in genbank .

we next examined whether pitx2b <dig> mrna is also present in human. rt-pcr of human pituitary mrna demonstrated the expression of pitx2a, pitx2b <dig>  and pitx2b <dig> . examination of the pitx <dig> genomic sequence on human chromosome  <dig>  confirmed that the sequence permitting alternative splicing in murine pitx <dig>  is also present in human pitx <dig>  however, the degeneracy of splicing regulatory sequence makes it difficult to know this with certainty  <cit> . we were unable to identify pitx2b2/pitx2b <dig> in est database searches. this is not a major concern, as very few murine ests in the ncbi database correspond to pitx2b <dig>  none of which were derived from pituitary libraries. we confirmed pitx2b <dig> protein expression in gonadotrope cell lines, lβt <dig> and αt3- <dig> . comparing the migration of the endogenous lβt <dig> proteins  with a combination of nuclear extracts from cho cells transfected with expression vectors for each murine pitx <dig> isoform  shows that the pitx2b <dig> protein migrates just above pitx2cβ. indeed, the predicted molecular weight of pitx2b <dig>  is only slightly greater than that of pitx2cβ . thus, the two proteins can be resolved only when separated on high percentage polyacrylamide gels  . when run on lower percentage gels , pitx2cβ and pitx2b <dig> run so closely together as to appear as one abundant protein.

pitx <dig> can be post-translationally modified ; therefore, it is possible that the different isoforms we observe in lβt <dig> cells extracts might represent fewer isoforms than suggested, but with different states of post-translational modification. given that the bands observed by over-expression in cho cells show the same migration patterns and can be directly attributed to the proposed isoforms, we consider this a less likely explanation for the observed data. this does not preclude the fact that the distinct isoforms may be differentially post-translationally modified by virtue of their unique sequences. indeed, the  <dig> additional amino acids in pitx2cα include residues potentially subject to modification . three residues in the  <dig> amino acids unique to pitx2b <dig>  might also be modified. these possibilities should be addressed in future analyses.

identification of the major pitx <dig> isoforms expressed in lβt <dig> cells and adult murine pituitary
the major protein isoforms of pitx <dig> in mammals are generally considered to be pitx2a , pitx2b <dig>  and pitx2cα . in light of our results, we re-examined this hypothesis. the endogenous proteins expressed in lβt <dig> cells  and adult murine pituitary  were compared with the different isoforms expressed in cho cells; pitx2a , pitx2b <dig> , wt pitx2c , pitx2cα , pitx2cβ , and pitx2a and wt pitx2c together . the results suggest that: 1) the major forms in homologous cells/tissues are pitx2a, pitx2cα and pitx2cβ, 2) pitx2cβ is not an artifact of our expression system and corresponds to the major immunoreactive band that migrates intermediate to pitx2a and pitx2cα , and 3) endogenous pitx2b <dig> is expressed at relatively low levels and migrates just below pitx2cα . the relative migration patterns of the different isoforms on sds-page are consistent with their predicted molecular mass: pitx2a , pitx2cβ , pitx2b <dig>  and pitx2cα . note that the gel in this figure was not of a sufficiently high percentage to resolve pitx2cβ and pitx2b <dig>  in addition, based on the data in fig. 3d, we cannot rule out the possibility that these latter two isoforms are expressed at equivalent levels in lβt <dig> cells and pituitary.

these data indicate that previous assessments of relative pitx2b <dig> protein levels were likely over-estimated. that is, three prominent bands typically detected by immunoblot using pitx <dig> antisera were attributed to pitx2a, pitx2b, and pitx2c  <cit> . our data show that these are pitx2a, pitx2cβ , and pitx2cα. thus, what was previously interpreted as pitx2b <dig> is pitx2cβ , and that pitx2b <dig> is of low abundance and is only slightly smaller than pitx2cα .

these observations become particularly relevant in cellular contexts where only some of the pitx <dig> protein isoforms are expressed. for example, as shown in fig. 4b, a single pitx <dig> immunoreactive band is observed in skeletal muscle . pitx <dig> has been demonstrated to be expressed in virtually all embryonic anlagen and adult muscle groups, suggesting that the protein may play some role in maturation or maintenance of muscle anlagen  <cit> . previously, this protein might have been attributed to pitx2b1; however, comparing its migration to proteins in gonadotrope cell lines  strongly suggests that it is pitx2cβ. indeed, we detect pitx2c  mrna in the skeletal muscle. unlike the case with gonadotrope cells, we only detect one isoform on the immunoblot, raising the possibility that this protein may correspond to pitx2cβ or pitx2b <dig>  however, we did not detect pitx2b <dig> or pitx2b <dig> mrnas in skeletal muscle and pitx2a mrna was expressed at low levels, suggesting that the upstream promoter is relatively inactive in this tissue in adult mice . we have observed that the pitx2cα isoform may be more labile than the pitx2cβ isoform  and this may account for its apparent absence in skeletal muscle . this might also be predicted based on differences between the two proteins in amino acids that confer metabolic instability.

the n-end rule, which relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its n-terminal residue, predicts that pitx2cβ would be more stable, as it has the stabilizing amino acid, alanine, at its n-terminus. in contrast, pitx2cα has the tertiary destabilizing n-terminal residue asparagine. our data do not definitively rule out the possibility that pitx2cα might initiate from met <dig>  however, this protein would also be more labile due to the primary destabilizing n-terminal residue, lysine  <cit> . our results lend support to the recent reclassification of alanine from a type  <dig> primary destabilizing residue to a stabilizing amino acid under the mammalian n-end rule  <cit> .

all pitx <dig> isoforms trans-activate gonadotrope-restricted gene promoters
pitx <dig> isoforms differ in their n-termini, and this contributes to variation in their trans-activation functions in some contexts  <cit> . as all pitx <dig> isoforms are expressed in gonadotrope cells, we compared their relative abilities to trans-activate gonadotrope-restricted genes: a) murine fshb , b) bovine lhb , c) murine gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor , and d) bovine chorionic gonadotropin α subunit . all of these promoters were shown previously to be stimulated by different pitx proteins in heterologous cells  <cit> . we transfected cv- <dig> cells  with the indicated reporters and pitx <dig> expression vectors.

the novel pitx2b <dig> and pitx2cβ isoforms stimulated all of the gonadotrope-restricted gene promoters. pitx2b <dig> was more potent in stimulating the mfshb promoter-reporter compared to pitx2a, which was in turn more potent than pitx2b <dig> . pitx2b <dig> was more efficiently expressed in cv- <dig> cells than the pitx2a or b <dig> isoforms  , which might account for its greater trans-activation function. these data and their statistical analysis should be considered in this light. this concern does not, however, account for the differences between pitx2a and b <dig>  which were expressed equivalently. pitx2b <dig> was also less effective in trans-activating the mgnrhr and bcga promoters compared to pitx2a and pitx2b <dig>  which did not differ . we next compared the actions of pitx2cα, pitx2cβ, and pitx2c wt . pitx2cβ was more potent in stimulating mfshb transcription compared to pitx2cα  even though they were expressed equivalently in cv- <dig> cells . pitx2cα and pitx2cβ similarly stimulated transcription of mgnrhr and bcga . all the pitx <dig> isoforms similarly synergized with sf- <dig>  to potently regulate blhb transcription . these latter results were similar to those from a previous report, which demonstrated synergism between pitx2a or pitx2b <dig> and sf- <dig> on the blhb promoter in cv- <dig> cells  <cit> .

we next examined dna binding by pitx2b <dig> and pitx2cβ proteins. we demonstrated that pitx <dig> proteins exert their actions through a conserved cis-element, aaatcc, in the murine fshb promoter  <cit> . all pitx <dig> isoforms bound to this element, but did so with apparently differing affinities , given their comparable levels of expression . we also conducted gel shifts with probes containing putative pitx elements from the blhb, bcga and mgnrhr promoters  <cit> . all of the pitx <dig> isoforms bound to the blhb probe , but we failed to identify/confirm binding elements within the bcga and mgnrhr promoters under our gel shift conditions . the pitx <dig> isoforms show two complexes with blhb probe  similar to what was observed earlier by cox et al. with the dlx <dig> bicoid consensus sequence  <cit> . it is possible that the two complexes reflect pitx <dig> binding alone  or with a non-pitx partner expressed endogenously in cho cells. as an added control, we examined the binding of the pitx <dig> isoforms to the recognized pitx binding element  in the rat pomc promoter  <cit>  and observed a binding pattern similar to that with the mfshb probe .

collectively, the data show that all pitx <dig> isoforms examined here can stimulate transcription of gonadotrope-restricted promoter-reporters, though their relative effects can vary between genes. this is in agreement with results of previous studies  <cit> . in some instances , this may be related to differences in relative binding affinities, whereas additional/alternative mechanisms, including differences in their expression levels in cv- <dig> cells or post-translational modifications of the proteins  <cit>  may be at play in other cases.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we identified two novel forms of pitx <dig>  produced by alternative mrna splicing  and alternative translation initiation . endogenous protein expression of both forms was confirmed in gonadotrope cell lines  and murine pituitary and skeletal muscle . based on the protein and mrna data, we suggest that the preferred splicing event is removal of exon  <dig>  generating pitx2a. when exon  <dig> is included, the splicing events generating pitx2b <dig> and pitx2b <dig> mrnas are roughly equivalent, at least in pituitary. our results are consistent with earlier reports demonstrating lower abundance of pitx2b <dig> relative to pitx2a mrnas in human and murine pituitary as well in various cell lines representing different pituitary cell types  <cit> . pitx2cβ is not only abundant, but appears to be the protein previously attributed to pitx2b <dig>  though, our results suggest that pitx2cβ abundance might also be over-estimated because pitx2b <dig> migrates with this isoform and only higher percentage gels can faithfully resolve the two proteins.

a comparison of the trans-activation functions of the pitx2c isoforms showed that both stimulated various gonadotrope-specific genes in a qualitatively similar manner, though quantitatively to different extents in some circumstances. the conservation of these isoforms across species suggests that they may play distinct biological roles, perhaps independent of their roles as transcription factors, that we were unable to uncover fully here. knock-in studies in mice introducing the mutations we describe would enable exclusive expression of the two isoforms and provide a means to assess their relative roles during development  and adulthood.
