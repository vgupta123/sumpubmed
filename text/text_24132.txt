BACKGROUND
lack of detailed knowledge about molecular disease mechanisms poses a primary challenge for the development of new therapeutic strategies for blinding diseases. one approach to prevent blindness is to stimulate endogenous neuroprotective pathways to support survival of stressed or injured retinal cells. whereas overexpression of neurotrophic factors delays or inhibits retinal degeneration  <cit> , inhibition of neuroprotective signaling or absence of neuroprotective factors, such as leukemia inhibitory factor , brain derived neurotrophic factor  and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  accelerates retinal degeneration in disease models, or in the aging retina  <cit> . although increased levels of neurotrophic factors are beneficial for injured retinal cells, a balanced expression is required in the normal retina since exaggerated doses may have detrimental side effects  <cit> .

one of the neuroprotective factors that is tightly regulated in the neuronal retina is lif. lif is expressed in a small and dispersed subpopulation of müller glial cells in response to photoreceptor injury  <cit>  and signals through the lifr/gp <dig> receptor complex activating the janus kinase /signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  signaling pathway  <cit> . activation of this pathway leads to increased expression of endothelin- <dig> , fgf <dig>  stat <dig>  jak <dig>  suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig>  and glial fibrillary acidic protein,   <cit> . elimination of lif impairs expression of these factors in the retina and results in a more severe disease progression  <cit> . thus, lif induces complicated intercellular signaling events between degenerating photoreceptors and müller cells that are crucial for photoreceptor survival  <cit> .

upregulation of lif signaling has been observed in induced and inherited photoreceptor degeneration models  <cit> , as well as in models of ganglion cell death  <cit> . therefore, induction of lif expression may be a common mechanism in the injured retina to support neuronal survival and may be one of the main tasks of müller cells in their attempt to protect retinal cells against degeneration. despite its important role in neuronal survival and its unique expression profile in the injured retina, the molecular mechanisms that regulate lif expression in müller cells are only poorly understood. recently, we showed that activation of lif gene transcription in the injured retina involves p <dig> mapk signaling  <cit> , but additional regulatory mechanisms are likely to exist.

previous reports have shown that injured photoreceptors generate h2o <dig> through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase  enzyme complexes  <cit> . in the presence of nox inhibitors, generation of h2o <dig> is impaired and photoreceptor apoptosis is increased in the presence of toxic stress  <cit> . moreover, increased levels of reactive oxygen species  upregulate extracellular signal regulated kinase  and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog kinase  dependent pathways and inhibit the activity of protein phosphatase  <dig> , all of which critically affect photoreceptor survival  <cit> . this seems controversial since h2o <dig> and other ros are well known to have detrimental effects on cell function and viability, and many reports show that oxidative stress contributes to retinal degenerative diseases  <cit> . however, it is now clear that subtoxic levels of h2o <dig> have important roles in signal transduction and are involved in many biological pathways  <cit> . low levels of h2o <dig> can reversibly oxidize selective amino acids, such as cysteine, histidine, methionine and selenocysteine, and thus modulate molecular pathways associated with such modified proteins  <cit> . subtoxic doses of h2o <dig> were also shown to participate in neuroprotection by ischemic preconditioning  <cit>  and to induce axonal regeneration in zebrafish  <cit> , supporting the concept that generation of h2o <dig> has neuroprotective consequences during stress conditions. therefore, an intriguing hypothesis suggests that h2o <dig> generated by nox enzymes or released from mitochondria in stressed cells may act as a physiological messenger to regulate expression of neuroprotective factors in müller cells. this hypothesis is supported by the previously reported regulation of lif expression by p <dig> mapk  <cit> , since p <dig> mapk signaling can be activated by h2o <dig> and may interfere with mrna stability of target genes. this level of gene regulation involves several rna binding proteins including tristetraprolin , which is known to be regulated by p <dig> mapk itself  <cit> .

here, we show that h2o <dig> enhanced mrna stability of lif during stress in a müller cell line and in primary mouse müller cells. highly conserved au-rich elements  in the lif 3′utr were important for this regulation and provided target sequences for several rna binding proteins. of those, interleukin enhancer binding factor  <dig>  was identified to be critically involved in the regulation of the h2o2-dependent increase of lif mrna stability, and kh-type splicing regulatory protein  was identified to be a general regulator of lif mrna levels independent of redox signaling. our results highlight the complex regulation of lif expression, and provide a mechanism for the puzzling connection between redox signaling and expression of survival factors such as lif in müller glia cells.

RESULTS
h2o <dig> stabilizes lif mrna in müller glia cells
signaling between degenerating photoreceptors and müller glia cells induces expression of several neuroprotective factors for photoreceptor survival  <cit> . recent evidence suggests that redox mechanisms may be involved in this intercellular communication, and it was proposed that h2o <dig>  which is produced by stressed photoreceptors, might be a molecule responsible for the induction of retinal survival pathways  <cit> .

since lif is one of the critical factors for photoreceptor survival and is expressed in müller cells in response to photoreceptor injury  <cit> , we tested the effect of subtoxic doses of h2o <dig>  <cit>  on lif mrna expression in rmc- <dig> müller cells  <cit> . since rmc- <dig> cells expressed high levels of lif mrna under normal  culture conditions, stress-related signaling molecules like h2o <dig> were without effect and failed to super induce lif expression . as müller glia may experience suboptimal  conditions in an injured retina, we serum deprived  cells to impose a mild stress during the period of h2o <dig> signaling in vitro. this caused a rapid and strong reduction of lif mrna levels in müller cells by 87% within one and 91% within two hours . whether this was due to the suboptimal conditions, or to the absence of lif-inducing factors potentially present in serum has not been addressed. importantly, sd allowed us to investigate the effect of h2o <dig> on lif levels. addition of h2o <dig> partially prevented this downregulation and resulted in lif transcript levels that were  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  higher than in cells treated with sd alone . h2o <dig> needed to be present from the beginning of sd treatment since its late addition  did not affect lif levels . similarly, h2o <dig> had no effect on lif expression when added to rmc- <dig> cells under normal cell culture conditions . the effect of h2o <dig> was specific for lif since the mrna levels of other genes known to be expressed in müller cells, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor , fgf <dig> and gfap  <cit> , or known to be postranscriptionally regulated at the level of mrna stability, such as ttp  <cit> , were not increased by the addition of h2o <dig>  rather, cntf was downregulated by 18%  and 27%  in sd cells treated with h2o <dig> .figure  <dig> h2o <dig> stabilizes lif transcripts in rmc- <dig> müller cells. a) rmc- <dig> cells were serum deprived  for two hours. h2o <dig>  was added immediately  or at one hour during sd . b) rmc- <dig> cells were treated with actinomycin d  for two hours. h2o <dig> was added immediately  or at one hour during actd treatment . rna levels of the indicated genes were determined by real-time pcr at  <dig> hour,  <dig> hour and  <dig> hours of treatment and expressed relative to levels at  <dig> hour. shown are means ± sem of n =  <dig> to  <dig>  one-way anova with sidak’s posttests were used to compare rna levels against levels after sd  or actd  treatments at one hour and two hours.  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig>  and  p < <dig> . anova, analysis of variance; sem, standard error of the mean.



to test whether a transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanism was responsible for the h2o2-induced increase of lif mrna levels, we used actinomycin d  to block rna polymerase ii dependent transcription. like sd, actd treatment caused a rapid decrease of lif mrna levels, whereas other transcripts  were not strongly affected. importantly, h2o <dig> increased lif transcripts by  <dig>  fold  and  <dig>  fold  also in the presence of actd  suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism for the control of lif mrna levels. since h2o <dig> is a reactive molecule that may potentially reduce the activity of actd, we confirmed that actd was fully active in the presence of h2o <dig> and completely blocked tumor necrosis factor-alpha -induced lif transcription . h2o <dig> also significantly increased ttp mrna levels in the presence of actd  showing that ttp mrna levels can also be regulated on a posttranscriptional level in rmc- <dig> cells.

since it was shown that retinal degenerations activate lif mrna transcription  <cit>  and h2o <dig> clearly affected a posttranscriptional process, we tested whether h2o <dig> can increase longevity of lif mrna after an initial boost of mrna production. we treated rmc- <dig> cells with tnf, which was previously shown to transiently upregulate both lif and ttp transcription  <cit> . when applied at one hour of tnf-induced upregulation of gene transcription, sd and actd treatment caused a rapid decline of lif and ttp mrna levels. this decline was partially prevented by the addition of h2o <dig> suggesting that redox signaling can also stabilize lif and ttp mrnas under conditions of increased gene activity . the data argue that h2o <dig> may function as a signaling molecule to overcome the unstable nature of lif and ttp mrnas resulting in a more sustained expression of these genes when needed.figure  <dig> h2o <dig> stabilizes lif transcripts after tnf induced gene expression in rmc- <dig> müller cells. rmc- <dig> cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha  for one hour to induce lif gene expression. following tnf treatment cells were either  serum deprived  or  incubated with actd . h2o <dig>  was added either at the one hour  or the two hour time-point . rna levels of lif and ttp were determined by real-time pcr at the indicated time-points and expressed relative to levels at  <dig> hour. shown are means ± sem of n =  <dig>  one-way anova with sidak’s posttests were used to compare rna levels against levels after sd or actd treatments at two hours and three hours.  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig> . actd, actinomycin d. anova, analysis of variance; sem, standard error of the mean.



as already reported earlier, inhibition of p <dig> mapk by sb <dig>  strongly decreased lif mrna levels in rmc- <dig> cells . similar to the effect after sd or actd treatment, addition of h2o <dig> to sb-treated cells increased lif mrna levels. this argues that redox dependent lif mrna stabilization may not depend on p <dig> mapk, even though several components of its signaling system are activated by h2o <dig>   <cit> . to strengthen this conclusion, we tested whether h2o <dig> might be able to increase lif mrna levels in the absence of ttp, an important component of the p <dig> mapk-dependent mrna stability pathway  <cit> . indeed, h2o <dig> rescued the sd-induced downregulation of lif mrna levels also in primary müller cells isolated from ttp−/− mice . importantly, these experiments also showed that redox regulation of lif was not specific for rmc- <dig> cells, but was also a feature of primary müller cells making it likely that this mechanism is relevant for the regulation of lif expression in vivo.figure  <dig> h2o2-induced stabilization of lif in rmc- <dig> and primary müller cells is independent of p <dig> mapk. a) rmc- <dig> cells were  or were not  treated with p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig>  in the presence  or absence  of h2o <dig>  for one hour. rna levels were determined by real-time pcr and expressed relative to the levels in untreated cells. shown are means ± sem of n =  <dig> . one-way anova with tukey’s posttests were used to compare all pairs of columns. b) primary mouse müller cells isolated from rlbp-gfp mice heterozygous  or homozygous  for the ttp knockout allele were  or were not  serum deprived  for two hours in the presence  or absence  of h2o <dig> . lif mrna levels were determined by real-time pcr at two hours of treatment and expressed relative to the levels of untreated cells. shown are means ± sem of n =  <dig> to  <dig>  one-way anova with sidak’s posttests were used to compare the effect of treatment for both ttp

inhibition of p <dig> mapk signaling and addition of h2o <dig> also affected mrna levels of cyclooxygenase  <dig>  and ttp comparably to lif . gfap levels, however, were not significantly altered by the treatments. interestingly, mrnas of cox <dig> and ttp, but not of gfap, contain several ares that regulate their stability  <cit> .

cis-regulation of lif mrna stability
since lif encodes a highly unstable mrna  and stability of particular rnas like cox <dig> can be regulated through proteins that bind to ares within their 3′utrs  <cit> , we analyzed the sequence of the  <dig>  bp long lif 3′utr for the presence of ares. alignment of the 3′utrs from various mammalian lif genes  <cit>  showed that several regions were strongly conserved . two large regions  were identified that were particularly rich in adenosine and uracil . these two regions contained several smaller regions with auuu sequence elements and auuua core motifs . region  <dig> was an exception in that it contained only a string of  <dig> auuu sequences without core motif. in addition, two conserved putative binding sites for mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  were identified using targetscan software  <cit> . no ares or mirna binding sites were detected in regions  <dig> and  <dig> .figure  <dig> the lif 3′utr contains conserved regions with ares that influence rna levels in rmc- <dig> cells. a) sequence alignment of the  <dig>  bp long lif 3′utr sequences from mus musculus , homo sapiens , rhesus monkey , canis lupus familiaris , bos taurus  and pan troglodytes  revealed two highly conserved au-rich regions  and seven smaller regions containing ares , a mirna binding site  or both . b, c) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with luciferase-reporter constructs, as indicated. luminescence levels were determined after  <dig> hours and expressed relative to a construct with a minimal 3′utr . d) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with luciferase-reporter constructs carrying r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> or Δutr sequences. gene expression was blocked with actd  <dig> hours after transfection. luminescence levels were determined at  <dig> to  <dig> hours after actd addition and shown relative to the levels of the Δutr control construct that were set to  <dig> for each time point. shown are means ± sem of n =  <dig> to  <dig>  one-way anova  or two-way anova  with dunnett’s posttests were used to compare constructs to the levels of the Δutr construct.  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig>  and  p < <dig> . anova, analysis of variance; ares, au-rich elements; sem, standard error of the mean.



to evaluate the potential importance of these conserved elements for the regulation of lif rna stability, we fused fragments of the mouse 3′utr to a luciferase gene driven by the sv <dig> promoter and enhancer . the incorporation of cl <dig>  <cit>  and pest  <cit>  sequences led to the production of an unstable luciferase protein  suitable to monitor changes in mrna levels by measuring luminescence in cell culture homogenates.table  <dig>

fusion of the whole lif 3′utr  to the reporter gene reduced expression of luc2cp by 89% compared to a construct with a minimal 3′utr  . when the full length lif 3′utr was compared to a similar-sized human genomic sequence without conserved, genic or repetitive sequences this reduction was 55% , excluding that lif mrna destabilization was mediated non-specifically by its long 3′utr sequence. this suggested that the lif 3′utr contained cis regulatory elements leading to reduced levels of the reporter protein. test of the individual au-rich regions i and ii  showed that region ii strongly reduced luciferase levels by 43%, whereas region i had no effect when compared to a similar sized region from the human actb 3′utr . this suggested that region ii may contain elements for the cis-regulation of lif mrna stability. to identify the elements responsible for the effect, we tested shorter sequences within both regions. in addition, short sequence elements that contained a putative binding site for mir- <dig> in connection with two ares  or a putative binding site for mir- <dig>  were also tested . whereas several of these sequence elements decreased luciferase levels only mildly, regions  <dig> and  <dig> had strong and significant effects . these data identified two small regions important for the regulation of lif mrna stability and suggested that region  <dig> may be responsible for the destabilizing effect observed with the larger region ii . to confirm that regions  <dig> and  <dig> regulate lif mrna levels through rna stability, we transfected rmc- <dig> cells with the respective reporter constructs and followed luc2pc luminescence in the presence of actd. cells expressing the reporter gene fused to regions  <dig> or  <dig> lost luc2pc luminescence significantly faster than cells expressing the reporter containing region  <dig>  . thus, regions  <dig> and  <dig> influenced rna levels, indeed, through regulation of rna stability.

in order to identify the functional elements within regions  <dig> and  <dig>  we mutated individual auuu sequences . region  <dig> had three predicted ares  that, when mutated, significantly increased reporter expression . mutating two elements in either combination resulted in luc2pc levels similar to the triple mutant suggesting that none of the individual ares was sufficient to significantly reduce luc2pc expression but that the elements may need to interact or to act synergistically to regulate mrna stability. consistent with a synergistic effect, increasing the number of ares within the same reporter construct gradually decreased reporter expression to levels found for the whole lif 3′utr . region  <dig> contained two predicted ares  and a conserved mir- <dig> binding site . mutating the mir- <dig> binding sequence alone or in combination with either are did not significantly alter luc2cp levels. in contrast, simultaneous elimination of all three elements significantly increased luc2cp levels .figure  <dig> ares are involved in cis-regulation of lif mrna stability in rmc- <dig> müller cells. a) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with reporter constructs fused to wild type or mutated r <dig> sequences , as indicated. b) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with reporter constructs fused to r <dig> sequences containing increasing numbers of ares , as indicated. c) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with reporter constructs fused to indicated wild type or mutated r <dig> sequences , as indicated. luminescence levels were always determined after  <dig> hours and shown relative to the level generated by the Δutr control construct. shown are means ± sem of n =  <dig> to  <dig>  squares in horizontal bars indicate ares or an mir- <dig> binding site, respectively, in the analyzed sequences. one-way anova with dunnett’s posttests were used to compare expression levels to constructs containing the respective wild type sequence  or to ‘ <dig> are’ .  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig>  and  p < <dig> . anova, analysis of variance; ares, au-rich elements; sem, standard error of the mean.



overall, these experiments identified are elements within regions  <dig> and  <dig> that are involved in the regulation of lif mrna stability in müller cells.

ilf <dig> influences redox-dependent lif mrna stability in müller glia
to identify proteins that specifically bind to ares in regions  <dig> and  <dig> we incubated the respective rna sequences or their are-null counterparts  with protein extracts from rmc- <dig> cells. mass spectrometry -based quantitative proteomics identified those proteins that preferentially bound to the wild type sequences of regions  <dig> or  <dig> . gene ontology -pathway analysis on identified proteins showed that pools were enriched in rna binding proteins and contained  <dig>  and  <dig>  such proteins . whereas rna binding proteins identified with region  <dig> were mainly linked to translational initiation and elongation as well as rna catabolic processes , region  <dig> rna binding proteins were primarily associated with double-stranded rna binding and mrna stability . interestingly, the protein pool identified with region  <dig> was also enriched with cell redox homeostasis proteins .table  <dig>

elav like rna binding protein  <dig>  and ilf <dig>  two well-known are-binding proteins  <cit> , were identified as primary candidates for targeting ares in region  <dig> of the lif 3′utr . interestingly, ilf <dig> together with elavl <dig> was previously shown to regulate gene expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase  <dig>  through an h2o2-dependent mechanism  <cit> . ilf <dig> was additionally shown to interact with several rna binding proteins including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein  d, hnrnpa2/b <dig> and hnrnpa/b  <cit> . all of these hnrnps were identified by our ms analysis and shown to preferentially bind the  <dig> wild type over the respective are-null sequence ; but none reached statistical significance . since hnrnpd not only is an interacting partner of ilf <dig> but also a known are binding protein, which potentially directly influences stability of target mrnas  <cit> , we included it in our further analyses.

to test whether the identified proteins are indeed involved in redox regulation of lif mrna stability we silenced their expression in rmc- <dig> cells and analyzed the effect of h2o <dig> on lif mrna levels. ilf <dig> silencing by two different sirnas significantly impaired lif mrna stabilization in h2o2-treated serum-deprived cells by about 50%. knockdown of elavl <dig> or hnrnpd, however, had no significant effect . controls showed that transfection of sirna decreased expression levels of target mrnas by 86% , 79% , 52%  and 91% , as compared to cells transfected with scrambled sirna . similarly, protein levels of elavl <dig> and ilf <dig>  were severely reduced in cells treated with the respective sirnas . silencing of either gene did not significantly alter lif expression in untreated müller cells .figure  <dig> ilf <dig> regulates redox dependent mrna stabilization in rmc- <dig> müller cells. a) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with sirnas directed against ilf <dig>  elavl <dig> or hnrnpd, as indicated. scrambled sirna was used as control . medium was changed  <dig> hours after transfection and then cells were  or were not  serum deprived. h2o <dig>  was added to the indicated samples. rna levels were determined by real-time pcr two hours after treatment and expressed relative to untreated cells , which were set to  <dig> for each knockdown series. n =  <dig> to  <dig>  b) top panel: rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with sirnas directed against ilf <dig>  elavl <dig> or hnrnpd, as indicated. scrambled sirna was used as control . medium was changed  <dig> hours after transfection and respective target rna levels were determined after two hours by real-time pcr. bottom panels show protein levels at  <dig> hours after sirna transfection. n =  <dig>  c) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with sirnas directed against ilf <dig>  elavl <dig> or hnrnpd, as indicated. scrambled sirna was used as control . medium was changed  <dig> hours after transfection and lif rna levels were determined after two hours by real-time pcr. to knockdown ilf <dig> expression, two different sirnas , ilf <dig> ) were used to exclude off-target effects. shown are means ± sem of n =  <dig>  one-way anova with dunnett’s posttests was used to compare lif levels after sd + h2o <dig> treatments  and in untreated knockdowns against control . student’s t-test was used to compare downregulation of target genes .  p < <dig> ,  p < <dig> . anova, analysis of variance; ilf <dig>  interleukin enhancer binding factor 3; sem, standard error of the mean.



this argued that redox regulated lif mrna stability may involve ilf <dig> but not elavl <dig> or hnrnpd.

khsrp is an important general regulator of lif expression
we identified ilf <dig> to be of importance for regulating lif mrna levels in redox signaling, probably through its interaction with ares in the 3′utr of the gene transcript. however, ilf <dig> did not affect lif mrna levels under normal growth conditions. we also showed that ttp, known to be capable of regulating the stability of are-containing mrnas in various systems, was not involved in controlling lif mrna levels under normal conditions . thus, we asked whether other rna binding proteins may affect lif mrna levels under normal non-stressed growth conditions. khsrp was an obvious candidate as it is a multifunctional rna binding protein involved in both transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation as well as in mirna biogenesis  <cit> . furthermore, khsrp is regulated through p <dig> mapk signaling  <cit>  that was shown to be important for lif mrna transcription  <cit> . silencing khsrp to 15%  or 8%  of control levels resulted in 78%  and 52% , respectively, lower lif mrna levels under normal conditions  suggesting that khsrp is essential to maintain normal lif mrna levels in non-stressed cells. however, lack of khsrp did not affect redox-mediated stabilization of lif transcripts. note that expression levels of lif in figure 7c have been normalized to the respective controls  to better visualize the effect of h2o <dig> in khsrp knockdown cells. these results argue that khsrp is involved in lif expression independently of redox regulated mrna stabilization and suggest that mechanisms controlling lif mrna levels under normal conditions differ from those under stress conditions. khsrp may be involved in the first, ilf <dig> in the second, situation. both proteins showed widespread expression in the normal mouse retina. cells of the inner nuclear layer and of the ganglion cell layer were intensely stained whereas photoreceptor cells appeared to contain lower levels of the two proteins. light-induced injury did not affect the expression pattern. co-staining for glutamine synthetase confirmed expression of ilf <dig> and khsrp in müller glia supporting a role of ilf <dig> and khsrp in müller cells in vivo .figure  <dig> silencing of khsrp reduces lif mrna levels in non-stressed rmc- <dig> müller cells. a, b) rmc- <dig> cells were transfected with sirnas directed against khsrp. scrambled sirna was used as control . medium was changed  <dig> hours after transfection and rna levels for khsrp  or lif

discussion
regulation of lif expression in müller cells
our results show that lif mrna levels are regulated in stressed müller cells by a redox controlled stability mechanism that involves ares in the lif 3′utr. this mechanism may thus constitute a significant part of the neuroprotective activity of müller glia cells that critically depends on signaling between injured photoreceptors and müller cells  <cit> . several reports argue that h2o <dig> may act as a signaling molecule in various biological systems  <cit> . our results support this notion and suggest that the reported neuroprotective effect of h2o <dig> in the retina  <cit>  may be through its signaling to müller cells leading to increased expression of lif. h2o <dig> may be generated by nadph oxidases or be released from outer segments in case of photoreceptor injury  <cit> . generation or release may occur as long as stress conditions exist and, thus, h2o <dig> may signal for a prolonged period of time to ensure a lasting increase of lif mrna levels in the damaged retina as observed in both the vpp and rd <dig> models of retinal degeneration  <cit> .

in the mammalian retina, basal expression of lif is barely detectable but expression increases after photoreceptor or ganglion cell injury  <cit> . however, in both primary müller cells and rmc- <dig> cells basal lif expression was relatively high, a phenomenon which may be the result of removing müller cells from their tissue environment disrupting cell-cell interactions and/or of in vitro culture conditions. still, lif expression responded to tnf treatment in rmc- <dig> cells in vitro leading to transiently increased levels similar to the in vivo situation  <cit> . importantly, h2o <dig> also enhanced lif mrna stability after such a transient upregulation of lif transcription  highlighting the importance of h2o <dig> signaling for the prolonged maintenance of increased lif expression during stress conditions. under normal non-stress conditions, however, h2o <dig> did not affect lif levels , in contrast to mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase  <dig>  and placenta growth factor  that were induced under such conditions  <cit> . because of its reported side effects in the retina  <cit> , lif expression might be needed to be tightly regulated by a negative feedback system to avoid hazardous high lif levels under normal conditions. thus, h2o <dig> may be required for lif to overcome this negative feedback and to sustain lif rna stability ultimately leading to an increased cell survival during degenerative conditions in the retina.

an additional level of control may be the restriction of lif upregulation to a small subpopulation of müller cells in the injured retina  <cit> . this may additionally ensure that overall levels of lif may not exceed a certain threshold, thus safeguarding the retina. although the molecular mechanism of this regulation is not known, an intriguing possibility is the existence of programmed müller cells that have the unique capability to respond to h2o <dig> as a physiological messenger. recently, aquaporins  <dig> and  <dig> have been identified as channels for h2o <dig>  a molecule once believed to diffuse freely through cell membranes  <cit> . although all known aquaporins have been identified in ocular tissues  <cit>  and aquaporin- <dig> has been shown to alter its localization in müller glia cells upon photoreceptor injury  <cit> , it will be important to study the aquaporin expression profiles and localization with respect to h2o <dig> signaling and the ensuing müller cell response.

even though h2o <dig> clearly functioned through the regulation of lif mrna stability without affecting lif gene transcription, h2o <dig> may nevertheless act on other levels as well. it has been shown that h2o <dig> activates expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor  target genes such as sulfiredoxin and heme-oxygenase  <dig>  <cit> . nfe2l <dig> is a redox regulated transcription factor prominently expressed in müller cells and astrocytes in the retina  <cit>  and binds to specific sequence elements in the 5′utr of target genes. interestingly, such elements were not only identified in the lif 5′utr, but they also had the highest cross-species conservation among other transcription factor binding sites  <cit> . this raises the possibility that a connection might exist between h2o <dig> levels, nfe2l <dig> activation and initial lif expression. however, we have not addressed the initiation of lif transcription in this study as lif expression was already high in cultured müller cells. therefore, in vivo studies are required to study such a potential interaction and to better understand redox regulation of lif expression during retinal disease conditions.

cis-acting elements for lif regulation
various studies have shown that regulation of mrna stability and, hence, gene expression is closely linked to regulatory sequence elements within the 3′utr of the target gene. among those, ares regulate stability of the associated gene transcript by directing the binding of regulatory proteins. hao et al. have shown that the number of ares is closely associated with the timing of events during an inflammatory response. early response genes have the highest number of ares, which may support fast turnover of transcripts after the initial activation to strictly regulate gene expression  <cit> . lif mrna is also associated with a high number of ares in its 3′utr  and has been shown by us and others to be expressed early and transiently in response to injury  <cit> . ares that were associated with the regulation of lif mrna stability resided mainly in highly conserved regions in mammals including humans . this suggests that mechanisms for the regulation of lif expression may be conserved among mammals.

since h2o <dig> increased mrna levels not only of lif but also of other are containing transcripts such as ttp and cox <dig> , our data support the concept that h2o <dig> signaling may control a general pathway for the regulation of are-mediated mrna stability during oxidative stress. additionally, h2o <dig> signaling may also be linked to inflammation since  ttp can regulate expression of critical inflammatory response genes such as tnf  <cit> ,  cox <dig> is an important mediator of the inflammatory response  <cit> , and  lif signaling has both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . since inflammatory events have been implicated in retinal pathologies including age related macular degeneration   <cit> , h2o <dig> signaling may not only be neuroprotective via regulation of lif expression but may affect the outcome of retinal degenerative diseases on several levels.

trans-acting factors for lif regulation
ms analysis has identified several rna binding proteins that targeted lif are sequences. elavl <dig> and ilf <dig> were of significant interest among the proteins that bound to ares of region  <dig>  as both proteins were previously shown to be involved in h2o <dig> dependent mrna stabilization and/or translation  <cit> . here, ilf <dig> but not elavl <dig> was involved in redox dependent regulation of lif mrna stability in müller cells . this suggests that elavl <dig> either may not be involved in the regulation of lif mrna stability or may influence lif expression by other means such as through regulation of rna splicing  <cit>  and/or translation  <cit> .

interestingly, neither lif nor mkp <dig> mrnas were identified as ilf <dig> target rnas by a high-throughput ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay  <cit>  even though both lif  and mkp <dig>  were shown to be regulated by ilf <dig> during oxidative stress. since non-treated hela cell lysates were used for those experiments  <cit> , this may indicate that ilf <dig> may have different binding affinities for target sequences under normal and stress conditions. here, however, ilf <dig> was identified as a binding protein for ares in the lif 3′utr using extracts from untreated müller cells  and shown to function under redox conditions. although experimental approaches and binding conditions differed from the study of kuwano  <cit> , this indicates that the binding affinity of ilf <dig> to target ares may be influenced by cell-type and/or species specificities.

in contrast to ilf <dig>  the contribution of khsrp to the regulation of lif mrna expression in müller cells may not depend on redox signaling . similar to the inhibition of p <dig> mapk, sirna-mediated knockdown of khsrp severely reduced lif mrna levels suggesting that khsrp is required to stabilize lif transcripts under normal conditions. this result was unexpected, since khsrp has been shown to negatively regulate stability of its target mrnas  <cit> . although khsrp was detected in our ms analysis, it did not show preferential binding to either wild type or mutant sequences . thus, it is possible that the reduction of lif mrna levels in the absence of khsrp may be independent of ares in regions  <dig> and/or  <dig> of the 3′utr. since khsrp has been shown to promote maturation of mirnas  <cit> , khrsp may affect lif mrna levels indirectly, potentially by modulating non-coding rnas involved in lif regulation. although mirnas are generally believed to destabilize target mrnas, evidence has been presented that individual mirnas may also increase the stability of targets  <cit> . thus, absence of khsrp may prevent maturation of specific non-coding rnas required for lif mrna stabilization under normal conditions. alternatively, khsrp may act through an interaction with the p <dig> mapk pathway  <cit>  since both inactivation of khsrp and inhibition of p <dig> mapk had similar consequences for lif mrna levels under normal conditions.

our results highlight important aspects of lif gene expression, which may impact on retinal physiology and pathophysiology. specifically, regulatory proteins identified here may provide attractive targets for the modulation of lif synthesis in retinal degenerative diseases since a moderate elevation of endogenous lif expression may be neuroprotective and support photoreceptor survival . our data may also impact on stem cell biology since lif is a pleiotropic factor that contributes to stem cell renewal in vivo and maintenance of pluripotency of mouse stem cells in culture  <cit> . interestingly, müller cells act as stem cells to regenerate retinal neurons in fish  <cit>  and attempt  to do likewise in mouse  <cit> . thus, a proper adjustment of lif signaling in vivo may influence the capability of mammalian müller cells to act as progenitors in retinal disease. clearly, in vivo experiments are warranted to test whether modulating the components of lif regulation may affect neuroprotection and/or impact on the stem cell potential of müller glia cells in the mouse retina and may thus improve disease outcome and vision.

CONCLUSIONS
neuroprotection through the generation of ros by injured neurons has long been a controversial issue in neurodegenerative diseases. here, we show that h2o <dig> can act as a messenger to regulate expression of the neuroprotective gene lif in stressed müller glia. redox dependent increase in expression is achieved by the modulation of lif mrna stability through an ilf <dig> dependent pathway and conserved ares in the 3′utr. therefore, injury-induced production of ros by retinal neurons leads to stabilization of lif mrna that may result in a more sustained expression when lif signaling is necessary to preserve neurons.
