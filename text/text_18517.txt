BACKGROUND
liver failure is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide  <cit> . the only effective treatment so far for acute and chronic liver failure is liver transplantation  <cit> . however, liver transplantation has several limitations, especially, the shortage of organ donors. during the last decade, hepatocyte transplantation therapy has emerged as an attractive alternative treatment for end-stage liver disease  <cit> . to enhance the potential for this approach, hepatocyte transplantation therapy requires a renewable cell source of functional hepatocytes in vitro. one of the most promising potential sources of functional hepatocytes is from directed embryonic stem  cell differentiation.

at present, lack of detailed knowledge of the hepatocyte differentiation events restricts this potential. several groups have reported that mouse embryonic stem  cells can differentiate towards hepatocyte-lineage, based on the expression of several hepatocyte-lineage marker genes, but the underlying mechanisms that steer the induction of stem cell differentiation toward functional hepatocytes is poorly characterized  <cit> . hepatocyte-lineage marker genes have been categorized into four groups, representing stages in the potential sequence of molecular events of hepatocyte differentiation. the first group are endodermal markers  including α-fetoprotein  and hepatocyte nuclear factor-3β   <cit> . the second group are fetal hepatocyte markers  including albumin  <cit> . the third group are perinatal hepatocyte markers  including glucose-6-phosphatase  and tyrosine aminotransferase   <cit> . the fourth group are postnatal  hepatocyte markers  including cytochrome p450-3a , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and tryptophan  <dig> -dioxygenase   <cit> .

the expression of hepatocyte-lineage marker genes is primarily regulated at transcriptional level  <cit> . promoters of hepatocyte-lineage marker genes contain combinations of dna regulatory elements for binding liver-enriched transcription factors   <cit> . despite the importance of letfs in regulation of expression of hepatocyte-lineage marker genes, as yet, few studies have examined the profile and sequence of expression of letfs in the differentiation of es cells.

the overall aim of this study was to determine the expression of letfs during differentiation of es cells toward hepatocyte-lineages in vitro. our study had two linked stages. firstly, we developed culture conditions that enhanced differentiation towards a hepatic phenotype. secondly, to permit a more detailed characterization of the underlying regulatory mechanisms that define mes-derived hepatocyte-lineage cells, transgenic mes cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein , under the control of an albumin promoter/enhancer element were created and used to purify hepatocyte-lineage cells by fluorescent-activated cell sorting . the pattern of expression of hepatocyte-lineage marker and letf genes was examined in populations of cells generated from facs.

RESULTS
him exhibits enhanced potential for differentiation of mes cells toward hepatocyte-lineages
rt-pcr analysis of differentiation marker gene expression indicated that culturing of cells in hepatocyte inducing medium  supported mes cell differentiation through to postnatal stage of hepatocyte development. populations generated from culture in non-differentiated es medium  without leukemia inhibitory factor  expressed endodermal marker genes  but failed to show the expression of fetal , perinatal  or postnatal  hepatocyte marker genes throughout the time course of culture  . in contrast, mes cell populations generated from culture in him showed expression of all hepatocyte-lineage marker gene examined including postnatal hepatocyte markers . in addition, the hepatocyte marker genes in him culture were expressed in an order  similar to that observed in the development of the normal mouse embryo  <cit> . however, the expression of pou5f <dig> was observed throughout the culture period implying that some non-differentiated mes cells were present even at the end of the culture .

flow cytometry fractionation of hepatocyte-lineage cells from differentiated mes cell populations
although culture in him enhanced the derivation of cells of hepatocyte-lineage, it was clear that mes cell populations generated from this culture condition contained mixed cell types. most mes cells  exhibited circular-shaped cell morphology with a diameter about  <dig> μm but some  exhibited epithelial-like morphology . the observed heterogeneity limited the interpretation of changes in gene expression in terms of differentiation toward hepatocyte-lineage. consequently, linked to him culture, we isolated hepatocyte-lineage cells from the mixed population by fluorescence with egfp expressed from a reporter construct under the control of a hepatocyte-specific  promoter/enhancer element.

after mes cell transfection,  <dig> clonal transfectants  were obtained and four randomly selected palb-egfp/es cell lines were cultured in him and the percentages of gfp-expressing cells  were determined by flow cytometry. one cell line, a. <dig>  expressed a higher percentage of gfp-expressing cells than the others upon differentiation and this cell line was selected for a more detail analysis of mes cell differentiation using facs. gfp-expressing cells were purified from the a. <dig> populations, after  <dig> days  and  <dig> days  of culture by facs and gfp-negative cells  were also isolated at each stage of culture  . the percentage of gfp-expressing cells was increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at culture day  <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % at culture day  <dig> . the sorted gfp-expressing cells homogeneously exhibited epithelial-like morphology  . unsorted cells from cultured cell line a. <dig> were harvested at  <dig> days of culture  as a further comparator. rt-pcr indicated that n <dig> expressed all the hepatocyte-lineage marker genes including hnf-3β, afp, albumin, tat, g6pase, cyp3a, pepck and tdo . all hepatocyte-lineage marker genes detected in n <dig> were also detected in purified gfp-expressing cells . in addition, the expression of pou5f <dig> was absent in both a. <dig> + and a. <dig> + indicating that the contaminated non-differentiated mes cells were separated from the populations after facs . the a. <dig> - population expressed several hepatocyte-lineage marker genes  but crucially did not express perinatal or postnatal marker genes  . these data indicate that the a. <dig> cell line cultured in him could generate cells with the genetic characteristics of mature hepatocytes, which by sorting allow for subsequent definition of the relationships between cell line development and transcriptional regulatory events.

as a further step towards understanding regulatory events linked to mature hepatocyte differentiation processes, the expression of cytochrome p450-3a  and glucose-6-phosphatase  was measured in a. <dig> + and a <dig> + cells by quantitative real-time pcr . expression of cyp3a and g6pase increased from  <dig> to  <dig> days of culture in the gfp-expressing populations towards the level found in intact mouse liver  .

expression of liver-enriched transcription factors during mes cell differentiation
having defined a method for enhancement of differentiation towards hepatocyte-lineage  and a means to enrich hepatocyte-lineage cells, we sought to examine how control of differentiation towards hepatocyte lineage was related to the pattern of expression of the network of letfs. to this end we determined expression of  <dig> letfs at mrna level throughout mes culture in him and in populations separated on the basis of palb-egfp expression 

expression of hnf-1β in mes cell populations was greatest  at day  <dig> of culture and remained constant over a further  <dig> days before decreasing  . the expression of hnf-3β increased over the first  <dig> days of culture and reached its highest value  at day  <dig> before decreasing  . hnf-3α and c/ebp-β exhibited a pattern of expression that was similar to that of hnf-3β, increasing over the first  <dig> days of culture to reach their highest values  at day  <dig> before decreasing  .

although the expression of hnf-4α and hnf- <dig> also increased over the first  <dig> days of culture, to reach its greatest expression at that time  the expression of these two transcription factors remained unchanged from that point until the end of culture . in contrast to all other letf genes examined, c/ebp-α mrna could not be detected at any stage of culture .

gfp-expressing cell populations were isolated from a. <dig> cells cultured in him for  <dig>  and  <dig>  days. it was notable that the expression of all letfs examined increased progressively from  <dig> to  <dig> days of culture for gfp-expressing populations . in particular, the expression of hnf-3α and c/ebp-β in the a. <dig> + population reached values similar to those observed for intact mouse liver . in contrast to hnf-3α and c/ebp-β, the expression of hnf-4α and hnf- <dig> in the a. <dig> + population was still much lower than that of intact mouse liver  . again, c/ebp-α mrna expression was undetectable .

for gfp-negative cell populations isolated after  <dig> and  <dig> days of culture , the expression of hnf-1β, hnf-3β, hnf- <dig> and c/ebp-β was similar to that of non-differentiated mes cells   whereas the expression of hnf-3α and hnf-4α were similar to that of the unsorted albumin-negative cultured mes cell population  .

discussion
the ability of es cells to differentiate to various cells of ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm lineages in vitro offers a promising system to study cell differentiation processes that opens the potential for cell replacement therapy. in this study, we categorized the hepatocyte-lineage marker genes into four groups  according to the expression pattern during the development of mouse liver  <cit>  to facilitate the identification of the corresponding developmental state of the differentiated mes cells. we demonstrated that even though the differentiated ebs can generate endodermal cells , these mes-derived endodermal cells cannot proceed past a specific "check point" to generate hepatocyte-like cells  without the supplementation of some undetermined critical factors .

several previously published papers have reported that mes cell-derived ebs expressed alb and tat genes, when cultured in same medium as our control condition, ndesm  <cit> . there are several potential reasons that would explain the apparent discrepancy. firstly, the mes cell lines used in this study is different from those used in previous publications. it is well known that different mes cell lines have varied differentiation capacity even though cultured in the same conditions  <cit> . secondly, unlike previous studies, we did not use the "hanging drop method" for generating ebs and this is an important factor which might contribute to the differences in the experimental results.

this is the first report, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that a relatively simple medium, supplemented with insulin and dexamethasone and no other growth factors, can support induction of cultured mes cells towards endodermal and hepatocyte-lineage cells in a pattern similar to that of mouse embryos  <cit>  . other workers have reported a need to make sequential additions of several growth factors to mimic the expression profile of hepatocyte-lineage markers in cultured mes cells populations but in our system this was unnecessary  <cit> . however, the percentage of albumin-expressing cells generated from him culture was still lower than those reported using the sequential addition of growth factors. this implies that the sequential addition of growth factors may improve the differentiation efficiency even through they are not critical for the induction of the expression of those hepatocyte-lineage genes.

it also appeared that albumin-expressing cells were also detected in gfp-negative cell populations  as determined by rt-pcr. this might arise through two reasons. firstly, the albumin promoter/enhancer region used in this study  contained only parts of the whole physiological albumin promoter. thus, it is possible that the gfp-negative, albumin-expressing cells may produce albumin-mrna under control of the albumin promoter regions which are located outside alb-p/e. secondly, it is also possible that the transfected alb-p/e might be inactivated in some albumin-expressing a. <dig> cells. such events can account for the lack of gfp-expression in albumin-expressing cells.

we have shown that up-regulation of the expression of hnf-3α, hnf-4α, hnf- <dig>  and c/ebp-β was specific to the hepatocyte-lineage cells in the heterogeneous cultured mes cell populations . by implication, this suggests that these transcription factors might be required for the initiation of cell progression towards full expression of hepatocyte-lineage marker genes in mes-derived hepatocyte-like cells. in contrast, the expression of hnf-1β and hnf-3β in the mes-derived hepatocyte-lineage cells  was not significantly different from that of albumin-negative cell populations . these data suggest that although hnf-1β and hnf-3β are required for expression of endodermal marker genes  they might not be required for the expression of fetal, perinatal and postnatal hepatocyte marker genes  .

others have reported that expression of hnf-1β and hnf-3β was increased when definitive endoderm  was generated and then decreased  or remained constant  during the remainder of liver development  <cit> .

although expression of hnf-3α and c/ebp-β in the a. <dig> + population  was similar to that of intact mouse liver, the expression of hnf-4α and hnf- <dig> was 40-fold less than that of intact liver. the expression of c/ebp-α, which is considered to be involved in perinatal and postnatal stages of hepatocyte differentiation processes  <cit> , was not detected in any cultured mes cells populations in this study. moreover, although a. <dig> + and a. <dig> + mes-derived cells expressed all hepatocyte-lineage marker genes examined, the expression of perinatal and postnatal hepatocyte marker genes  was much less than that of intact mouse liver . the lack of the significant expression of "late phase" transcription factors such as c/ebp-α  implies a regulatory point of key significance towards the transition to expression perinatal and postnatal hepatocyte marker genes  in the mes-derived hepatocyte-lineage cell populations. this interpretation agrees with reports that c/ebp-α -/- mice died within  <dig> hours after birth due to hypoglycemia caused by low expression of several glucose metabolism enzymes including g6pase  and pepck   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have provided a detailed analysis of the sequential and coordinated changes in key transcription factor gene expression in an in vitro model of hepatocyte differentiation . these data indicate that the regulation of expression of late phase transcription factors is critical for optimization of differentiation of es cells towards a full hepatocyte phenotype in vitro. however, the direct evidence for any causal relationship between specific transcription factors and the differentiation would only arise through further experiments involving over-expression and/or knockdown of specific transcription factors. nonetheless, the system we have developed and the molecular characterization of the transcription factor  profiles offer a critical model for direct examination of molecular determinants of hepatocyte differentiation control. that information will not only develop further understanding of cell differentiation processes but will aid researchers in examination of the potential for use of human es cells in the generation of donor hepatocytes for cell replacement therapies.
