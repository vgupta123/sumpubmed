BACKGROUND
cystic kidney diseases are amongst the most common monogenetic disorders in the human population, affecting up to  <dig> in  <dig> individuals  <cit> . numerous studies have been carried out in humans, zebrafish and rodents  <cit>  indicating the important function that cilia and associated proteins play in the pathogenesis of renal cystic diseases  <cit> , including polycystic kidney disease   <cit>  and nephronophthisis   <cit>  incorporating merkel gruber and joubert syndromes  <cit> .

in addition to progressing our understanding of cystic pathophysiology, rodent models of cystic kidney disease have played a major role in facilitating the molecular characterization of novel genes required for normal renal epithelial cell function  <cit>  and establishing the importance of the ciliary-centrosome interactions in coordinating many aspects of cell division  <cit> . the available evidence suggests that defects in cilia or centrosomes can have profound effects on the control of cell division. for example, mutation of the pkhd <dig> gene encoding for fibrocystin/polyductin results in autosomal recessive  pkd. this gene was first identified in the pck rat  <cit>  and encodes an integral structural component of both the cilia and basal body associated with the centrosome  <cit> . another example relates to polycystin- <dig> and - <dig> expression, both of which have been shown to regulate the jak-stat pathway, which in turn controls cell cycle arrest in g <dig> and g <dig>  <cit> . when either protein is defective, as occurs in human autosomal dominant  pkd, unregulated cell growth can occur  <cit> . other key pathways engaged in cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation, growth and apoptosis, that are regulated by polycystin- <dig> include those involving wnt signaling  <cit> . wnt signaling has been shown to have oncogenic activity, becoming deregulated in certain types of cancers  <cit>  and polycystin- <dig> regulates genes responsive to wnt signaling  <cit> , inhibiting proliferation and maintaining normal microtubular structures.

the nphp gene family  encodes a group of proteins that are expressed in the primary cilium, basal bodies/centrosomes or mitotic spindles, and are critical to cell division and cilia function  <cit> . for example inversin  is thought to act as a molecular switch between the different wnt signaling pathways and is associated with the accumulation of proteins within the cilia  <cit> . nphp <dig> encodes for nephrocystin- <dig>  and has been localised to centrosomes in interphase and the mitotic spindle pole during mitosis  <cit> , while nphp <dig>  encoding for nima - related kinase  <dig> , localises to the proximal region of the primary cilium and is proposed to modulate ciliary targeting of polycystin- <dig> and polycystin- <dig>  <cit> .

the lewis polycystic kidney  rat is a spontaneous rat model of arpkd that has been phenotypically characterized  <cit> . the phenotype is localized to the kidney, which presents with large renal cysts. the lpk rat contrasts with the pkd/mhm cystic rat model, which has a mutation in the pkdr <dig> gene , and which presents additionally with liver cysts  <cit> . renal cyst formation in the early stages of disease in the lpk model is confined to the collecting ducts, comparable to human arpkd, and the animals present with a concurrent and marked hypertensive phenotype  <cit> . to fully appreciate the pathological basis of progression of the polycystic kidney phenotype in this model, we sought to identify the gene mutated in the lpk rat and its predicted impact on protein function using a positional cloning approach. further analysis focused on conserved elements within the mutated protein to predict structure and function.

our results determined that the mutation responsible for the rat lpk model is a non-synonymous mutation r650c in the nek <dig> gene, in a region syntenic to portions of human chromosome   <dig> and mouse chr  <dig>  this is a novel nek <dig> mutation that occurs within the regulator of chromosome condensation  <dig> -like region of the protein and is located within a glg) motif that we predict is important for the structural organisation of seven bladed beta-propeller rcc <dig> like proteins. scanning electron microscopy confirmed abnormal renal cilia in the lpk and fluorescence immunohistochemistry revealed altered cilia localisation of the nek <dig> protein.

RESULTS
genetic analysis locates the lpk qtl on rat chromosome 10q25
backcross  progeny were produced and characterized. the genetic map obtained from mapmanager  <cit>  analysis of  <dig> bc <dig> progeny is shown in figure 1a. the characteristic lpk phenotype, namely cyst to kidney ratio, was located within the map using wincart qtl. the output from wincart qtl for marker-trait linkage is shown in figure  <dig>  the cyst/kidney area ratio quantitative trait locus   mapped the lpk locus with a logarithm of odds  score of  <dig> to the region defined by the markers d10rat <dig>  and d10mgh <dig> . positions were taken from the rgsc genome ver <dig>   <cit> . characterization of an independent mapping population, a second filial  generation of  <dig> progeny, confirmed the location of the lpk locus but was unable to provide any greater resolution with the peak region of linkage located between d10rat <dig> and d10rat <dig> .

comparative genomics identifies candidate genes
localization of the lpk mutation on rat chromosome  <dig>  allowed comparison with syntenic regions of mouse and human chromosomes, mmu <dig> and hsa  <dig> respectively . the region of interest as defined by the qtl analysis , projected onto hsa <dig>  <dig> mbp to  <dig> mbp  and mmu <dig>  <dig> mbp to  <dig> mbp , based on shared molecular markers. within this region we identified  <dig> syntenic genes. two of these genes have previously shown to be associated with cystic kidney disease in mammals, namely, the genes coding for the nek <dig> protein and for the intraflagellar transport protein  <dig> .

following this comparative analysis, several approaches were explored to identify additional genes in the qtl defined region that may be causal for the lpk phenotype. an initial subset of genes was determined by review of all genes in the region, captured using ensembl biomart  <cit>  based on qualitative assessment criteria linked to known function and network pathways. analyses indicated  <dig> genes, in addition to nek <dig> and ift <dig> within this area that could potentially result in cystic kidney disease, namely: rgd1309077phf <dig>  flot <dig>  spag <dig>  sdf <dig>  supt6h, proca <dig>  traf <dig>  sarm <dig>  nlk and ksr <dig> . these candidate genes span approximately  <dig> kbp of genomic sequence so a genome capture array was employed to sequence the entire lpk locus  rather than using gene-by-gene sequencing.

targeted genome next-generation sequencing of the lpk region
nimblegen arrays were used for exon capture and sequencing of genomic dna spanning the markers d10rat <dig> and d10rat <dig> on rra <dig> . totals of  <dig> million reads and  <dig> million reads were generated for the lpk sample and control lewis  dna, respectively. 76% of the reads mapped to the target region with an average depth coverage of  <dig>  reads were aligned to the rn <dig> rat assembly to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  within exons. only one single homozygous and  <dig> heterozygous snps  were found unique to the lpk strain. the homozygous mutation was located at  <dig> , <dig> bp  within exon  <dig> of the nek <dig> gene, consisting of a base change of cytosine to thymine. this corresponded to position  <dig> within the cdna and would cause an arginine to cysteine change at position  <dig> in the protein product. conservation analysis identified the relevant amino acid  to be conserved in published nek <dig> mrna sequences  <cit> . the non-synonymous heterozygous snps identified in the sequence analysis were in two separate genes. the first was a het- <dig> mutation  at location  <dig> bp within the gene fam101b  of a/g  with a coverage of  <dig> reads. the second gene contained two low frequency het- <dig> mutations of t/a  and a/t  at location  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp within the krt1- <dig>  gene. conservation analysis of all three heterozygous snps  indicated that although the nucleotide in which the snp occurred was conserved across species, the actual codons were not conserved. these snps were not considered further.

*position location in base pairs  was determined using the rat genome browser gateway using the baylor  <dig> / build rn <dig> . ref: nucleotide on the ref sequence. obs: nucleotide recorded from transcripts. a c g t: number of transcripts recorded with a change to the reference. total: total number of transcripts recorded with a change to the reference. used: reads that support the change after consideration of read quality. snp type: defines type of mutation. dna: position of the base change within the cdna. prot: position of the amino acid change within the protein. aa change: resultant change of amino acid in the protein. hom: homozygous. het: heterozygous.

confirmation of the mutation in the nek <dig> gene
four bc <dig> animals â€“ two affected and two unaffected as defined by kidney histology and genotyping - were analysed in more detail. the parental lines of brown norway , wistar kyoto  and the lpk mutant were also analyzed. sequencing of bn and wky dna revealed a homozygous nucleotide  at location  <dig> , <dig> bp  . the bc <dig> animals that were cystic negative were either homozygous for nucleotide  or were heterozygous . the animals positive for cysts were homozygous for , as was the lpk mutant. these results confirmed the data obtained from the targeted genome sequencing.

nek <dig> predicted protein structure
the location of r650c within the nek <dig> protein is shown in figure  <dig>  alignment of the nek <dig> protein sequence across  <dig> species indicated a high level of conserved residues within the n-terminal serine/threonine kinase region of the protein as compared to the c-terminal rcc <dig> domain . the r650c located to a conserved rcc <dig> like repeat domain containing the repeated motif glg . the predicted ancestral dna sequence with evolutionary conserved amino acids in the nek <dig> protein is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  and suggests that r650c mutation is located within an evolutionary conserved domain.

the overall structure of the nek <dig> protein was subsequently interpreted using the extensively studied rcc1-like domains in proteins  <cit>  as a model. homology alignment using phyre <dig>  <cit>  and esypred  <cit>  showed that the serine/threonine kinase at the n terminal of the nek <dig> protein had up to 40% homology to over  <dig> different kinases . the rcc <dig> domain in the c terminal half of the protein aligned with three proteins, prp20p and rcc1/blip and herc <dig>  which were subsequently used to predict the tertiary structure of the nek <dig> protein. the nek <dig> rcc <dig> domain comprised of  <dig> identifiable rcc1-like repeat domains . an additional rcc1-like repeat domain was annotated as a non-canonical domain as it did not contain the typical repeat motif. the 3d structure shown in figure  <dig> provides a model for the serine/threonine kinase and the rcc <dig> domains of nek <dig> 

a manual comparison of the predicted 3d structure of nek8â€™s rcc <dig> domain to the mesocricetus auratus   <cit>  confirmed that repeat regions within the rcc <dig> domain formed the blades of a classical propeller structure  <cit> . the r650c mutation in the lpk nek <dig> protein is located in blade  <dig> .

relative occurrence of glg within proteins
the r650c mutation is within the core glg motif that was also noted within the hamster rcc <dig> protein. to investigate the occurrence of this motif and possible protein function, the expasy scanprosite tool  <cit>  was used to scan for the sequence within uniprotkb/swiss-prot databases. the original search using the glg motif within the homo sapiens taxa yielded  <dig> proteins. the final sequence search was refined to contain the two conserved glycine residues upstream from the motif of interest. the final search motif was gxgxglg. this search identified  <dig> proteins: dact <dig>  fbx <dig>  gli <dig>  herc <dig>  herc <dig>  herc <dig>  herc <dig>  herc <dig>  herc <dig>  ibtk, mycb <dig>  nek <dig>  nek <dig>  ptf1a, rcbt <dig>  rcbt <dig>  rcc <dig>  rcc <dig>  rccd <dig>  rpgr, srgef, wbs <dig>  wdfy <dig>  of the  <dig> identified proteins, five  were characterized as guanine releasing factors, dact <dig> and gli <dig> are involved in the hedgehog and wnt signaling pathways,  <dig> proteins were associated with the ubiquitin pathway ,  <dig> proteins were linked to cell cycle regulation , while little is known about wbs <dig>  wdfy and rccd <dig>  the majority of the proteins  contained multiple copies of the rcc <dig> repeats and are expected to form toroid 3d structures important for protein-protein interactions.

characterization of cilia and nek <dig> expression in lpk renal epithelial cells
under scanning electron microscopy, control lewis rat kidneys had normal morphology, with cilia present on the majority of cells  as short projections into the unchanged lumens of the tubules . cilia in lpk kidneys were observed as long, often tangled, screwed or with branches or knots  and there were occasionally multiple cilia per cell. in other cysts, epithelia had no or very short cilia. the median and quartile length of the cilia in the lpk distal tubule and collecting duct was significantly longer than lewis , with the range of values notably greater in the lpk kidney . immunohistochemical labeling for acetylated Î±-tubulin confirmed greater ciliary length in the lpk vs. lewis . in the lewis, double labeling for nek <dig> and Î³-tubulin, or nek <dig> and acetylated Î±-tubulin, indicated that nek <dig> was localised to a discrete region in the proximal portion of the cilia . in the lpk, double labeling with nek <dig> and Î³-tubulin, or nek  <dig> and acetylated Î±-tubulin showed variable positioning of nek <dig> in cilia, being either absent, present at the base or distal region of the cilia, or showing punctate staining along the length of cilia . this was confirmed in additional experiments with triple labeling for nek <dig> and both Î³-tubulin and acetylated Î±-tubulin .

discussion
this study found a novel snp mutation  located within the nek <dig> gene on rat chr  <dig> is responsible for the autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease phenotype identified in the lpk rat  <cit> . the lpk rat can now be classified as a rat model of nphp <dig>  <cit> , and will be invaluable for delineating the complex disease processes associated with nphp, including hypertension and cardiac disease  <cit> .

the lpk phenotype is similar to that described for the jck mouse nek <dig> model  <cit> , which also have elongated renal cilia and altered ciliary nek <dig> expression  <cit> . longer cilia have also been reported in other animal models of cystic renal diseases. the collecting ducts of the wpk rodent model for meckel-gruber syndrome  <cit> , and nphp <dig> mice  <cit> , all display longer cilia. an increase in length variability has been described previously in the cpk mouse  <cit> , a model of adpkd. our data supports the hypothesis that ciliary nek <dig> plays a key role in normal communication between the cilia and the processes of cellular differentiation and proliferation, such that its reduced expression or inadequate localization results in the formation of cysts  <cit> . whether an increase in cilia length is the effect of cystogenesis, or a primary defect in the assembly and maintenance of the cilium as a key pathogenic mechanism remains a controversial issue, as elongation of the cilium is also linked to injury  <cit> .

the impact of an arginine  to cysteine  change can potentially result in disulfide bridge formation, resulting in loss of rigidity in protein movements and conformational changes. an example of the impact of an r to c change can be found in the insulin receptor. the irr252c mutation results in an impairment of insulin binding, with downstream effects of reduced insulin degradation and insulin-induced receptor down-regulation  <cit> .

in order to better interpret the functional consequences of the r650c mutation in the lpk rats, we determined that the position of the mutation occurred within a repeated domain found in proteins with so-called propeller structures  <cit> . this rcc <dig> domain and the serine/threonine kinase domain are both evolutionary conserved features of the nek <dig> protein  <cit> . the rcc <dig> and serine/threonine kinase domains could be clearly identified in the predicted 3d structure that was modeled from the amino acid sequence.

manual comparison to the crystal structure of the golden hamster rcc <dig> protein  <cit>  confirmed that the motif in which the r650c mutation occurred is prominent in protein-protein interactions. for example, the outer regions of the blades of the reference rcc <dig> proteins form the conformationally diverse loop region that interacts with the gtpase ras-related nuclear protein   <cit> . another example of an rcc <dig> domain-containing protein that has a mutation within the glg sequence is the protein alsin, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for rab <dig> and rac <dig>  mutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive motor neuron disease  <cit> . alsin, similar to nek <dig>  has been predicted to form a  <dig> bladed propeller. the mutation g540e in alsin is similar to the h425y and r650c in nek <dig> in that it lies between strands c and d and positions itself within the conserved motif between the r650c and h425y mutation . structural analysis by soares et. al.   <cit>  predicts that this mutation destabilizes the structure resulting in the observed protein delocalization and cytotoxicity. this is also in accordance with mollinari et. al   <cit>  who illustrate the motif as a structural component that hinges the blades together.

a recent study has shown that correct localization of nek <dig> to centrosomes and cilia requires both nek <dig> catalytic activity and the rcc <dig> domain  <cit> . the authors propose that a region incorporating the g448v and h425y mutations, present within blade  <dig> of the rcc <dig> domain, is a centrosome/cilia targeting sequence  <cit> . the authors demonstrated that none of the known nek <dig> mutations identified in nphp patients, nor that of the jck mouse, had altered nek <dig> kinase activity. they further propose that autophosphorylation within the rcc <dig> domain caused a conformational change that reveals a cilia/centrosome-targeting site. among the nek <dig> mutations studied by zalli et al.   <cit>  the ones of specific interest were those that were homozygous . the interpretation of these mutations as exposing a cilia/centrosome targeting motif needs to be modified in light of the r650c mutation reported in this paper. the h425y mutation and r650c mutations are predicted to be located between strands c and d  and both are located at or near the conserved glg motif. these observations, taken together with other structure function studies on rcc <dig> like proteins, suggests that the seven bladed beta-propeller structure as a whole is important, rather than individual component blades or part thereof. we propose that the glg motif is an important component for defining the integrity of the â€˜axialâ€™ region on which the propeller structure is based.

taking into account structural similarities of proteins rcc <dig> domains  and the mutations r650c, h425y and g448v within nek8â€™s rcc <dig> domain, we contend that interactions with different proteins or conformational changes within the propeller structure as a unit per se are therefore important in altering the function of nek <dig>  this model is similar to observations on the rcc <dig> protein coupled to the gtpase ran, where all blades of the rcc <dig> propeller are involved in forming the rcc1-ran complex  <cit> . studies on a related protein, nek <dig>  <cit>  directly defined phosphorylation activity associated with the serine/threonine kinase activity and the control of this activity by the rcc <dig> domain. furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the nek <dig> rcc <dig> domain was the domain capable of binding ran  <cit> . the role of this domain in nek <dig> is thus inferred to be a regulatory domain for the kinase.

it is of interest that the mouse and rat mutations in nek8/nphp <dig> lead to a phenotypic presentation of polycystic kidney disease that resembles human arpkd, with an early onset, enlarged cystic phenotype and widespread cyst development  <cit> . in contrast, in human nphp, the majority of mutations result in a juvenile onset form of disease, having kidneys that are reduced in size and cysts arising at the corticomedullary border through loss of normal tissue  <cit> . the notable exception is infantile nphp, which arises from mutations in nphp2/inversin, and presents with a comparable histopathology to that of the rodent models. the known mutations in human nek8/nphp <dig> were identified through screening of patients clinically defined as nphp, however it is indiscernible from that study what the clinical phenotype of these patients was  <cit> .

phenotypic difference is not unique in rodent models of pkd, for as noted by fischer et al   <cit> , the mouse pcy model of nphp <dig> was initially proposed as model of adpkd  <cit>  and the pck rat model, while presenting with an adpkd phenotype, is due to a mutation in pkhd <dig>  the rat orthologue of the human gene responsible for arpkd  <cit> . while the nature of the mutations may be responsible for these phenotypic differences, it has recently been shown that mutations in nphp2/inversin always result in infantile nphp with enlarged kidneys, regardless of the mutation type  <cit> . relevant to this study, inversin and nek <dig> have a tightly coupled structural and functional relationship within the cilia  <cit>  and future studies are warranted to determine if the interactions between nek <dig> and inversin explain the phenotypic similarities between these forms of nphp.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of the lpk mutation in the nek <dig> gene is consistent with many lines of evidence linking this gene to nphp. the location of the mutation in the rcc <dig> domain and our demonstration of altered nek <dig> localisation supports the hypothesis that ciliary nek <dig> plays a key role in normal communication between the cilia and the processes of cellular differentiation and proliferation, such that its dysfunction results in the formation of cysts. our analysis establishes the lpk rat model for studies aimed at defining the key network systems linking regulation of the cell cycle with cilia, basal bodies and centrosomes, and further, providing a pathological model for the study of cystic kidney disease, and the development of potential intervention and treatment strategies.
