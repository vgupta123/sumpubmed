BACKGROUND
veterinary drugs are widely used in modern agricultural practice for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. unfortunately, illegal and abusive usage of veterinary drugs can cause long-term and short-term public health hazard  <cit> . monitoring of edible animal products for the presence of veterinary drug residues is an essential process in ensuring the safety of the food supply. the complexity of the biological matrices and the huge variety of drug residues preclude the use of a single analytical method. currently, liquid chromatography  combined with tandem mass spectrometric detection is the preferred technique in a large majority of all cases for quantification and confirmation  <cit> . other chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography  can be used for multiple residues screening, but the need for extensive sample pretreatment, specialized equipment and highly trained personnel make most chromatographic methods poorly suited for screening purposes. microbial survival assays and immunoassays are more suitable for screening. however, microbiological assays are time consuming, and the identity of the offending compound is not immediately known. on the other hand, immunochemical detections such as elisa have a fast turnaround, there is no need for any extensive sample preparation, and the compound is immediately identified. elisas are, therefore, one of the most commonly employed screening methods.

protein microarray as an emerging technology has many advantages over the traditional elisa method. it is a versatile, miniature and high-throughput platform that can be adapted for a variety of screening uses. protein microarrays are already widely used to perform high though-put drug screens, to study protein-protein interactions, and have great potential for disease diagnosis  <cit> . the technology can also be used to detect veterinary drug residues. here, we describe our protein microarray immunodetection assay  <cit>  for two commonly abused veterinary drugs: clenbuterol   <cit>  and sulfamethazine   <cit> . we compared its sensitivity to traditional elisa-based method, and tested the applicability of the assay to complex biological material.

methods
reagents and chemicals
the following reagents were purchased from sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa: clenbuterol , sulfamethazine , bovine serum albumin , ovalbumin , freund's adjuvant complete , freund's adjuvant incomplete , tween- <dig> and n', n-dimethylformamide . cy3-goat-anti-rabbit igg, and hrp-goat-anti-rabbit igg were purchased from jackson immunoresearch, west grove, pa, usa.  <dig> ' <dig> '-tetramethyl benzidine dihydrochloride  was purchased from amresco, inc., solon, oh, usa.

hapten-carrier conjugation
the aromatic primary amine on cl and sm <dig> were activated by diazotization and coupled to the phenol group of tyrosine residues on ovalbumin  as a carrier protein  <cit> . the detailed conjugation procedures are as follows:  <dig> mg of each hapten were first acidified . then, 2% nano <dig> was slowly added with stirring. after  <dig> h,  <dig> ml of  <dig>  m carbonate buffer solution  containing  <dig> mg ova was added. the ph was maintained between  <dig> and  <dig>  through the periodic addition of  <dig>  m naoh. the solution was allowed to stir overnight at 4°c. the conjugated product was dialyzed into pbs for  <dig> h, with pbs replacement at  <dig> h intervals. the synthetic products were combined with the same volume of sterile 80% glycerol and then frozen at -20°c. the formation of the artificial antigens was monitored by uv absorbance from  <dig> to  <dig> nm . within this wavelength range, the haptens, ova and the respective conjugates have distinct absorbance patterns and thus could be used to identify the formation of the conjugated product.

the efficiency of the diazotization was determined by the coupling ratios of the haptens to ova. the conjugation ratios of cl to ova and sm <dig> to ova are 16: <dig> and 3: <dig>  respectively.

antibody production
one mg of each immunogen  were diluted with sterile saline and combined with an equal volume of complete freund's adjuvant for the initial subcutaneous injection into new zealand white rabbits . second and third injections were mixed with incomplete freund's adjuvant, and no adjuvant was used for the forth. the injections were  <dig> days apart, and two rabbits were immunized with each immunogen. blood was collected before the start of immunizations as a negative control, and  <dig> days after each immunization for titer monitoring.  <dig> ml of blood was collected each time from the central ear artery and allowed to clot and retract at 37°c for  <dig> h and overnight at 4°c. the blood samples were then centrifuged at room temperature for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> rpm and the sera were decanted into sterile tubes.

antibody titer monitoring
titers of the polyclonal antibodies against the two immunogens were determined by indirect elisa.  <dig> well plates were coated with cl or sm <dig> artificial antigens overnight at 4°c. the plates were washed  <dig> times with pbst , and blocked with  <dig> μl of  <dig> %  ova per well at 37°c for  <dig>  h. antisera from each injection were diluted from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig>  on a two-fold dilution series and  <dig> μl were applied to each well. undiluted pre-immune sera were also assayed as the negative control. the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h, washed with pbst, and then incubated with hrp-anti-rabbit igg  at 37°c for  <dig> h. finally, tmb  was added and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min, and  <dig> μl per well of  <dig> m h2so <dig> was added to stop the enzymatic reaction. the plates were read with a zs- <dig> microplate reader . the final optical density reading was adjusted for background absorbance .

we could observe an increase in the od after each injection, indicating that the titers were rising. the pre-immune sera showed insignificant amount of absorbance, implicating that the antisera were specific. we determined that after four injections, a sufficient titer was achieved for both immunogens , and terminating bleeds were performed. the sera were collected as mentioned above and stored at -80°c.

competitive indirect elisa
two 96-well plates were each coated with  <dig> μg per well of cl or sm <dig> artificial antigen overnight at 4°c. the plates were washed  <dig> times with pbst, and blocked with  <dig> μl of  <dig> %  ova per well at 37°c for  <dig>  h. a 1: <dig>  dilution of the antisera were shown during tittering to achieve an od in the working range, thus for both cl and sm <dig>   <dig> μl of a 1: <dig>  dilution of the corresponding antiserum were applied to each well, and  <dig> μl of the corresponding hapten standard solutions was added as the "competitor". the concentrations of the standard solutions of cl were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  ng/ml; for sm <dig>  the concentrations of the standard solutions were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/ml. each concentration was added to one row of twelve wells. the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h, and were processed the same way as in the indirect elisa mentioned above.

protein microarray immunodetection
twenty nanogram of each artificial antigen were spotted onto a  <dig> ×  <dig> array on p-l-l microarray slides  using an omnigrid- <dig> microarrayer . following a  <dig> h incubation in a humid chamber at 37°c, the slides were inverted and immersed into pbs  containing  <dig> % ova . the slides were then turned right side up and immersed in a 2% bsa solution for  <dig> h at room temperature with gentle agitation. next, the slides were washed twice  at room temperature with pbst and twice with ddh2o. the diluted antiserum  and one of the corresponding standard hapten solutions  were mixed and added to an artificial antigen-spotted protein microarray slide. the slides were incubated with the antiserum-hapten mix for  <dig> h at room temperature and then washed three times with pbst and once with ddh2o. then, cy3-goat-anti-rabbit igg  was applied to the slides. after  <dig> h of incubation, the slides were rinsed with pbst and then washed as previously. the slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned using an axon genepix® 4000b microarray scanner  to detect the fluorescence signal.

ic <dig> determination
a dose-response curve was produced and was used to calculate the ic <dig> by non-linear regression analysis using graphpad prism  <dig> software  for the ci-elisa, the final optical density reading was adjusted for background absorbance . the log of the hapten concentrations were plotted against the percentage of inhibition, which was calculated by the equation  × 100%, where the control group  od was considered to be the point of 100% activity.

the results of the protein microarray assays were reported as the average pixels of fluorescence at  <dig> nm of the  <dig> spots for each hapten concentration minus background pixels. the ic <dig> of the protein microarray assays were determined by the same method of non-linear regression analysis as for the ci-elisa.

fortification of muscle homogenate with clenbuterol
the muscle tissue samples in control group were used in the fortification studies. fortification was carried out by adding  <dig> μl of methanolic solutions containing clenbuterol concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml to the tissue homogenate, resulting in fortification levels of  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> ng/g, respectively  <cit> . the fortified samples were used for calculation of recovery by ci-elisa and protein microarrays.

preparation of muscle samples from clenbuterol-fed chicken
fifteen eight-week-old broilers  were randomly divided into five groups and raised in brooders provided with fresh feed and water every day. the control group was given drug-free feed; the other four groups were given feed treated with  <dig> mg/kg cl   <cit> . the broilers were fed for  <dig> consecutive days. one treated group was slaughtered after  <dig>   <dig> day,  <dig> days, and  <dig> days withdrawal periods, respectively. the muscle tissue samples were collected and frozen at -20°c until analysis. the muscle tissue samples were homogenized using a di  <dig> basic ultraturrax homogenizer . five gram of homogenate was mixed with  <dig> ml  <dig> mm hcl by shaking for  <dig>  h. the homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected in a tube containing  <dig> μl of  <dig> m naoh and mixed for  <dig> min.  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m kh2po <dig> were then added and the mixture was stored at 4°c overnight. the next day the mixture was centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> min, and the supernatant was purified by rp- <dig> cartridges . clenbuterol was eluted with methanol from the purified supernatant as described elsewhere  <cit> . the eluent was collected by vacuum and the solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream. dried residue was redissolved in  <dig> μl of water, and  <dig> μl per well were analyzed by ci-elisa and per slide by protein microarray analysis. the concentrations of the recovered cl were calculated against a standard curve made with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml cl solutions for both methods. the total cl recovered were converted to and reported as per gram of tissue.

RESULTS
protein microarray and competitive indirect elisa  were carried out in parallel to compare their sensitivities for the detection of the haptens. figure  <dig> shows the schematics of the two assays. the sensitivity was determined by measuring the ic <dig> of the haptens in competitively inhibiting the binding of the antisera to the immobilized artificial antigens. a dose-response curve was produced for each assay for the two haptens tested and was used to calculate the ic <dig> by non-linear regression analysis . the classic sigmoidal fashion demonstrated the specificity of the antisera to the immobilized ligands. the ic <dig> of the haptens measured by ci-elisa were  <dig>  ng/ml for cl and  <dig>  ng/ml for sm <dig> with a standard error of logic <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. on the other hand, the ic <dig> of the haptens measured by the protein microarray immunodetection were  <dig>  ng/ml for cl and  <dig>  ng/ml for sm <dig> with a standard error of logic <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the scans of the microarray slides were shown in figure 2c and 2d. the protein microarrays showed  <dig>  and  <dig>  times lower ic <dig> than the ci-elisa detection for cl and sm <dig> respectively, suggesting that the protein microarray method has better sensitivity than the ci-elisa detection method.

we next examined if the protein microarray assay would perform equally well with complex biological material. chicken muscles fortified with known concentrations of cl were homogenized, and the eluted cl from each sample was being tested by the protein microarray and ci-elisa. as shown in table  <dig>  both assays could recover effectively from the  <dig> ng/g cl-fortified tissues. however, when the fortifying cl concentration was reduced to  <dig> and  <dig>  ng/g, the protein microarray could recover significantly more than ci-elisa . when we examined the recovery from cl-fed chicken muscle tissues, the protein microarray assay again showed higher sensitivity than ci-elisa for samples with lower cl concentrations, i.e., longer withdrawal periods  .

each experiment was repeated  <dig> times. *p <  <dig>  by unpaired t-test.

the use of dna microarrays  <cit>  and immunobiosensor technology  <cit>  in residue detection has become increasingly popular in recent years. however, the use of protein microarray technology for detecting toxic drug residue in food is relatively new. our study established the use of protein microarray immunodetection of drug residues as a better method than a traditional method such as ci-elisa. in our experiments, ci-elisa underestimated the presence of cl in tissues when the concentration was below the ng/g range. the protein microarray displayed much more consistent recovery and higher sensitivity. the fluorescence nature of the readout method of the protein microarray is certainly more sensitive than the colorimetric measurement in ci-elisa. moreover, the measurement by protein microarray is more accurate and reliable, as each sample can be assayed in much higher number of repeats . the protein microarray method also consumed far less samples than ci-elisa. thus, the protein microarrays have the added advantages of requiring fewer reagents, a faster analysis and the potential to be a multi-analyte platform.

CONCLUSIONS
our study has shown that protein microarray technology is a more sensitive, reliable and efficient method for small molecule detection than traditional elisa.
