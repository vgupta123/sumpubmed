BACKGROUND
there exists enormous variation in the size of sperm across the animal kingdom, ranging from  <dig>  mm in the wasp meteorus sp.   <cit>  to 58 mm in drosophila bifurca  <cit> . sperm size and quality are key factors for fertilization success . yet, the adaptive significance of variation in sperm size remains poorly understood  <cit> . sperm size is expected to be selected both by sperm competition and the fertilization environment  <cit> , e.g., the female reproductive tract in the case of internally fertilizing species. in taxa with sperm storage organs, sperm length may determine the ability to reach the storage organs first and to move to the ovum from the storage organs once ovulation takes place  <cit> .

theory predicts that sperm size can increase with sperm competition risk when longer sperm achieve a higher fertilization success than shorter sperm  <cit> . however, empirical results for internal fertilizers are conflicting. positive relationships between sperm length and sperm competition risk have been found across nematodes  <cit> , butterflies  <cit> , moths  <cit> , and frogs  <cit> , but not in scathophagidae   <cit> , while the results from studies of birds vary among taxa  <cit> . in mammals, larger species exhibit stronger selection on sperm number than on sperm length compared to smaller species  <cit> . as in most taxa, our understanding of how sperm competition influences sperm size and structure is hampered by lack of understanding of sperm function  <cit> .

stylommatophoran gastropods  show a huge variation in sperm length and structure, which is frequently used as a taxonomic character . sperm are monomorphic in all species so far examined, except in the slug arion ater, which produces eupyrene and apyrene sperm  <cit> . the adaptive significance of the interspecific variation in gastropod sperm length, however, has not been examined.

all stylommatophoran gastropods are simultaneous hermaphrodites and numerous species reproduce predominantly by cross-fertilization . available evidence indicates that these gastropods copulated with different mating partners , resulting in multiple paternity in egg batches  <cit> , with 2– <dig> contributing fathers  <cit> . self-fertilization is also widespread, while other species have a mixed breeding system . within species, however, geographic and age-dependent variation in frequency of self-fertilization might occur  <cit> . thus, some species reproduce predominantly by self-fertilization .

cross-fertilizing species store the sperm received in the spermatheca, which has a complex structure with several tubules and functions in the context of sperm competition . sperm from different mating partners can be stored for months or even years before being used to fertilize eggs  <cit> . during copulation, sperm masses or spermatophores containing spermatozoa are reciprocally transferred into the vagina of the partner  <cit> . the spermatophore is transported in the reproductive tract of the recipient towards the bursa copulatrix, where it is eventually digested. during a relatively short period sperm leave the spermatophore and travel up the spermoviduct to reach the spermatheca, where they are stored until fertilization  <cit> . the vast majority of sperm , however, is transferred into the bursa copulatrix. sperm stored with their heads in tight contact with the epithelial walls of the spermatheca survive best  <cit> . rogers and chase  <cit>  suggested that the unified beating of the flagella of sperm stored from the first mate could provide paternity assurance through increased resistance to incoming sperm from subsequent mates, with longer and more numerous sperm resulting in a stronger resistive force  <cit> . thus, sperm of cross-fertilizing species with multiple mating and sperm storage are exposed to intense sperm competition. in contrast, self-fertilizing individuals do not store any sperm from mating partners. instead, they use for fertilization their own sperm passing the ova in the fertilization pouch  <cit> . sperm competition is absent in species reproducing exclusively by self-fertilization and strongly reduced in species reproducing predominantly by self-fertilization. we therefore hypothesize that stylommatophoran species with predominant cross-fertilization have longer sperm than species that reproduce exclusively or frequently by self-fertilization.

sperm size, however, can also be influenced by the fertilization environment  <cit> . there is a huge variability in the complexity of the sperm-storage organ in stylommatophoran gastropods ranging from a simple spermatheca consisting of one tubule to highly structured spermatheca with multiple tubules, while other species do not possess a sperm-storage organ  <cit> . a comparative study showed that carrefour length  in  <dig> gastropod species possessing a spermatheca was positively correlated with sperm length  <cit> . this suggests that sperm length in gastropods may not only be influenced by sperm competition but also by the morphology of the female reproductive tract.

in this study, we used original data on total sperm length from  <dig> terrestrial gastropod species occurring in europe and south america and literature data on their breeding system to test the hypothesis that stylommatophoran species with cross-fertilization have longer sperm than species with self-fertilization. we used 28s rrna nuclear and coi mitochondrial sequence data to construct a molecular phylogeny. some of the among-species variation in sperm length may be explained by allometry  <cit> . we therefore examined the effect of shell size across land snail species, taking into account phylogenetic inertia. furthermore, large interspecific differences in morphology, anatomy, physiology, behaviour, egg morphology and the fertilization environment may confound results of among-species comparisons  <cit> . we used phylogenetical generalized linear models to explore how the breeding system, age at sexual maturity, lifespan, mode of reproduction  and habitat preference might explain sperm length in  <dig> stylommatophoran species.

phylogenetic tree and mode of evolution
the maximum-likelihood  reconstruction for the combined data  was conducted with the best-fit model of substitution using jmodeltest. the best fit model was tvm + i + g  =  <dig> ; r =  <dig> ; r =  <dig> ; r =  <dig> ; r =  <dig> ; r = 1; proportion of invariable sites =  <dig> ; gamma distribution shape parameter =  <dig> ). the ml analysis resulted in a relatively well-resolved topology  and the bayesian inference analysis  produced very similar topologies.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood tree of the concatenated sequences . the tree was obtained using phyml v <dig>   <cit> . sequences of  <dig> terrestrial gastropod species  were considered. values of bootstrap support higher than 50 % are shown for maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference . families and the breeding system are indicated 



the phylogenetic relationships of the different families were not well resolved . however, most families were monophyletic. in those families, which appear not to be monophyletic, the bootstrap support was limited.

the occurrence of predominant self-fertilization and/or a mixed reproductive system was found in several distantly related families . the analysis of the ancestral state reconstruction using bayestraits revealed that self-fertilization is the ancestral state . this suggests a very old and common origin  and implies that at least five origins of mixed mating systems, two origins of self-fertilization and one loss of self-fertilization  are needed to explain the current status of the species analysed.

for the variables shell type, breeding system, mode of reproduction, age at sexual maturity, lifespan and habitat specificity, pagel’s λ ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when all gastropod species were considered , indicating some phylogenetic dependence of the traits. considering only snails, λ ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . in all cases, λ was significantly different from both  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting an evolution model that is different from brownian motion.

effects of breeding system and life-history traits
considering phylogenetic information of the gastropod species examined, the best-fit model  revealed that sperm length was affected by both the breeding system and the age at sexual maturity . delta aicc values and akaike weights did not support any alternative model . the most likely model  showed that gastropod species with predominant cross-fertilization had longer sperm than species with a mixed breeding system and species with predominant self-fertilization . phylogenetic uncertainty had only a minor effect on this pattern . the most likely model also showed that species whose individuals need more than one year to attain sexual maturity had significantly longer sperm than other gastropod species whose individuals reach sexual maturity earlier . phylogenetic uncertainty had only a small effect on this pattern .table  <dig> best fit phylogenetic generalized linear models  explaining sperm length in gastropods

considering exclusively phylogenetic information of the snail species examined, several models showed that maximum shell dimension had a strong impact on sperm length . the most likely model  revealed that sperm length of snails was affected by maximum shell dimension and age at sexual maturity . this model suggests that total sperm length increases with increasing shell size and that the relationship is only weakly influenced by phylogenetic uncertainty . other, still very likely models  included also effects of the breeding system, habitat specificity and reproductive mode .table  <dig> best fit phylogenetic generalized linear models  explaining sperm length in snails

discussion
our study showed that sperm length in the gastropod species examined was influenced by the breeding system and age at sexual maturity in all models. species with cross-fertilization had longer sperm than species with self-fertilization or a mixed breeding system. in the models that considered exclusively snail species, sperm length was also affected by shell size. we used exclusively original data on sperm length measured by the same person in the same way, which excludes unexplained variation owing to different measurement techniques applied in different studies. we also present data on sperm length in tiny snails with a shell height of  <dig> – <dig>  mm . surprisingly, these snails have in relation to their shell size relatively long sperm .

female reproductive tract
in species with internal fertilization and multiple mating, sperm size is expected to be selected both by the female reproductive tract  and by sperm competition  <cit> . in a study comparing  <dig> terrestrial gastropod species, sperm length was found to be positively correlated with the total length of the spermatheca and fertilization pouch after controlling for differences in shell size  <cit> . this finding supports the suggestion that the divergence in sperm length results from sperm size evolving in response to changing female reproductive tract  <cit> . indeed, experimental evolution studies showed that changing female spermatheca length can drive the divergence in sperm length in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> .

in helicid land snails, the sperm received are stored in an ordered manner in the spermatheca, usually at the bulbous blind ends of the tubules and with their heads in tight contact with the spermathecal epithelium  <cit> . it has been suggested that the beating of the flagella of sperm from the first mate could provide paternity assurance through increased resistance to incoming sperm from subsequent mates  <cit> , with longer sperm and a larger number of sperm resulting in a stronger resistive force  <cit> . thus, longer sperm competing with sperm from other mates may have a fertilization advantage by occupying and/or retaining occupancy in the storage organ better than shorter sperm. in contrast, autosperm used for self-fertilization are obtained from the spermoviduct and/or hermaphrodite duct  <cit> , and thus are not stored in a spermatheca in competition with sperm from other mates. it is important to note that most species with predominantly self-fertilization do not possess a spermatheca  <cit> .

the physical characteristics of female sperm-storage organs may impose stabilizing selection on sperm length  <cit> . in gastropods with spermatheca and cross-fertilization, the potential of blocking the storage organ for sperm from future mates may in turn favour divergence in spermatheca length  <cit> . longer storage organs could allow the female function to take up sperm from more mating partners and thereby to benefit from a greater control over the fertilization process  <cit> . this could result in a coevolution leading to the association between sperm length and the length of the female sperm-storage organ found across snail species  <cit> , as well as across other animal taxa including moths  <cit> , flies  <cit> , beetles  <cit> , birds  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> .

in this context the intraspecific variation of sperm length is of interest. in stylommatophoran gastropods, data on intraspecific variation of sperm length are available for only a single species  <cit> . in  <dig> populations of arianta arbustorum sampled across the distributional range of the species, a difference of 11 % in total sperm length between the lowest and highest population means was found  <cit> . differences among a. arbustorum populations explained  <dig>  % of the variance in total sperm length, differences among individual snails within population  <dig>  % and differences within individual snail  <dig>  %. furthermore, individuals of a. arbustorum showed consistent sperm length in successive matings, and mean sperm length was not correlated with the number of sperm delivered in a spermatophore  <cit> . a breeding experiment with offspring of a. arbustorum raised at three different temperatures revealed both environmental and genetic effects on sperm length  <cit> . the relatively small intraspecific variation in this species can be contrasted with the huge interspecific variation in sperm length found in our study with sperm of plagiodontes patagonicus being  <dig> times longer than those of oxychilus navarricus helveticus .

sperm competition
success in sperm competition is predicted to be influenced by variation in sperm and ejaculate quality and by interactions among competing sperm  <cit> . sperm of cross-fertilizing terrestrial gastropod species are exposed to intense sperm competition due to multiple mating with different partners and long-term sperm storage  <cit> . yet, apart from sperm number, relevant sperm characteristics are poorly understood in terrestrial gastropods.

in general, sperm size may influence the outcome of sperm competition through multiple mechanisms . in stylommatophoran gastropods, sperm size may influence:  the number of sperm delivered during a copulation because of a potential trade-off between sperm length and number;  sperm longevity and/or swimming speed; and  the defence ability of sperm stored in the spermatheca of the recipient against sperm from future mates . available evidence suggests that there is no trade-off between sperm length and the number of sperm delivered in a spermatophore. in none of the four arianta arbustorum populations examined was a correlation between mean sperm length and the number of sperm delivered found after having removed the effect of shell size  <cit> . sperm competition may select for longer sperm if sperm size is positively linked to sperm competitiveness through increased velocity, motility, longevity, and/or a better ability to defend their position in spermatheca  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster, relatively long and slow sperm are at an advantage in entering or remaining in the “fertilization set” of the female during the sperm storage and displacement phase of sperm competition, thereby gaining a chance of being used for fertilization later  <cit> .

sperm length in the snail a. arbustorum was neither correlated with mean velocity nor with percentage motility or longevity, all measured in vitro  <cit> . however, mean sperm velocity differed among individual snails . furthermore, the percentage motility and longevity of sperm differed between snails from the two populations, but were not affected by shell size  <cit> . after spermatophore transfer, longer sperm might have a higher probability of leaving the spermatophore and escaping the peristaltic waves of the duct transporting them to the sperm-digesting organ  <cit> . in helix pomatia and cornu aspersum, only about  <dig>  % of the transferred sperm are stored in the spermathecal tubules of the storage organ  <cit> . however, experiments are needed to test whether longer sperm have an advantage in this process.

with the unified beating of their flagella sperm stored in the spermatheca of the recipient may generate resistance to incoming sperm from subsequent mates entering the tubules and thus provide paternity assurance  <cit> , with longer and more numerous sperm resulting in a stronger resistive force  <cit> . this hypothesis might also explain why sperm of stylommatophoran species with a complex sperm-storage organ are longer than those of other gastropods with simple or no sperm storage organ, most of them being frequently or predominantly self-fertilizing species. several comparative studies considering a diverse array of taxa examined the evolutionary relationship between sperm length and some estimates of risk or intensity of sperm competition . for example, in rhabditid nematodes, males of gonochoristic species had significantly larger sperm than males of the hermaphrodite species  <cit> . in nematodes, males of gonochoristic species are normally exposed to a high risk of sperm competition, whereas hermaphroditic species mainly reproduce by self-fertilization resulting in a low sperm competition risk. the main conclusion to be drawn from the various correlational studies is that sperm competition is important in the evolutionary diversification of sperm size in some but not in all animal groups.

allometric effects
some of the among-species variation in sperm size may be explained by allometry: the way characters scale with shell or body size. we found a positive relationship between sperm length and shell size after having taken phylogenetic relationships into account. this finding supports the results of an earlier study on land snails with a much smaller sample size  and extends our knowledge of the positive sperm length–body size relationships in other invertebrates . two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested for the sperm length–body size relationships observed across some invertebrate groups  <cit> . first, increases in body size and sperm size may be independently favoured by sexual selection. second, because of the energetic demands of producing relatively long sperm, sperm size and body size may coevolve. interspecific studies with drosophila have demonstrated substantial energetic costs and life history trade-offs associated with the production of relatively long sperm  <cit> , while intraspecific analyses with d. hydei showed how larger body size mitigates those costs for males  <cit> . similar studies are not available for terrestrial gastropods.

advantage of self-fertilization
simultaneous hermaphroditism is advantageous when mates are hard to find. in such situations each sexually mature conspecific encountered is a potential mating partner. simultaneous hermaphroditism also offers opportunities for self-fertilization. evolutionary theory predicts the conditions under which simultaneous hermaphrodites should reproduce by self-fertilization  <cit> . depending on the relative balance of the costs and benefits, populations are assumed to evolve towards complete cross-fertilization or complete selfing  <cit> . nevertheless, mixed mating strategies are also frequently observed in a variety of taxa in nature  <cit> .

self-fertilization provides advantages including assurance of reproduction in the absence of mating partners, preservation of highly fit genotypes, and reduced energy allocation to both sperm production and mating behaviour  <cit> . on the other hand, self-fertilization results in low heterozygosity, which in turn reduces the chances to adapt to changing environmental conditions and thus enhances the risk of local extinction  <cit> .

in stylommatophoran gastropods, the frequency of self-fertilization varies greatly among species and – to a smaller extent – even among populations within species  <cit> . in some species, it is rare, in others it occurs occasionally, and still in others self-fertilization occurs regularly  <cit> . low frequencies of self-fertilization also occur in species so far considered as obligate cross-fertilizers. for example, in a natural population of a. arbustorum, a low frequency of self-fertilization was found in two out of  <dig> mother-progeny arrays: two mother snails produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of their offspring by self-fertilization, while the remaining  <dig> mother snails reproduced exclusively by cross-fertilization  <cit> . however, laboratory breedings showed strong effects of inbreeding depression in this species; selfing individuals had a reproductive success of 1–2 % compared with that of cross-fertilizing individuals  <cit> . strong inbreeding depression was also observed in triodopsis albolabris  <cit> , another snail species that predominantly reproduces by cross-fertilization. in contrast, inbreeding depression appears to be absent in the slug deroceras agreste, a species with frequent self-fertilization  <cit> . self-fertilizing individuals were two to four times more fecund, had a longer lifespan and the growth rate of their offspring was higher than that of cross-fertilizing individuals. similarly, inbreeding depression was very low in self-fertilizing balea perversa  <cit> .

within-species variation in breeding system could influence the results of our analyses. to minimize errors due to misclassified species, we used three categories of breeding systems: predominantly cross-fertilizing species, predominantly self-fertilizing species and species with a mixed breeding system. to the latter category we assigned all species in which the available information was ambiguous, i.e., some authors reported cross-fertilization but records on selfing were also found in the same species. our analyses showed that the main differences in sperm length were between cross-fertilizing species with longer sperm and both self-fertilizing species and species with a mixed breeding system, which produced shorter sperm. available information indicates that species with a mixed breeding system fertilize 70–80 % of their eggs by self-fertilization, suggesting less intense sperm competition than in cross-fertilizing species. this could be an explanation for the small difference in sperm length between species with predominant self-fertilization and species with a mixed breeding system.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we found evidence that sperm length in stylommatophoran gastropods is influenced by the risk of sperm competition experienced in different breeding systems, as well as by age at sexual maturity and shell size. however, female morphology  may also influence divergence in sperm length. our findings extend present knowledge of sperm evolution in a rarely studied group of simultaneous hermaphrodites and highlight the complexity of postcopulatory processes in this group.
