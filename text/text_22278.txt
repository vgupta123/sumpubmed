BACKGROUND
aquaporins constitute a superfamily of major intrinsic proteins  that facilitate passive, yet remarkably efficient permeation of water molecules across cellular membranes  <cit> . some aquaporins can also permeate non-ionic compounds, such as glycerol and urea, and are termed glycerol facilitators  or aquaglyceroporins. the first water channel was isolated from human red blood cell membranes as a novel integral membrane protein of  <dig> kda . this channel is now termed aquaporin- <dig>   <cit> . subsequently, thirteen aquaporin paralogs  have been identified in mammals  <cit> , and up to  <dig> mip-related sequences, divided into four types, plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , tonoplast intrinsic proteins , small and basic intrinsic proteins  and nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins , have been documented in plants  <cit> . each form is composed of a single polypeptide chain varying in length from ~270- <dig> amino acids that spans the lipid bilayer six times with three extracellular loops  and two intracellular loops , which have their n- and c-termini located intracellularly. the loops b and e fold and extend intramembranous hemi-helices that bear the highly conserved amino acid motifs asn-pro-ala , which are involved in the formation of the water pore. when translocated to the cell membrane, most aquaporins form homotetramers  <cit> , in which one or two monomers may be glycosylated, but each monomer functions as an independent water channel  <cit> .

the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis is essential for the survival of any living organism. aquatic animals also face the problem of direct interaction with their aqueous environment. depending upon the life history of the species, the osmolarity of the saline or freshwater medium differs manifold from their internal body fluids, and therefore an important physiological role of aquaporins would be expected. accordingly, some studies in teleosts have reported differential mrna and protein expression of specific aquaporin isoforms in osmoregulatory organs in response to changes in environmental salinity  <cit> . moreover, recent studies of neofunctionalized vitellogenins and the essential role of an aqp1-related channel have revealed the evolutionary importance of oocyte hydration in marine teleosts as a pre-adaptation to spawning in the hyper-osmotic oceanic environment  <cit> . to date, however, the genomic repertoire of aquaporin isoforms present in teleosts, as well as the permeability properties of the encoded proteins, remains largely unknown.

during the last decades, the zebrafish  has become a powerful model organism in comparative genomics and developmental biology. this species is amenable for genetic analysis in which large-scale mutagenesis screens have been successfully performed, and a large amount of genomic and expressed sequence tags  data, bac libraries and fine genetic linkage maps have been accumulated  <cit> . work with zebrafish has also extended its application to a wide variety of experimental studies relevant to human disease, such as cardiovascular disorders, angiogenesis and neurological and renal diseases  <cit> . aquaporins have been shown to play important roles in some of these alterations  <cit> , and therefore the diversity and functional properties of zebrafish aquaporins need to be determined prior to using this species as a suitable experimental model in biomedical research and comparative physiology.

with the sequence of the zebrafish genome completed, the complexity of the teleost aquaporin gene family can be assessed. in the present study, we screened the zebrafish genome for aquaporin-related sequences and determined their phylogenetic relationships, permeability properties, and the pattern of mrna expression in adult tissues. we found a high number of functional aquaporins in this species, and based upon the data obtained we propose a new classification of the piscine aquaporin superfamily.

RESULTS
the zebrafish aquaporin gene family
the screening of the zebrafish genome revealed the presence of  <dig> putative members of the aquaporin superfamily, most of them existing as duplicate or triplicate genes, ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb that encode proteins between 255- <dig> amino acids long . we successfully cloned and characterized  <dig> of these transcripts. the nomenclature of these genes was chosen based on their phylogenetic position and chromosomal locus, their identity to human orthologs, as well as on their structural and functional features , in accordance with the recommended guidelines for human genome nomenclature  <cit>  and the zebrafish information network  <cit> . thus, zebrafish aquaporin- <dig>  - <dig>  -11b and - <dig>  are present as single copy genes, whereas aquaporin- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes  are duplicates. for the draqp <dig> gene, three copies were found . unlike the other aquaporin isoforms, we found that aqp <dig> has both tandem and genomic duplicates encoded within the genomes of zebrafish and stickleback  .

the deduced amino acid sequences of zebrafish aquaporins contain six predicted transmembrane helices and two npa boxes that are the hallmark of the mip superfamily  <cit> . the only exception was draqp8b in which only five transmembrane domains could be determined in silico, despite the equality in sequence length. analysis of the primary structures of the zebrafish aquaporins indicated that they could be classified into two paralogous subgroups and two more divergent subgroups . the first subgroup includes draqp0a, -0b, -1a, -1b and - <dig>  which share 35-85% amino acid identity  and clustered with the escherichia coli aquaporin-z , thus suggesting that these aquaporins belong to the water-specific aquaporin subfamily  <cit> . the identity of the duplicated isoforms present in this group varied, since draqp0a and -0b were 85% identical, whereas draqp1a and -1b share only 61% identity . the second group includes draqp3a, -3b, - <dig>  -9a, -9b, -10a and -10b, which were 40-73% identical and clustered together with the e. coli glycerol facilitator , suggesting that they belong to the aquaglyceroporin  subfamily. in this group, the identity between draqp3a and -3b, draqp9a and -9b, and draqp10a and -10b, was  <dig>   <dig> and 45%, respectively. the percent identity between the aquaporin and glp groups was as low as 19-28%. the most divergent paralogs were those including the aqp8-like , and draqp11b and - <dig> sequences, which share 23-28% and 13-25% identity, and 20-14% and 4-22% identity with aquaporins and glps, respectively. draqp8aa, -8ab and -8b share 43-60% identity between them, and draqp11b and - <dig> were 27% identical. these observations indicate that zebrafish harbours the largest complement of aquaporin genes of any vertebrate studied to date, which can be classified into four tetrapod-like subfamilies  <cit> : classical water-selective aquaporins , a water and urea transporter , classical glps , and two unorthodox aquaporins .

genomic organization
the division of the zebrafish aquaporin superfamily into four subfamilies inferred from comparison of the deduced protein sequences is mirrored in the intron-exon structures . most classical aquaporins include four exons, draqp <dig> being an exception with five exons, whereas the glp genes are characterized by six exons, with the exception of draqp3b, which is encoded by five exons. the draqp8aa, draqp8ab and draqp8b transcripts are invariably coded by five exons, whereas the unorthodox draqp <dig> showed four exons as the aquaporin subfamily. in draqp11b, three exons were observed although in this case the intron-exon boundaries were not well defined and therefore the number of exons could not be determined with certainty. in the majority of zebrafish aquaporin genes the intron lengths were < <dig> kb, although the last intron of draqp <dig> was of  <dig>  kb, whereas the second intron of draqp9b and draqp8aa, and the first intron of draqp <dig>  were of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in length. in the case of draqp9a, the quality of the genomic sequences available did not allow assessment of intron length.

examination of the zebrafish aquaporin gene structures in relation to orthologs in other metazoan organisms revealed a generally well-conserved exon-intron organization . classical aquaporins  are encoded by  <dig> exons, with xenopus tropicalis aqp <dig> as an apparent exception with  <dig> exons. metazoan aqp <dig> is encoded by  <dig> exons, although drosophila melanogaster aqp <dig> shows some variability. aqp <dig> is a polymorphic gene encoded by  <dig> exons in tetrapods,  <dig> exons in teleosts, 2- <dig> exons in diptera and 6- <dig> exons in nematoda. classical glps are highly conserved with 5- <dig> exons in metazoa, while the vertebrate-specific unorthodox aqp <dig> has  <dig> exons, but the more ancestral unorthodox aqp <dig> retains 3- <dig> exons in vertebrates, but 4- <dig> exons in invertebrates.

in silico genomic screening using ensembl v <dig>  <cit>  also revealed the presence of an 18th gene in zebrafish  with an anomalous structure showing  <dig> exons . the inferred exon structure of this gene is different to that of other metazoan aquaporins and the gene appears to be a hybrid with exons 1- <dig> more related to aqp <dig> and - <dig>  but exons 4- <dig> showing higher nucleotide sequence identity to aqp <dig> and - <dig> . using blast we noted that it was related to tetrapod aqp <dig>  to validate the existence of this gene, we isolated genomic dna based upon the predicted ensembl sequence. using pcr and subsequent sequencing, we found that exons 1- <dig> are 100% identical to the predicted sequence, and the gene was therefore named draqp5/ <dig> in accordance with its hybrid status. maximum likelihood analysis of the codons of draqp5/ <dig> confirmed that exons 1- <dig> encode a putative protein that is structurally related to tetrapod aqp <dig> and - <dig>  while exons 4- <dig> encode a putative protein that is more related to aqp <dig> . bayesian analysis of the codons placed exon 1- <dig> basal to aqp <dig>  but the protein product as a polytomy between aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> . it therefore appears that despite retaining a large aquaporin repertoire of which ~40% are duplicate isoforms specific to the teleost crown-clade, the zebrafish lacks functional orthologs of tetrapod aqp <dig>  - <dig> or - <dig> genes.

phylogenetic analysis of zebrafish aquaporins
to validate the orthology of the zebrafish aquaporins, we investigated the molecular phylogeny of  <dig> piscine nucleotide and amino acid sequences in relation to  <dig> human orthologs . these analyses corroborated the structural homologies outlined above and consistently demonstrated a dual- or in the case of aqp <dig> a tri-paralogous clustering of piscine isoforms as sister branches to human orthologs. two mutually exclusive clades are observed within the superfamily, a vertebrate aquaporin clade containing nine subfamilies  stemming from ecaqpz , and a glp clade containing four vertebrate subfamilies  that stem from ecglpf . the elasmobranch aquaporins are represented by single-copy variants, of which all but aqp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were found. each clustered basal to teleostei or together with the human transcripts indicating that the encoded proteins have differentially evolved functions specific to the actinopterygian or sarcopterygian lineages, respectively. the internal distribution of teleost isoforms within each subfamily was consistent with a whole genome duplication  event at the root of the crown-clade  <cit> . the topology within each teleost subcluster was fully congruent with phylogenetic rank and encompasses members of the elopomorpha , ostariophysi , protacanthopterygii  and acanthomorpha . we therefore annotated each of the teleost paralogs with the postscript "a" or "b" to reflect the genomic duplicate.

by including genomic variants together with transcripts available from genbank  <cit> , and by investigating the syntenic relationships of each ortholog , we were able to validate whether a duplicated gene arose through wgd or resulted from intrachromosomal duplication. despite the observation that draqp1a and -1b, draqp0a and -0b, and draqp <dig> and -3b are linked , we only find strong evidence of one tandem duplicate within the crown-clade: aqp8aa  and aqp8ab  in zebrafish, and aqp8aa  and aqp8ab  in stickleback. one lineage-specific tandem duplicate of aqp10a  was also noted in green-spotted pufferfish . both aqp8aa, -8ab and aqp10aa, -10ab genes are immediately juxtaposed in the genomes of zebrafish  and green-spotted pufferfish , while the wgd products aqp8b and aqp10b are each located on separate chromosomes, lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively. unfortunately, it was not possible to characterize the complete aqp <dig> loci in other teleosts due to the current location of stickleback aqp8ab on scaffold  <dig>  and the absence of aqp8aa, -8ab in green-sptotted pufferfish, and aqp8aa and -8b in medaka . for medaka, only the aqp8ab gene was found on lg <dig>  however, by comparing our data with the earlier study of kasahara and colleagues  <cit> , we were able to trace the ancestral chromosome that gave rise to aqp <dig> genes in humans and teleosts. despite multiple rearrangement, fusion and fission events, the major portions of all descendent lgs that harbour vertebrate aqp <dig> genes can be traced to protochromsome e. for humans this entails lg <dig>  while for teleostei, the descendent chromosomes are lg <dig>  and lg <dig>  for green-spotted pufferfish, lg <dig>  and lg <dig> or lg <dig>  for medaka. the chromosomal loci of aqp <dig> genes in stickleback and zebrafish further support this ancient origin. moreover, the early divergence of teleost aqp8aa, -8ab and -8b is clearly evident in the trichotomous clustering of these transcripts among diverse taxa , and further confirmed through functional and expression analyses in zebrafish .

similar ancestral reconstructions can be made for the other linked aquaporins, wherein aqp <dig> genes descend from protochromosome m, aqp <dig> originated on prototochromosome l, and aqp <dig> and - <dig> derive from protochromosomes l and i, respectively. in this latter instance, aqp <dig> and - <dig> have remained linked in all vertebrata, except the opossum , and thus likely became colocalized prior to the separation of sarcopterygii from actinopterygii. the evidence supporting this latter proposal lies in the observation that zebrafish has maintained the linkage between aqp3b and - <dig> on lg <dig>  while aqp3a is located on lg <dig>  zebrafish lg <dig> is the orthologon of stickleback lgxiii and medaka lg <dig>  both of which harbour the aqp3a orthologs. hence the single aqp <dig> gene found in teleost genomes is the surviving aqp7b product of wgd. the close linkage of teleost aqp1a and -1b genes, suggests that they could have arisen through tandem duplication. however, the fact that all teleost genomes, except medaka, retain both isoforms, and that each shows dichotomous clustering in the phylogenetic trees , their origin must be close to, or coincident with the wgd event at the root of the crown-clade. hence, although we cannot exclude a tandem duplication scenario suggested earlier  <cit> , a parsimonious explanation for the appearance or aqp1a and -1b would seem to be wgd with subsequent colocalization, rather than local duplication and loss of wgd paralogs. the divergence of these isoforms is clearly evident in the phylogenetic trees, where aqp1b transcripts display significantly longer branch lengths compared to the aqp1a paralogs. this latter feature is consistent with our earlier findings wherein aqp1b is a rapidly evolving channel protein with novel functions specifically associated with oocyte hydration  <cit>  and osmoregulatory processes  <cit> .

in a separate analysis of metazoan aquaporins  we confirmed that aqp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> have remained single-copy genes in non-human vertebrates while the present data show that aqp <dig> duplicated at the root of the teleost crown-clade. with the exception of torafugu , which retains both aqp11a and -11b, teleostei, including zebrafish, appear to have differentially retained alternate isoforms. this is clearly shown in the phylogenetic tree , with closely related protacanthopterygii and acanthomorpha harbouring opposite isoforms. based upon the more ancestral ostariophysan position of zebrafish and the fathead minnow , we arbitrarily assigned the zebrafish cluster as the "b" variant.

although zebrafish retains two isoforms of aqp <dig>  these genes proved the most difficult class of glp to resolve . here we show the codon topology, which also includes variants obtained from est databases. by specifically increasing the taxon sampling of these glps, we were able to resolve a branch topology that matched the chromosomal loci of the teleost genes. as a result, the genomic duplicates are annotated as "a" or "b" accordingly. however, the protein trees did not always corroborate the codon topology and therefore these glps will require further validation with the advent of new sequence data. the placement of draqp5/ <dig> as an outgroup between aqp <dig> and - <dig> was consistent with its hybrid status, while the aqp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes are specific to the sarcopterygian lineage.

molecular features of zebrafish aquaporins and functional implications
the characteristic residues in a water channel that distinguish a true water facilitator from a glp have previously been analyzed by comparing sequences of aquaporins with known functions  <cit> . that comparison resulted in the identification of five invariant or nearly invariant residues  in aquaporins and glps on the basis of  <dig> sequences ranging from bacteria to humans . however, structural and functional studies of aqp <dig> and glpf suggest the presence of two constriction sites in the water pore, in addition to the p1-p <dig> residues, that underlie their high selectivity and efficiency with regard to water or glycerol transport  <cit>  .

the first constriction is formed by the opposing npa motifs located at each positive end of α-helices  <dig> and  <dig> , such that the asn creates an electrostatic barrier in this region  <cit> . together with desolvation, these regions are essential for water transport specificity while excluding proton transport  <cit> . accordingly, asn is the least variable in aquaporin sequences whereas pro and ala are more exchangeable  <cit> . the primary structure of zebrafish aquaporins and glps confirm these observations since asn was conserved in both npa boxes of all paralogs, whereas pro is substituted by ala in the first box of draqp <dig> as observed in human and rat aqp <dig> . the third residue of the npa boxes shows more variation as previously found in over  <dig> aquaporin-encoding genes  <cit> . in zebrafish, ala is substituted by pro , ser , val , or thr .

the second significant energy-barrier in aquaporins is located close to the extracellular exit of the channel forming the narrowest region of the pore and is referred to as the aromatic/arginine  constriction  <cit> . this region in water-selective aquaporins is formed by four amino acids  that create the hydrophobic and size filter  <cit> . the site sensitive to mercurial inhibition   <cit>  is less conserved. in contrast, in glpf, and essentially in all other glps, the ar/r region is wider and more hydrophobic due to the lack of his and substitution of the cys by a second aromatic residue, which allows the passage of polyols and urea, and possibly of other small solutes such as nh <dig>  co <dig> or o <dig>  <cit> .

the present data show that zebrafish aquaporins previously inferred to be water-selective or glps after amino acid sequence analysis retain the respective three amino acid consensus in the ar/r constriction, and show the p1-p <dig> residues conserved in each sub-family . however, the cys residue just prior to the second npa box, which is potentially mercury-sensitive, is maintained in draqp1a and -1b. similarly, draqp8aa, -8ab, -8b, -9a, -9b and -10a also show a cys upstream of the second npa motif in loop b but at slightly different positions. despite these minor differences, the structural features of zebrafish aquaporins strongly suggest that they encode functional channels. a slightly different situation is found in draqp8aa, -8ab and -8b, which despite having the conserved p1-p <dig> residues of the aquaporin subfamily, contain his instead of phe <dig>  and val or ile instead of his <dig>  in the ar/r constriction . as for their mammalian counterparts, draqp11b and - <dig> appear to be more divergent since they did not show any of the typical residues in the ar/r constriction and only three aquaporin-conserved amino acids  .

water and solute permeability of zebrafish aquaporins
typically, aquaporin water-channel activity is tested by the oocyte-swelling assay  <cit> , in which xenopus laevis oocytes expressing aquaporins are exposed to hypo-osmotic shock and the subsequent water influx is measured by determining volume changes over time. solute permeability can also be determined volumetrically in isotonic solutions, or by employing radiolabeled compounds  <cit> . therefore, to determine experimentally the substrate specificity of the zebrafish aquaporins, the cloned cdnas were expressed in x. laevis oocytes.

expression of all of the aquaporin isoforms, except draqp11b and - <dig>  induced a three- to twenty-fold increase in oocyte water permeability . interestingly, however, water permeability of oocytes expressing draqp3a and -3b was reduced by acidic ph, as found for mammalian aqp <dig>  <cit>  and european eel  aqp <dig>  <cit> , with maximum permeability occurring at ph  <dig> . swelling  and isotope-labeled solute uptake assays demonstrated that oocytes injected with draqp3a, -3b, - <dig>  -9a, -9b, -10a and -10b were also permeable to glycerol and urea, although in the case of draqp10b urea permeability was low . oocytes expressing draqp8aa or -8ab were permeable to water and urea, but not glycerol. in contrast, oocytes expressing draqp0a, -0b, -1a, -1b and - <dig>  as well as draqp8b, were not permeable to either of these solutes.

water and glycerol transport through most aquaporins was significantly  blocked by  <dig>  mm hgcl <dig> even in the absence of cys <dig> in their deduced amino acid sequences . such inhibition was not always reversed with the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. however, draqp <dig>  and draqp8b were mercury-insensitive, even though draqp8b has a potential mercury-sensitive cys upstream of the second npa box . it thus appears that water and solute flux through zebrafish aquaporins can be blocked by mercurial compounds regardless of the presence or absence of cys <dig>  these observations have also been noted for rat aqp <dig>  <cit>  and plant aquaporins  <cit> . the present findings suggest that sensitivity of zebrafish aquaporins to mercurials is a complex phenomenon, as has been suggested for other aquaporins, and may involve other residues in addition to cys <dig>  <cit> .

expression of draqp11b or - <dig> had no effect on oocyte water , or glycerol  permeability. the absence of water and solute transport in x. laevis oocytes expressing mammalian aqp <dig> and - <dig> has been previously reported  <cit> . for aqp <dig>  this seems to be caused by the absence of protein expression in the oocyte plasma membrane  <cit> , but in the case of aqp <dig> the protein is readily targeted to the plasma membrane  <cit> . the underlying mechanisms involved in the functional failure of aqp <dig> and - <dig> in oocytes are not well known, but may be related to the fact that these aquaporins are localized intracellularly in vivo  <cit> . however, when aqp <dig> was reconstituted into liposomes this protein proved to be a functional water channel  <cit> . although the identity of draqp11b and - <dig> with aqp <dig> and - <dig> is low , a similar situation may be speculated in zebrafish. further studies employing reconstitution of draqp11b and - <dig> into proteoliposomes, as well as specific antibodies to elucidate their subcellular localization, would help to clarify this issue.

expression pattern of zebrafish aquaporins
the relative expression of the zebrafish aquaporin genes in adult tissues was evaluated by rt-pcr employing isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers . these data revealed that while all genes except draqp5/ <dig> were expressed, some aquaporin transcripts were ubiquitiously distributed in the tissues examined or appeared to be tissue-specific. notably, mrnas derived from duplicated paralogs showed slightly different expression patterns, although redundancy in some tissues was also observed.

only two zebrafish aquaporin transcripts  showed tissue-wide expression patterns. the ubiquitous expression of draqp1a transcripts is consistent with the presence of the mammalian aqp <dig> ortholog in endothelial barriers of almost all tissues and in many epithelia  <cit> . its presence in the zebrafish gastrointestinal tract and gills agrees with that reported in other teleosts  <cit> . in contrast, expression of draqp1b was restricted to the ovary, testis and brain, as previously reported  <cit> . the ubiquitous expression of the unorthodox aquaporin draqp <dig>  with lower levels in the eye and muscle, differs markedly from the exclusive expression of mammalian aqp <dig> in the pancreatic acinar cells  <cit>  and the retina  <cit> . the vertebrate-specific unorthodox aquaporin, draqp11b, also showed a different expression pattern compared to that described for mammalian aqp <dig>  in mice, kidney expression of aqp <dig> seems to be essential during development since either its absence or mutations of the amino acid sequence induce renal failure  <cit> . in our pcr experiments, however, we could not observe detectable levels of draqp11b transcripts in the kidney, although they were abundantly expressed in the gut and were also detected in ovary and liver.

in contrast to draqp1a and - <dig>  transcripts of draqp0a and -8b were exclusively detected in tissues of the eye and brain, respectively, and draqp0b was also observed in the ovary. the specific expression of draqp <dig> paralogs in the eye is consistent with that previously described in the common mummichog   <cit> , as well as in mammals where aqp <dig> is predominantly present in fibre cells of the lens  <cit> . expression of draqp8b was noted only in the brain, where draqp8aa and -8ab were not expressed. in contrast, these latter transcripts were abundantly expressed in the gut and kidney, draqp8ab mrna being also present in the ovary, testis, eye, gills and liver. the diffuse expression of draqp8aa and -8ab resembles that found for mammalian aqp <dig>  which is present in the testis, ovary, kidney, liver, pancreas, small intestine and colon  <cit> . the expression of draqp <dig> is similar to that of mammalian aqp <dig>  <cit> , which is distributed in the brain, small intestine and muscle, but also in kidney. in the present study, however, we did not detect draqp <dig> transcripts in the zebrafish kidney.

the distribution of classical glp mrnas in zebrafish was comparable to that described for mammals and some teleosts  <cit> . draqp3a showed the most extensive distribution in all tissues examined except in the liver, showing high abundance in gills as previously found for other teleosts  <cit> . in contrast, draqp3b transcripts were seen only in the testis, gills, muscle and skin. the draqp9a and -9b isoforms, as well as draqp10a and -10b, also showed differential expression in some tissues. the expression of two functional isoforms of draqp <dig> in zebrafish, however, differs from that reported for mouse in which aqp <dig> was suggested to be a pseudogene  <cit> . as in mammals, draqp <dig> is expressed in the gonads and the kidney, while the expression observed in the intestine may reflect an adipocyte function  <cit> .

the rt-pcr studies suggest that redundant expression of duplicated aquaporin isoforms occurs in many tissues of zebrafish. the physiological significance of these findings is intriguing. in other teleosts, such as the gilthead seabream , redundant expression of aqp1a  and -1b  in the ovary and gastrointestinal tract is also observed, but immunological studies have revealed that their protein products are differentially localized  <cit> . thus, in the ovary saaqp1b is oocyte-specific, whereas saaqp1a seems to be only present in the external epithelium surrounding the ovarian follicle. in the gut, saaqp1b is exclusively detected at the apical membrane of rectal enterocytes, whereas saaqp1a is localized at the brush border of enterocytes in the duodenum and hindgut. therefore, the significance of the redundant aquaporin expression in zebrafish must be further investigated by determining the subcellular sites of transcription and protein targeting.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified a large number of mip encoding genes in zebrafish when compared to tetrapods. by integrating the molecular phylogeny and the genomic loci with structural and functional analyses we demonstrate dual- or tri-paralogy between teleost aquaporins and human orthologs. consequently teleost aquaporins can be classified into the same water-selective and glp subfamilies previously described in vertebrates  <cit> . expression in x. laevis oocytes also demonstrated that zebrafish aquaporin genes, except aqp11b and - <dig>  encode functional channels, which in most cases have retained the substrate specificity of the tetrapod counterparts. some mammalian aquaporins are also permeable to nh <dig>  co <dig> or o <dig>  <cit> , but whether any of the zebrafish orthologs are permeable to these compounds remains to be investigated.

the high number of aquaporin genes in zebrafish and other teleosts result from wgd at the root of the crown-clade. most duplicated isoforms are retained, while aqp <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> have remained single-copy genes in non-human vertebrates. the findings further reveal that tandem duplication has occurred within the clade and in a lineage-specific manner, but such intrachromosomal replication events are rare for this superfamily. while most of the duplicated genes seem to be conserved during the diversification of teleosts, some such as aqp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> appear to have been differentially retained among species. the reasons for the evolutionary selection of specific aquaporin isoforms in teleosts, as well as the potential neofunctionalization of others, as shown for aqp1b in the hydrating oocytes of marine teleosts  <cit> , have yet to be determined.

an interesting finding was that zebrafish harbours a hybrid gene with partial structural identity to the tetrapod aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> orthologs. this hybrid sequence is not expressed, and it appears to represent a pseudogene. the physiological significance of this observation remains to be elucidated. the present study, however, provides a validated nomenclature for the piscine aquaporin superfamily and lays the foundation for further functional studies in zebrafish.
