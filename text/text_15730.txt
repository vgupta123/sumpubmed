BACKGROUND
the escherichia coli uropathogenic-specific protein  has been shown to be associated with e. coli strains that provoke pyelonephritis, prostatitis and bacteraemia, and with increased virulence and fitness of pathogenic strains of e. coli <cit> . nucleotide sequence analysis has shown approximately 45% sequence identity of the usp c-terminal region with that of the e. coli bacteriocin colicin e <dig>  which has nuclease activity, while the usp n-terminal region is similar to the type vi protein secretion system component 
 <cit> . it has been proposed that usp acts as a bacteriocin against competing e. coli strains and that it also enhances infectivity in the urinary tract. recently, we demonstrated the genotoxic activity of usp against mammalian cells
 <cit> . to protect the colicin-producing cell from its own toxin, colicin-encoding operons generally harbour one cognate immunity gene
 <cit> . colicins and their immunity proteins have some of the strongest protein-protein affinities, which result in the formation of stable colicin–immunity protein complexes
 <cit> . in contrast, downstream of the usp gene, there are three short open reading frames designated orfu1- <dig> , that are believed to be involved in the protection of the usp-producing cell from its own nuclease activity
 <cit> . the immunity proteins coded by the usp gene operon have a characteristic two-histidine region which appears to enable the inactivation of the usp dnase activity
 <cit> . however, usp-encoding strains that do not have all three orfu immunity protein genes have been described. all three immunity proteins are thus not essential for the protection of the usp producers, although usp is lethal when it is expressed alone in e. coli. it has been postulated that none of the three proteins is exclusively required for usp protein synthesis
 <cit> . as protection of the usp-producing bacterial cell might be provided by a mechanism that is different from that of the colicins, we have investigated the e. coli usp-associated immunity protein imu <dig>  previously designated orfu <dig>  our study indicates that imu <dig> has protective non specific dna-binding abilities that could have possible biotechnological potential.

RESULTS
isolation of immunity protein  <dig>  with ni-nta affinity chromatography provided protein fractions with appropriate purity; . dna binding ability was not affected by the presence or absence of the his-tag, as both precipitated linear dna . the theoretical and actual mass  of the purified imu <dig> differed by  <dig>  da , indicating that imu <dig> is not post-translationally modified. parret and demot
 <cit>  previously described an approximately 45% sequence identity of the c-terminal region of the usp protein with known nuclease colicins, such as colicins e <dig> and e <dig>  although it has been shown that colicin e <dig> and its immunity protein form a high-affinity complex
 <cit> , we were not able to confirm the formation of a high affinity complex between usp and any of the three smaller proteins encoded downstream of the usp gene  which were previously proposed to protect the usp-producing cell against its endonucleolytic activity
 <cit> . nevertheless, our results showed that imu <dig> protects isolated dna from digestion by the nuclease colicin e <dig>  indicating a nonspecific protection mechanism that is distinct from that of the colicin immunity proteins .

induction of the cloned usp gene  was either lethal  or resulted in severely diminished growth . of the three potential immunity proteins, when cloned separately downstream of the usp gene, imu <dig> showed the greatest degree of protection as the number of transformants obtained was repeatedly higher, with larger colonies than for the other two . we therefore focused our further investigation on imu <dig>

imu <dig> dimerisation and usp binding
imu <dig> has fairly high sequence similarity to the colicin e <dig> immunity protein cei, approximately 66% sequence identity as established with the mega program package, which was previously reported to form monomers
 <cit> . we investigated potential dimer formation by imu <dig>  using the cross-linking glutaraldehyde assay, native page electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography . native page as well as hplc experiments clearly showed that, imu <dig> does not form dimers or multimers since a single peak of size between  <dig> and 13 kda was observed regardless of the presence or absence of dna . cross-linking studies of equimolar mixtures of imu <dig> and usp also showed no complex formation .

dna/rna binding
our data thus indicate that the usp-producing cell is protected from the dnase activity of its own usp by a mechanism that is distinct from that of colicin-producing cells. surprisingly, emsa showed that imu <dig> binds linear and circular  dna as well as rna molecules. when imu <dig> reached a critical concentration , it repeatedly precipitated the dna, which resulted in total retardation/precipitation of dna in the electrophoresis . when imu <dig> was subjected to treatment with increasing concentrations of ions , the effects of dna retardation were decreased . incubations at higher temperatures  also reduced the gel shift effects of imu <dig> on dna . the emsa studies with dna or e. coli total rna clearly showed that imu <dig> has dna-binding as well as rna-binding abilities. no such activity was observed with imu <dig> or imu <dig> .

furthermore, thermal denaturation curves  showed a stabilising effect of imu <dig> on the linear double-stranded dna molecule. the melting temperature  of dna alone was 73°c, which increased by 3°c  when an aliquot of  <dig>  μg imu <dig> was added in the emsa studies. the dna melting temperature was further raised by an additional 13°c  when a 1 μg aliquot of imu <dig> was added. this concentration of imu <dig> saturated the dna, and the melting curve revealed a two-phase thermal transition. one transition showed a stabilisation effect , whereas the other transition  was shown to be destabilising , most probably due to partial dna precipitation .

minimal dna length for imu <dig> binding
binding of short dna fragments to imu <dig> occupied all its free dna binding sites, and therefore prevented subsequent binding of imu <dig> to indicator dna . these emsa tests showed that free imu <dig> starts to bind to oligonucleotides longer than  <dig> base pairs, observed as the reappearance of unbound indicator dna . these results indicate that  <dig> base pairs is the minimal dna length required for imu <dig> binding .

emsa tests with short double stranded dna fragments  were also performed however, the results were inconclusive since we repeatedly observed the recurring effect of unbound imu <dig> that re-/dis-appeared every 3- <dig> nucleotides of the oligonucleotide length; however, the underlying basis of this phenomena is unclear.

separation of imu <dig> from dna and subsequent dna integrity analysis
separation of the dna-imu <dig> complex, was examined under different conditions. exposure of the dna–imu <dig> complex to ph values between ph  <dig> and ph  <dig> showed separation at values between ph  <dig> and ph  <dig>  however, at ph values higher than ph  <dig> , dna degradation was also observed. when the dna–imu <dig> complex was heated to 100°c for 5 min in the presence of different nacl concentrations, separation of imu <dig> from dna was observed at  <dig>  m nacl or higher . incubation of imu3-dna complexes with proteinase k resulted in unbound dna due to degradation of imu <dig> 

to determine whether dna exposed to imu <dig> could subsequently be used for molecular biological manipulations, linear plasmid pbr <dig> dna that had been previously complexed with imu <dig> was purified with the qiagen commercial kit. this dna could be re-ligated, transformed into e. coli, and again subjected to restriction enzyme activity. the integrity of precipitated and religated plasmid dna was confirmed on the basis of expression of the ampicillin resistance gene among  <dig> analysed transformants . all procedures were also performed with dna that had not been previously complexed as a control, and no apparent losses in quantity or quality of dna were observed  . further, we found that imu <dig> precipitated dna from highly  diluted solutions, where 1 μl  of linear plasmid dna was diluted in 15 ml. this procedure yielded less dna as the control but could without doubt be optimised with appropriate protocol modification . the colicin dnases and their cognate immunity proteins are known to form high affinity complexes with the dnase domain
 <cit> . in the present study, despite its two preserved histidines, as nuclease inactivation motifs that are present throughout the dnase immunity protein family, imu <dig> showed no coupling with the usp protein, and imu <dig> alone was shown to be sufficient for protection of usp-producing cells. not unexpectedly due to the sequence similarity of imu <dig> with the colicin e <dig> immunity protein, which was shown by dennis et al.
 <cit>  to be monomeric, we demonstrated, on the basis of different experiments that imu <dig> does not undergo dimerisation or multimerisation.

to the best of our knowledge, no known functions have been described yet for the protein products of orfu <dig>  orfu <dig> and orfu <dig> . although all three immunity proteins of the usp cluster share a high degree of sequence similarity, the present study shows that imu <dig> has a distinct rna- and dna-binding ability. nevertheless, additional as of yet unresolved mechanisms could be involved in protection of usp producing cells by its cognate immunity proteins. interestingly, protein-mediated dna precipitation has been reported in studies describing eukaryotic histones and the e. coli global regulator, protein hu, a known dna-binding protein
 <cit> . operons, such as those of colicins, that encode proteins that can be detrimental to the producing cell are regulated precisely to ensure appropriate timing of synthesis and avoid untimely death of the producer
 <cit> . we can thus speculate that synthesis of usp and its associated imu1- <dig> proteins could also be tightly regulated, limiting their production to avoid overt degradation and masking of the producers’ genome. indeed high expression levels of imu <dig>  are toxic for producing cells. dna-binding  proteins usually have an overall positive charge that facilitates their binding to dna. the imu <dig> protein, has a theoretical isoelectric point of ca.  <dig> , which implies that the dna-binding region must be localised only on part of the tertiary structure of the molecule. different online dna-binding motif search tools were used to identify a potential imu <dig> dna binding motif
 <cit> . the results imply that the dna-binding ability of imu <dig> probably originates from the helix-turn-helix motif.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study shows that imu <dig> like the colicin e <dig> immunity protein cei, does not form dimers and in addition, does not form a tight complex with the usp protein. however, in contrast to the two other small proteins of the usp pathogenicity island, imu <dig> and  <dig>  imu <dig> does bind dna and rna. we propose that usp producing cells are protected from genome fragmentation by imu <dig> dna masking. further, as imu <dig> precipitates but does not damage dna we believe that could have biotechnological potential.
