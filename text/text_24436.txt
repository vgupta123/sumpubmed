BACKGROUND
the mustelidae is the largest and most-diverse family of carnivora with a distribution throughout all continents except australia and antarctica  <cit> . recent classifications of the mustelidae recognize up to eight subfamilies: mustelinae, galictinae, helictidinae, martinae, melinae, lutrinae, mellivorinae, and taxidiinae  <cit> . phylogenetic relationships among these subfamlies have been hotly disputed in pioneer studies  <cit>  and are not well established yet. the main problem is that the family mustelidae represents a typical example of rapid evolutionary radiation and recent speciation event  <cit> , dating back to the oligocene  <cit> . for this reason, attempts to clarify relationships among the eight mustelidae subfamilies based on a variety of molecular studies have encountered challenges.

previously, molecular studies of the phylogenetic reconstruction of subfamilies within the mustelidae were based on short fragments of nuclear and mt dna. recently, some efforts have been made to obtain the phylogenetic tree based on large datasets, including those using  <dig> mt protein-coding genes  <cit> ,  <dig> nuclear genes  <cit> ,  <dig> nuclear genes and  <dig> mt gene  <cit> ,  <dig> nuclear genes and  <dig> mt gene  <cit>  and  <dig> nuclear genes and mt genes  <cit> . despite numerous efforts, however, evolutionary relationships among the mustelidae subfamilies remain controversial .

hence, it is necessary to exploit larger independent sources of phylogenetic characters to clarify these enigmatic problems. several studies have shown that relative to the commonly used nuclear protein-coding and mt genes, the noncoding intron sequences can be an equally fruitful source of phylogenetic characters as they possess a number of traits that are desirable for molecular phylogenetics  <cit> , for example, lack of functional constraints, a high substitution rate and less homoplasy  <cit> . in these studies, the nuclear introns have been shown to provide powerful complementary data to address the ambiguous relationships of different taxonomic levels, including the beaked whale species  <cit> , the asian pitvipers genus  <cit> , the carnivoran families  <cit> , and the eutherian orders  <cit> .

in the present study, we aim to sequence  <dig> nuclear intron loci comprising a total of > <dig> kb from  <dig> mustelids. the mustelids examined here represent all subfamilies of mustelidae, except for mellivorinae and galictinae. of the  <dig> nuclear loci,  <dig> were first applied in the studies of mustelidae phylogeny. in addition, we undertook the sequencing of the mt genome from these species and presented a phylogeny based on the mt genome data currently available for mustelids. our objectives were to:  provide new insights into the relationships among the mustelidae subfamilies, and  examine the utilities and evolutionary dynamics of the nuclear and mt genes in the context of mustelidae phylogeny, with special attention to the previously unexplored nuclear intron genes.

RESULTS
characteristics of the nuclear intron data and mt genomes
the general characteristics of the nuclear intron data and mt genomes are summarized in table  <dig>  the  <dig> nuclear introns of  <dig> species varied in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  aligned positions. the removal of ambiguous areas resulted in length variation of the aligned sequences from  <dig>  to  <dig>  positions. the numbers of parsimony-informative sites range from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . according to different gap selection criteria in gblocks, the alignment of the combined dataset comprised  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  positions. the parsimony-informative sites in these three datasets are  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. an a-t bias  and low transition /transversion  rate ratio  were observed in most introns. in addition, most introns showed gamma shape parameters  close to or larger than  <dig> . the nuclear sequence divergence among ingroup taxa ranged from 3%  to  <dig> % , and averaged  <dig> %.

note: ti = transition; tv = transversion; i = proportion of invariable sites; Î± = gamma distribution shape parameter; tes = transposible elements. if tes were detected in introns, it indicated yes, otherwise it indicated no.

a the length of sequences which were aligned using the clustal software with default settings.

b the length of analyzed data, after the ambiguous areas of the alignment were removed by gblocks  <dig> b.

c the length of all introns concatenated, after the ambiguous areas of the alignment were removed by gblocks  <dig> b with no gap , half gap , and all gap  parameters.

the complete mt genomes of  <dig> species ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in size. length differences are largely due to the variation in tandem repeats within the control region. all genomes shared the same  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trnas genes,  <dig> rrnas, and a control region, and also the same gene order. these mt genomes are apparently at-biased . the sequence divergence among ingroup taxa ranged from  <dig>   to 23%  for the protein-coding dataset , from  <dig>   to  <dig> %  for the rrna dataset ,  <dig> % for the trna dataset,  <dig> % for the control region, and  <dig> % for the complete dataset.

occurrence of transposable elements 
in our intron datasets, pervasive transposable element  insertions were discovered , which are mainly non-long-terminal repeat retrotransposons , e.g., long interspersed elements , short interspersed elements , mammalian-wide interspersed repeats , and dna transposons. mirs and dna transposons integrated into the orthologous loci of all examined species, which suggested an ancient origin. the result was consistent with the earlier finding that these two classes of tes represented remnants or "fossils" of tes, predating the radiation of mammalian orders, and had long ago become inactive in mammalian lineages  <cit> .

the great majority of lines and sines identified here were members of the l1_canid  and can sine groups that have been exclusively found in carnivora  <cit> . most of sines showed restricted taxonomic distributions and were characterized by sporadic locations in the intronic regions. this suggests that those sines emerged after species diversification, likely retaining their ability to retrotranspose.

the insertions of tes at genomic sites are often considered irreversible and random  <cit> , which suggests that they may be excellent homoplasy-free markers in phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . here, we identified one sine insertion shared by martes flavigula, martes zibellina, martes foina, martes pennanti, martes amaricana, and gulo gulo, supporting their close relationship and the monophyly of martinae subfamily.

occurrence of intra-individual allele heterozygotes 
the overall incidence of intra-individual allele heterozygotes  in our  <dig> new introns appears universal . there were  <dig> cases of iiahs in total. of the  <dig> species examined,  <dig> to  <dig> cases of iiahs were detected from each intron. iiahs were observed to be either of equal or variable length.  <dig> of  <dig> introns had allele length variant heterozygotes due to a 1-bp indel, with the other nucleotide sites either the same or distinct at 1- <dig> bp. iiahs of identical length were discovered in all introns with 1- <dig> substitutional differences.

notes: the information of iiahs were represented as transitions/transversions/indels. the numbers correspond to the number of transitions, the number of transversions and the length of indels, respectively. -- stands for unknown numbers due to the unavailiablity of sequences data

generally, iiahs formed monophyletic pairs on the phylogenetic trees as expected . two cases of strongly-supported nonmonophyletic iiahs were illustrated by the close relatedness of one allele of the least weasel mustela nivalis to one allele of the european polecat mustela putorius , which are most likely to indicate the cases of incomplete lineage sorting.

phylogenetic inference
although individual nuclear gene analyses produced inconsistent topologies with low levels of support , possibly due to limited phylogenetic information harbored in a single gene, the analyses of the combined nuclear data set using three gap selection criteria in gblocks  and different tree-building methods  yielded nearly identical, well-resolved trees with strong support for all nodes, except for the relationships among gulo gulo, martes americana, and martes pennanti . in the tree, taxidiinae diverged first , followed by melinae . the remaining mustelids were divided into two clades, one consisting of martinae and helictidinae , and the other one consisting of lutrinae and mustelinae . in addition, both the inclusion of iiahs in the combined nuclear analysis using software pofad  <cit>  and the bayesian concordance analysis  analysis  using software bucky  <cit>  produced the same tree topologies as that in figure  <dig>  at the subfamily level, all nodes in the bca analysis received high concordance factors  value .

for individual mt gene analyses, the rrna and trna data sets demonstrated reduced resolving power for phylogenetic inference compared to protein-coding gene analysis . the complete mtdna genome-based analyses, irrespective of the used tree-building methods and parameter sets, produced a well-resolved and well-supported tree , with the tree topology and branch supports identical to that of the combined protein-coding gene analysis. at the subfamilial level, the single difference between mt genome tree  and combined nuclear gene tree  is the phylogenetic position of helictidinae. in mt genome tree, helictidinae is closer to the clade uniting lutrinae and mustelinae than to martinae .

the phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the combined nuclear and mt genome data set by using the bca analysis  <cit>  produced a tree topology  identical to that from the combined nuclear gene analysis . at the subfamily level, all nodes received high cfs , except for that of helictidinae , whose position is the single discrepancy between the combined nuclear and mt gene trees.

shimodaira-hasegawa  test and the approximately unbiased  test were carried out to examine the degree of significant difference between the nuclear and mt trees produced in the present study. both tests indicated significant topological incongruence concerning the phylogenetic position of helictidinae between the nuclear and mt trees. when using nuclear data, the mt genome tree topology, in which helictidinae is closer to the clade uniting lutrinae and mustelinae, was rejected by the au and sh tests . when using mt genome data, the nuclear tree topology, in which helictidinae and martinae are grouped together, was rejected by the au and sh tests .

divergence time estimation
divergence time estimates for the origin and diversification of mustelidae subfamilies yielded broadly consistent results between combined nuclear and mt genome data set . combined nuclear gene analysis placed the earliest branching taxidiinae around  <dig>  mya . after that, melinae diverged from the other mustelids at  <dig>  mya . the split between martinae/helictidinae and lutrinae/mustelinae took place at  <dig>  mya . the divergence between martinae and helictidinae occurred at  <dig>  mya , and that between lutrinae and mustelinae at  <dig>  mya . the origins of mustelinae and martinae were estimated to be  <dig>  mya  and  <dig>  mya , respectively.

node numbers correspond to those indicated in figure  <dig> and 3

a the divergence times were estimated based on combined nuclear genes and tree topology in figure 2

b the divergence times were estimated based on mt genomes and tree topology in figure 3

c 95% confidence intervals

the analyses of the mt genome data set suggested the origin of taxidiinae around  <dig>  mya . other time estimates included the split of the melinae clade from other mustelids at  <dig>  mya , the separation between helictidinae/lutrinae/mustelinae and martinae about  <dig>  mya , the divergence between helictidinae and lutrinae/mustelinae at  <dig>  mya , and the divergence between lutrinae and mustelinae at  <dig>  mya . the origins of mustelinae and martinae were estimated to be  <dig>  mya  and  <dig>  mya , respectively.

discussion
phylogeny of mustelidae subfamilies
among mammalian phylogenies, those characterized by rapid species radiations have long been one of the plaguing and challenging problems in species tree reconstruction  <cit> . this is the first study utilizing data from such large-scale nuclear non-coding loci from mustelidae.

both our combined nuclear intron and mt genome phylogenies not only strongly favor the prevailing view that taxidiinae was the most basal member within family mustelidae  <cit> , but also provide strong evidence that melinae diverged between taxidiinae and all the other mustelids examined as well. the latter is in contradiction to morphological investigations  <cit> , but supports the nuclear gene results from sato et al.  <cit>  and wolsan and sato  <cit> , and disagree those from koepfli et al.  <cit>  and yu et al.  <cit> .

notably, the sister relationship between lutrinae and mustelinae was reinforced by consistent recovery from both our mt genome and combined nuclear intron analyses with high confidence, upholding and strengthening the hypothesis drawn by almost all sequence-based analyses in previous studies  <cit> . in contrast, the position of helictidinae varied between our nuclear and mt genome analyses. nuclear data analysis placed it as sister to martinae, whereas mt genome data indicated a sister-taxa association of it to the clade uniting lutrinae and mustelinae. our mt genome result  is consistent with that inferred from most previous nuclear studies  <cit> , but dissented from morphological view and karyological analyses  <cit> . interestingly, our combined nuclear analysis  yields a result that is different from all previous hypotheses, suggesting for the first time helictidinae and martinae are more closely related to each other than any other taxa in mustelidae.

corresponding tests  have indicated significant topological incongruence between nuclear and mt trees. when using nuclear data, the mt genome tree topology was rejected by the au and sh tests , and vice versa. phylogenetic incongruence between nuclear and mitochondrial genes has also been reported in drosophila, aves and bears  <cit> . various elements may bear the responsibility for the presence of conflicting signal regarding the placement of helictidinae, including different evolutionary histories and gene properties in gene regions from different genomes, sampling error and lineage sorting. the probability of their occurrence increased especially when separation time between different species is short  <cit> , as in the present study. although the bca analysis of the combined nuclear intron and mt genome sequences, which is an approach that allows for gene tree discordance, retrieved an identical tree topology to that of the nuclear intron gene, the position of helictidinae received week support. therefore, the analyses involving more characters in the future may help to confirm the precise position of helictidinae.

implications for mustelidae radiation
mustelidae has one of the most extensive fossil records of extant carnivora families  <cit> , and molecular dating of the mustelidae radiation has also been attempted in several studies previously. our results, from an independent character source, provide important insights into the time scale of the origin and diversification of extant subfamilies of mustelidae. it is interesting to draw a comparison of the dating results estimated from prior and present studies .

among the subfamilies, taxidiinae is the basal-most branching lineage in mustelid diversification dating to the late oligocene, which is more concordant with the time estimate of koepfli et al.  <cit> , but earlier than those of bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> , yonezawa et al.  <cit>  and eizirik et al.  <cit> . the divergence time of the next branching lineage, i.e., melinae clade, is dated to the early miocene in our analysis, which is more broadly consistent with the paleontological data  <cit>  and the sequence-based data from yonezawa et al.  <cit>  than those from sato et al.  <cit> , bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> , koepfli et al.  <cit> , and eizirik et al  <cit> . the estimates of the origin of the remaining mustelids are more recent than those fossil-based ages  <cit> , and older than the other sequence-based dates  <cit> .

among the remaining mustelids, one important event of the mustelid diversification is the divergence between lutrinae and mustelinae. our estimated dates are consistent with the corresponding fossil records  <cit>  and that from yonezawa et al.  <cit> , but more recent than those from hosoda et al.  <cit> , wayne  <cit> , and sato et al.  <cit> , and older than those from koepfli et al.  <cit>  and eizirik et al.  <cit> . other important events are the origins of mustelinae and martinae. our estimates for them are both much older than the existing fossil record  <cit> . the dates of mustelinae origin are older than most of the other molecular estimates, but in good agreement with that of koepfli et al.  <cit> . as regards the origin of martinae, there is large difference between our nuclear and mt genome estimates. the nuclear estimate is more in agreement with those from koepfli et al.  <cit>  and eizirik et al.  <cit> , while the mt estimate is more concordant with those from hosoda et al.  <cit>  and yonezawa et al.  <cit> .

in addition, our analyses resulted in time estimates of divergence of helictidinae that more agree with that from koepfli et al.  <cit>  than that from bininda-emonds et al.  <cit> , which is younger than the present results. more intensive taxonomic sampling will improve accuracy on the time estimation of mustelid diversification.

utilities of the nuclear introns in phylogenetic study of mustelidae subfamilies
several recent studies have indicated that nuclear introns hold considerable signals for resolution of difficult phylogenies at both shallow and deeper species level hierarchies  <cit> . we are among the first to use large-scale nuclear intron genes in inferring phylogenies of mustelidae. our analysis not only brings new perspectives on the phylogenetic relationship of mustelidae subfamilies, but provides another example demonstrating that the nuclear non-coding genes can be an effective data source for reconstructing evolutionary histories in a group that has undergone rapid bursts of speciation as well.

we assessed the phylogenetic utilities of individual introns and mt genes in resolution of the inter-subfamilial relationships of mustelidae by counting the number of congruent nodes between the individual phylogenies and the combined gene trees . in the individual nuclear gene analyses, the plod2- <dig> gene recovered all  <dig> nodes of the combined nuclear gene tree. anyway, the plod2- <dig> and plod2- <dig> genes recovered the highest number of congruent nodes of the combined nuclear gene tree, whereas the wasf1- <dig>  guca1b- <dig>  ssr1- <dig>  and tbc1d7- <dig> genes showed the lowest phylogenetic performance. as regards the mt gene analyses, we observed that the nd <dig> and cytb genes recovered all  <dig> nodes of the mt genome tree. ranking the single mt gene shows that the nd <dig>  cytb, 16srrna and nd <dig> genes are better indicators of mustelidae phylogeny at subfamilial level than are other genes, such as atp <dig>  atp <dig> and nd4l genes. this result agrees broadly with previous conclusions about the rough classification of mt genes into good, medium, and poor performance categories  <cit>  . in summary, the assessment of phylogenetic utility and limits of these individual nuclear and mt genes makes it possible to preselect subsets of genes for future molecular studies of vertebrate phylogeny.

* branches with pp >  <dig>  congruent in the combined topology

# branches with pp <  <dig>  congruent in the combined topology

although the use of nuclear introns as genetic markers has now been implemented as a powerful approach in recent phylogenetic studies, there are, however, numerous potential problems associated with this approach. chief among these is the difficulties in sequence data acquisition, alignment, and analysis of the nuclear introns compared to the traditional mt and nuclear protein-coding genes, as a result of the higher rates of variation and frequencies of indels. the common presence of indels  and iiahs, as reported in this study, makes experimental work labor-intensive by virtue of the additional time and money required to isolate alleles and optimize pcr amplification and sequencing. in addition, they can create positional homology problems associated with areas of ambiguous alignment  <cit> . several studies have also shown that the phylogenetic inference is sensitive to the various treatments of indels. these issues are central to the appropriate application of intron data in phylogenetic reconstruction and they should be comprehensively and explicitly addressed in the future studies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the phylogenetic relationships among mustelidae subfamilies have posed one of the major problems concerning carnivora systematics. in this study, phylogenetic relationships among mustelidae subfamilies are presented based on  <dig> nuclear intron loci and mt whole genomes. our results resolve some of the ambiguous issues in mustelidae phylogeny, whereas some phylogenetic relationships require confirmation by analyzing additional samples and character information, such as the precise position of helictidinae. our study not only brings new perspectives on the previously obscured phylogenetic relationships among mustelidae subfamilies, but also provides another example demonstrating the effectiveness of nuclear non-coding loci for reconstructing evolutionary histories in a group that has undergone rapid bursts of speciation.
