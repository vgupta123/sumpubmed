BACKGROUND
whole-genome sequencing  of human genomic dna with next-generation sequencers  has opened a new avenue for personalized healthcare and personalized medicine based on the detection of genetic variations related to physical traits  <cit> . the application of human wgs to large-population genetics requires rapid, low cost, and accurate validation technologies.

the resequencing market is currently dominated by illumina hiseq sequencing platforms  that have been applied in large population studies . bridging pcr amplification of fragmented genomic dna in a flow cell and sequencing-by-synthesis chemical reactions truly realize massive parallel sequencing from both ends of a dna fragment  <cit> . the output from a hiseq instrument can reach up to 600 gb per run, with more than 80% of the reads with an average quality score higher than  <dig> . in particular, the newly released protocol for hiseq  omits the initial pcr amplification step during library construction and completes human wgs with high depth  in two days in one flow cell. this improved protocol is expected to accelerate the discovery of disease-susceptible variants by the wgs analysis of human populations on a large scale.

importantly, the accuracy of variant calls made with ngs data is critical for future genetic investigations that aim to detect disease-susceptible single nucleotide variations   <cit> . even with the improvements in the chemistry used and in the equipment, systemic biases have been reported for both the genome coverage and the accuracy of variant calls of most ngss  <cit> . currently, the validation of snv calls that are newly discovered using ngss depends on conventional methods based on amplification of the target region with pcr, sanger sequencing, hybridization of sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes, and mass spectroscopic assays  <cit> . more than three million snvs have been reported in a human genome compared with the reference grch37/hg <dig> sequence   <cit> . in the analyses of large populations, comprehensive validation of newly observed snvs is sometimes prohibitively expensive and tedious using these traditional low-throughput methods.

it is of interest to discover whether the overall accuracy of variant calls can be improved using a hybrid approach such as using ngss with different working principles to analyze the same genome, as indicated previously  <cit> . the rationale of this notion is that platform-specific biases or errors in the data from one ngs platform can be corrected by using the data from another ngs platform, if the two methods are based on different working principles. we surmised, therefore, that an appropriate combination of different ngss may reduce the overall cost of sequencing.

a semiconductor-based non-optical ngs has recently become available  <cit> . these sequencers are attractive candidates as alternatives to hiseq. the semiconductor sequencers directly detect changes of ph that are caused by the release of hydrogen ions when nucleotides are incorporated into the growing dna strand during the dna polymerase reaction in cells within a chip, which is manufactured using the same technology that is used to construct integrated circuits  <cit> . this method features rapid reaction time and low price in consumables per base  <cit> . the first semiconductor-based ngs, ion torrent personal genome machine, has been used widely in many different applications . the larger ion proton semiconductor ngs  has now been launched, and the total output of the ion proton i chip is reported to be nearly 10 gb, which is suitable for targeted resequencing of, for example, the human exome. because the sequencing reaction in semiconductor-based ngss does not use terminator nucleotides, the accuracy of the generated reads are known to decrease for homopolymer repeat sequences . nonetheless, many known disease-causing mutations have been detected by the semiconductor sequencers  <cit> , implying the potential of the platform.

it has been reported that a pcr-free protocol for hiseq is not free from coverage bias, especially for high and low gc regions  <cit> . therefore, the addition of exome data  to the wgs data processed by hiseq may strike a balance between cost and benefit, making it an attractive strategy for sequencing functionally important regions in human populations. here, we compare the variant call results for the genomic dna of  <dig> japanese individuals generated by wgs on hiseq  <dig> in rapid-run mode and targeted exome sequences obtained using on proton with the i chip. we used the omni  <dig> - <dig> snp arrays as references for the variant calls and compared the snp data among the three platforms. we found that ion proton exhibited high concordance in variant calls with the other two platforms, indicating that ion proton is a promising tool for validation of multiple snps in the wgs of a large population.

RESULTS
outline of sequence outputs
a new sequencing protocol for hiseq  <dig>  namely, a rapid-run mode with 162 bp paired-end sequences, was used in this study. a summary of the wgs data for the samples from  <dig> japanese individuals produced by hiseq  <dig> is shown in table  <dig>  the average total number of bases and mapping ratio for the  <dig> samples were 101 gb and  <dig> %, respectively . the percent coefficient of variation  of total bases and mapping ratios among the  <dig> samples was small , indicating that the quality of the sequence reaction was comparable among the samples. the automatic library construction using the agilent bravo liquid-handling robot contributed to the reproducibility among the samples. the %cv of quality scores  of the  <dig> to 150 cycles of read  <dig> was a bit higher , implying that the sequencing-by-synthesis technology may be less stable during the final one sixth of the cycles.table  <dig>

a summary of the whole exome sequencing data for the same  <dig> japanese samples produced by ion proton is shown in table  <dig>  two samples  did not meet our criteria for total number of bases  with one ion proton i chip experiment; therefore, we repeated the ion proton run with samples from the same library and merged the two results before the variant calling . although we used a  <dig> base read protocol, the average read length that we obtained was  <dig>  because ion proton automatically trims unreliable bases  <cit> . we found that the variance in average read length was small compared with the variance in the total number of bases , indicating that the sequencing reaction after the chip loading in ion proton was reproducible. consequently, the %cv of the aligned bases was quite small . the mean coverage depth of target sequences was 109× , while the coverage depth may be somewhat overestimated because pcr duplication was not removed for the mapping. these results demonstrate that the hiseq sequencing and ion proton sequencing both attained the standard quality.table  <dig>

comparison of snp calls among three platforms
to assess the potential of the ion proton exome sequencing to validate the snv calls for the wgs generated by hiseq  <dig> of the  <dig> japanese population samples, we evaluated the snp calls using the illumina omni  <dig> - <dig> snp chip  as a reference to characterize the differences between the two ngs platforms. the reported japanese genomic sequence generated by hiseq  <dig> seemed to be substantially different from the grch37/hg <dig> reference genome  <cit> . we focused on the autosomal target sequences of the ion proton exome kit  to compare the ngs results from the two platforms. we extracted the variant call results, and tested the variants at the loci covered by omni  <dig> - <dig>  a total of  <dig>  snps on the autosomes in the  <dig> japanese genomes were tested .

the numbers of called autosomal snps and the degrees of concordance among the three platforms  were the positivity of the alternate alleles, regardless of its allelic state , from the grch37/hg <dig> reference genome. omni  <dig> - <dig> called  <dig>  alternate alleles per person, either homozygous or heterozygous, on the  <dig> japanese sequences and the %cv of the total calls of individuals was  <dig> % . the average number of snps called by the hiseq software  was fairly similar to the number called from omni  <dig> - <dig> with a similar variance  . ion proton called  <dig>  snps with a relatively large variance  among the  <dig> samples . therefore, we concluded that ion proton made less stable snp calls among the individuals than hiseq.table  <dig> 
concordant snp calls made from the hiseq, ion proton, and omni  <dig> - <dig> snp array data


ho concordant, hiseq  <dig> and omni  <dig> - <dig> chip snp calls were concordant but not the ion proton calls. hp concordant, hiseq  <dig> and ion proton snp calls were concordant but not the omni  <dig> - <dig> chip calls. op concordant, omni  <dig> - <dig> chip and ion proton snp calls were concordant but not the hiseq  <dig> calls. calculation of proton support = all concordant/ho concordant.



concordance between the omni  <dig> - <dig> and hiseq calls was very high and much less variable among the samples  than the concordance between the omni  <dig> - <dig> and ion proton calls . the concordance among the calls by the three platforms exhibited relatively high variance compared with the concordance between the omni  <dig> - <dig> and hiseq calls. the %cv is as low as  <dig> % for the concordance between the calls made by omni  <dig> - <dig> and hiseq. the variance in the numbers of concordant snps among the  <dig> individual genomes seems to be caused by fluctuations in the number of snps  called by ion proton .

venn diagrams of the snp calls shared among the three platforms are shown in figure  <dig>  a maximum of 97% of the hiseq calls for any one individual were supported by the ion proton calls . indeed, the numbers of concordant snps including “negative” calls  were nearly 98% . the overall concordance of snp calls made by hiseq and ion proton with calls made by omni  <dig> - <dig> was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . these numbers are comparable with similar results reported in a previous study  <cit> . while almost  <dig> of the called snps were discordant between omni  <dig> - <dig> and both hiseq and ion proton , many of these snp calls seemed to be derived from a difference in the allelic calls in the manifest file of omni  <dig> - <dig>  <cit> . these results support the promising potential of combining the ngs platforms as a multiple validation method for snv calls in population studies.figure  <dig>

reproducibility of snp calls by individual ngss
to analyze the reproducibility of snp calls among the three platforms in detail, a level plot of the numbers of alternative allele calls in the  <dig> alleles  was generated . if all the snp calls are completely identical between two of the three platforms, the data points accumulate on the 1: <dig> diagonal line. for the hiseq and omni  <dig> - <dig> snp calls, the points accumulated along the diagonal line, indicating very high concordance between these two platforms . for both the hiseq and omni  <dig> - <dig> snp calls against the ion proton calls, the plot showed that ion proton tended to call a lower number of snps than hiseq and omni  <dig> - <dig> . however, we also found that only a small fraction of alternate alleles in the  <dig> japanese samples at one of the snp loci was never called by ion proton .figure  <dig>

the level plot analysis also indicated possible systemic errors inherent in each platform. for example,  <dig> snps were not called by hiseq for any of the  <dig> samples, whereas all of them were called as homozygous for the alternate alleles by omni  <dig> - <dig> . visual inspection of the bam files using the integrated genome viewer  <cit>  suggested that some of the snp loci may be caused by the large structural variations that are commonly found in the genomes of japanese populations, implying that population-specific reference genomic sequences will improve the quality of mapping of ngs reads to reference genomes.

to detect systemic errors in the snv calls, we analyzed the commonly discordant snps among the  <dig> individuals . on average, ion proton called  <dig>  snps that exhibited discordant variant calls in an individual exome, and  <dig>  of them were commonly discordant among the  <dig> japanese genomes. hiseq called an average of  <dig> snps that were discordant with ion proton and omni  <dig> - <dig>  suggesting that ion proton may cover some calls that were missed by hiseq. together, these results indicate that the two ngs platforms showed no strong systemic calling biases for the snps covered by omni  <dig> - <dig> table  <dig>

effects of sequence depth and gc contents on snp calls by the ngss
read depth, gc content, and homopolymer stretches have been identified as critical factors for the accuracy of snv calls made by the ngss  <cit> . for hiseq, the read depth at each snp was significantly different between the concordant and discordant calls with omni  <dig> - <dig>  as well as with ion proton . similarly, the variant calls discordant with ion proton exhibit significantly lower read depth . these results confirm the previous observations that read depth can be a major factor in determining the quality of variant calls. as mentioned earlier, we did not eliminate duplicate reads from the ion proton data. the ratio of duplicated reads at snvs in the ion proton reads for each of the  <dig> samples was found to be inversely correlated to the concordance of snp calling comparing with the omni  <dig> - <dig> .the gc content was calculated in a 101-base window for each snp locus . we found that ion proton calls were affected in the loci with higher gc content . for the hiseq snp calls, no significant difference in the gc content of the loci was detected between the snps concordant and discordant with omni  <dig> - <dig>  whereas, for the ion proton calls, some significant difference was found . similarly, the concordant snps between ion proton and omni  <dig> - <dig> tended to have higher gc content than the discordant snps . these results indicate that gc content in the snp loci affected the quality of snp calls by the ngss, especially for ion proton.figure  <dig>

it has been noted previously that semiconductor sequencers frequently show insertion/deletion  errors at loci with homopolymer sequences . however, against our expectation, homopolymer length in the snp loci did not affect the number of discordant snps between ion proton and omni  <dig> - <dig> , suggesting that snps in short homopolymer stretches can be detected by ion proton.figure  <dig>

logistic regression analyses indicated that read depth was the strongest factor for discordant calls against omni  <dig> - <dig> for both hiseq and ion proton ; however, gc content affected more ion proton calls  than hiseq calls. in contrast to the effect of homopolymer sequences on discordant snp calls, the logistic regression analysis results showed that homopolymer sequences in the snp loci effected ion proton variant calls more strongly than they affected hiseq variant calls, even though the overall effects were not significant . these results indicate that all three factors  may affect the accuracy of the ion proton snp calls, whereas read depth may be the major factor for the accuracy of the hiseq snp calls.table  <dig>

in addition, we calculated the transition/transversion ratio for omni  <dig> - <dig> and the two ngss and found that the transition/transversion ratio was smaller for variant calls between the two ngss but not between either of the two ngss and omni  <dig> - <dig> or are all discordant snps, indicating that the ngss might miss more transitions than transversions . the transition/transversion ratio values that we obtained are compatible to the ratios reported in a previous study  <cit> .

discussion
in this paper, variant snp calls in the exonic sequences from the genomic dna of  <dig> japanese individuals were compared between two ngs platforms, targeted exome sequencing by ion proton and pcr-free wgs by hiseq  <dig>  and omni  <dig> - <dig>  the omni  <dig> - <dig> chip snp calls were used as the reference. approximately  <dig>  snp loci were analyzed in this study from which omni  <dig> - <dig> called  <dig>  variants, and more than 90% of these variant calls were supported by both hiseq and ion proton. ion proton exhibited a maximum of 96% concordance of snp calls with the snp calls by the other two platforms, indicating that ion proton is a promising tool for the valiadation of multiple snps. nonetheless, improvements in the sensitivity of ion proton for alternative alleles are still necessary for the efficient detection of novel snvs in a human genome using ion proton.

of the three factors that are known to affect snv calling by ngss, we found that all three factors  affect more or less the accuracy of ion proton snp calls, whereas read depth was the major factor that affected hiseq snp calls. gc content has been shown to be a confounding factor for exon capturing ; therefore, the accuracy of ion proton snp calls may have been affected by differences in the gc content near the snp loci. non-optical semiconductor-based sequencers like ion proton have been used widely for multiple amplicon sequencing ; however, it has been reported that these sequencers exhibit relatively high error rates, especially for homopolymer sequences . while homopolymer length did affect the accuracy of the ion proton snp calls more than it affected the accuracy of the hiseq snp calls, its affect on the ion proton snp calls was small .

an interesting question is whether ion proton can cover errors found in hiseq data. we found that hiseq failed to call from  <dig> to  <dig> snp calls in the  <dig> individual samples, which were called commonly by ion proton and omni  <dig> - <dig> , indicating that ion proton may cover the hiseq missed calls. the ion personal genome machine  that preceded ion proton was used for a similar purpose in the characterization of the tasmania devil genome sequence  <cit> .

we found that there was a significant difference between the number of snps called among the  <dig> samples by hiseq and ion proton, and the variance was larger for ion proton calls than it was for hiseq calls. the sequencing processes in ion proton after the chip loading appeared to exhibit reproducibility similar to that of hiseq during sequencing-by-synthesis. therefore, the major reason for the variance in the number of ion proton snp calls must be in the different library construction procedures that are used in the two ngss. in this study, the library preparation procedures that we used for ion proton were manual, whereas liquid-handling robots were used for the construction of libraries for hiseq. we surmise that the ion proton output will improve if automated liquid-handling procedures can be established. indeed, we found that the reproducibility of library construction for ion proton was improved using an automated library construction method .we found that most of the snps called by hiseq were supported by the ion proton snp calls; indicating that ion proton could be used to validate novel snps in a population. however, if the snps are relatively rare in a population, they may not be validated by ion proton. in fact, the pixels near the origin on the horizontal axis are a bit brighter than those farther from the origin, as can be seen in figure 2b and 2c. the data plotted in figure 2b and 2c demonstrated how the addition of ion proton snp call data to hiseq snp calls can provide strong support for the identification of alternate alleles in a population of interest. our results suggest that approximately 97% of the expected snvs in exonic regions of a human genome will be verified by ion proton exome sequencing. this finding will contribute to designing custom arrays for large-scale population-specific genetic studies of populations of unique origin, like the japanese.

CONCLUSIONS
validation of snvs detected in wgs is critical for studying disease-related variations in human population genetics. combining different types of ngss in analyses of the genome sequences from the same individual may be an efficient means of validateing multiple snv calls simultaneously. here, we attempted to show the versatility and usefulness of the combination of ion proton exome sequencing with hiseq  <dig> wgs by analyzing  <dig> independent japanese genomes sequences and comparing the corresponding snp calls, with the omni  <dig> - <dig> snp calls as the reference. we found that ion proton exhibited a maximum of 97% concordance in variant calls with the other two platforms, indicating that ion proton is a promising tool for the validation of multiple snps in the exons of genomic sequences.
