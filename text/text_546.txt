BACKGROUND
two color microarrays allow massively parallel profiling of gene expression in a single hybridization experiment  <cit> . the study of two different mrna populations consists of 1) labelling each set of transcripts with a fluorescent dye, usually cy <dig> and cy <dig>  2) challenging the transcripts in a competitive hybridization towards thousands of specific gene probes spotted on an array and 3) measuring the fluorescence signals for each dye over the whole array. the two  <dig> bit images produced by the scanner are combined and the data for each spot are extracted and processed to yield ratios between the tested conditions. these ratios are used for further analysis. this technique, however, suffers from an excess of variability that limits the measurements' robustness. uncertainties in the measurements come from different sources among which are data acquisition and image processing  <cit> .

in the microarray approach, the final interpretation of the experiments strongly relies on the accuracy of the measurement of the signal intensity at each spot. therefore, array scanning and image processing are crucial steps that need to be optimized thoroughly. scan parameters depend upon the instrument and upon user-controlled settings . since a single scan is usually not sufficient to provide all the statistically significant information that is available on the slide, different protocols employing multiple scans have been proposed. dudley et al  <cit>  combined multiple scans performed at different and linearly spaced sensitivity settings. other authors have proposed the computation of data from scans acquired at multiple scanner sensitivity settings   <cit> . variability among microarray images also has been studied by tang et al.  <cit>  and romualdi et al.  <cit> . their results showed that, following independent scans, a single pixel belonging to a given spot can have different levels of fluorescence intensity. they, also, have shown that dna spot images scanned with the same settings  are not exactly superimposed. they have proposed solutions either to correct image misalignment or to reconstitute one single virtual image statistically that is representative of a series of consecutive scans of a microarray . romualdi et al. demonstrated that the use of multiple scans 1) reveals false positive results such as differentially expressed genes that are detected by a single scan but not confirmed by successive scanning replicates 2) increases the image homogeneity and 3) enhances the detection of differentially expressed genes, particularly for genes with a low level of expression. indeed, when the fluorescence level of a given spot is close to the background, it is usually rejected from further statistical analysis  <cit> . however, these authors did not analyse, among successive scans, the fluctuations of individual pixel intensities or median spot intensities. since the intensities of the weak spots are often too variable among replicated slides to allow the signal to be considered as statistically relevant, the associated genes are not selected as being significantly differentially expressed.

a previous study by romualdi et al.  <cit>  was limited to series of consecutive scans obtained with the same scanning parameters. here, we have investigated the effect of pmt settings and scanning resolution on the variability of the fluorescence signal among successive scans for the same array. to avoid any specific influence resulting from comparison of different experimental conditions, we used data from arrays for which self-to-self hybridizations of two identical samples from various species was performed. since the photo-bleaching of each dye is low, this allowed us to study the fluctuation of the spot median at different intensity levels. for a given spot, we determined the standard deviations of the pixels along the series of scans, to assess which part of the spot is responsible for the fluctuations of the intensity median from one scan to the next. finally, for one array that contained repeated probes  and which had been hybridized with two biological samples, we determined the effect of averaging successive scans on the reproducibility of the signal of the duplicated genes.

our results show that averaging two image acquisitions of the same array is sufficient to enhance the robustness of the value of the signal, particularly in the case of weak spots, and we propose a new procedure to enhance the detection of differentially expressed genes.

RESULTS
analysis of the decrease in the signal
one problem that can arise when microarrays are submitted to repetitive scans is photo-bleaching. to evaluate this phenomenon, we compared the median of the intensities from the first scan in a series to the last scan, the series being scanned with an axon scanner at pmt settings of  <dig> v for cy <dig> and  <dig> v for cy <dig>  the result of this comparison reveals that the decrease in the signal is small  and  <dig> % for the green dye ) our results are in agreement with those of bengtsson et al  <cit> . however, we noticed that this decrease is not regular from scan to scan along each series, particularly in the green channel. to render the images within a series comparable, this irregular decrease has to be corrected. to do so, we adjusted the f <dig> and f <dig> median values as described in the materials and methods.

influence of the scanning parameters on the signal variability
once the effect of the decrease in the signal was corrected, we were able to study the influence of other parameters such as the scanning resolution and the pmt settings on the signal variability.

effect of the scanning resolution
technical progress in array manufacturing has permitted an increase in the density of the spots present on a slide. however, the size of the spots, and, thus, the number of pixels per spot, has decreased. further, the number of pixels is directly related to the scanning resolution. for example, a spot with a diameter of  <dig> microns is composed of  <dig> pixels at a scanner resolution  <dig> microns and four times more pixels when the resolution is  <dig> microns, . it is not known to what respect the signal associated with a spot is affected by the resolution of the scan. to investigate this relationship, we compared the signals obtained at  <dig> and  <dig> microns scanner resolution from two high density arrays having spots with mean diameters of  <dig> microns . the criterion chosen to measure the signal variability is an adjusted signal that varies more than 10% between two consecutive acquisitions . the percentage of "outlier" spots corresponds to the percentage of spots whose adjusted signal satisfies this criterion. we chose this threshold since it permits the detection of small fluctuations while still maintaining enough spots for a robust statistical study. for example, at pmt settings of  <dig> v in both channels and  <dig> microns resolution, 4% of the spots have fluctuations higher than 10% but only 1% present fluctuations higher than 12% whereas for 86% of the spots the fluctuation is higher than 7%. we found that the percentage of "outlier" spots is higher at  <dig> microns resolution than at  <dig> microns. indeed, because of the reduced number of pixels per spot at  <dig> microns, the robustness of the intensity value  is reduced. this is true for both the red and the green channels, but the percentage of "outlier" spots is higher for cy <dig> than for cy <dig> .

results for slide # <dig>  400- <dig> corresponds to settings  <dig> v for the red dye  and  <dig> v for the green dye , respectively. the percentage of "outlier" spots, pout, is equal to: pout = nout/n with nout being the number of events where a spot is found to be an "outlier" between two successive scans and n =  Ã— nspots .

effect of the pmt settings
we also found that the fluctuation of the signal increases as the pmt voltage increases  except for the hydrogel slide where the percentage of "outlier" spots was constant in the green channel at all the pmt settings. when the pmt gain increased from  <dig> v to  <dig> v, the signal fluctuations for each pmt setting were different depending upon the surface chemistry. for the hydrogel slide , the percentage of "outlier" spots was very low . for the aminosilane slide  it increased from  <dig> to 7% and from  <dig> to 15% in the green and the red channels, respectively. for phosphoramidite slides  the percentage of "outlier" spots, at  <dig> microns resolution, increased from  <dig> to 4% and  <dig> to 12% in the green and the red channels, respectively .

in order to study the relationships among these fluctuations and the signal levels, for each pmt gain, we computed the number of "outlier" spots according to their intensity class . for each channel, the lower the intensity of the signal, the higher the number of "outlier" spots . as described above, for each intensity class, the percentage of "outlier" spots increases with the pmt settings and it is higher for the red dye than for the green dye. for example, for slide # <dig>  the percentage of "outliers" is  <dig> %  at pmt settings of  <dig> v and  <dig> %  at pmt settings of  <dig> v for the spots having a log <dig> of the green fluorescence level between  <dig> and  <dig>  the percentage of "outliers" is  <dig> %  at pmt settings of  <dig> v and  <dig> %  at pmt settings of  <dig> v for the spots having a log <dig> of the green fluorescence level between  <dig> and  <dig>  there were twice as many "outlier" spots for the red dye as for the green dye.

these signal fluctuations associated with each spot in the red or the green channel, especially with increasing pmt gain , impact on the red/green ratios and, thus, influence the differential analysis. these observations indicate that scanning should be performed with moderate pmt settings. however, this is in opposition to the necessity of finding spots in all intensity classes for which increasing the settings increases the range of fluorescence values for the spots and, thus, improves spot detection. different authors have proposed combining scans at low and high sensitivities to increase the number of spots detected on an array  <cit> . we evaluated an alternative protocol consisting of performing consecutive scans at the same pmt settings and then calculating the mean of  <dig> or  <dig> successive scans.

effect of averaging successive acquisitions
effect on the signal variability
some scanners, such as the axon scanner , offer the possibility of acquiring each line of the array several times  and computing the arithmetic mean of these acquisitions. we performed a series of experiments using this option. slides were scanned at balanced voltages in order to determine the best parameters for acquisition of the images. the images were aligned at sub-pixel levels and analysed as previously described  <cit> .

the number of "outlier" spots, was found to decrease with an increase in the number of scans per line. this was more pronounced for the red channel, where the percent of outlier spots decreased from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, than for the green channel where the decrease was from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . in figure  <dig>  for the green channel  and for the red channel  the number of spots presenting large differences decreases when the number of acquisitions increases. whatever the intensity class or the dye, the number of "outlier" spots decreased when  <dig> or  <dig> acquisitions were used to compute the average for a line, except for the log <dig> of intensities between  <dig> and  <dig>  where there were very low numbers of spots . this decrease was more pronounced going from  <dig> to  <dig> acquisitions as opposed to that going from  <dig> to  <dig> acquisitions. moreover, the decrease in the percentage of "outliers" is more pronounced for spots with low intensity values, decreasing for example, from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and then to  <dig> %, respectively when  <dig> or  <dig> acquisitions are averaged, for red intensities having a log <dig> value between  <dig> and  <dig>  thus, averaging leads to increased levels of confidence in the values of the signals, whatever the signal level. this results in the inclusion of more low intensity spots in the differential analysis.

results for slide # <dig>  the pmt settings were  <dig> v for cy <dig>  and  <dig> v for cy <dig> ; images were acquired at  <dig> microns resolution using the lsmode .

effect on the variability of the intensity ratios within the series of scans
although these results illustrate how the quality of the signal can be increased by averaging consecutive scans, they do not address the consequences on the log <dig> ratio values. to elucidate this aspect, we performed an analysis of the fluctuations of the m values  within a series of nscans. we computed, for each interval of the a value , a parameter e. this parameter is a measure of the fluctuation of the log <dig> red/green ratios within the series, for all "outlier" spots  on the one hand and for the "non-outlier" spots on the other hand . the results were very different between "outlier" and "non-outlier" spots, as the "non-outlier" spots showed constant fluctuations within a series independent of the a values. the difference between the fluctuations of the m values of "outlier" and "non-outlier" spots decreased with the number of acquisitions used for averaging. this decrease was larger when going from  <dig> to  <dig> scans than for  <dig> to  <dig> scans. moreover, the strongest effect was seen for the spots in the low intensity classes. thus, averaging consecutive scans results in a decrease in the fluctuation of m within the series, especially for the low intensity spots.

effect on the pixel variability
to understand the reason for the fluctuations observed within a series, we analysed spots at the pixel level. spots can have different shapes ; they can have irregular contours. when the adaptative circle method of segmentation is used, all the pixels of the contour do not have the same intensities. to visualize the behaviour of the pixels, the nscans aligned images of the same series were stacked. one "non-outlier" spot and one "outlier" spot having the same intensity levels  were selected and the images were cropped. we calculated the mean and the standard deviation of the intensity of each pixel in these stacks. the resulting images  were processed with an image j plug-in adapted from "interactive 3d surface plot"  <cit> . comparison of "outlier" and "non-outlier" spots shows that the standard deviation of "outlier" spots is always higher. for the example of spots b <dig> and a <dig>  the maximum values of the standard deviation are equal to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these values are remarkably high compared to the intensity levels of the spots . in addition, these large fluctuations concerned many pixels; for the "outlier" spot b <dig>  95% of the pixels have a standard deviation greater than  <dig>  since our definition of an "outlier" spot is based upon a fluctuation of the median intensity greater than 10% from one scan to the next, this indicates why the pixels of "outlier" spots are more variable from scan to scan. indeed, as the median is a measure insensitive to the extreme values, the median of pixel values of each spot changes from one scan to the next, only when a large number of pixels vary to a large extent with respect to the previous scan.

the data shown in figure  <dig> are in agreement with the expected results and demonstrate the heterogeneity of the spots. we observed that the pixels of the contour of the spots vary more than the pixels in the middle of the spots. averaging scans decreased the value of the standard deviation of all the pixels within the series  and  <dig> for "non-outlier" spots  with  <dig> acquisitions averaged; it is  <dig> with  <dig> acquisitions averaged for both spots).

effect on the reproducibility of the signal and of the m values
finally, we wanted to determine the impact of averaging consecutive scans on the robustness of the measurement of the signal and on the difference in expression, as evaluated by the reproducibility of both measures. to do that, we analyzed slide # <dig>  which was a competitive hybridization between two different biological samples. there are several levels of replication  which improve the quality of the measurement and which allow an evaluation of the variance of the data . two thirds of the spots on the array of slide # <dig> are randomly replicated. the array was scanned using the ls mode . we observed a large decrease in the standard deviation of the log-ratios   of replicated spots when the number of acquisitions used for averaging increased, whatever the class of intensity. within a series, the deviation between the log-ratio values attained  <dig>  or  <dig> . the majority of the log-ratio values  vary from - <dig> to + <dig>  so these observed deviations are high. we observed that 8% of the duplicated spots were significantly different  but only 1/ <dig> of them are "outlier" spots, either in f <dig> or f <dig>  this percentage decreases to only 1% after averaging  <dig> acquisitions and remains at 1% after averaging  <dig> acquisitions. as noted previously, in the majority of the analyses, weak spots are often filtered. this leads to the elimination from the analysis of potentially interesting genes  <cit> . decreasing of the log2-ratio variability of the intra-array replicates has, as a direct consequence, the reduction of the inter-array log2-ratio variability. we have shown that this reduction of variability exists for spots with weak intensities and, thus, the genes having low levels of expression in one of the conditions to be compared can be detected better.

discussion
the observed signal intensity of the array results from several parameters extending from the hybridization of the target and the probe to the scanning. using an axon 4000b scanner, we have demonstrated that the behaviours of the spots on an array are not identical. some spots display more fluctuations than others and, moreover, the green and the red dyes do not have the same behaviour.

our results show that, for a series of successive scans, the decrease of the signal is weak but irregular. the variation in intensities involves many spots and is higher for the red channel as opposed to the green channel. the variation increases with increasing pmt gain and is higher for the lower intensity signals. thus, when the gain is increased, the detection of spots is improved but the fluctuations of the signals increases. these observations suggest that scanning should be performed with moderate pmt settings. however, this is in opposition to the need for finding and measuring accurately the intensities of spots in all of the intensity classes and, particularly, in the low intensity classes. considering this paradox, a good compromise would be to scan arrays with the highest pmt setting for which there are no "saturated" spots. however, to increase spot detection, different authors have proposed combining scans at low and high pmt settings  <cit>  and/or using a method to calibrate dye biases  <cit> . at high pmt settings, red signal values are more variable so their log2-ratios are less accurate. we propose an alternative protocol consisting of averaging  <dig>  consecutive scans. we show that the fluctuation of the signal decreases when the number of scans averaged increases from  <dig> to  <dig> . moreover, the effect of the averaging is most marked for the spots having low intensities.

we found that the fluctuations of the signal are due mainly to a strong texture in the spot  or, sometimes, to its border, which presents variations greater than the other pixels in the spot. this is especially true when the spots have irregular contours and are segmented with the adaptive circle method. the border of the circle delimiting the spot contains pixels both of the background and of the signal. it might be assumed that, if the circle is completely inside the spot, the number of "outlier" spots would be reduced. but this is not what is observed. indeed, by reducing the circle size, the number of pixels per spot decreases and the median, computed from all the pixels of the spot, is then less robust. since the "outlier" spots, are less homogeneous than the other spots, the averages of several consecutive acquisitions will decrease this texture. the number of pixels depends directly on the scanning resolution and, as a consequence, the texture, too. thus, the signal fluctuation is higher at  <dig> microns resolution than at  <dig> microns. consequently, the average of  <dig> or  <dig> consecutive scans has a greater effect on arrays scanned at  <dig> microns resolution.

the aim of the method published by romualdi et al  <cit>  is to reduce the high variability among pixels in the same spot. they stacked  <dig> consecutive acquisitions of the same array to increase the homogeneity of the pixels in the spots. thus, this method allows enhancement of the detection of differentially expressed genes. however, it cannot be used practically because it is difficult to implement. our method, which consists of averaging two or three acquisitions, is based on the same principle, but it is easier to perform, particularly on the axon scanner where the ls mode can be executed automatically. even when a scanner does not offer this functionality, averaging two or three independent, consecutive acquisitions of the same array leads to a similar result. but, in this case, it is essential that, before averaging, the consecutive acquisitions are aligned at a sub-pixel level  <cit> . as shown previously, the photo-bleaching is very low and homogeneous for all spots, therefore, it is not necessary to adjust the medians between consecutive scans before averaging them.

finally, we show that averaging scans leads to a decrease in the variability of the signal of replicate spots and, in particular, that of low intensity spots. the confidence in the values of the weak signals is thus improved, increasing the threshold of the signal/noise ratio and, consequently, allowing the retention of many more weak spots for analysis.

we also found that averaging leads to a decrease in the standard deviation of the m value of replicate spots. biological and/or technical repeats with less variation will have improved detection of differentially expressed genes. since weak spots are affected by the reduction of the standard deviation of the m value of the replicates, this will lead to an improvement in the detection of genes having very low levels of expression in one of the experimental conditions being compared.

CONCLUSIONS
by using series of scans of arrays at different pmt settings and by precisely aligning the images, we have evaluated the signal fluctuations from one scan to the next. we established that the variation in the signals is related to several parameters: the resolution, the values of the settings, the dye, the chemistry of the slide and the intensity of the spot itself. we also demonstrated that these fluctuations can be reduced by averaging scans; in this case, the heterogeneities of the spots and the standard deviation of the replicates are reduced. moreover, the diminution of signal fluctuation leads to more accurate results, especially in the case of weak spots.

finally, we recommend scanning at moderate pmt gains and averaging two  scans to increase the reliability of the fluorescence signal. in some scanners this can be done easily by using the "ls mode" or it can be done afterward. for this purpose, a program for image alignment at sub-pixel levels and for averaging is freely available on our web-site .
