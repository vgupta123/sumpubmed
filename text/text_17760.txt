BACKGROUND
the origin of spliceosomal introns – "extra" dna sequences that disrupt the coding regions in nuclear genes of eukaryotes – is still a mystery. since the evolution of introns is closely related to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, understanding the origin of introns is vital for understanding the evolution of eukaryotes. there are currently two opposing theories of intron origin. the introns-early theory proposes that introns already existed at the progenote  to facilitate the construction of the first genes  <cit> . the introns-late theory, on the other hand, holds that genes at the progenote were intronless, similar to those in present-day prokaryotes, and introns were gained late, after the emergence of eukaryotes  <cit> . there has been no decisive resolution to the debate, and each of these theories has supporting arguments that have not been satisfactorily disproved.

introns can be located in one of three phases: phase- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> introns are defined as introns located before the first, after the first, and after the second nucleotide of a codon, respectively. the phase of an intron is conserved during evolution, because a variation in intron phase is possible only through simultaneous mutations that alter the 5' and 3' ends of the intron in a complementary manner  <cit> . the distribution of intron phases is non-uniform: phase- <dig> introns occur most frequently and phase- <dig> introns occur least frequently  <cit> .

the introns-early theory explains the non-uniform distribution by speculating that 35% of modern introns are ancient, i.e., existed at the progenote to facilitate the assembly of the first genes  <cit> . since exons are remnants of primordial minigenes, most of these ancient introns must lie in phase- <dig>  resulting in the current excess of phase- <dig> introns. however, this theory does not satisfactorily explain why phase- <dig> introns are more common than phase- <dig> introns. in contrast, the introns-late theory proposes that the nonuniformity of intron phase distribution may have arisen from nonrandom intron insertion  <cit> . introns have been proposed to be inserted only into a fixed sequence pattern, termed a "proto-splice site"  <cit> . several potential patterns for proto-splice sites have been proposed, for example mag|r  <cit> ; g|g, ag|g, ag|gt  <cit> ; and mag|gt  <cit> .  however, there is still no clear evidence that the observed distributions of intron phase are caused by intron insertions  <cit> .

in this paper, we tested the introns-early and introns-late theories using two independent approaches:  by inferring the evolution of intron phase distribution and  by retesting whether intron phase distribution reflects the nonrandomness of intron insertions. the results show that there is a general trend over evolution toward increasing the preponderance of phase- <dig> introns and that the observed phase distribution of introns can be indeed explained by an intron insertion model. consequently, our results seem to support the explanation provided by the introns-late theory for the nonuniformity of intron phase distribution.

RESULTS
inference of the evolution of intron phase distribution
compilation of a genome-wide dataset
in order to test the introns-late prediction that intron phase distribution is non-uniform, we compiled a dataset from the entire genomes of  <dig> eukaryotes . these  <dig> species were chosen because they cover a broad range of evolutionary distance and their genomes are well annotated. in this dataset, the average number of introns per gene varies from  <dig>  in schizosaccharomyces pombe to  <dig>  in homo sapiens. the gc content of the coding regions in the genomes ranges from 24% in plasmodium falciparum to 56% in neurospora crassa, and the distribution of phase- <dig> introns ranges from  <dig> % in n. crassa to  <dig> % in a. thaliana. in all species the intron phase distributions show an obvious pattern of phase- <dig> > phase- <dig> > phase-2; the only exception is a. thaliana, in which the distribution of phase- <dig> introns is slightly larger than that of phase- <dig> introns. these results are consistent with previously published results .

the  <dig> eukaryotes are arranged in descending order of gc contents  from top to bottom. p- <dig>  phase-0; p- <dig>  phase-1; p- <dig>  phase- <dig> 

prediction of intron phase distribution for the all-pattern model
inference of the gc content and intron density in the rp gene dataset
to test our speculation that the prediction errors were due to high mutation rates, we compiled a smaller dataset containing  <dig> orthologs of ribosomal protein  genes from four species: a. thaliana, oryza sativa, chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and h. sapiens, and inferred the evolution of gc content and intron density . the three plant species were chosen because a. thaliana had the largest prediction error using the all-pattern model . the outgroup h. sapiens was chosen due to its nearly neutral  gc content and its high density of introns. the analysis indicated that 98% of a. thaliana introns already existed in its last common ancestor with o. sativa, and the inferred gc content for this ancestor was 54%. the result suggests that the large reduction in gc content  in a. thaliana is likely to be the main cause for its large prediction error.  it is possible that when introns are inserted, the exon junctions surrounding introns are subjected to a much lower mutation rate than the average mutation rate in the genes of fast-evolving species due to the need for efficient splicing. consequently, the intron phase distributions predicted using current sequences in fast-evolving species would not match the observed data.

prediction of intron phase distribution with mutation correction
to accommodate this source of error in fast-evolving species, we proposed a simple model for mutation correction and used it to re-predict the intron phase distributions for all species in the genome-wide dataset . the best mutation rates , the corresponding gc contents, the predicted intron phase distributions, the prediction errors, and the standard deviations for all species are provided in table  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the differences between the predicted intron phase distributions and the observed ones were now not statistically significant  for h. sapiens, n. crassa, fusarium graminearum, cryptococcus neoformans, a. thaliana, and x. tropicalis. there are several lines of evidence for the validity of our mutation correction model. first, for a. thaliana, the gc content at the best mutation rate was  <dig> % , a value very close to the inferred 54% of the last common ancestor of a. thaliana and o. sativa in the  <dig> orthologs of rp genes . it is possible that this value was the average gc content of a. thaliana during the period when most of its introns were gained. second, the best prediction errors and gc contents of h. sapiens and x. tropicalis were close to each other, in agreement with the fact that most h. sapiens introns are shared with those of x. tropicalis and their divergence is quite recent .  third, the inferred best gc contents of the two other animals: d. melanogaster and c. elegans were also very close to those of h. sapiens and x. tropicalis. finally, our result suggests that the human genome is evolving toward decreasing its gc content, consistent with the result of meunier and duret  <cit> .

discussion
the introns-early theory explains the excess of phase- <dig> introns by predicting that a fraction of present-day introns are ancient and these introns were in phase- <dig>  if this explanation is correct, the excess of phase- <dig> introns should generally decrease during eukaryotic evolution as new introns are inserted into random positions. a direct test of the explanation of the introns-early theory for the excess of phase- <dig> introns is therefore to infer the evolution of intron phase distribution from observed data. this test was first performed by roy et al.  <cit> . using a dataset of  <dig> ancient genes , they divided the present-day introns into two categories: lineage-specific introns and widely phylogenetically distributed introns, which are thought to be rough estimates of recently gained introns and ancestral introns, respectively. they found that the presumed ancestral introns had a stronger phase- <dig> bias than the lineage-specific introns . in contrast, our results  show a general trend over evolution toward an increase in the excess of phase- <dig> introns. we believe that this discrepancy is more likely due to different datasets than to different classification methods because when a classification method similar to that used in ref.  <cit>  was applied to the current dataset, a stronger phase- <dig> bias in lineage-specific introns was obtained  <cit> . another reason for this discrepancy may be that all of the  <dig> gene families in the dataset used in ref.  <cit>  are ancient, and these gene families may show a different pattern of evolution of intron phase distribution than younger gene families. however, when we used a smaller dataset of  <dig> rp gene families – all of which are believed to be ancient – from the same seven species studied here  <cit> , the result was still inconsistent with that in ref.  <cit>  .

sverdlov et al.  <cit>  suggested that the stronger phase- <dig> bias in lineage-specific introns than in widely distributed introns refuted the explanation of the introns-early hypothesis. however, it should be stressed that this conclusion cannot always be drawn from this result: the explanation of introns-early may still be correct even when lineage-specific introns have stronger phase- <dig> bias than widely distributed introns. consider the following example: suppose a species has  <dig> current introns with a phase distribution of 100:50: <dig>  and  <dig> of these are widely distributed introns with a phase distribution of 40:30: <dig>  therefore, the species also has  <dig> lineage-specific introns with a phase distribution of 60:20: <dig>  we suppose further that all  <dig> lineage-specific introns were gained recently and there are also  <dig> introns specific to this species that have been lost. if the phase distribution of the lost introns is 40:30: <dig>  the phase distribution of ancestral introns will be 80:60: <dig>  which has less phase- <dig> bias than the current introns. however, if the phase distribution of lost introns is 80:10: <dig>  the phase distribution of ancestral introns will be 120:40: <dig>  which has more phase- <dig> bias than the current introns. thus, no decisive conclusion can be reached by comparing intron phase distributions between lineage-specific introns and widely distributed introns. in contrast, by using the maximum likelihood method to infer a set of most reliable events , we were able to estimate the intron phase distribution at each ancestral node.

our result for the evolution of intron phase distribution suggests that the excess of phase- <dig> introns is more likely to be caused by the nonrandomness of intron gains. however, all previous studies failed to prove this at a satisfactory level  <cit> . therefore, we decided to re-test this prediction on a large scale using genome-wide data from  <dig> model species. we first used the fixed-pattern intron insertion model, in which introns are inserted only into proto-splice sites, and our experimental results  were consistent with previous results  <cit> , in which the intron phase distributions predicted from the distributions of four potential proto-splice sites  did not match the observed ones.

another model of intron insertion has been proposed in which introns are either randomly inserted into sequences but with different rates of fixation or are preferentially inserted into a consensus sequence  <cit> . we therefore tested the all-pattern intron insertion model, in which introns can be inserted into any pattern of sequences but are inserted into different patterns with different frequencies. since the frequencies of intron insertion may vary from species to species, these frequencies were obtained from the observed data separately for each species. the results  show that the model predicted intron phase distributions well in gc-rich species but not in gc-poor species. analysis of a smaller dataset of  <dig> orthologs of rp genes shows that higher mutation rates are very likely the main cause for the higher prediction errors in gc-poor species . therefore, we proposed a simple model for mutation correction and used it to predict intron phase distributions for all species again. as expected, the predicted intron phase distributions now matched the observed data for both gc-rich and gc-poor species, with differences in six out of ten species that were not statistically significant .

although the predicted intron phase distributions of four remaining species  account quite well for the observed distributions , their differences were still statistically significant. it is possible that the assumption of not changing amino acid sequences in our mutation correction model did not fully compensate for the mutation effect in s. pombe and p. falciparum, as they have very low gc contents. the larger errors in d. melanogaster and c. elegans may be partly due to the nonuniformity of intron losses, because both species suffered from high rates of intron loss after their divergence from h. sapiens  <cit> . moreover, since other factors such as annotation mistakes on exon/intron structures may also affect the results, we should not put too much weight on statistical tests. therefore, we conclude that the all-pattern intron insertion model may explain intron phase distributions even when statistical equivalence is not reached.

the intron phase distributions are lineage-specific and may be affected by two factors: changes in dna sequences and changes in intron insertion frequencies. the latter may reflect changes in the efficiency with which the splicing machinery splices out introns. when the intron insertion frequencies learned from h. sapiens were used to predict n. crassa sequences, the predicted intron phase distribution was 44:32: <dig>  much closer to the distribution observed in h. sapiens  than in n. crassa . this indicates that the change in intron insertion frequencies has stronger effect on the intron phase distribution than the change in dna sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
the debate surrounding introns-early versus introns-late remains vigorous  <cit> . we previously provided two lines of support for the introns-late view: there is no general trend over evolution toward decreasing intron density ; and there was no clear case of intron position conservation in a set of  <dig> cytoplasmic rp genes of archaeal origin and mitochondrial rp genes of bacterial origin, which are thought to have diverged at the progenote  <cit> . in this paper, we have provided two more lines of support for introns-late from analyses of intron phase distribution: the current excess of phase- <dig> introns is due to the excess of phase- <dig> among gained introns and not to the remnants of minigenes; and the all-pattern intron insertion model can explain the observed intron phase distributions in various species. these results should help to resolve the long-standing but important debate about the origin of spliceosomal introns.
