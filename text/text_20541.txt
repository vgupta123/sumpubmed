BACKGROUND
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  is a non-invasive tool for brain stimulation and is able to modulate brain activity beyond stimulation  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying these long-term rtms-effects could be analogous to long-term potentiation  or depression . these rtms-induced changes in cortical excitability and brain activity can be measured by different tms-protocols. furthermore, rtms is capable to influence task performance and learning processes. for example, it can improve motor learning  <cit> . the induced effects depends on different parameters like coil orientation, total number of pulses and frequency.

for the measurement of rtms-induced changes of cortical excitability, a single-pulse tms  protocol called “stimulus response curve”  is used. it tests stimulus intensity-dependent recruitment of corticospinal projections by means of sptms  <cit> . the steepness of the linear regression line through the data points of the src is a measure of corticospinal excitability  <cit> . special paired-pulse tms  protocols can determine intracortical facilitation  and short-latency intracortical inhibition   <cit> . the normalized icf and sici ratios give information about the activity of excitatory and inhibitory intracortical interneuronal circuits  <cit> .

despite clear effects of rtms on cortical excitability, identifying consistent effects of rtms on sensorimotor learning has proven more difficult. many experiments have found no changes in motor learning after high frequency rtms in healthy humans, while others showed only mild effects  <cit> . short lasting improvements, however, could be elicited using a combination of finger tapping task and 10 hz rtms  <cit> .

under these difficult circumstances and to get insight of the physiology of learning processes, numerous studies have used pharmacological interventions  <cit> . there are several studies on the effect of the positive allosteric modulators of the gabaa receptors, i. e. benzodiazepines  <cit> . for example, di lazzaro and coworkers investigated the influence of lorazepam on the excitability on human motor cortex. they could demonstrate by means of single and paired-pulse tms that lorazepam depress high-amplitude motor-evoked potentials  and increases the excitability of inhibitory circuits  <cit> . moreover, it could be demonstrated that this interference with the gabaa-system can reduce learning and use-dependent plastic changes  <cit> . similar changes in excitability could be demonstrated by schwenkreis and coworkers with the glutamate antagonist riluzole and the nmda antagonist memantine  <cit> . both agents reduce intracortical facilitation and increase intracortical inhibition. similar to the observations of butefisch for lorazepam, it was demonstrated that riluzole and memantine were capable to block use-dependent plasticity in motor cortex.

looking for pharmacological interventions that lead to facilitative effects and might boost learning processes, the influence of norepinephrine  agonists like amphetamine , methyphenidate , reboxetine  and atomoxetine  were investigated. mph, rbx and atx increase icf and decrease sici measured by paired-pulse tms after a single dosage  <cit> . moreover, plewnia and tegenthoff investigated the modulation of use-dependent plasticity in primary motor cortex . rbx and amp were able to enhance training-induced motor cortex plasticity  <cit> . all these studies clearly show that ne plays a crucial role in promoting plasticity. especially, atx affects the regulation of ne as a highly selective inhibitor of the presynaptic ne transporter with low affinity for other transmitters  <cit>  whereas amp and mph act as indirect ne and dopamine agonists.

considering these facts, a combination of rtms and atx would be a promising intervention that might lead to clear learning effects. so far, there are no placebo-controlled studies on the influence of atx and rtms on cortical excitability and motor learning. moreover, it has not been investigated if a subsequent high frequency rtms can further increase excitability and motor learning. here, we used a sequential 4-finger tapping/10 hz rtms combination paradigm previously introduced by kim and coworkers  <cit>  combined with atx or placebo intake in order to evaluate the effect of atomoxetine and rtms on motor cortex plasticity and motor learning in humans. previous studies generally used neuropharmacological modulation only. here, we were particularly interested in possible interactional effects of both treatment regimens. we therefore administered placebo or atx and real rtms or sham rtms in a randomized double-blind study. we hypothesized that the combination of atx and 10 hz rtms over m <dig> is capable of increasing excitability and motor learning, and that they might have synergistic effects.

RESULTS
participants
there were no significant differences in sex  or age  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). blood samples were taken from all participants approximately 1 hour and 2 hours after atx or placebo  intake. the average atx blood serum levels in both atx-groups were  <dig>  ng/ml after 1 hour and  <dig>  ng/ml after 2 hours after drug intake. four subjects reported about temporary headache beginning 12 hours after the experiment and persisted about  <dig> to 4 hours. we could not distinguish if these symptoms derived from atx or rtms-intervention.

excitability measurements
considering the slopes of the srcs, repeated measurement analysis of variance  showed a significant effect of the within-subject factor “time”  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). there was no effect of the between-subject factor “group”  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) or the interaction “time x group”  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). post-hoc paired t-tests revealed significantly increased slopes from t <dig>  to t <dig> , from t <dig> to t <dig>  and from t <dig> to t <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; mean slope differenceΔt3t2 =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; mean slope difference Δt3t1 =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , t =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ).

atx-induced excitability changes between t <dig> and t <dig>  being before rtms intervention, were further assessed by pooling the results of the  <dig> atx-groups and the  <dig> placebo -groups. looking at the slope, rmanova with within-subject factor “time” and between-subject factor “group” revealed a significant effect of the factor “time”  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), of the interaction between “time” and “group”  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and of the factor “group”  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ), indicating a greater increase in slope in the atx-groups as compared to the plc-groups. for a better overview, figure  <dig> shows the mean mep-differences of atx- and plc-groups between t <dig> and t <dig>  for all  <dig> stimulation intensities.

analyzing the sici-ratio data, rmanova revealed a significant effect of the within-subject factor “time”  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), no significant effect of the between-subject factor “group”  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) and no interaction between “time x group”  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). post-hoc t-test showed a significant difference between t <dig> and t <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). the other comparisons were not significant  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; t <dig> vs. t3: t =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

rmanova of the icf-ratio data showed a significant effect of the within-subject factor “time”  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). furthermore, a significant interaction between the factor “time” and the between-subject factor “group” could be demonstrated  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). the between-subject factor “group” revealed no significant effect  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). post-hoc t-test showed a significant increase of the icf-ratio 1 hour after drug intake in both atx-groups . icf-ratio increased further in the atx + real-rtms-group after motor training and 10 hz rtms . this could not be demonstrated for the atx + sham-rtms-group. mean icf-ratio differences∆t2t <dig>  ∆t3t <dig> and ∆t3t <dig> and corresponding p-values are shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>

no effect of either atx or rtms could be shown for rmt  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; between-subject factor “group”: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; interaction “time x group”: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ).

discussion
our study yielded three major findings. first, atx led to a significant increase of corticospinal and intracortical excitability in m <dig> one hour after intake of 60 mg atx . second, high frequency 10 hz rtms applied over m <dig> during a finger tapping motor task was capable of further increasing intracortical excitability significantly, but only in combination with 60 mg atx . third, only the combination of atx and 10 hz rtms significantly improved motor learning with regard to target score and execution time .

atx led to a significant increase of corticospinal and intracortical excitability in m1
we could reproduce the facilitative effects of atx on cortical excitability in m <dig> as had been previously shown by gilbert and coworkers  <cit> . in contrast, we did not see a significant atx-induced m <dig> disinhibition. the reduction of intracortical inhibition between the beginning and end of the study  did not depend on the group, i.e. on the type of intervention. similar effects of ne on m <dig> excitability could be demonstrated for the ne reuptake inhibitor reboxetine. plewnia and coworkers  <cit>  showed enhanced corticospinal and intracortical excitability and improved motor skills in healthy subjects suggesting that this is an effect of ne reuptake inhibitors. this assumption could not be verified by foster and coworkers  <cit> . they found no improvement of motor learning after intake of the ne reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine compared to atx  <cit> . they concluded that the affinity to other transmitters like serotonin and the lower dosage and the higher rate of adverse effects of venlafaxine might have led to contradictory results.

high frequency 10 hz rtms applied over m <dig> during a finger tapping motor task was capable of further increasing intracortical excitability significantly, but only in combination with atx
in our study, we wanted to extend the approach of neuropharmacological modulation of cortical activity and its use-dependent plasticity by additionally applying 10 hz rtms. our rtms paradigm itself had no significant facilitative effects on excitability parameters. this might be due to the low number of total tms-pulses . it is well known that rtms effects depend on the number of total pulses, frequency and stimulation intensity  <cit> . interestingly, we could see a further increase in excitability only in combination with 60 mg atx . this suggests that a premedication with atx is capable of facilitating the effects of a low pulse number rtms protocol. homeostatic plasticity did not play a role in this study. following the concept of homeostatic plasticity, we would have expected that the enhancement of motor cortex excitability induced by atx favors the induction of synaptic depression by the subsequent 10 hz rtms-stimulation and motor task that themselves would induce ltp-like plasticity. cortical ltp and ltd are typically mediated by nmda-receptor activation  <cit> . one reason, why we could not see homeoplastic effects is that our 1st intervention  had no effect on nmda-receptors but on ne-receptors. all classic homeostatic plasticity protocols combine rtms, transcranial direct current stimulation  or paired-associative stimulation protocols that typically involves nmda-receptors  <cit> , for example 1 hz rtms with cathodal tdcs  <cit> .

instead of homeostatic effects, a synergistic effect of atx and rtms was observed. the sum of gain in excitability in the atx + 10 hz rtms group could not be explained by the single effects of atx and 10 hz rtms. because higher cortical excitability is a precondition for neuronal plasticity and improved learning process, this finding might be closely related to the fact that we observed improved motor learning only after combining both interventions. the significant increase in icf-ratio in the plc + sham-rtms condition could be explained by the motor task itself  <cit> .

only the combination of atx and 10 hz rtms improved motor learning and execution time significantly
looking at the motor task data, significant higher ts and tset ratio and shorter et could only be seen in the verum-verum-condition, i. e. atx + real-rtms group. there was no significant interaction between time and group. graphically, the ts, et and tset curves are shifted in a parallel fashion. this indicates that the superiority of the atx + real-rtms group was not based upon a different effect on motor learning itself but upon a better performance at the beginning of the motor task due to higher cortical excitability as previously mentioned. another reason might be the well known atx effects in promoting wakening and arousal  <cit> . in contrast to the results of kim and coworkers  <cit> , we did not observe higher ts for the plc + real-rtms group compared to the plc + sham-rtms. this may be due to our modified and easier motor task, which could have prevented smaller differences in learning to become visible.

considering detail of our motor task, we decided to choose the non-dominant hand and according non-dominant hemisphere  for motor task, excitability measurements and rtms-intervention because we wanted to avoid a ceiling effect  <cit> . we did not test the excitability parameters of the contralateral hemisphere and motor learning of the contralateral hand. thus, previous studies could demonstrate that there is a hemispheric asymmetry of corticospinal activation with a higher mep facilitation for the non-dominant  hemisphere  <cit> . brouwer et al. showed that this different level of excitation is not related to speed or dexterity of finger movements. relating to our study, we would expect similar facilitative effects of atx and rtms on dominant hemisphere. we also can purpose that there were differences in levels of cortical excitability between hemispheres not only in baseline but also later in postinterventional measurements. but according to brouwer’s results, these differences had no relation to differences in motor performance between both hands.

interestingly, motor learning was not affected by atx or 10 hz rtms alone. according to the subtraction method devised by donders <cit> , the entire effects on ts or et should be explained by the cooperativity of the atx and rtms effects. applying this method, a factor “x” remains which cannot be explained by the separate atx and rtms effects . this kind of synergistic effect “atx x rtms” indicates nonlinear interaction between both components. the neuronal basis of this interaction, however, remains unclear. high frequency rtms activates the motor network including premotor cortex, supplemental motor area and ipsilateral primary motor cortex, and increases effective connectivity between these areas  <cit> . the finger tapping task itself activates a similar system including contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, bilateral secondary somatosensory areas and basal ganglia and ipsilateral cerebellum  <cit> . in addition, atx leads to significant increase of activity in error signaling forebrain areas like bilateral inferior frontal cortex and pre-supplementary motor cortex, increasing neural sensitivity for errors in healthy humans  <cit> .

therefore, the combination of more effective synaptic transmission within the motor system along with higher cognitive/behavioral sensitivity may have led to the synergistic effect of 10 hz rtms and atx seen in our study. it could also explain the failure of atx or 10 hz rtms alone to be effective.

pharmacological interventions and rtms
studies combining rtms and neuropharmacological intervention were usually undertaken to investigate the role of transmitters in the induction of rtms after-effects and not to boost performance like we did in our study. huang et al. combined a specialized rtms-protocol called theta-burst-stimulation  with the nmda receptor antagonist memantine  <cit> . they found that, on one hand, memantine inhibited the facilitatory effect of intermittent tbs  on mep amplitudes. on the other hand, it blocked the suppressive effect of continuous . teo et al. used the nmda receptor coagonist d-cycloserine that acts at the glycine site of the nmda receptor. they found that it reversed the aftereffect of itbs from facilitation to inhibition  <cit> . lang et al. performed a 1 hz rtms study using the dopamine receptor agonist pergolide and found that the suppression of corticospinal excitability by rtms was more pronounced after drug intake compared to placebo  <cit> . these results show in general that nmda and dopaminergic receptors play a role in the induction of rtms effects.

so far, no study has been undertaken to investigate adrenergic influences on rtms effects. furthermore, we have not found any study that considers the combination of pharmacological intervention, rtms and motor learning. in this case, we describe synergistic effects between rtms and pharmacological modulation for the first time.

limitations
considering some limitations of our study, we surely have to mention the relative low number of subject per group . furthermore, we did not choose a cross-over design, which would have allowed intra-subjects comparison. a cross-over design would have had advantageous for the interpretation of the results, rendering out biases that comes from inter-individual variability of cortical excitability, partly determined by brain morphology  <cit> .

moreover, one might argue that the use of circular coil for excitability measurement does not extract reliable measures compared to a figure-of-eight coil. ugawa et al. could demonstrate no different results between figure-of-eight coil over left hand motor area and circular coil over vertex for the determination of corticocortical facilitation and inhibition  <cit> . moreover, in our tms-studies, we prefer the use of the circular coil. we could see stable results and the positioning of this coil is less critical  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies could show that high frequency rtms and atx are capable to modulate cortical plasticity and to improve motor learning  <cit> . possible interaction effects have never been investigated. in the present study, we could show that the combination of a pharmacologically-induced increase in ne transmission and 10 hz rtms exerts synergistic effects on cortical excitability and motor learning in healthy humans.

this could be a promising approach to improve motor learning in patients with neurological disorders like stroke, traumatic brain injury and neuromuscular diseases . especially, it would be interesting to investigate the development and consolidation of neuronal plasticity effects in primary motor cortex when rtms and atx were administered over several days. furthermore, it remains unclear if such effects would be seen with other facilitative drugs like modafinil or amantadine or in combination with other brain stimulation protocols like tdcs and tbs.
