BACKGROUND
cannabinoid receptors are members of the g protein-coupled receptor superfamily  <cit> . two cannabinoid receptors, cb <dig> and cb <dig>  have been pharmacologically identified. cb <dig> and cb <dig> receptors modulate several downstream signaling pathways including the inhibition of intracellular cyclic amp accumulation, stimulation of map kinase activity and modulation of potassium and calcium channel activities  <cit> . the fatty acid derivative anandamide was isolated from porcine brain tissue, found to compete for cannabinoid receptor binding and identified as the first endogenous cannabinoid  <cit> . other endogenous ligands have been identified, including 2-arachidonylglycerol  <cit>  and archidonylglycerol ether  <cit> . anandamide administration leads to a number of pharmacological effects that are similar in nature to thc  <cit> . as components of the endocannabinoid system have been identified, pharmacological opportunities to modulate the system and effect therapeutic change have been increasingly explored.

the observation that cb <dig> receptor antagonists may be useful as drugs for the management of obesity and metabolic disease was made in  <dig> when aronne and colleagues reported that sr141716a  selectively inhibited sucrose consumption relative to normal chow consumption in male rats  <cit> . since this observation, rimonabant has been used extensively in preclinical and clinical settings to define the role of the endocannabinoid system in appetitive  behaviors  <cit> , and more broadly to understand the role of the endocannabinoid system in regulation of energy balance  <cit> . it was hoped that brain-penetrant cb <dig> r antagonists might provide effective therapeutic options for the management of metabolic disorders, such as obesity. several cb <dig> receptor inverse agonists/antagonists were recently withdrawn from the market or clinical development including the diarylpyrazole rimonabant or sr141716a  <cit> , the acyclic amide taranabant  <cit> , cp- <dig>  <cit> , and ce- <dig>  the focus of the present work.

we previously reported that ce- <dig> is efficacious in a model of parkinsonism  <cit> . the results suggested that selective cannabinoid cb <dig> antagonism may enhance the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa and other dopaminomimetics. we herein report the in vitro and in vivo quantitative pharmacological evaluation of ce- <dig>  a highly selective and potent cb <dig> receptor antagonist with inverse agonist properties. furthermore, we demonstrate that ce- <dig> is efficacious in preclinical acute and chronic models of fi, energy expenditure and body weight regulation.

methods
reagents
human cb <dig> and cb <dig> receptor cdnas in pcdna <dig>  and/or cell lines were the generous gift of dr. debra kendall . the sequences of the receptors were confirmed and are the predominant splice variants. ce- <dig>  <cit> , cp- <dig> -4-cyclohexan-1-ol] were synthesized at pfizer global research and development, groton, ct. cp <dig>   and gtpγ were purchased from perkin elmer life sciences . sr141716a  was purchased from amersham pharmacia .

cb <dig> and cb <dig> receptors and membrane preparations
hek <dig>  or cho  cells  were stably transfected with the human cb <dig> or cb <dig> receptors. rat brain, and recombinant cb <dig> and cb <dig> and membranes were prepared as described  <cit> . a pierce™ bca kit was used to determine protein concentrations.

radioligand binding assays
radioligand binding of ce- <dig> to cb <dig> and cb <dig> receptors were performed as described  <cit> . cp- <dig> was diluted in drug buffer  and then  <dig> μl was added to each well of a 96-well polypropylene plate. sr141716a was diluted in a ligand buffer  and  <dig> μl was added to the plate.  <dig> μg of membranes per well from human cb <dig> and cb  <dig> receptor transfected cells and rat brain was used in the assay. the plates were covered and placed in an incubator at 30°c for  <dig> min. at the end of the incubation period  <dig> μl of stop buffer  was added to the reaction plate. the plates were then harvested onto gf/c filter plates  presoaked in bsa  plus tme. each filter was washed twice with tme and dried overnight. in the morning the filters were counted on a wallac trilux™ counter.

gtpγ binding assays at cb <dig> receptors
gtpγ binding assays were performed as described  <cit> . gtpγ binding assays were performed in a 96-well flashplate™ format in duplicate using  <dig> pm gtpγ and  <dig> μg membrane per well in assay buffer composed of  <dig> mm tris hcl ;  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> ;  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm egta,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> μm gdp,  <dig> % bsa and the following protease inhibitors:  <dig> μg/ml bacitracin,  <dig> μg/ml benzamidine,  <dig> μg/ml aprotinin, and  <dig> μg/ml leupeptin. the assay mix was incubated with increasing concentrations of antagonist  for  <dig> min and challenged with the cannabinoid agonist cp- <dig>  assays were performed at 30°c for  <dig> hr. the flashplates™ were then centrifuged at 2000×g for  <dig> min. stimulation of gtpγ binding was then quantified using a wallac microbeta®  <cit> .

receptor occupancy studies
an ex vivo brain receptor occupancy assay was used to calculate the in vivo receptor occupancy of ce- <dig> at selected doses. the inhibition of specific binding of sr141716a was assessed for ce- <dig>  brains were removed from the rats  <dig> hr after return of food. brain homogenates were prepared by adding tme buffer to pre-weighed tissue to obtain a working concentration of  <dig> mg/ml, and then homogenizing with a polytron for  <dig> seconds. the homogenate was diluted to a concentration of  <dig> mg/ml using tme buffer. for the receptor occupancy assay,  <dig> μl of the diluted brain homogenate was added to the wells of a 96-well polypropylene plate, together with  <dig> μl of the radioligand sr141716a, . triplicate wells were incubated with  <dig> μl of the cannabinoid agonist cp- <dig>  to determine non-specific binding. for all other wells,  <dig> μl of tme was added, and these wells measured total binding. the plates were then covered and incubated for  <dig> min at room temperature on a plate shaker. reactions were stopped by the addition of  <dig> μl ice cold  <dig> % bsa in tme. the plates were aspirated then harvested onto gf/c filter plates  using ice-cold tme buffer. the filter plates had been pre-soaked in  <dig> μl  <dig> % bsa in tme for  <dig> min. filters were dried at room temperature for  <dig> min, after which  <dig> μl of microscint™  was added to each and the plates analyzed on a microbeta counter. care was taken in our assay to minimize drug-tissue dissociation by comparing binding in a time course and under various conditions. the inhibition of specific sr141716a binding was determined by subtracting the proportion of non-specific binding relative to total binding. experiments were run in triplicate with at least an n =  <dig> for each treatment group.

plasma ce- <dig> measurements
plasma bound fractions for ce- <dig> were determined using an equilibrium dialysis assay, as previously described  <cit> . spectra-por  <dig> membranes  with a molecular cut-off of 12- <dig> kda were used for the dialysis. equilibrium of the system was achieved by incubating the apparatus for  <dig>  hr in a 37°c reciprocating water bath . a standard curve was set up over the range 1- <dig> ng/ml. all samples were quantified using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using a pe sciex api  <dig> spectrometer. for plasma, the unbound fraction was determined as the ratio of concentrations determined in buffer and plasma.

food intake assays
all animal studies were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. male sprague dawley rats on normal chow  were obtained from charles river. after arrival, animals were individually housed and placed on powdered rat chow. rats were maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle and received food and water ad libitum. in all studies ce- <dig> and veh  administration to rats and mice was by oral gavage.

for the fast-induced re-feeding assay, food was removed from the cages the afternoon preceding the test day and the rats were fasted overnight. after the overnight fast, rats were administered veh. or ce- <dig>  food was reintroduced  <dig> min after dosing. food consumption was measured at selected time points as indicated in the figures.

for the spontaneous, nocturnal fi assay, rats were administered veh.  or ce- <dig>  <dig> min prior to the start of the dark phase. food consumption was monitored with electronic scales, and consumption was recorded every  <dig> min for  <dig> hr using an automated fi system .

indirect calorimetry
whole body oxygen consumption was measured using an indirect calorimeter  in male sprague dawley rats. the rats  were placed in the calorimetry chambers and the chambers were placed in activity monitors. all studies were conducted during the light cycle. prior to the measurement of oxygen consumption, the rats were fed standard chow ad libitum. during the measurement of oxygen consumption, food was not provided to the rats. basal, pre-dose oxygen consumption and ambulatory activity were measured every  <dig> min for  <dig>  to  <dig> hr. at the end of the basal pre-dosing period, the chambers were opened and the animals were administered a single dose of compound  by oral gavage. ce- <dig> was prepared in  <dig> % methylcellulose as veh. oxygen consumption and ambulatory activity were measured every  <dig> min for an additional 1- <dig> hr after dosing. resting oxygen consumption, during pre- and post-dosing, was calculated by averaging the 10-min o <dig> consumption values, excluding periods of high ambulatory activity  and excluding the first  <dig> values of the pre-dose period and the first value from the post-dose period. change in oxygen consumption is reported as percent and is calculated by dividing the post-dosing resting oxygen consumption by the pre-dose oxygen consumption . vo <dig>  vco <dig>  rer and locomotor activity were all measured.

four day rat studies
ce- <dig> was evaluated in 4-day chow-fed and dio s-d rat studies. male 12- <dig> week old s-d rats which had been maintained on regular chow were singly housed and acclimated to handling and dosing and two days of food intake were recorded to establish baseline food intake values before dosing was initiated. the animals were randomly sorted and assigned to treatment groups . two studies were performed. in study  <dig>  the mean starting weight of all animals was  <dig> ±  <dig> g. in study  <dig>  the mean starting weight of all animals was  <dig> ±  <dig> g. rats were dosed  with veh. or ce- <dig> according to body weight. fi and bw were recorded daily.

male  <dig> week old s-d rats which had been maintained on a high fat diet  for  <dig> weeks were selected for the dio weight loss study. dio rats were singly housed were acclimated to handling and dosing and two days of food intake were recorded to establish baseline food intake values before dosing was initiated. the heaviest animals were randomly sorted and assigned to treatment groups . the mean starting weight of all animals was  <dig> ±  <dig> g. rats were dosed  with veh. or ce- <dig> according to body weight. fi and bw were recorded daily.

dio mouse study
male,  <dig> week old c57/bl6/6j mice which had been maintained on a high fat diet  for  <dig> weeks were selected for the dio weight loss study. the animals body weights ranged at least  <dig> standard deviations from age-matched chow-fed control animals mean body weight. mice were singly housed. the mean starting weight of all animals was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g. on day  <dig>  mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups . mice were dosed daily over  <dig> days, starting approximately at  <dig> minutes before the start of the  <dig> hr dark cycle. bw and food intake were recorded daily.

calculations and statistical analyses
all calculations of in vitro receptor characterization were completed using graphpad prism™. statistical analyses of in vivo studies were completed using one-way anova for repeated measures. if the overall result achieved statistical significance , then one-way anova was employed for each time point and the results subjected to fisher's plsd . if the conditions of fisher's were met, individual two-tailed t-tests compared the treatment group to the veh.-only control group for statistical significance. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. data were excluded from analysis when increased locomotor activity was recorded. all data shown are the mean ± standard error of the mean  except where noted.

RESULTS
in vitro pharmacology of ce-178253
radioligand binding
the structure of ce- <dig> is displayed in figure  <dig>  saturation and competition radioligand binding assays were used to characterize membranes prepared from human recombinant cb <dig> and cb <dig> and rat brain membranes. sr141716a was used in cb <dig> and rat brain membrane binding assays. cp- <dig> was used in cb <dig> binding assays. in membranes prepared from cho expressing cb <dig> receptors, the kd and bmax of sr141716a were  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  pmoles/mg, respectively. in membranes prepared from hek <dig> expressing cb <dig> receptors, the kd and bmax of sr141716a were  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  pmoles/mg, respectively. in rat membranes prepared from whole brain the kd and bmax of sr141716a were  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  pmoles/mg, respectively. in membranes prepared from cho expressing cb <dig> receptors the kd of and bmax of cp- <dig> were  <dig> nm and  <dig> pmoles/mg, respectively. the binding affinities were determined using sr141716a, at cb <dig> receptors and rat brain membranes and cp- <dig> at cb <dig> receptors. cp- <dig>  and sr141716a  were used in functional assays to characterize the membranes from cells expressing cb <dig> and cb <dig> receptors. inhibition of cp-55940-stimulated gtpγ binding was used to measure antagonist potency and efficacy at human cb <dig> receptors expressed in cho cells. ce- <dig> exhibits both high affinity binding to and functional antagonism of the human cb <dig> receptor expressed in chinese hamster ovary  cells and rat brain cannabinoid receptors .

nd, not determined

the pharmacological properties of ce- <dig>  sr141716a and cp- <dig> were assessed at human cb <dig>  human cb <dig> receptors and rat brain membranes . the intrinsic activity assessed in inverse agonist assay is the percent decrease in basal gtpγ binding.

the binding affinity  of ce- <dig> for the human cb <dig> receptor was  <dig>  nm . complete inhibition of sr141716a binding was observed at concentrations of ce- <dig> greater than  <dig> nm . ce- <dig> is selective for the human cb <dig> receptor subtype over the human cb <dig> receptor subtype , as demonstrated by the >  <dig> -fold difference in the respective binding ki values for these two receptor subtypes.

functional assays
further in vitro functional profiling demonstrated ce- <dig> to exhibit primarily non-competitive cb <dig> receptor antagonist properties and to a lesser degree, competitive antagonism as well. ce- <dig> blocked cp-55940-stimulated gtpγ binding in a concentration-dependent manner. ce- <dig>  is almost five-fold more potent in the gtpγ binding functional assay than in the radioligand binding assay . schild analysis  in the gtpγ assay confirmed a potency similar to that observed in the binding assays . the intrinsic efficacy and potency of cp- <dig> were both decreased by increasing concentrations of ce- <dig>  suggesting that ce- <dig> appears to behave as a mixed competitive and non-competitive antagonist. inverse agonist potency was weaker than functional and binding potencies by  <dig> and 6-fold, respectively   <cit> . function of ce- <dig> was not assessed at cb <dig> receptors because of the weak potency  in binding assays.

activity of ce- <dig> at other sites
ce- <dig> was tested at  <dig> μm concentration for binding affinity at other receptors, ion channels, and uptake sites . ce- <dig> did not exhibit any binding activity  in these assays. based on these data ce- <dig> is greater than 1000-fold selective over the receptors, enzymes and channels that were tested. rimonabant exhibits weak agonist activity at the putative third cannabinoid receptor gpr <dig>  <cit>  with an ec <dig> approximately 500-fold lower than that observed at cb <dig> receptors. no agonist activity was detected with  <dig> μm ce- <dig> at gpr <dig>  rimonabant also binds weakly to the vanilloid  <dig>  receptor channel  <cit> . trpv <dig> was inhibited by 11%  by  <dig> μm ce- <dig>  these data suggest that ce- <dig> does not interact with either trpv <dig> or gpr <dig>  ce- <dig> was not evaluated against trpm <dig>  rimonabant has been reported to bind to trpm <dig>  <cit> .

inhibition ce- <dig> was evaluated for inhibition of binding to the following receptors, channels and sites at  <dig> μm concentration . ce- <dig> did not inhibit binding by > 50% at any site noted in the panel.

in vivo pharmacology of ce-178253
as previously reported, ce- <dig> dose-dependently reversed the effects of the centrally acting cannabinoid agonist cp- <dig> in all four components of the tetrad  <cit> , confirming pharmacological antagonism of central cb <dig> receptor-driven responses.

determination of plasma concentration/effect relationships and brain receptor occupancy of ce- <dig> in acute food intake assays
the in vivo pharmacology of ce- <dig> was evaluated using two models of acute fi: 1) a spontaneous nocturnal feeding paradigm and, 2) an overnight fast-induced refeeding paradigm. quantitative pharmacology was used to establish concentration/effect relationships based on unbound efficacious plasma concentrations, receptor occupancy and fi efficacy.

the first fi model used for determining anorectic efficacy of ce- <dig> was spontaneous nocturnal feeding in rats. in rodents, most feeding activity takes place during the dark phase . in this model, male s-d rats were orally administered compound  <dig> min prior to the onset of the nocturnal phase. ce- <dig> dose-dependently inhibited spontaneous nocturnal fi  as compared to veh.-treated rats. cumulative fi was significantly inhibited  at each hourly time point throughout the dark phase period at each dose tested except at the  <dig>  mg/kg dose at the one hr time point . in addition, the effect of treatment on hourly fi was also assessed. with the exception of the  <dig>  mg/kg 0- <dig> hr interval, ce- <dig>  treatment resulted in a statistically significant decrease in fi through the first four hr compared to veh. no other time points in the interval analysis reach statistical significance. a concentration effect relationship analysis comparing fi reductions to unbound plasma concentrations  using the cumulative fi at  <dig>  post dose confirmed a concentration-dependent reduction in fi wherein the unbound ec <dig> was calculated to be  <dig>  nm . a 25%, 84% and 94% decrease in fi at the three doses  compared to veh. at the  <dig> hr time point was observed. cumulative food intake at the  <dig>  hr time point was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the veh,  <dig>  mg/kg,  <dig> mg/kg,  <dig> mg/kg treated rats, respectively.

administration of ce- <dig> to male s-d rats inhibited overnight fast-induced refeeding. s-d rats were fasted overnight and veh.  or ce- <dig> was administered orally. food was provided to the rats  <dig> min after dosing. food intake was measured  <dig> min and  <dig> hr after return of food. dose- and unbound plasma concentration-dependent decreases in cumulative fi versus veh. were observed  at both time points after return of food. however, the efficacy  was greater in the  <dig> - <dig> hr interval than in the first  <dig>  interval. in contrast, fi efficacy in the dark-phase feeding was consistent throughout the first four hr .

*significantly different from veh. p <  <dig> 

overnight fasted s-d rats were administered veh. , or ce-178253- <dig> p.o. food was returned  <dig> min later. cumulative food consumption was measured  <dig> hr after the return of food.

brain cb <dig> receptor occupancy by ce- <dig>  as estimated by ex vivo binding, was also dose-dependent . the ratios of unbound plasma and total plasma to unbound brain and total brain concentrations were determined at four doses  to assess the brain impairment of ce- <dig>  this analysis is a useful predictor of the free brain concentration of drugs . the mean  of the ratios was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  suggesting that this compound exhibits, little, if any brain impairment. rimonabant exhibits a ratio between  <dig> and  <dig> . these data suggest that a minimum of a 3-fold coverage of the ki  appears to be required for maximal food-intake reduction.

determination of plasma concentration/effect relationships of ce- <dig> in indirect calorimetry studies
indirect calorimetry studies measuring oxygen consumption demonstrated that ce- <dig> increases energy expenditure . oral administration of ce- <dig> at  <dig> mg/kg or  <dig> mg/kg increased average oxygen consumption in s-d rats by 28% and 39%, respectively, between  <dig> and  <dig> hr after dosing. no differences in oxygen consumption of veh.-treated or ce- <dig> treated rats were observed in the first  <dig> hr after dosing . these data are consistent with the tmax of  <dig> hr that is observed in rats given oral ce- <dig> . the respiratory quotient  declined from  <dig>  to  <dig>  over the first hr suggesting a shift from carbohydrate to fat oxidation. a non-statistically significant  increase in locomotor activity was also observed in all treatment groups. though the two studies cannot be compared directly the efficacious unbound plasma concentrations  were similar in both fi and indirect calorimetry studies .

*significantly different from veh. p <  <dig> 

in a separate study, core body temperature was measured in c57bl/6j mice. core body temperature and was found to be increased at the  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg doses by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c  compared to veh, respectively.

weight loss efficacy of ce-178253
chow-fed, lean rats and two animals of obesity, dio rat and dio mouse, were used to evaluate body weight changes in response to ce- <dig> treatment. a preliminary four day study was performed in chow-fed and dio rats and followed up with a ten day study in dio mice.

dio rats were treated once daily with veh.  or ce- <dig> at doses of  <dig>  mg/kg p.o. or  <dig> mg/kg p.o. in a 4-day study . ce- <dig> dose-dependently reduced daily fi . the effects on fi were apparent after the first doses and sustained over the 4-day study period. along with the significant anorectic effect in dio rats, ce- <dig> significantly and dose-dependently reduced body weight over the 4-day study period . a  <dig> % and  <dig> % decrease in body weight was observed at the  <dig>  and  <dig> mg/kg doses compared to veh, respectively. in contrast, there was no change in weight in veh-treated rats. initial and final body weights of veh-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g, respectively. initial and final body weights of  <dig>  mg/kg ce-178253-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g, respectively. initial and final body weights of  <dig> mg/kg ce-178253-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g, respectively. a statistically significant difference in bw between veh and the  <dig> mg/kg dose was observed .

ce- <dig> was also evaluated in chow-fed rats in a  <dig> day fi and bw study. rats were treated once daily with veh.  or ce- <dig>  in the first study the same doses used in the dio study were used to compare fi and bw efficacy. in contrast to the  <dig> day rat dio study the effects of fi and bw were modest suggesting that ce- <dig> is more efficacious in dio than chow-fed rats . ce- <dig> was clearly efficacious in acute food intake studies in chow-fed rats up to  <dig> hours . a comparison of  <dig> hr fi in chow-fed and dio rats yielded different efficacy in response to ce- <dig> treatment. the  <dig> mg/kg dose yielded an 8% decrease in  <dig> hr fi compared to veh-treated animals . ce- <dig> reduced daily fi only on day  <dig> in the high dose group whereas significance was observed in the dio rat study with both low and high doses . no statistically significant differences in bw changes were observed in the  <dig>  and  <dig> mg/kg dosing groups. initial and final body weights of veh-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g , respectively. initial and final body weights of  <dig>  mg/kg ce-178253-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g, respectively. initial and final body weights of  <dig> mg/kg ce-178253-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g, . at  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg  doses, statistically significant decreases in fi and bw were observed. initial and final body weights of veh.-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g , respectively, a 9% gain in bw. initial and final body weights of  <dig> mg/kg ce-178253-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g, respectively, a 2% decline. initial and final body weights of  <dig> mg/kg ce-178253-treated rats were  <dig> ±  <dig> g and  <dig> ±  <dig> g, respectively, 1% increase. as such, the two high dose ce- <dig> groups of prevented weight gain that was observed in the veh.-treated rats. these data suggest that efficacy can be maintained but require a higher dose in chow-fed rats. in pk studies, no differences in exposure were observed between chow-fed and dio rats. thus, as has been reported for other cb <dig> receptor antagonists it is likely that dio rats are more sensitive to the anorectic and weight loss effect of ce- <dig> 

dio mice were treated once daily with veh.  or ce- <dig> at  <dig> mg/kg or  <dig> mg/kg, p.o., in a 10-day study . ce- <dig> significantly and dose-dependently reduced fi over the 10-day study. the lower dose of ce- <dig>  provided for a non-significant 8% reduction in fi, whereas the  <dig> mg/kg dose led to a significant 31% reduction in cumulative fi. as with other cb <dig> receptor antagonists, the food intake reduction was maximal over the first five days and declined over time . however, fi reductions were still evident on the final day of dosing at the high dose. along with the anorectic effect in dio mice, ce- <dig> significantly and dose-dependently reduced body weight over the 10-day study period . the high dose group  lost, on average 18% bw.

discussion
endocannabinoids and their receptors are involved in various centrally and peripherally mediated physiological functions including modulation of appetitive behavior, energy metabolism and energy balance  <cit> . furthermore, endocannabinoids are elevated in obese humans and rodent models of obesity  <cit> , suggesting a link between an activated endocannabinoid system and obesity. the beneficial effects of pharmacological antagonism of the endocannabinoid system to the treatment of human obesity is well supported by pre-clinical experiments and, more directly, the results of human clinical trials with rimonabant have been shown to be effective in achieving weight loss in long-term studies in humans  <cit> . in the present study, we have described the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of a novel, selective, and orally active mixed competitive and non-competitive cb <dig> cannabinoid receptor antagonist identified as ce- <dig> 

cannabinoid receptors selectively couple to the gi family of g proteins  <cit> . ce- <dig> displayed a high affinity for cb <dig> receptor binding , and functional antagonism  that was highly selective  compared to cb <dig> receptors. these in vitro pharmacological properties, along with the observed lack of activity  at a select panel of receptors, enzymes and ion channels, clearly indicate the desired pharmacological properties of a cb <dig> receptor antagonist as present in ce- <dig>  sr141716a  was initially considered to be a silent antagonist , however studies have reported hyperalgesic, stimulant and immunosuppressive effects of this compound, suggesting that it may be an inverse agonist in vivo. in support of these findings, rimonabant has been reported to decrease basal cb <dig> receptor signaling in addition to antagonism of agonist-mediated responses  <cit> . our gtpγ binding results with ce- <dig> further demonstrate that it is also a weak inverse agonist  in vitro at the cb <dig> receptor. the intrinsic inverse agonist potency of ce- <dig> is higher than the efficacious unbound plasma concentration. these data suggest that the observed in vitro inverse agonist efficacy of ce- <dig> is not critical for efficacy. however, discrimination between inverse agonism endocannabinoid tone in vivo is difficult. apparent inverse agonism in vivo may be due to high endocannabinoid tone.

in our pre-clinical assessment of ce- <dig>  we have shown that the compound is efficacious in two models of fi, fast-induced refeeding and spontaneous, nocturnal fi. efficacy in both of these models provides evidence that the compound has significant anorectic activity in rodents consistent with its binding affinity. ce- <dig> appears to be more efficacious in spontaneous feeding vs. fast-induced refeeding. while robust inhibition of fi efficacy was observed in both models, direct comparison to previous studies is difficult. for example, kirkham et al  <cit>  examined the effect of sr141716a on 2-ag-mediated hyperphagia. the dose of sr141716a used  in this pharmacological challenge attenuated fi by ~50%. these data are similar to our results in the fast-induced refeeding model where it has been reported that hypothalamic 2-ag levels are high after a fast.

in addition to anorectic efficacy, cb <dig> receptor antagonists also increase energy expenditure . a comparison of the quantitative pharmacology between fi and energy expenditure suggest a similar concentration/effect relationship for the two endpoints. the relative contribution, however, of central and peripheral cb <dig> receptors as well as target tissues  in modulating energy expenditure remains to be elucidated.

rimonabant  <cit>  and am- <dig>  <cit> , a cb <dig> receptor antagonist structurally similar to rimonabant) treatment decreased body weight in chronic studies in both normal and obese rodents. dio rodents appear to be more sensitive to the anorectic efficacy of cb <dig> receptor antagonists. like other cb <dig> receptor antagonists, sustained weight loss was observed with ce- <dig> treatment in both dio rats and dio mice. in pk studies, no differences in exposure of ce- <dig> were observed between chow-fed and dio rats. however, the fi and bw efficacy the  <dig> day study in chow-fed rat study required a much higher dose to achieve equivalent efficacy compared to the dio rats suggesting that ce- <dig> is more potent in dio than chow-fed rats.

CONCLUSIONS
as with all cb <dig> receptors antagonists the relative contributions of fi and energy metabolism to weight loss remains to be determined. none of the above referenced studies provided any quantitative in vivo pharmacological analysis. one of the most critical components of increasing confidence in mechanism is the establishment of in vitro vs. in vivo concentration effect relationships. the complexities in the understanding of these relationships will vary depending on the stage and available chemical lead matter of a drug discovery program. these can range from concentration/effect relationships in early stage discovery projects to true pk/pd relationships at the later stages of discovery and into development . we sought to better understand the concentration/effect relationships of ce- <dig> by comparing unbound plasma concentrations, brain receptor occupancy, binding affinity and fi efficacy. unbound plasma concentrations normalized to ki provided a useful benchmark for comparing compounds across different in vivo studies and facilitated early predictions of efficacious human plasma concentrations . surprisingly, very little data exist on the in vivo quantitative pharmacology of cb <dig> receptor antagonists, a therapeutically important target class. most studies have relied on dose and not unbound plasma concentrations were not reported. fong et al  <cit>  assessed weight loss efficacy in relation to receptor occupancy. they reported that a minimum of 30% receptor occupancy in a  <dig> day weight loss study was required to achieve measurable weight loss. it is likely that endogenous cannabinoid levels are high after the fast in the fi studies but not in the indirect calorimetry studies. thus, a lower concentration of compound could be required for maximal efficacy when assessing energy expenditure compared to fi.

we did not observe changes in fi at this level of receptor occupancy under the standard study conditions. however, ce- <dig> reaches steady-state between brain and plasma at a slower rate than other cb <dig> receptors antagonists including rimonabant . when the interval between dosing to return of food was extended to  <dig> hr from  <dig> min, a statistically significant reduction in fi  at 50% receptor occupancy was observed. this efficacy is similar to that observed with other cb <dig> receptor antagonists. for maximal weight loss efficacy, 60-90% receptor occupancy is required for taranabant similar to our observations with ce- <dig> receptor occupancy studies.

while brain receptor occupancy studies are in themselves very important, cb <dig> receptor antagonists have pronounced peripheral metabolic effects that appear to be independent of the cns effects  <cit> . having measurements of both brain and unbound plasma concentration provides views of multiple sites of action. these include possible direct effects on adipose, liver, pancreas and muscle, all tissues that are involved in maintaining energy balance  <cit> .

in summary, we have linked in vitro , ex vivo  and in vivo  to define the quantitative pharmacology and concentration/effect relationships preclinical models of food intake and energy expenditure with the novel cb <dig> receptor antagonist, ce- <dig>
