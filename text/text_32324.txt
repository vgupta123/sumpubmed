BACKGROUND
metarhizium anisopliae is a globally distributed, entomopathogenic fungus that infects many important crop pests including aphids, scarabaeoid beetle larvae and western flower thrips  . the species was one of the first to be investigated for its use as a biological control agent and advances in the understanding of its biology and ecology have led to improved biocontrol applications  <cit> . m. anisopliae is regarded as asexual as no teleomorph has been observed  <cit> . in cases such as these, phylogenetic species boundaries are often used to taxonomically characterize anamorphic fungi  <cit>  and m. anisopliae has been well characterized in this regard  <cit> . analysis of mating type loci  however, can enhance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms behind sexual or asexual lifestyles and the potential pathways of genetic exchange.figure  <dig>

the metarhizium species complex is diverse, including generalist species with a broad host range and specialist species with narrow host ranges. furthermore, individual isolates can also exhibit a range of cultural variability. in our laboratory, variability of cultures is minimized through the use of single spore isolates and mother cultures from long term storage. despite best practice, significant variability arises in the colour and amount of sporulation from replicates of the same single spore isolates  cultured on sday plates of identical composition and grown under identical temperature regimes . two main morphologies have been observed: 1) highly sporulating olive green cultures and 2) low sporulating tri-colour cultures, that is orange, pale green and olive green. in addition to these morphologies, some cultures also exhibit more abundant fluffy mycelial growth while others tend to sector, a sign of aging  <cit> . culture degeneration has been shown to affect the stability of enzyme production  and secondary metabolite production  and results in extensive downstream gene regulation  <cit> .figure  <dig>

brip  <dig>  grown on sday plates of identical composition under identical temperature regimes. the main morphologies observed are  one highly sporulating olive green culture and low sporulating tri-colour cultures.



while possible mechanisms responsible for sectoring may include changes due to physiological and environmental adaptations or differences in transposable elements , our observations of cultural phenotype variation under laboratory conditions are not well understood. phenotypic variability which affects sporulation in the laboratory could also affect the multiplication of blastospores in the host haemocoel, isolate pathogenicity, as well as commercial conidial production, which has important implications for maintenance, preservation and the selection of isolates for commercialization  <cit> . the existence of unique divergent gene sets and expansion of gene families within m. anisopliae may provide an important genetic resource for the continued development of this important entomopathogen as a biopesticide.

the recent publication of reference genomes and comparative genomics of the generalist m. anisopliae and the locust-specific pathogen m. acridum has further enhanced our understanding of the biology of these entomopathogenic fungi and the molecular basis of host-specificity  <cit> . however the isolate sequenced as the reference strain for m. anisopliae  was subsequently re-classified to m. robertsii
 <cit> , a phylogenetically distinct species within the metarhizium parb clade   <cit> .

in light of the well-supported divergence of arsef <dig> from the main m. anisopliae clade  <cit>  and re-classification to m. robertsii, the primary aim of this study was to assemble an accurate, annotated, draft reference genome for m. anisopliae using our isolate ma <dig>  we used a comparative genomics approach, not to repeat the excellent work of the previous publication  <cit> , but to complement it, add to the body of knowledge and establish new genomic resources for the metarhizium genus. in this study, we compare the genomes of m. anisopliae, m. robertsii and m. acridum to identify the key suite of genes which differentiate m. anisopliae from the other two species. we used a multi-faceted bioinformatics approach to identify genes that were divergent between the three metarhizium species and to assign putative functions to them where possible. we identify a suite of effector-like genes that are predicted to be specific to m. anisopliae, significant differences in the repetitive dna complements, repeat-induced point mutations and mating type gene composition between the three species and discuss the implications of these findings.

RESULTS
phylogenetic validation, genome sequencing and assembly of m. anisopliaeisolate ma69
the rdna internal transcribed spacer  region of m. anisopliae isolate ma <dig> was sequenced and analyzed by blastn to confirm its identity  <cit> . one hundred hits to m. anisopliae its sequences with an e-value of  <dig>  were obtained, confirming isolate ma <dig> as m. anisopliae .

the genome of isolate ma <dig> was then shotgun-sequenced by generating two illumina libraries, a 100 bp paired-end library and a 3 kb mate-paired library, comprising  <dig>  gb and  <dig>  gb of raw data respectively. this corresponded to approximately 380x coverage of the final genome assembly. a total of  <dig>  million reads  were retained for assembly after quality-control filters were applied for the removal of adapter sequence and regions of low base-call quality or low sequence complexity. initial de novo assembly using only paired-end reads produced an assembly containing  <dig>  scaffolds with an n <dig> of  <dig> and an n <dig> length of  <dig>  bp. contigs were scaffolded with the 3 kb mate-pair library, resulting in  <dig> scaffolds with an n <dig> of  <dig> and an n <dig> length of  <dig> ,138 bp. the genome assembly statistics and general features were tabled along with those of m. robertsii and m. acridum
 <cit>  . the whole genome shotgun project of the organism m. anisopliae, isolate brip  <dig> efd <dig> ssc <dig> , was deposited at ddbj/embl-bank/genbank under the accession apnb <dig> table  <dig>

gene prediction and predicted protein orthology
a total of  <dig>  protein-encoding genes were predicted within the m. anisopliae ma <dig> genome assembly, compared with  <dig>  and  <dig>  from m. robertsii and m. acridum, respectively  <cit> . orthology relationships between the translated proteins of the three metarhizium species were predicted. while the number of predicted proteins in m. anisopliae was greater than those of m. robertsii and m. acridum , most of these appeared to belong to gene families that are expanded in m. anisopliae . a total of  <dig> proteins from m. anisopliae were predicted to have no orthologs in either m. robertsii or m. acridum . these proteins were ‘unique-by-orthology’ to m. anisopliae and are referred to in this study as ‘divergent’. additionally, groups of orthologs in which the number of proteins belonging to one species was greater than the other two were classified as ‘expanded’. there were  <dig> expanded groups containing  <dig> proteins in m. anisopliae,  <dig> groups containing  <dig> proteins in m. robertsii and  <dig> groups containing  <dig> genes in m. acridum .

functional annotation of species-specific  genes, expanded gene families and effector-like proteins in m. anisopliae,m. robertsiiand m. acridum
orthology relationships between the predicted proteins of the three metarhizium species were used as a basis for predicting ‘divergent’ and ‘expanded’ gene families. expanded gene families in all  <dig> species were abundant in proteins with similar pfam annotations. these were generally related to membrane transport, sugar metabolism, protein kinases, cytochrome p450s, and transcription factors . putative functional annotations were assigned to divergent genes by comparison to multiple databases and algorithms, including: blastp versus ncbi protein and swissprot, gene ontologies , interpro, pfam, signalp, wolfpsort and bioperl::seqstats. functional annotations were then ‘manually curated’ based on the sum collection of supporting evidence for each gene, with a view, where possible, to intelligibly describe its putative role in pathogenicity. for the purposes of summarizing this analysis, the divergent genes were then sorted into generalized categories based on their putative role and/or function. of the  <dig> genes found to be divergent in m. anisopliae,  <dig>  contained motifs known to be associated with pathogenicity in other species,  <dig>  had homology to genes in phibase  <cit> ,  <dig>  were low-molecular weight proteins of ≤30 kda and  <dig>  had predicted signal peptides . the divergent genes of m. anisopliae were found, compared to its complete gene content, to be relatively more abundant in genes encoding membrane-anchored proteins, transposable elements, or having unknown functions and other functions described in more detail in sub-sections below. genes encoding dna/rna binding factors and degradative enzymes were more abundant in the divergent genes of m. robertsii relative to its complete gene content .

dna/rna binding – transcriptional regulation
thirteen divergent genes of m. anisopliae were broadly characterized as having dna/rna binding functions, that is, potentially involved in the regulation of gene expression and intracellular signaling. no signal peptides were identified on these genes. four of these genes were putative helicases,  <dig> were putative piwi-like argonaut/dicer proteins,  <dig> had endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase  domains,  <dig> were putative fungal transcriptional factors and one was a putative ribonuclease h homolog.

degradative enzymes
m. anisopliae had six divergent genes that were grouped in three pairs of paralogs that encoded enzymes with a degradative function. the products of gene paralogs ma69_03389/ma69_ <dig> were putative peptidases . gene paralogs ma69_06536/ma69_ <dig> also encoded putative peptidases, each with a signal peptide and with homology to a phytophthora sojae gip1-like effector in phibase . gene paralogs ma69_00354/ma69_ <dig> encoded putative subtilisins. ma69_ <dig> in particular was assigned go terms indicating: serine type endopeptidase ; active evasion of host immune response via regulation of host complement system ; alkaline serine protease alp <dig>  and pathogenesis .

membrane-anchored proteins
twelve genes, divergent in m. anisopliae were classified as encoding membrane-anchored proteins. these genes included a putative arrestin-like g-protein coupled receptor, several membrane-associated proteins and a major facilitator superfamily  membrane transporter protein. two genes were homologous to canag <dig>  a membrane transport protein  and camdr <dig>  a multidrug transporter protein  both found in candida albicans.

transposable elements, other genes and unknown genes
fourteen genes divergent in m. anisopliae were identified as transposons and were therefore not considered of interest to this study. of the remaining divergent genes in m. anisopliae,  <dig> had functions including protein kinases, histidine kinases and heat-shock proteins. four divergent genes had homology to fungal pathogenicity genes in phibase. two of these were homologous to toxf from cochliobolus carbonum and two had homology to ctb <dig> from cercospora nicotianae . due to a lack of homology to the datasets screened,  <dig> divergent genes, lacked functional annotations and as such their putative biological roles are unknown. two of these unknown genes had predicted signal peptides.

divergent candidate secreted effector proteins in m. anisopliaema69
candidate secreted effector proteins are defined here as small protein molecules  which are putatively capable of being secreted by the pathogen via the eukaryotic secretory pathway. secretion to the apoplast relies on the presence of an n-terminal signal peptide and some of these molecules are transferred into plant cells, facilitated by an amino acid motif, downstream of the signal peptide. of the  <dig> divergent genes in m. anisopliae,  <dig> were found to encode putative signal peptides. nine of these were ≤  <dig> amino acids in length, four had pathogenicity motifs and these proteins were deemed candidate secreted effector proteins. these candidate secreted effector proteins were assigned to various functional categories including: degradative enzymes , membrane anchored proteins , other  and unknown genes .

repetitive dna content and repeat-induced point mutation 
repetitive dna analysis was performed on the scaffold sequences of m. anisopliae and the published reference genomes of m. robertsii and m. acridum. repetitive sequences were predicted de novo and ripcal was used to determine genome-wide dinucleotide frequencies and to quantify rip-like polymorphisms  within alignments of each repeat family   <cit> . to facilitate comparison of repeat types between metarhizium spp., their respective genomic matches to characterized repeat sequences in repbase  <cit>  are also shown in figure  <dig>  overall, the repetitive contents of the genome of m. anisopliae ma <dig> and m. robertsii arsef <dig> were similar and relatively low in comparison to other pezizomycotina. in contrast, the m. acridum genome assembly contained approximately twice as much repetitive dna. in total,  <dig> % of the genome assembly was predicted to be repetitive for m. anisopliae,  <dig> % for m. robertsii, and  <dig> % in m. acridum. in the three metarhizium genomes, the most abundant repeat type was simple/low-complexity repeats, followed by retroelements and dna transposons. the increased repetitive content of m. acridum was largely due to increased amounts of simple/low-complexity sequences. interestingly, m. acridum was also relatively depleted in transposons and though maintaining a comparable level of ltr retroelements was relatively deficient in lines and dna transposons.figure  <dig>

repeat families were scanned for repeat-induced point mutation -like dinucleotide changes using two methods. the first involved genome-wide comparison of dinucleotide frequencies between de novo-identified repetitive sequences and non-repetitive sequences . the rip index tpa/apt, which measures the frequency of the common rip-product tpa versus a non-rip like control apt, was  <dig>  within repeats of m. anisopliae and m. robertsii and  <dig>  in m. acridum. dinucleotide frequency analysis also showed an overall increase in tpa dinucleotides in m. acridum relative to m. anisopliae and m. robertsii and a corresponding depletion of the rip-target dinucleotides cpa and tpg .

the second rip-quantitation method used the ripcal alignment-based method  <cit>  versus a ‘deripped’ consensus of each family as a reference for comparison  <cit> . rip mutation statistics for all repeat families in all three species are tabled in additional file  <dig>  rip levels were on the whole relatively low in all three species, however all three species had a rid  homolog  <cit> . ripcal analysis showed that m. anisopliae and m. robertsii had similar total levels of rip mutations and both species exhibited elevated levels of mutation of cpa dinucleotides  typical of rip in the pezizomycotina in some repeat families. it should be noted that rip mutation requires a minimum repeat length and we would not expect it to occur in repeats less than 400 bp in length  <cit> . however assemblies containing short scaffolds such as those used in this study means these metarhizium assemblies are likely to contain a high number of short repeat families which are incomplete versions of full length repeats. a total of  <dig> repeat families of m. anisopliae, ranging in average repeat family length of  <dig> to 375 bp, had cpa↔tpa  dominance scores of  <dig> or greater . in m. robertsii,  <dig> repeat families had a similar rip-like dominance score, with lengths ranging from  <dig> to 173 bp. in contrast, m. acridum had  <dig> repeat families with a rip-like dominance score ≥ <dig>  lengths ranging from  <dig> to 1225 bp. interestingly, the total number of rip-like mutations in m. robertsii  , was approximately five times fewer than those of m. anisopliae and m. acridum .

mating  type gene analysis
analysis of orthologous relationships between the genes of the three metarhizium species in this study identified incongruence in the number and presence of mat genes . ma <dig> had three genes putatively identified as mat 1-1- <dig> , mat1-1- <dig>  and mat1-1- <dig>  with no orthologous pairs in m. acridum, and orthologs of mat 1-1- <dig> and mat1-1- <dig>  in m. robertsii. ma <dig> also had one gene  putatively identified as mat1- <dig> which had an ortholog  in m. acridum, but not in m. robertsii.figure  <dig>

the four putative mat genes from ma <dig> were subjected to blastp analysis and were found to have near identical sequence homology to ascomycetous mating type  genes . the top ten sequence hits for each mat gene were aligned to confirm the identity of the genes and identify conserved domains . the m. anisopliae mat1- <dig> alpha box domain  was confirmed by alignment to known mat1- <dig> sequences and carries a conserved intron   <cit> . the m. anisopliae mat1- <dig> hmg-box domain  was also confirmed by alignment with other mat1- <dig> sequences and also carries a conserved intron   <cit> . the presence of both mat idiomorphs in the genome of the m. anisopliae isolate sequenced indicates it to be putatively homothallic.figure  <dig>

prediction of secreted effector protein candidates via species-specificity and secretion predictions
to our knowledge, pathogenicity effector-like motifs have not yet been examined in metarhizium species. some experimentally-validated pathogenicity effector proteins exhibit short conserved amino-acid motifs , that in some cases have been demonstrated to facilitate host-cell import  <cit> . we combined protein matches to these known ‘effector motifs’, with predictions of signal-peptides , to arrive at a conservative set of predicted secreted effector protein candidates.

in total,  <dig>  proteins in m. anisopliae ma <dig> contained sequences matching to a motifs associated with pathogenicity in other fungal species . the most abundant motifs found were xc, xar and rxlr. these motifs are short , thus a substantial number of false-positive matches to proteins would be expected, in particular in long, intracellular proteins unrelated to pathogenicity. however these motifs were only considered and found in high numbers among groups of genes that had been previously bioinformatically-filtered for protein properties relevant to pathogenicity. potential pathogenicity genes were identified using orthology as a basis for predicting species-specific  genes in all  <dig> species, which are strong candidates as determinants of their respective differences in host-range phenotype. seven amino acid motifs known to be associated with pathogenicity proteins were found to match several divergent genes of m. anisopliae, m. robertsii and m. acridum .

furthermore,  <dig>  proteins were predicted to be secreted in m. anisopliae ma <dig> . we identified  <dig> of these proteins that we term ‘candidate effectors’, which both contained a pathogenicity effector motif and were predicted to be secreted . among these  <dig> candidate effectors,  <dig> motifs were found, in descending order of abundance: xc , xar , rxlr , chxc , kecxd  and yxsl .

discussion
m. anisopliae is a fungus with significant commercial and industrial applications as a biopesticide. the host and environmental range of m. anisopliae is regarded as entomologically cosmopolitan, compared to that of m. acridum which is host-specific. recent molecular analysis of the m. anisopliae complex has proposed its division into nine taxa, or distinct species, which individually may have narrower host specificities  <cit> . in a multigene phylogeny, m. anisopliae clustered with three other species m. pingshaense, m. robertsii and m. brunneum forming a distinct clade   <cit> . whether or not these represent discrete biological species or merely formae specialis is not known, as m. anisopliae has no known teleomorph  <cit>  and the basis of its assumed asexuality has not been determined. furthermore, advancing the currently poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms of genetic exchange could have important implications for understanding the persistence of traits of biopesticides in commercial applications.

given that the isolate arsef <dig> sequenced as m. anisopliae has subsequently been re-classified as m. robertsii, and is sufficiently divergent from m. anisopliae
 <cit> , an alternative genome reference is required for this important biocontrol fungus to differentiate it from and complement the existing metarhizium genomic resources. thus, we sequenced the genome of m. anisopliae isolate ma <dig> using illumina short-read sequence data, producing an annotated, de novo draft genome assembly of  <dig> scaffolds with an n <dig> of  <dig> and an n <dig> length of  <dig>  mb. the whole genome assembly and its predicted gene content was compared to the published genomes of m. robertsii  and m. acridum  , with particular focus on the species-specific genes of m. anisopliae ma <dig>  mating type and bioinformatic prediction of its candidate secreted effector proteins.

whole genome synteny, homology and divergent genes in m. anisopliae
the comparative genomics of m. robertsii and m. acridum has been comprehensively examined  <cit>  and we have refrained from duplicating previous efforts, except to include and compare m. anisopliae in that context. the previously published genome analysis of m. robertsii
 <cit>  showed syntenic conservation with gene clusters of m. acridum but did not present any whole-genome scale synteny comparisons. this was likely due to the poorer contiguity  of the m. acridum genome assembly, which would prevent whole-genome scale synteny from being accurately observed. in this study, whole genome comparisons including the new assembly of m. anisopliae, in which the largest scaffolds are of a comparable level of contiguity with those of m. robertsii, indicate a generally macrosyntenic conservation pattern . a low level of intra-chromosomal rearrangement is also observed, however this is similar to levels of degraded macrosynteny between other pezizomycotina species of the same genus, such as previously observed between the aspergilli  <cit> . we found that both m. anisopliae and m. robertsii had nucleotide sequence identities ≥ 90% to m. acridum, but sequence identity to each other was ≥ 95%, confirming that m. anisopliae and m. robertsii are more closely related to each other than to m. acridum.

a total of  <dig>  proteins were predicted in the m. anisopliae genome assembly,  <dig> and  <dig>  more than m. robertsii and m. acridum respectively. we examined the orthology of genes within the three metarhizium species and found  <dig> genes in ma <dig> that had no orthologs in m. robertsii and m. acridum, which we refer to in this study as ‘divergent’ genes. we also defined a set of ‘expanded’ genes in which the number of inparalogs of a single species was greater than corresponding outparalogs in the other two species, of which for m. anisopliae there were  <dig> expanded genes within  <dig> ortholog groups.

repetitive dna, te classes and rip analysis
repetitive sequences are associated with transposable elements  which play a central role in the evolutionary restructuring of fungal genomes due to their ability to move within the host genome, causing a range of mutations  <cit> . excluding deleterious insertions, the mutational activity of tes may promote genetic diversity and speed up adaptative evolution in the host  <cit> . class i  use a ‘copy and paste’ mechanism to transpose via the reverse-transcription of an rna intermediate and include long terminal repeats , non ltrs, and long and short interspersed nuclear elements  ‘cut and paste’ directly through a dna form, using the enzyme transposase  <cit> . earlier, we detailed our observations of phenotypic variation within single spored cultures of m. anisopliae . due to their ability to directly excise from dna and re-insert elsewhere in the genome, dna transposons can generate a wide range of dna sequence variation which may result in phenotypic changes and may account for the variety of cultural phenotypes observed. alternatively, the abundance of class ii tes in m. anisopliae may also affect cultural morphology, as evidence by line mediated mutations causing changes to conidial pattern formation in magnaporthe grisea
 <cit> .

at the gene level, insertion of tes either in or adjacent to genes may cause partial or total gene inactivation, resulting in new phenotypes  <cit> . on a genome-wide scale, tes may be associated with large scale chromosomal modifications such as deletions, inversions and translocations  <cit> . to prevent or minimize potential deleterious effects of tes, some fungi possess a gene silencing mechanism known as repeat induced point  mutation which targets duplicated dna sequences > 400 bp long with > 80% shared identity  <cit> . comparisons of the repeat content of the three metarhizium spp., using reciprocal blast clustering, revealed surprisingly few common repetitive sequences. further analysis of rip-like polymorphism in all three metarhizium spp. confirmed a common dinucleotide bias for cpa which conforms with expectations for species of the pezizomycotina. as found in a number of species of pezizomycotina  <cit> , all three metarhizium species examined here possessed a rid homolog which is essential for rip and although the function of these genes is untested, we assume that rip is active in all three species. in silico analysis of repetitive dna and rip across the three metarhizium spp. indicated that repetitive content in m. anisopliae and m. robertsii was low at around 2% of genomic dna and doubled in m. acridum at around 4%. dinucleotide frequency analysis supports active rip in all  <dig> species, with elevated frequencies of the rip-product tpa and depleted levels of the primary rip targets cpa and tpg within their respective repetitive dna complements. m. acridum also exhibited a significant increase in tpa and decrease in cpa and tpg relative to the other two species, perhaps indicative of its higher transposon content. however a more complex picture emerges after alignment-based ripcal analysis, which supports similar levels of rip mutations between m. anisopliae and m. acridum, with a predicted 5-fold decrease in rip-like polymorphism in m. robertsii. we speculate that while m. anisopliae and m. robertsii appear to contain similar levels of repetitive dna, rip activity may be greater in m. anisopliae than in m. robertsii. higher numbers of rip-like polymorphism in m. anisopliae and m. acridum may suggest a slightly greater adaptive potential compared to m. robertsii, as pathogenicity-related genes have previously been demonstrated to be affected by rip mutations leaking outwards from flanking repetitive dna  <cit> .

mat gene orthology
sexual function in filamentous ascomycetes is determined by mating type loci  which has been extensively described . typically, the single locus determining mating behaviour between mating partners contains different genes which are not allelic and are therefore known as idiomorphs  <cit> . in filamentous ascomycetes , mat genes encode dna binding motifs  boxes and α domains)  <cit>  and are responsible for the control of both mating and incompatibility, cell-cell recognition and recognition between nuclei  <cit> . the lack of an observed sexual lifestyle in metarhizium species may be the result of a loss of gene function, the lack of an opposite mating type, or merely the inability to induce a teleomorph under laboratory conditions. functional mat genes have been discovered in other ascomycetes previously assumed to be asexual  but the potential for a sexual cycle in these remains enigmatic  and indeed, its manifestation may occur on a continuum of sexuality in fungi, ranging from common to rare  <cit> .

we identified both mat1- <dig> and mat1- <dig> idiomorphs in m. anisopliae, indicating that it is putatively homothallic and possibly capable of sexual reproduction. the ma <dig> mat1- <dig> idiomorph encodes three proteins: mat1-1- <dig>  an α domain protein; mat1-1- <dig>  an amphipathic α-helical protein; and mat1-1- <dig>  an hmg box protein  <cit> . at this point, the functionality of these genes in m. anisopliae is not known, however sequence analysis has yielded a high level of conservation of alpha box and hmg domains with other ascomycetes. this warrants further investigation, including gene expression and/or transformation of closely related teleomorph species.

the m. acridum isolate cqma <dig> possessed the mat1- <dig> gene but lacked the mat1- <dig> idiomorph. the mat1- <dig> gene encoded an hmg-domain protein that was highly conserved with m. anisopliae and other ascomycetes. until an opposite mating type can be found and functionality is confirmed, heterothallism in m. acridum is deemed putative at this juncture. in contrast to both m. anisopliae and m. acridum, the m. robertsii isolate arsef <dig> possessed an incomplete mat1- <dig> idiomorph and lacked an ortholog to mat1- <dig>  absence of the mat1- <dig> idiomorph would indicate that the isolate sequenced was mat1- <dig> heterothallic, however again, in the absence of an opposite mating type and without confirmation of functionality, heterothallism is deemed putative. the relatively similar extents of rip-like polymorphism in m. anisopliae and m. acridum, given the putative homothallism of m. anisopliae, is perplexing. rip occurs only during meiosis, and as such, evidence of rip may indicate the occurrence of meiosis in an ancestral or cryptic sexual stage, or alternatively, the existence of a similar process in vegetative cells  <cit> . the results of rip analysis for m. robertsii, which indicate approximately  <dig> times less rip than in the other metarhizium spp., lends support to impaired or less frequent sexual activity in this species.

the missing mat1-1- <dig> gene in m. robertsii, a phenomenon also observed in pyrenopeziza brassicae and cochliobolus heterostrophus, two heterothallic species with sexual stages  <cit>  is intriguing. a functional mat1-1- <dig> gene is critical to mating identity, sexual development  <cit>  and vegetative incompatibility  <cit>  as the alpha box domain, which is subsequently processed into mature pheromone molecules is located here  <cit> . however the requirement for a functional mat1-1- <dig> is less clear. in the aforementioned example of p. brassicae, the absence of mat1-1- <dig> does not impede out crossing, indeed the teleomorph is found naturally in oilseed rape  <cit> . in another example, neurospora crassa, the homologs of mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-1- <dig>  were reported to be non-essential for mating or ascospore production  <cit> , however their expression increased the efficiency of sexual development  <cit> . it was also reported that homologs of mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-1- <dig> in podospora anserina  were not required for mating but were required for sexual development and biparental progeny, as mutations in the α-helical gene lead to barren fruiting bodies  <cit> . the evidence suggests that while mat1-1- <dig> is crucial to mating, the mat1-1- <dig> gene may have a supporting role in some ascomycetes in the successful development of sexual bodies, post mating, while in other species, its absence does not impede the development of fit progeny. the effect of the absence of mat1-1- <dig> in m. robertsii is unknown at this point, however it is intriguing that its closely related sibling species, m. anisopliae possesses the full complement of mat1- <dig> genes. in future, the discovery of isolates of m. robertsii and m. acridum with complementary mat idiomorphs followed by evolutionary analysis of these idiomorphs may help to further our understanding of the role of mat1-1- <dig> in the metarhizium species complex, and the potential effect on genetic exchange and perhaps, the observable phenotypic variation between cultures.

candidate secreted effector proteins
in this analysis, we identified a suite of genes which have the characteristics of effector proteins. effector proteins are defined as molecules produced by a pathogen, which can alter host cell structure or function, thereby facilitating infection and/or initiating defense mechanisms  <cit> . putative effector proteins are characterized in this study as being ≤  <dig> amino acids in length and have a predicted signal peptide, which would facilitate secretion into the pathogen’s extracellular space. in addition to these characteristics, effector predictions may also be supported by matches to proteins with previously identified pathogenicity motifs.

proportionately, the genome of m. anisopliae had similar numbers of putative secreted effector-like proteins to m. robertsii, and more secreted effector-like proteins than m. acridum suggesting a similar capability or role of secreted proteins between m. anisopliae and m. robertsii. ten predicted secreted effectors in m. anisopliae were divergent from m. robertsii and m. acridum. in particular,  <dig> of these divergent secreted effectors were determined to be putative degradative enzymes, which is of significant biological interest to metarhizium biopesticide research and warrants further investigation to identify their function and potential effect on host range.

we found six motifs known to be associated with pathogenicity in other species, to be present in  <dig> candidate secreted effector-like proteins of m. anisopliae. of these,  <dig> matched xc,  <dig> matched xar and  <dig> matched rxlr and represent the first analysis of effector-assosciated motifs in an entomopathogenic fungus. the best characterized of these motifs is the rxlr motif found in the oomycete phytophthora infestans
 <cit> , although conserved rxlr motif effectors have yet to be observed in fungi. in pathogenicity effectors of p. infestans, the rxlr motif is found adjacent to the signal peptide, on the n-terminal end of the mature cleaved protein, and has been shown to facilitate translocation of the effector protein across the host membrane into the host cell. the xar motif was identified in effector proteins secreted by the rice blast pathogen magnaporthe oryzae, however the function of this motif is unknown  <cit> . as such, the function of these motifs in metarhizium remains speculative.

while the high number of xc motifs among the two predicted sets of genes, divergent and effector candidates, may simply be an artifact of random background matches to this short, three residue motif, there is some evidence suggesting that there may be an important, albeit, still unknown role for xc motifs in secreted proteins. the xc motif was first reported in the powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis
 <cit> . it was predominantly expressed in the haustoria and was also over-represented among its predicted secretome  <cit> . since then, the xc motif has also been discovered among effector candidates from the haustoria-producing rust fungi puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici, p. striiformis f.sp. tritici and melampsora larici-populina . m. anisopliae also produces haustoria in vitro under nutrient deprivation  <cit>  however the link between the xc motif and production of haustoria is still yet to be resolved. the function of the xc motif still remains unclear, however it may have arisen from an extracellular rnase ancestor  <cit>  and may be involved in establishing disulphide bridges with a c-terminal cysteine residue  thereby assisting protein folding and enhancing extracellular stability. pedersen et al.,  <cit>  hypothesize that a secreted fungal ribonuclease appears to be the common origin of many of their candidates for secreted effector proteins . they suggested that some of these cseps could still be involved in interactions with host rnas and modulate host immunity via this route. they also go on to suggest that extracellular ribonucleases are very stable molecules, resistant to proteolytic degradation, thereby providing a rigid scaffold ideal for evolving an effector arsenal, in which exposed loop regions subjected to positive selection allow diversification and evasion of host recognition. the structural conservation among effector candidates from diverse plant pathogenic species supports the hypothesis of an ancient common ancestor. the entomopathogenic m. anisopliae is likely to have arisen from a plant-pathogenic predecessor  <cit>  and the discovery of these motifs in metarhizium is consistent with the high level of conservation and putative functional requirement of these for pathogenicity.

CONCLUSIONS
genomics, phenotypic variability and biopesticides
the key to successful commercialization of biopesticides is the identification and selection of virulent microbial isolates which are amenable to industrial scale production and formulation  <cit> . information from comparative genomics studies can be used to identify genes which may contribute to isolate virulence and fitness as well as other characteristics which affect cultural variability and stability of potential biopesticides.

the discovery of both mat idiomorphs in m. anisopliae raises more questions about its perceived asexuality, the potential pathways of genetic exchange in this species, impact on virulence, and implications for industrial applications. understanding the molecular basis of mating genes not only gives insight into fundamental processes such as evolution of homothallism, heterothallism and asexuality, but also facilitates research on ascomycetous species of industrial interest and subsequent applied aspects  <cit> . proof of function or not in these genes, will enhance the understanding of genetic exchange pathways in this species.

overall, the repetitive contents of the genome of m. anisopliae ma <dig> and m. robertsii arsef <dig> were similar and relatively low in comparison to other pezizomycotina. in contrast, the m. acridum genome assembly contained approximately twice as much repetitive dna. rip levels were on the whole relatively low in all three species, however all three species had a rid  homolog and we observed snp polymorphism consistent with active rip in all three species. m. anisopliae and m. robertsii had similar total levels of rip –like mutations and both species exhibited elevated levels of mutation of cpa dinucleotides  typical of rip in the pezizomycotina in some repeat families. interestingly, the total number of rip-like mutations in m. robertsii was approximately five times fewer than those of m. anisopliae and m. acridum, lending support to impaired or less frequent sexual activity in this species. rip occurs only during meiosis, and as such, evidence of rip in these species may indicate the occurrence of meiosis in an ancestral or cryptic sexual stage, or alternatively, the existence of a similar process in vegetative cells.

the availability of an annotated whole genome sequence for m. anisopliae adds value to the already published genomes of m. robertsii and m. acridum; however in and of itself, represents a significant resource for future research into this agriculturally important fungal biopesticide. the nomenclature of the species m. robertsii needs to be widely adopted immediately to prevent further confusion with m. anisopliae, therefore the publication of the genome reference of m. anisopliae will serve as a valuable reference to differentiate it from m. robertsii.
