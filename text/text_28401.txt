BACKGROUND
hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome  is a rare sporadic disorder with an incidence of  <dig> per  <dig> million live births. birth weight and appearance are usually normal, but growth typically becomes retarded at the age of  <dig> year. phenotypic features include short stature, sculptured nose, alopecia, prominent scalp veins, small face, subcutaneous fat loss, faint mid-facial cyanosis, and dystrophic nails. features occurring in the skin during late adulthood of normal individuals, such as hair greying, hair loss, and skin thinning, occur in the first few years of life in subjects with hgps  <cit> . most subjects die in their teenage years from cardiac complications of coronary artery disease or stroke due to widespread arteriosclerosis  <cit> .

the diagnosis of hgps was formerly based on the criteria of growth retardation and prematurely aged phenotype in children. in  <dig>  however, mutations in the lmna gene that encodes nuclear lamins a and c were identified as responsible for this syndrome  <cit> . as such, hgps belongs to the group of diseases caused by mutations in lmna, sometimes referred to as "laminopathies," which also includes disorders of striated muscle, peripheral nerve and partial lipodystrophy syndromes  <cit> . the lmna mutation present in the majority of subjects with hgps is a de novo heterozygous base change  within exon  <dig> of the lmna gene, which does not cause an amino acid substitution  but creates an abnormal splice donor site  <cit> .

nuclear lamins are members of the intermediate filament protein superfamily  <cit> . they are the building blocks of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous proteinaceous meshwork underlying the inner nuclear membrane  <cit> . nuclear lamins have an extra  <dig> amino acids  in coil 1b compared to cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins  <cit> . nuclear lamins also contain two unique sequences: a nuclear localization signal in the tail domain  <cit> , and, except for lamin c, a carboxyl-terminal caax box , a target for isoprenylation  <cit> . in the human genome,  <dig> distinct loci encode lamins. lmna is located on chromosome 1q <dig>   <cit>  and encodes  <dig> lamins by alternative rna splicing: a, c, aÎ” <dig>  and c <dig>  <cit> . lamin a is synthesized as a precursor, prelamin a, from which  <dig> amino acids are removed from the carboxyl-terminal by endoproteolysis after isoprenylation. there are  <dig> b-type lamin genes: lmnb <dig> on chromosome 5q23-q <dig>  that encodes lamin b <dig>  <cit> , and lmnb <dig> on chromosome 19p <dig>   <cit>  that encodes lamin b <dig>  <cit>  and lamin b <dig>  an alternatively spliced isoform expressed in germ cells  <cit> .

we recently identified a new female subject with hgps from italy. we now show that she has the most common heterozygous point mutation, g608g, in lmna resulting in expression of the prelamin a mutant with  <dig> amino acids deleted from the carboxyl-terminal tail domain. we analyzed the nuclear morphology and growth characteristics of these fibroblasts, and for the first time demonstrate that cells from a subject with hgps exhibit increased susceptibility to heat stress.

RESULTS
clinical description of a new subject with hgps
the female subject is the second child from consanguineous parents  . the subject's mother and an uncle  were affected with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, an inherited disorder of connective tissue. at birth, the subject had cutaneous xerosis and mild skin indurations of the lower limbs. at  <dig> month, she developed more severe skin stiffening on the lower limbs, trunk, and extensor areas on the forearms, accompanied by functional limitation in leg extension. mild perioral cyanosis was also visible. a skin biopsy was performed at  <dig> years of age and histological analysis revealed fibrous thickening of the lower dermis, subcutaneous septa, and fascia, accompanied by a few mucinous deposits. weigert staining showed pronounced rarefactions of elastic fibers. a dermal fibroblast culture was established from the biopsy sample. physical examination of the subject at age  <dig> years revealed loss of subcutaneous tissue, especially on the face and limbs, and thickening of the skin that appeared shiny and taut in most areas. she also had a small face with a recessed chin, thin beaked nose, small ears, prominent eyes, prominent scalp veins, and alopecia.

detection of a lmna mutation encoding a truncated prelamin a
we sequenced all  <dig> exons of lmna that comprise the lamin a/c coding region and splice junctions of the subject's dna using previously described oligonucleotide primers  <cit> . we found a heterozygous c to t transition at nucleotide  <dig> in exon  <dig> of lmna, which created a silent point mutation at codon  <dig>  . we also sequenced exon  <dig> from the father  and the mother  and found no mutation in either.

amplification of cdna fragments by rt-pcr corresponding to nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> of prelamin a mrna showed that the wild type fragment was  <dig> nucleotides and the mutant fragment  <dig> nucleotides. the mutant sequence was  <dig> nucleotides shorter than the wild type, corresponding to a deletion of  <dig> amino acids. figure 2a shows the sequence of the mutant lamin a cdna from nucleotide  <dig>  to the last amino acid codon. the deducted amino acid sequence of the mutant from residue  <dig> to the carboxyl-terminus is gsgaqspqncsim .

nuclear envelope morphology in hgps fibroblasts
we examined the nuclear envelope morphology of dermal fibroblasts from control individuals and from the subject with hgps after  <dig> or less passages in primary cultures. cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-lamin a/c antibodies and examined by confocal microscopy. nuclei of control fibroblasts were mostly regular in size and shape, and appeared generally round or ovoid . in contrast, the size of nuclei in the subject's fibroblasts was more variable, and the nuclear envelopes had convex "blebs" or herniations projecting towards the cytoplasm . by direct count of  <dig>  cells in  <dig> different cultures from the subject and controls, we determined that 19% of nuclei in the subject's fibroblasts had irregularities in nuclear envelope shape compared to only 4% of control cells, in which the dysmorphic nuclei exhibited less severe abnormalities. despite abnormalities in nuclear envelope size and shape in fibroblasts from the subject with hgps, there were no gross abnormalities in the localization of lamins a/c  or lamin b <dig> . furthermore, the vimentin network appeared normal . staining with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  did not reveal obvious defects in chromatin density .

we further examined the localizations of a-type lamins, b-type lamins, and emerin, an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, using double labelling immunofluorescence microscopy. we examined the most abnormal appearing nuclei in the subject's cells, carefully analyzing the localization of lamin b <dig>  and emerin  compared to a-type lamins . at the nuclear periphery of the subject's most dysmorphic nuclei, labelling of a-type and b-type lamins is super-imposable . even in sites where the nuclear envelope contained "blebs," both a-type and b-type lamins were colocalized. emerin also colocalized with a-type lamins in the same distribution pattern . when intranuclear lamin a/c labelling was present, emerin was found in the same structures, suggesting that they represented invaginations of the nuclear envelope. concurrent dapi staining did not demonstrate a gross detachment between the nuclear lamina  and chromatin, even in the most abnormally shaped nuclei . lamin a/c, b <dig> and emerin labelling were in close apposition to the dna labelling, suggesting that the nuclear envelope and lamina remained in close approximation to chromatin. dna labelling detected in the herniated areas of nuclei also was associated with labelling by anti-lamin a/c, anti-lamin b <dig> and anti-emerin antibodies .

we carried out an ultrastructural analysis of cultured fibroblasts from the subject with hgps using transmission electron microscopy. the electron micrographs clearly showed that chromatin remained in contact with the nuclear envelope . analysis of a dysmorphic nucleus with  <dig> blebs  revealed that the chromatin also remained attached to the nuclear envelope at those sites .

analysis of lamin expression by western blotting
we performed western blot analysis on total protein extractions from cultured fibroblasts at passage number  <dig>  anti-lamin a/c antibodies that recognize a sequence predicted to be within the truncated g608g prelamin a mutant, in addition to lamin a and c bands, detected the mutant protein in the subject's cells migrating above the band corresponding to lamin c . this protein was not detected in extracts of control fibroblasts . in western blots containing equal amounts of cell extracts, the lamin a and lamin c signals were approximately the same for subject and control cells . this was confirmed by densitometric analysis of autoradiograms of  <dig> separate western blots from subject and control cells. in addition, the signals on western blots obtained using anti-lamin b <dig> and anti-emerin antibodies showed no obvious differences between the subject and unaffected individuals . hence, at low passage number in primary culture, fibroblasts from a subject with hgps express a mutant truncated prelamin a, but lamin a, lamin c, lamin b <dig>  and emerin are expressed at approximately normal levels.

growth rate of fibroblasts from a subject with hgps in early passage primary culture
we examined the growth rate of cultured primary dermal fibroblasts from the subject with hgps. at each cellular passage, the total number of cells from control and proband was assessed by direct count prior to plating. the mean number of harvested hgps fibroblasts was comparable to the number obtained with two control fibroblast lines derived from unaffected individuals at passage numbers in culture below passage  <dig>  dermal fibroblasts from the subject with hgps therefore had a similar growth rate to the control counterparts and did not exhibit gross cell cycle defects at low passage numbers in culture.

dermal fibroblasts from a subject with hgps are hypersensitive to heat stress
to evaluate the resistance to stress of the nuclear envelope, fibroblasts from the subject with hgps and control individuals were heat shocked for  <dig> minutes at 45Â°c. cells were then either fixed immediately  or incubated at 37Â°c for  <dig> and  <dig> hours to allow for recovery. nuclear shape was examined by microscopy after labelling with anti-lamin a/c or anti-lamin b <dig> antibodies at time  <dig>   <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after heat shock . in control cells, nuclear shape and distribution of a-type and b-type lamins were not altered by heat shock . in contrast, extensive nuclear deformations appeared in the cells from the subject with hgps . the subject's fibroblasts showed an increase in the number of cells with altered nuclei immediately after heat shock. nuclear envelopes were deformed, many had a ruffled appearance, and some had "pleats" or "folds" . the number of irregular nuclei increased to nearly  <dig> % after  <dig> hours, as determined by direct count of  <dig>  nuclei in cells on different coverslips. some nuclei were more severely affected than others and showed "blebbing" or nuclear lobe formation  <dig> hours after heat shock . this type of nuclear damage was never observed in the control cells . at  <dig> hours after heat shock, nuclei with invaginations were no longer observed in the fibroblasts from the subject with hgps , suggesting that the cells with severely dysmorphic nuclei died and detached from the coverslips during processing for immunofluorescence microscopy. fibroblasts remaining on the coverslips appeared to have recovered from the stress, as their nuclei showed a less ruffled appearance and the irregularities resembled those observed prior to the heat shock . there was no apparent rearrangement of the vimentin cytoplasmic intermediate filament network after heat shock and  <dig> and  <dig> hours after recovery in the subject's and control fibroblasts .

survival rates of fibroblasts subjected to heat shock were evaluated and compared to unheated cells . at  <dig> hours after recovery, 25% of the subject's cells were lost compared to the number of cells prior to treatment. in contrast, the total number of control fibroblasts increased by 39%. this suggests that growth of control cells was not significantly affected by heat shock, as they continued to divide. after  <dig> hours, the subject's fibroblasts appeared to have recovered from stress, as the number of cells increased, reaching approximately the same number of cells per dish as before heat shock. from  <dig> hours to  <dig> hours after heat shock, the number of cells from the subject with hgps increased by 30%. control cells continued to increase by an average of 36% at  <dig> hours after heat shock.

these experiments indicate that control cells recovered rapidly from heat shock, since no changes were apparent in their growth rate  <dig> and  <dig> hours later. however, fibroblasts from the subject with hgps were hypersensitive to heat shock, and the number with dysmorphic nuclei was high after treatment. their recovery was only observed  <dig> hours after heat shock, when cell numbers started to increase, suggesting that surviving cells had begun to divide again.

discussion
we report another subject with hgps who has the lmna g608g mutation. so far,  <dig> out of  <dig> reported cases of hgps genetically analyzed have this point mutation  <cit> , making it a molecular signature for hgps. sequencing of parental dna, when available, has shown that none of them carried this mutation, indicating that it is a de novo mutation. these findings also show that hgps is an autosomal dominant disease possibly resulting from germinal mosaicism  <cit> .

the lmna g608g mutation creates an abnormal splice donor site producing mrna with  <dig> nucleotides deleted from the prelamin a coding sequence. the encoded truncated protein is predicted to be missing residues  <dig> to  <dig> of prelamin a and to retain the caax box for the prenylation at its carboxyl-terminus. as the "upstream" endoproteolytic cleavage site of wild type prelamin a is deleted  <cit> , the truncated prelamin a in hgps may remain prenylated; however, this remains to be shown experimentally.

to understand the cellular basis of hgps, we analyzed the morphology dermal fibroblasts from our subject, which express the mutant protein. we studied the distribution of a-type lamins in primary fibroblast cultures at early cellular passage numbers  to better reflect the in vivo distribution of proteins. we observed nuclear abnormalities in a subpopulation of hgps fibroblasts, where dysmorphic nuclei had "blebs" surrounded by a-type lamins. we did not observe defects in the lamin a/c meshwork in "blebs" of the most dysmorphic nuclei, and chromatin distribution appears normal even within the 'blebs." the fibroblasts did not have gross anomalies of the localization of lamin b <dig> or emerin, even when the lamina network appeared ruffled.

only a subpopulation of cultured fibroblasts from our subject with hgps had dysmorphic nuclei. furthermore, the nuclear abnormalities observed in these fibroblasts may have been less dramatic than those reported in cell lines from other individuals with hgps  <cit> . nuclear abnormalities in fibroblasts from our subject with hgps also differed from those reported in fibroblasts from subjects with dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, a condition caused by different autosomal dominant lmna mutations. cells from these subjects have defects in lamin a/c distribution in nuclear envelope "blebs," and there is also a loss of lamin b <dig> staining around the nuclear envelope "blebs" and sometimes at the nuclear pores  <cit> . despite these subtle differences between cells from subjects with hgps and subjects with other laminopathies, generally similar morphological alterations invariably occur in some portion of cultured fibroblasts from subjects with different lamin a/c mutations  <cit> . grossly similar alterations are also observed in fibroblasts from lmna knockout mice  <cit> . based on these nuclear envelope abnormalities common to all laminopathies, it appears that a-type lamins play a crucial role in the maintenance of the size and shape of the nucleus. these alterations in nuclear morphology could potentially lead to abnormalities in cell growth or structural stability.

we did not observe differences in the proliferation of fibroblasts from our subject with hgps compared to fibroblasts from unaffected controls at passage numbers below  <dig> in primary culture. a recent report suggested that, after a certain number of passages, fibroblasts from subjects with hgps were no longer able to proliferate at a similar rate as fibroblasts from unaffected controls  <cit> . growth inhibition was recently reported for other cell lines from subjects with hgps, where after a certain number of doublings, the cells rapidly entered a senescence phase  <cit> . fibroblasts from lmna knockout mice are prone to apoptosis when derived from newborns, while fibroblasts derived from knockout embryos can grow in culture for a restricted number of passages  <cit> .

with regards to cell stability, we observed that fibroblasts from our subject with hgps cells were more susceptible to damage from heat shock than controls. the subject's cells in culture had an increased number of dysmorphic nuclei and enhanced cell death within the first  <dig> hours after the heat shock. fibroblasts from the subject with hgps appeared to be able to eventually recover from heat stress, since they started to grow again after a delay of  <dig> hours. these findings suggest that fibroblasts form subjects with hgps are fragile and more readily damaged or killed after stress. increased nuclear fragility to mechanical stress and head shock has also been reported in fibroblasts from mice lacking lamins a and c and human subjects with dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
cells from a subject with hgps and the lamin a g608g mutation have dysmorphic nuclei and an increased susceptibility to damage by heat shock. our findings suggest that these cells may also be sensitive to other types of stress, such as metabolic or mechanical. improving the cellular response to stress may be one possible way of helping individuals with hgps and other laminopathies.
