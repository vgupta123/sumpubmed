BACKGROUND
β-arrestins were first identified for their role in mediating g-protein-coupled receptor  desensitization and internalization, and were later discovered to serve as signaling scaffolds mediating g-protein-independent signaling. in our previous studies we have shown that proteinase-activated-receptor- <dig>  can signal through two different pathways, one involving gαq coupling and mobilization of intracellular ca2+ and another involving recruitment of various signaling proteins into a scaffolding complex with β-arrestins  <cit> . as par <dig> is reported to have both protective and pathogenic effects in a number of diseases, the dominance of one pathway over the other may direct the ultimate physiological response <cit> . upon activation of par <dig> and a number of other receptors, β-arrestins can associate with and differentially regulate the activity of various signaling proteins. for example, association with β-arrestins increases the activity cofilin and erk1/ <dig>  while inhibiting the activity of pi3k  <cit> . furthermore, studies on other receptors suggest that β-arrestins can both positively and negatively regulate additional enzymes including rhoa, phosphatase pp2a and nf-κb <cit> .

par <dig> is one of a family of four gpcrs activated by proteolytic cleavage of their n-termini, which exposes a tethered ligand that then auto-activates the receptors. synthetic peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand for par- <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> will specifically activate them in the absence of proteinase <cit> . members of this gpcr family share a common mechanism of activation, but they are quite divergent in their downstream signaling pathways. for example, while par <dig> and par <dig> can couple to gαq, par <dig> exhibits β-arrestin-dependent desensitization and internalization, while par <dig> uses β-arrestins only for desensitization. downstream of par <dig>  β-arrestins scaffold and activate erk1/ <dig>  while inhibiting pi3k. in contrast, β-arrestins increase par1-stimulated pi3k activity and inhibit erk1/ <dig> activation <cit> . previous studies suggested that gαq-coupled receptors, including par <dig>  promote ampk activity through a gαq/camkkβ-dependent mechanism, making ampk a logical metabolic target of par <dig> <cit> ; however, the role of β-arrestins in ampk signaling have never been investigated. a major goal of this study was to examine the possible role of β-arrestins in the regulation of ampk downstream of par <dig> 

ampk is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase activated in response to decreased amp/atp ratios  <cit> , by classic signaling pathways that increase camkk or lkb- <dig> activity, and by drugs such as statins, metformin and thiazolidinediones <cit> . while amp directly activates ampk by inducing a conformational change and by rendering it less susceptible to dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases 2a and c  <cit> , ampk is further activated by phosphorylation on its α subunit at thr  <dig> by lkb- <dig> or ca2+/calmodulin kinase-kinase β   <cit> . activation of ampk is associated with a number of beneficial metabolic effects, including phosphorylation and inhibition of the enzyme acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase  <dig>  which is involved in fat synthesis. ampk activity is tightly regulated within the cell and there are a number of pathological conditions associated with decreased ampk activity. most research has focused on the mechanisms by which it is activated downstream of different receptors; however, the possibility that receptors can send negative signals to ampk has not been as well studied. given the ability of par <dig> to promote two separate signaling pathways leading to events that might be considered protective and pathogenic from a metabolic standpoint, we investigated whether it is capable of regulating ampk and asked whether both ca2+-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways were involved.

RESULTS
par <dig> promotes camkkβ-dependent ampk activity in fibroblasts
to first determine whether par <dig> promotes ampk activation, we treated nih3t <dig> cells, with the par <dig> activating peptide 2-furoyl-ligrl-o  for 0- <dig> minutes and assessed ampk phosphorylation by performing western blots with antibodies specific for thr <dig> phosphorylated-ampk and total ampk . a negative control peptide comprising the reverse sequence  was used to show the response was specific to 2fap. although serine proteinases are the physiological activators of par <dig>  synthetic peptide agonists corresponding to the tethered ligand are typically used to specifically activate the receptor, in an experimental setting, to minimize confusion from extraneous effects of proteinase treatment <cit> . nih3t <dig> cells were chosen for these initial studies because we have previously demonstrated that they favor gαq over β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways  <cit> . par <dig> promoted a  <dig> -fold increase in ampk phosphorylation, peaking at  <dig> minutes and remaining slightly elevated for  <dig> hours . we simultaneously examined phosphorylation of a known substrate of ampk, using an antibody specific for ser79-phosphorylated acc , observing a similar increase in acc phosphorylation with 2fap treatment . reverse 2fap did not increase ampk phosphorylation, pointing to the specificity of the response . to further confirm that the increase in ampk phosphorylation reflected an increase in its activity, we immunoprecipitated ampkα from cells after stimulation with 2fap for 0- <dig> minutes and assayed phosphorylation of the ampk substrate peptide ; here we observed a 2-3-fold increase in ampk activity that peaked at 5- <dig> minutes . we conclude that par <dig> promotes phosphorylation and activation of ampk, and its downstream substrate, acc in nih3t <dig> fibroblasts.

par <dig> is a gαq coupled receptor, which leads to mobilization of intracellular ca2+. since camkkβ is a ca2+-regulated kinase that can be activated by par <dig>  <cit> , and other gαq-coupled receptors activate ampk via camkkβ, we examined its role in par <dig> stimulated ampk activity using the inhibitor sto- <dig>  at the concentration used, , sto- <dig> is considered specific for camkkβ and although it exhibits non-specificity at higher concentrations, it does not affect the activity of lkb <dig>  the other primary ampkk  <cit> . in the presence of sto- <dig>  par2-induded ampk phosphorylation was blocked. in fact, although sto- <dig> treatment did not significantly decrease baseline pampk levels, we observed a mild decrease in ampk phosphorylation below baseline levels upon par <dig> stimulation . these data suggest that par <dig> is capable of inhibiting as well as promoting ampk phosphorylation, an observation that is consistent with previous studies in which we demonstrated that a number of gαq/ca2+-dependent signaling pathways are opposed by β-arrestins and vice versa  <cit> . we conclude that par <dig> stimulated ampk activation requires the activity of camkkβ and may be opposed by a separate par <dig> stimulated pathway. we address whether this inhibitory pathway is mediated by β-arrestins, similar to what has been observed for other proteins  <cit>  in the next section.

the other kinase capable of activating ampk is lkb- <dig>  a tumor suppressor, which is activated by strad and ste-20-related kinases and which potentiates the effect of amp on ampk activity <cit> . transfection of sirna to lkb- <dig> reduced lkb- <dig> protein by 70%, and resulted in a 50% decrease in par2-stimulated ampk phosphorylation . we next measured amp and atp levels in cells treated with or without 2fap for 0- <dig> minutes by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry . par <dig> increased amp/atp ratios at  <dig> minutes and to a lesser extent at  <dig> minutes . we conclude that lkb- <dig> also contributes to ampk phosphorylation downstream of par <dig> , which may involve increased amp/atp ratios observed in response to par <dig> activation. because camkkβ signaling downstream par <dig> is better understood, and the effect of camkkβ inhibition on par <dig> stimulated ampk phosphorylation was more pronounced than that of lkb <dig>  the remainder of these studies will focus on the camkkβ arm of this signaling pathway.

β-arrestin- <dig> inhibits par <dig> stimulated ampk activation
in light of studies suggesting that par2-induced, ca2+-dependent activation of other enzymes is inhibited by β-arrestins <cit> , we hypothesized that β-arrestins might be capable of inhibiting the par <dig> stimulated increase in ampk phosphorylation. we examined ampk phosphorylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild type mice , β-arrestin double knockout mice , or from mefβarrdko transfected with either β-arrestin- <dig>  or β-arrestin- <dig> . these transfected mefs have been previously characterized and found to express levels of either β-arrestin- <dig> or  <dig> similar to those expressed in the wild type cells, and avoid the possible complications of compensatory mechanisms that may be present in either β-arrestin- <dig> or β-arrestin- <dig> knockout mice <cit> . in wtmef, no significant increase in ampk phosphorylation was observed upon par <dig> activation, consistent with the higher levels of β-arrestins present in mefs compared with nih3t <dig> cells <cit> . however, in mefβarrdko, and in mefdko+βarr <dig>  par <dig> promoted a 2- <dig> -fold increase in ampk phosphorylation. in contrast, in mefdko+βarr <dig>  par <dig> stimulated ampk phosphorylation was inhibited . furthermore, when flag-β-arrestin- <dig> was over-expressed in nih3t <dig> cells, par <dig> stimulated ampk phosphorylation was abolished . in nih3t <dig> cells over-expressing β-arrestin- <dig>  we observe a small  increase in baseline pampk . we do not yet know the significance of this alteration in basal ampk phosphorylation but may reflect a par-2-independent effect of β-arrestin on ampk phosphorylation. β-arrestins are involved in terminating the signals of a number of receptors known to activate ampk. par <dig> is relatively unusual in that it promotes a number of β-arrestin-dependent signaling events, while its g-protein signal is being dampened. we conclude that β-arrestins can inhibit par <dig> stimulated ampk phosphorylation.

par <dig> promotes β-arrestin-dependent inhibition of ampk in primary fat
to confirm the inhibitory role of β-arrestin- <dig> on ampk phosphorylation in primary cells, we investigated par2-stimulated ampk phosphorylation in adipose tissue from wild type and either β-arrestin-1-/- or β-arrestin-2-/- mice. ampk activity in adipose plays a key role in modulating the metabolic state of the animal  <cit>  and we observe high levels of β-arrestin expression in primary fat as well as differentiated 3t3l <dig> adipocytes . isolated epididymal fat was incubated with or without 2fap for  <dig> and  <dig> minutes, then homogenized and analyzed by sds-page followed by western blotting for phospho-ampk. in wt and β-arr1-/- fat, no significant increase in ampk activity was observed in response to par <dig> activation. however, in β-arr2-/- fat, par <dig> promoted a 5-fold increase in ampk phosphorylation , and a  <dig> - <dig> -fold increase in ampk activity . similar results were observed in liver from wt, β-arr-1-/- and β-arr2-/- animals . pretreatment with sto- <dig> abolished par2-stimulated ampk phosphorylation in β-arr2-/- fat , suggesting that ampk phosphorylation by camkkβ is inhibited by β-arrestin- <dig>  consistent with these observations, par <dig> -stimulated phosphorylation of the ampk substrate, acc, was only observed in β-arr2-/- mice . we conclude that par <dig> can promote camkkβ-dependent ampk activation in primary fat, but under normal conditions this activity is suppressed by an inhibitory par <dig> pathway through β-arrestin- <dig> 

ampk and camkkβ associate with β-arrestin-2
our studies on pi3k suggest that β-arrestins can form inhibitory scaffolds leading to decreased kinase activity. to examine whether β-arrestins similarly associate with ampk and camkkβ, we performed co-immunoprecipitations in nih3t <dig> cells transfected with flag-tagged β-arrestin- <dig> or β-arrestin- <dig>  treated with and without 2fap. both ampk and camkkβ could be co-precipitated with β-arrestin- <dig> and to a lesser extent, β-arrestin- <dig>  only β-arrestin- <dig> increased association with ampk and camkkβ upon par <dig> activation . furthermore, a greater amount of both proteins associated with β-arrestin- <dig> relative to its expression level, than with β-arrestin- <dig> . confirming the specificity of this interaction, camkkβ and ampk were not immunoprecipitated with anti-flag in mock transfected cells . we confirmed association of endogenous β-arrestins with ampk and camkkβ in fat explants, where we immunoprecipitated ampkα <dig> and probed western blots with β-arrestin-1/ <dig> or camkkβ antibodies. ampk could be co-immunoprecipitated with camkkβ and β-arrestin- <dig> . therefore, we conclude that β-arrestin- <dig> might form an inhibitory complex with ampk and its upstream kinase, camkkβ.

β-arrestin- <dig> directly inhibits camkkβ activity in vitro
to examine whether β-arrestin- <dig> can directly inhibit camkkβ activity, thus preventing phosphorylation of ampk, we incubated recombinant gst-tagged β-arrestin- <dig> or gst alone  with recombinant camkkβ in the presence of 32p-atp and the substrate myelin basic protein . camkkβ activity was determined by quantifying incorporation of 32p into mbp. reactions were performed with 50ng camkkβ and carried out for  <dig> minutes, which resulted in maximal mbp phosphorylation . phosphorylation of mbp by camkkβ was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion upon addition of β-arrestin-2-gst but not gst alone , suggesting an overall inhibitory effect of β-arrestin- <dig> on camkkβ activity. we then specifically examined phosphorylation of ampk on thr <dig>  camkkβ was incubated with recombinant heterotrimeric ampk in the presence and absence of 500pm gst-β-arrestin- <dig>  or with gst alone, and phosphorylation determined by western blot using anti-phospho-ampk and anti- total ampk. camkkβ-stimulated ampk phosphorylation was abolished by addition of recombinant gst-β-arrestin- <dig>  but not gst .

discussion
here we describe a novel role for β-arrestin- <dig> in the regulation of ampk, downstream of par <dig>  we demonstrate that par <dig> can activate ampk in the presence of low β-arrestin- <dig> levels, and inhibit it in cells with high levels of β-arrestin- <dig>  while previous studies have investigated the mechanism of ampk activation by another proteinase-activated receptor, par <dig>  those studies did not deal with β-arrestins. furthermore, the role of β-arrestins in signaling by the two receptors is quite different. par <dig> activation of ampk involves the ca2+ sensitive enzyme, camkkβ, while the inhibitory pathway involves β-arrestin-dependent suppression of this same activity . as was observed for par <dig>  lkb- <dig> may also play a role in par2-stimulated ampk activation, but the sensitivity of this enzyme to β-arrestin-dependent regulation remains to be investigated. research by ours and other groups over the last few years has revealed that β-arrestins can direct signals that oppose, facilitate, or act independently of a number of g-protein-directed signals <cit> . with respect to par <dig>  we have shown that ca2+ mobilization, downstream of gαq activation, promotes nuclear mapk activity, pi3k activity and limk activation, while β-arrestins promote inhibition of pi3k and limk and membrane sequestration of mapk activity  <cit> . the predominance of one pathway over the other depends largely on the relative amounts of gαq and β-arrestins, which appear to vary in a cell-type specific fashion  <cit> . thus, the same extracellular signal can elicit distinct responses through the same receptor depending on the cellular context.

these findings also provide novel insight into the scaffolding functions of β-arrestin- <dig>  to date, numerous binding partners have been identified for β-arrestins encompassing a diverse array of proteins including mapks, phosphatidylinositol kinases, actin assembly proteins, transcription factors, rhogtpases, and ubiquitin ligases  <cit> . interestingly, individual receptors promote recruitment of only a select group of these potential binding partners to β-arrestins. part of this diversity can be explained by discrete domains within β-arrestins that serve as docking sites for different binding partners. here we identify two new targets of β-arrestin-2-dependent scaffolding: camkkβ and ampk which co-immunoprecipitate in cultured cells and in vivo. although it is not yet clear whether either or both camkkβ and ampk directly contact β-arrestin- <dig>  it is likely that camkkβ directly interacts with β-arrestin- <dig>  since addition of β-arrestin- <dig> blocked phosphorylation of both a non-specific substrate  and a specific one . furthermore, it is formally possible that ampkα may directly bind β-arrestin, because it contains a stretch of amino acids within its n-terminus that bears with similarity to a recently identified conserved region in jnk <dig> and camkγ, both of which constitutively bind β-arrestin- <dig>  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine whether ampkα directly binds β-arrestin- <dig>  whether it binds to the same region as jnk <dig> and camkγ and whether these proteins compete for interaction with β-arrestin- <dig>  while we demonstrated that interaction of β-arrestin- <dig> with ampk and camkkβ in cells was enhanced by activation of par <dig>  co-immunoprecipitation of all three proteins was observed in mouse fat in the absence of treatment, suggesting that this scaffolding complex may exist constitutively in vivo. our data suggest that association of β-arrestin- <dig> with these proteins is strengthened by par <dig> activation. the conformational rearrangement that β-arrestin- <dig> undergoes upon receptor binding may alter the nature of the contacts between these proteins resulting in the observed inhibitory effect. additional factors may also contribute to the inhibitory effect of β-arrestin- <dig> on ampk in vivo. for example, β-arrestin- <dig> has been shown to bind and inhibit calmodulin which could contribute to the inhibition of camkkβ activity in cells. β-arrestin- <dig> has also been shown to scaffold pp2a to one of its substrates and scaffolding of pp2a to ampk might further inhibit its phosphorylation <cit> . finally, β-arrestins also play a role in the desensitization of numerous receptors, ones that both activate and inactivate ampk, such as adiponectin receptor. thus, the absence of β-arrestin- <dig> may have the opposite effect on receptors that regulate ampk independent of camkkβ.

these findings are likely to have implications in terms of metabolic regulation, although this possibility was not specifically addressed here. there is increasing evidence that obesity can be viewed as an inflammatory disorder, associated with increased circulating inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration into fat, which in turn exacerbates defects associated with type  <dig> diabetes. par <dig> has been implicated in numerous inflammatory pathways and there is some evidence that β-arrestin levels can be altered under different physiological conditions  <cit>  and in a mouse model of insulin resistance  <cit> . β-arrestins have also been reported to contribute to insulin resistance by mediating a tnfα-induced inflammatory pathway <cit> . there are a number of potential physiologically relevant agonists of par <dig> in the tissues examined here. adipocytes secrete a trypsin-like enzyme called adipsin <cit>  that might activate par <dig> and diabetes is associated with increased levels of mast-cell infiltration into the fat, and increased release of tryptase, another physiological activator of par <dig> <cit> . factor viia, another known par <dig> agonist, is also reported to be elevated in diabetes and decreased with strenuous exercise <cit> . future studies should address whether par <dig> activation has different effects on parameters associated with obesity in wild type versus β-arrestin- <dig> knockout mice, and address the effects of par <dig> on fat synthesis in cells.

CONCLUSIONS
par <dig> can both activate and inhibit ampk through distinct signaling pathways. first, via activation of camkkβ and to a lesser extent lkb- <dig>  par <dig> can promote phosphorylation of ampk and subsequent phosphorylation of its downstream substrate acc. second, via coupling to β-arrestin- <dig>  par <dig> can inhibit ampk phosphorylation. this inhibitory effect is mediated by association of β-arrestin- <dig> with ampk and camkkβ, which results in direct inhibition of camkkβ activity.
