BACKGROUND
overlapping genes are known to be common in viruses, mitochondria, bacteria, and plasmids  <cit> , but are thought to be rare in eukaryotes. this view is changing because recent studies have suggested the existence of many overlapping genes in eukaryotic genomes, including human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , fish  <cit> , and flies  <cit> .

there are two principal types of overlap:  the same-strand overlapping type in which the two genes involved are transcribed from the same strand and  the different-strand overlapping type in which the two genes are transcribed from different strands. most of the recent large-scale analyses in higher eukaryotes have been restricted to different-strand-overlap genes, which are potential sense-antisense gene pairs in which the overlap can affect the regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription, mrna processing, splicing, or translation  <cit> . same-strand-overlap genes have been largely neglected, but a number of such genes have been shown to be functionally important  <cit> .

it is important to have a broad comparison between the two types of overlap. in this study we have compiled a list of orthologous gene pairs in human and mouse and identified overlapping genes in both species. we examined the respective frequencies of the two types of overlap and compared the lengths of overlapping regions in the two types. finally, we studied the evolutionary conservation of overlapping relationships between human and mouse and the possible mechanisms of transition between the overlapping and non-overlapping states.

RESULTS
frequencies of different types of overlap
different-strand overlaps are clearly more common than same-strand overlaps ; indeed, ~90% of the overlapping pairs are on opposite strands. interestingly, the pattern is opposite in prokaryotes. a study of overlapping genes in  <dig> microbial genomes revealed that ~84% of the overlapping genes are on the same strand  <cit> . there can be multiple reasons for the drastic difference in the prevalence of the two types of overlaps between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. it has been shown that in prokaryotes, same-strand overlaps  are mostly in the + <dig>  and + <dig>  reading frames, whereas different-strand overlaps  are evenly distributed in the three reading frames  <cit> . the pattern has been considered to be the product of the intensity of selective pressure on different types of overlaps and the level of independence derived from the plasticity in nucleotide sequence while maintaining a given amino acid sequence  <cit> . compared to the prokaryotes, most eukaryotes have introns and thus tend to have larger genomes. the more abundant different-strand overlaps in eukaryotes might be a joint effect of more complex gene structures and the role that these overlapping genes play in the regulation of gene expression.

 <dig> number of unique genes that are involved in overlap

based on the relative orientations of the genes involved in overlap, overlapping genes can be further classified into divergent , convergent , and embedded forms  for different-strand overlaps, and embedded and not-embedded forms for same-strand overlaps. table  <dig> shows that the majority of same-strand overlaps are embedded forms, accounting for ~89% and ~79% of overlapping genes in the human and mouse genomes, respectively. different-strand overlaps show a different pattern: in both species, convergent is the most common type , followed by embedded  and divergent forms .

we found no previous estimates of the frequencies of different types of same-strand overlaps. on the other hand, there have been some estimates on the proportions of the three types of different-strand overlap. for example, veeramachaneni et al.  found that ~54% are convergent, ~30% divergent, and ~16% embedded in a sample of  <dig> different-strand overlaps in human. a similar pattern was observed in mouse for a sample of  <dig> different-strand overlaps with ~54% convergent, ~37% divergent, and ~9% embedded forms. shendure and church  <cit>  reported that ~72% of  <dig> different-strand-overlap genes in human and mouse are convergent, ~22% are embedded forms, and only ~6% are divergent. lehner et al.  <cit>  and yelin et al.  <cit>  also examined the frequencies of different types of different-strand overlaps. a most recent study estimated 25–27% for the convergent, 27–30% for the divergent, and 43–48% for the embedded types of overlap  <cit> . therefore, estimates of the frequencies of different types of overlap differed considerably among studies. the differences can be due to a number of reasons such as small sample sizes, different computational methods used to identify sense and antisense genes, different criteria used to filter out spurious different-strand gene pairs, and different experimental data used for the evidence of transcription.

we also examined whether genes involved in overlap share coding regions or not . there are no same-strand-overlap genes that share coding regions; therefore, in the same-strand overlaps, one gene resides in another gene's introns. moreover, there are only  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes  that involve exon-exon overlaps on opposite strands in human and mouse, respectively. the dearth of genes that share coding regions suggests at least two possibilities. one might be selection against overlap in coding regions. since there is no selective pressure for a compact genome in eukaryotes  and since selection on genes sharing coding regions can be strong because overlap may cause interference in transcription, it is preferred that genes do not overlap with each other in coding regions. the second, perhaps the major reason, might be that the majority of overlapping genes evolved from non-overlapping genes, so that they originally had independent coding regions and merging of coding regions rarely occurs. compared with previous estimates, our estimates of the number of overlapping genes in coding regions are relatively low due to our stringent criterion of requiring that all genes studied here need to be one-to-one orthologs in human and mouse , which eliminates many genes in multi-gene families that have ambiguous ortholog assignments between human and mouse.

lengths of overlap regions
the distribution of lengths of overlap regions seems to reflect the degree of selective constraints on the length of overlap regions. the selective constraint appears to be stronger in different-strand overlaps than in same-strand overlaps. the length of overlap regions and the location of overlap regions in the genes  may determine the types of expression regulation or correlation between overlapping genes. for example, it has been shown that genes on different strands that overlap in their 5' utrs tend to have coordinated gene expression  <cit> , whereas genes that overlap in their 3' utrs seem to be mostly implicated in sense and antisense interaction that causes a negative association between genes' expression  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that the lengths of overlap regions can significantly influence the degree of transcriptional interference between cis natural antisense genes  – the longer the overlap region, the greater the transcriptional interference in cis-nats  <cit> . the study of the role of overlap in gene regulation is still in its infancy and much remains to be done to understand how overlapping genes interfere with each other's expression and function.

we calculated the ratios of the lengths of shorter and longer genes for overlapping gene pairs and compared them with the ratios of the lengths of the non-overlapping neighboring genes  in the sample of  <dig>  genes . the permutation tests show that genes involved in the same-strand overlaps have much lower length ratio than neighboring non-overlapping genes . this makes intuitive sense because most of the same-strand overlaps are in the form of one gene residing in the other gene's introns. for different-strand overlaps, this restriction on gene lengths appears to be not as pronounced, because the vast majority of different-strand overlaps are not embedded forms. however, in different-strand overlaps the length ratio is still significantly lower than the ratios in non-overlapping neighboring genes .

gain and loss of overlapping genes
we examined the shared overlapping relationship between human and mouse. we counted the cases where one gene overlaps with multiple genes as single overlaps. for same-strand overlaps, only  <dig> pairs of overlapping genes are shared between human and mouse,  <dig> pairs show overlap in human but not in mouse, and  <dig> pairs show overlap in mouse but not in human. in contrast, for different-strand overlaps, the proportion of shared overlaps between mouse and human is much higher:  <dig> pairs are shared between the two species,  <dig> pairs show overlap in human but not in mouse, and  <dig> pairs show overlap in mouse but not in human. therefore, different-strand overlaps are three times more likely to be conserved in the two species than same-strand overlaps . a similar observation was made earlier in a comparison of overlapping genes in human and fugu where ~ <dig> % of different-strand consecutive relationships were found to be shared between human and fugu, though only  <dig> % of the same-strand gene pairs were found to be shared between the two organisms  <cit> .

an interesting question on the evolution of overlapping genes is, "how many overlap gains and losses have occurred in the human and mouse lineages since their divergence"? to address this question, we also examined the overlapping states of the orthologous genes in three other completed mammalian genomes, rhesus macaque, rat, and dog. we required that both genes of an overlapping pair have one-to-one orthologous relationships to the genes in the three additional species, which is a very stringent criterion and reduces greatly the number of gene pairs for our analysis. but it also ensures the confidence in our inference. using this criterion, we were left with  <dig> pairs for this analysis . we found that there have been  <dig> and  <dig> gains of same-strand overlap in the human and mouse lineage, respectively. for different-strand overlaps, there have been  <dig> gains of overlap in human, of which  <dig> occurred in the ancestral lineage of human and macaque,  <dig> gains of overlap in mouse, of which  <dig> gains occurred in the ancestral lineage of mouse and rat,  <dig> losses of overlap in mouse, of which  <dig> occurred in the ancestral lineage of mouse and rat, and  <dig> losses of overlap in human, of which  <dig> occurred in the ancestral lineage of human and macaque.

caution must be taken in interpreting the results. although we took steps in minimizing impact of annotation errors on the analysis, we can not guarantee absolute accuracy. it is well-known that the annotation of utr is difficult, especially with 5' utrs. therefore, it is likely that some of the gains and losses of overlaps seen here are actually annotation artifact. in addition to the annotation problem, incomplete sequencing can also contribute to some of the non-conserved overlaps.

mechanisms of the nonoverlapping-overlapping transition
the observation that less than 30% of the overlaps are shared between human and mouse suggests fast gain and/or loss of overlapping genes. however, could the low extent of shared overlapping relationships between species be in part due to inaccurate ortholog assignment? imagine, for instance, gene a and gene b overlap in human, gene a is correctly assigned to its mouse ortholog gene a', whereas gene b is mistakenly assigned to mouse gene c. the observation that gene a and gene c do not overlap in mouse can mislead us to conclude that the overlap is not conserved between species. therefore, it is important to make sure that the two genes involved in overlap in one species both have correct ortholog assignment in the other species. since we only used the ortholog prediction in ensembl, it is likely that some of them are wrong. we therefore cross-validated the ensembl human-mouse ortholog prediction using  <dig> additional ortholog prediction databases including hgnc  <cit> , homologene at ncbi  <cit> , inparanoid  <cit> , mgi  <cit> , phigs  <cit> , and treefam  <cit> . these databases, together with ensembl, have independent methods of ortholog prediction and rely on information extracted from either sequences, phylogenetic trees, chromosomal synteny, or some combinations of these aspects. therefore, the more databases predict an ortholog assignment, the higher confidence we have for the assignment. we found that in  <dig> of the  <dig> pairs that show non-conserved overlap relationships, the ortholog assignments of one or both genes in a pair have no other database support except ensembl; the remaining  <dig> pairs have both genes whose ortholog assignments have multiple database support; in fact, the majority of the  <dig> pairs have more than four databases predicting the same ortholog assignment . therefore, the majority of our ortholog assignments are likely accurate and incorrect ortholog assignment likely contributes little to the low extent of conserved overlaps between human and mouse.

then what is the cause for the low extent of shared overlapping relationships between human and mouse? in other words, what could be the mechanisms for the fast evolutionary switches between overlapping and non-overlapping genes? one likely mechanism for the switch between overlapping and non-overlapping states is genome rearrangement. it might explain the situation where the two genes under study overlap in one species but are on different chromosomes in the other species. for example,  <dig> mouse pairs that are orthologous to the human same-strand overlaps are located on different chromosomes and  <dig> mouse pairs that are orthologous to the human different-strand overlaps are located on different chromosomes. however, these genes amount to less than 4% of the non-conserved gene pairs. therefore, genome rearrangement is not a major cause for the transition.

a more likely mechanism for the switch is utr change, because the majority of the non-conserved overlapping cases are such that the genes that overlap in only one species are located on the same chromosome in the other species. as indicated in figure  <dig>  for two genes that are neighboring on the same chromosome, the transition between overlapping and non-overlapping states can be simply a matter of gain or loss of either 5' utr, 3' utr, or both. for example, a gain of convergent different-strand-overlap genes is fairly simple. the disappearance of a transcription termination site will elongate the rna transcript and the transcription may run into the 3' of the neighboring gene, so that the two genes become overlap in the 3' end. this may also apply to the case of parallel same-strand neighboring genes, that is, the elongated transcription of an upstream gene may run into the 5' end of the neighboring gene. on the other hand, a gain of divergent different-strand-overlap genes can occur when the transcription start site  of a gene moves in the 5' direction, so that it includes the tss of the neighboring gene. similarly, the loss of convergent different-strand overlaps is simple, namely, the move of a transcription stop site in the 5' direction will shorten the transcription and the overlap may thus disappear. the same comment applies to the case of a parallel overlap.

given that utr changes seem to be the major mechanism for the evolutionary switch, we asked the question: what are the relative contributions of 5' change and 3' change? here we were able to computationally determine whether the switch between overlapping and non-overlapping states is due to 5' change or 3' change by taking advantage of the orthologous gene set and comparing the chromosomal arrangements between overlaps and non-overlaps in human and mouse . for the same-strand overlaps, the majority of transitions  were due to 3' end change and the remaining due to 5' end change ; the chi-square goodness-of-fit test for equal proportions of 5' and 3' changes is marginally significant . for the different-strand overlaps, the majority of transitions  were due to 3' end change; the chi-square goodness-of-fit test for equal proportions of 5' and 3' changes is highly significant .

several previous studies examined the transition between overlapping and non-overlapping genes in eukaryotes. for example, shintani et al.  <cit>  studied the evolutionary origin of tcp <dig> and acat <dig> that overlap in their 3' utr on different strands and suggested that the overlap arose during the transitions from therapsid reptiles to mammals and has been retained for > <dig> million years. they proposed that the two genes were brought together and became overlapping during a chromosome rearrangement. dan et al.  <cit>  examined the origin of the overlapping genes of mink and chrne and found that the two genes overlap in some mammals but not others owing to different usages of alternative polyadenylation sites.

besides these studies that examined individual cases of overlapping genes in eukaryotes, there have not been any systematic investigations of the causes for the transitions between overlapping and non-overlapping genes, especially for same-strand overlaps. here, our results on ~ <dig> pairs of overlapping genes in the two mammalian genomes indicate that 3' utr evolution  plays a major role in the transition. this seems to be consistent with the recent finding that at least half of all human genes encode multiple transcripts with alternative 3' termini  <cit> . the higher frequency of transition contributed by 3' utr changes than by 5' utr changes implies that it is easier to capture and utilize a downstream alternative termination signal than an upstream alternative start signal. we can get a rough estimate on the respective rates of the two utrs' evolution. under the assumption of  <dig> million years for the divergence time between human and mouse, and the observations that among the total of  <dig> overlapping gene pairs, there are at least  <dig> pairs that have gain or loss of 3' utr and  <dig> pairs that have gain or loss of 5' utrs, we estimate that the transition due to 3' utr change occurs at a rate of ~ <dig>  per gene pair per billion years and that due to 5' utr change occurs at a rate of ~ <dig>  per gene pair per billion years. thus, rates of gain or loss of utrs are only somewhat lower than rates of point mutation.

these estimates should be taken with caution as they are crude; although they tend to be conservative, their accuracy can be only as good as the annotation quality of utrs. another word of caution is that the higher rate of 3' utr evolution than 5' utr could also be partially due to more accurate 3' utr annotations. since annotation of utrs relies to a large extent on ests  and since ests are biased towards the 3'end of a gene, it is expected that 3' utrs are better annotated than 5' utr; thus, alternative usage of 3' utrs in genes will be more frequently recognized than that of 5' utrs.

CONCLUSIONS
when gene structure becomes better annotated, we might discover that many genes have multiple alternative 5' or 3' utrs for transcription, so that two neighboring genes may become overlapping with each other in certain transcribed forms. thus, it is likely that overlapping genes are even more common than estimated in this study.
