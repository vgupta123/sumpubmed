BACKGROUND
pioglitazone , a member of the thiazolidinedione  class of antidiabetic agents and agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ   <cit> , improves insulin sensitivity both in the liver and peripheral tissues. the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. however, they are attributed to the actions of tzds on pparγ  <cit> . after activating pparγ receptors, tzds induce adipocyte differentiation and remodeling of adipose tissue in vitro and in vivo <cit> . it is believed that signals derived from the adipose tissue  may mediate the improvement in skeletal glucose disposal induced by tzds  <cit> . however, it is also likely that other mechanisms independent of pparγ may contribute to tzd effects on insulin sensitivity  <cit> . thus, in vitro studies have shown that tzds elevate lactate production by skeletal muscle  <cit> , suggesting an inhibition of cell respiration  <cit> . in fact, several authors have found that the activity of complex i of the mitochondrial respiratory chain , state  <dig> respiration, and glucose oxidation were reduced in homogenates of skeletal muscle treated with increased doses of tzds  <cit> . pparγ does not seem to be involved in these effects of tzds  <cit> , since they inhibited complex i in sonicated tissue homogenates containing disrupted mitochondria  <cit> .

complex i  is the first and the largest of the four multiprotein complexes that constitute the mrc involved in oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . this complex is formed by at least  <dig> subunits,  <dig> of which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and the remaining  <dig> by the nuclear genome  <cit> . the crystal structure of the entire thermus thermophilus complex i has been recently reported  <cit> . in previous studies, we have shown that pgz suppressed the activity of complex i of the mrc in ob/ob mice, but the mechanisms of this effect are still unclear  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to determine the mechanisms by which pgz decreases mrc activity. we show that pgz binds subunits located in the membrane arm of complex i of the mrc, which induces disassembly of this complex, reduces its enzymatic activity, depletes cellular atp, and consequently upregulates nuclear dna-encoded gene expression of complex i subunits.

RESULTS
pgz decreased activity of complexes i and iii of the mrc in isolated mouse liver mitochondria
as the mrc plays a critical role in the conversion of nadh and fadh <dig> into nad and fad, respectively, and in the generation of atp from adp  <cit> , we measured the in vitro effect of increasing concentrations  of pgz on the activity of mrc complexes isolated from mouse liver. the activity of complex i, which accepts electrons from nadh and transfers them to ubiquinone, decreased in a dose-dependent manner from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein in untreated mitochondria  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein  in mitochondria treated with  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> minutes . to correct for mitochondrial volume, all respiratory chain enzyme activities were normalized to the activity of citrate synthase .

the activity of complex ii , which passes electrons directly to ubiquinone, was not affected significantly by pgz treatment  .

ubiquinone passes electrons from complex i and ii to the b-c <dig> complex , which transfers them to cytochrome c. the activity of complex iii also significantly decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein  .

cytochrome c is involved in carrying electrons from the b-c <dig> complex to the cytochrome oxidase complex , which finally transfers these electrons to oxygen. measurement of the activity of this complex in liver mitochondria exposed to increasing concentrations of pgz revealed that this drug did not affect complex iv activity ) .

atp synthase or complex v of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway converts adp into atp when protons flow back from the intermembrane space into the mitochondrial matrix. the activity of this complex was not significantly affected by treatment with pgz  .

treatment of mice with pgz decreased activity of complex i of the mrc
we also studied the effects of pgz on the activity of mrc complexes in c57bl/6j mice. in these animals, treatment with  <dig> mg pgz/kg/day for  <dig> weeks significantly decreased the activity of complex i  from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein in control animals to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein in pgz-treated mice , but not the activity of complexes ii , iii , iv , and v  .

treatment with pgz disassembled complex i in vitro and in vivo
in order to know whether pgz alters assembly of mrc complexes, we exposed  <dig> μg of isolated mitochondria from normal liver to either  <dig> or  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> to  <dig> minutes. as figure 2a shows, pgz decreased the band corresponding to the fully assembled complex i and determined the formation of several lower molecular weight bands  in which the ndufa <dig> subunit was also present. these effects were dose and time dependent. these changes were more evident at  <dig> minutes of treatment with  <dig> μm pgz. as figure 2b shows, two of these subcomplexes  maintained in-gel enzymatic activity. treatment of liver mitochondria with  <dig> μm pgz did not affect assembly of complexes ii, iii, and iv .

to determine whether pgz treatment also alters assembly of mrc complexes in mice, liver mitochondria isolated from c57bl/6j mice untreated and treated for  <dig> weeks with  <dig> mg/kg/day pgz via intragastric intubation were separated using a one-dimensional blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  system and analyzed by western blot using antibody against the complex i subunit ndufa <dig>  complex ii subunit sdha, complex iii subunit core  <dig> , complex iv subunit cox <dig>  and complex v subunit atp5a <dig>  as figure 2c illustrates, animals treated with pgz displayed a clear increase in the fully-assembled complex i as compared to untreated, control mice. in addition, similar to in vitro studies, two other subcomplexes of  <dig> and  <dig> kda, respectively, were detected. the bands corresponding to the remaining four complexes were not affected by pgz treatment. although fully assembled complex i was increased in pgz-treated mice, its in-gel activity was clearly decreased .

pgz altered formation of respiratory supercomplexes
to investigate how pgz affects the formation of respiratory supercomplexes, we performed bn-page using the detergent digitonin instead of n-dodecylmaltoside. this condition allows loose interaction to remain intact. we found that complex i was present in the monomeric form and in two additional supercomplexes also containing complex iii dimer  or complex iii dimer and complex iv . treatment of liver mitochondria with  <dig> μm pgz led to a marked decrease in the monomeric complex i and in both supercomplexes ci+ciii <dig> and ci+ciii2+civn. this decrease in supercomplex formation was due to a reduced accumulation of complexes i, iii, and iv . moreover, formation of supercomplex ciii+civ was increased after pgz treatment.

compared to untreated mice, in liver mitochondria isolated from mice treated with  <dig> mg/kg/day pgz for  <dig> weeks, we found that monomeric complex i was unchanged and supercomplexes ci+ciii2+civn and ci+ciii <dig> were markedly increased. likewise, supercomplex ciii+civ was also augmented .

pgz disassembled the membrane arm of complex i
with the intention of characterize subcomplexes formed after in vitro treatment of isolated mitochondria with  <dig> μm pgz, we analyzed the presence of representative subunits of intermediates in the assembly process following the model proposed by mimaki et al.  <cit> . thus, after pgz treatment, mrc complexes were separated as previously described using first-dimension bn-page, blotted, and analyzed by western blot using antibodies against subunits of complex i ndufa <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufv <dig>  ndufv <dig>  ndufs <dig>  ndufs <dig>  ndufs <dig>  ndufb <dig>  ndufb <dig>  ndufc <dig>  mtnd <dig>  and mtnd <dig>  as figure 3a shows, in addition to the  <dig> kda fully assembled complex i, we found subunits ndufv <dig>  ndufv <dig>  ndufs <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufs <dig>  ndufs <dig>  mtnd <dig>  ndufb <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufa <dig> in an approximately  <dig> kda molecular weight subcomplex b. likewise, subunits ndufv <dig>  ndufv <dig>  ndufs <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufs <dig>  ndufs <dig>  and ndufa <dig>  but not mtnd <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufb <dig>  were found in a  <dig> kda subcomplex c. in an approximately  <dig> kda subcomplex d, subunits mtnd <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufb <dig> were present, all of them belonging to the membrane arm of complex i. finally, subunits ndufc <dig> and mtnd <dig> were found in an approximately  <dig> kda subcomplex e.

two-dimensional analysis of complex i confirmed that treatment of liver mitochondria with  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> minutes disassembled complex i as indicated by the presence of its subunits in the mature fully assembled complex  and four additional subcomplexes of about  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda, respectively . subcomplex b contained subunits ndufv <dig>  ndufv <dig>  and ndufs <dig> that are part of the nadh:dehydrogenase module, ndufb <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and mtnd <dig>  belonging to the membrane arm of the complex, and subunits ndufa <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufs <dig>  and ndufs <dig> forming part of the hydrogenase module of complex i. subunits ndufv <dig>  ndufv <dig>  and ndufs <dig> and subunits ndufa <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufs <dig>  and ndnfs <dig> belonging to the hydrogenase module were present in subcomplex c. the subcomplex d of about  <dig> kda contained at least subunits mtnd <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufb <dig>  all of them forming part of the membrane arm. finally, subcomplex e contained at least subunits ndufc <dig> and mtnd <dig>  also members of the membrane arm.

examination of representative subunits of complexes ii , iii , iv , and v  showed that only subunit core  <dig> was modified by treatment with pgz . thus, this subunit appeared distributed in one additional subcomplex of about  <dig> kda.

pgz decreased prohibitin and assembly factors ndufaf <dig> , and foxred <dig> in mouse liver mitochondria
because it is known that a number of proteins are involved in maintaining the stability of complex i, we investigated whether in vitro isolated mitochondria treatment with  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> minutes affected mitochondrial prohibitin, ndufaf <dig> , or foxred <dig>  three proteins involved in the assembly/stability of complex i. as figure  <dig> shows, the amount of prohibitin clearly decreased in mitochondrial protein exposed to pgz . similarly, for ndufaf <dig> , we found that after pgz treatment these two signals were less intense and a third band of about  <dig> kda appeared between them . finally, foxred <dig>  that originated a signal at  <dig> kda of molecular weight in untreated proteins, was not recognized in pgz-treated proteins . likewise, second-dimension analysis of ndufaf <dig> and foxred <dig> proteins via sodium dodecyl sulfate -page confirmed these effects of pgz. thus, after pgz treatment, the signal for foxred <dig> disappeared completely, and ndufaf <dig> was distributed in three spots .

pgz binds to complex i subunits ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufa6
to investigate whether pgz interacts with complex i or with any of its subunits, we exposed isolated liver mitochondria to  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> minutes. as shown in figure 4c, pgz binds to mitochondrial proteins of about  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda molecular weight. to identify subunits that pgz was bound to, we treated isolated mitochondria with  <dig> μm pgz and complex i subunits were separated in parallel on two sds/bn-page gels as indicated in methods. autoradiography showed that pgz was bound particularly to a subunit of  <dig> kda, but also to subunits of  <dig> and  <dig> kda that overlapped the signals originated by ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufa <dig>  respectively . the binding of pgz to these subunits was confirmed by immunoprecipitating mitochondrial subunits after treating isolated mitochondria with  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> minutes .

treatment with pgz increased mitochondrial gene transcription in mice liver and hepg <dig> cells
because fully assembled complex i was increased in mice treated with pgz for  <dig> weeks, we examined the steady-state levels of nuclear dna -encoded  mrna and mitochondrial dna -encoded  mrna in the liver from ten control mice and in ten mice treated with  <dig> mg pgz/kg/day for  <dig> weeks. this experiment revealed that gene expression of complex i subunits encoded by the ndna was increased by 30% to 50% over control levels in pgz-treated mice , whereas expression of mtdna encoded complex i subunits remained at the control levels in pgz-treated mice. gene expression of complex iii subunit core  <dig> was also significantly increased in these mice.

to ensure that pgz increases gene expression of mrc subunits, we treated hepg <dig> cells with  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> days and measured expression of complex i subunits ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  ndufs <dig>  complex iii subunits uqcrc <dig>  uqcrc <dig>  and uqcrfs <dig>  complex iv subunit cox <dig>  and complex ii subunit sdha. as figure 5b shows, treatment of cells with pgz increased gene expression of complex i subunits by 30% and complex iii by 20% to 30%, but did not increase significantly gene expression of complex ii and iv subunits.

pgz reduced intracellular atp content and upregulated gene expression of specific protein  <dig>  and pparγ coactivator 1α  in hepg <dig> cells
to determine whether pgz modifies intracellular atp content, hepg <dig> cells were cultured in the absence or presence of  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> days. as figure 5c shows, treatment of cells with  <dig> μm pgz decreased cellular atp from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg protein to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/mg protein . to examine whether pgz modifies gene expression of transcription factors involved in the regulation of gene encoding mrc proteins, we exposed hepg <dig> cells to  <dig> μm pgz for  <dig> days and measured gene expression of sp <dig>  estrogen related receptor α , and pgc-1α of the mrc by real-time polymerase chain reaction . we found that pgz treatment increased significantly gene expression of sp <dig> and pgc-1α, but not of errα .

discussion
our results shows that in vitro pgz significantly inhibits complex i activity and, less intensely but also significantly, complex iii in isolated liver mitochondria. likewise, treatment of mice with pgz for  <dig> weeks at a dose that has demonstrated to have pharmacologic effects   <cit>  resulted in a significant decrease in complex i, but not complex iii, activity. these results are consistent with those obtained by others with pgz and other tzds  <cit>  and with those we have previously reported in ob/ob mice  <cit> . although some authors found that this effect of pgz on complex i activity was not dose-dependent  <cit> , we found a clear relationship between the dose of pgz and the decrease in complex activity . in contrast, we found no effects of pgz on complex ii, iv, or v activity.

mechanisms by which pgz decreases complex i and iii activity are not well understood. complex i transfers two electrons from nadh to ubiquinone, represents the main entrance site for electrons into the mrc, and translocates four protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane  <cit> . it is composed of two arms forming an l-shaped structure. one arm is hydrophobic and is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, whereas the other arm is hydrophilic and protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix. while the hydrophilic arm is formed by subunits involved in electron transfer from nadh to ubiquinone, the membrane arm is responsible for the proton translocation  <cit> .

activity of complex i can be reduced as a result of a large number of factors including mutations in complex i subunits  <cit> , physiological molecules, such as nitric oxide  <cit> , drugs, such as rotenone and tzd  <cit> , or oxygen or nitrogen derived reactive substances such as peroxynitrite  <cit> . moreover, defects in the assembly/stability of this complex may also result in a reduced activity of complex i.

our study shows that pgz affects the stability of complex i as indicated by the presence of its subunits in the mature holoenzyme and four additional lower molecular weight subcomplexes with apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda, respectively. the assembly process of complex i is still not completely understood and a number of different assembly models have been proposed  <cit> . however, in our study, the presence of these four additional subcomplexes cannot be attributed to an effect of pgz on the assembly process, in as much as we added the pgz to mitochondria isolated from the liver of a normal mouse in which complexes are fully assembled as shown in control untreated proteins. therefore, formation of these four subcomplexes may be the result of the fragmentation of complex i into subcomplexes. the subcomplex b of approximately  <dig> kda of molecular weight has nadh:dehydrogenase activity  and contains the same subunits as the mature holoenzyme a, except subunits nadufc <dig> and mtnd <dig> , which appear in the small subcomplex e of about  <dig> kda. following the assembly model proposed by mimaki et al.  <cit> , these subunits are components of a subcomplex also containing subunit mtnd <dig> that bind to the distal end of the membrane arm of complex i . thus, subcomplexes b and e may be the result of the detachment of this distal end of the mature complex i. the subcomplex d, of about  <dig> kda of molecular weight, contains subunits mtnd <dig>  ndufb <dig> and ndufb <dig> of the membrane arm of complex i, but not the remaining studied subunits. therefore, this subcomplex may also correspond to a fragment that has been detached from the membrane arm of subcomplex b . the subcomplex c, of approximately  <dig> kda of molecular weight and with nadh:dehydrogenase activity , may be the remaining fragment of complex i after having lost subcomplexes e and d .

mechanisms by which pgz destabilizes complex i are unclear. a number of factors have been recognized to be implicated in the assembly/stabilization of complex i, including complex iii  <cit> , ndufaf <dig>   <cit> , ndufaf <dig>   <cit> , ndufa <dig> complex i subunit  <cit> , foxred <dig>  <cit> , and prohibitin  <cit> , among others. although our study shows that in vitro treatment of isolated mitochondria with pgz markedly altered these proteins, we do not believe that the pgz-induced disassembly of complex i resulted from the effects of pgz on these stabilizing proteins, as some of these proteins  dissociate before complex i is completely assembled and are not found in the mature holoenzyme  <cit> . prohibitin, a protein that likely prevents complex degradation by aaa-metalloproteinases  <cit> , decreased in parallel with fully assembled complex i . however, our study cannot differentiate whether pgz-induced complex i fragmentation was the result of the reduced amount of prohibitin or, on the contrary, prohibitin bound to complex i was reduced because pgz had decreased fully assembled complex i. in the case of ndufaf <dig>  a chaperone not found associated with mature complex i, pgz induced its binding to a new complex of  <dig> kda, likely the subcomplex b formed after fragmentation of complex i. . the effect of pgz on foxred <dig> is difficult to interpret as very little is known about the function of this protein  <cit> . we are not aware of other studies that have been published on the effects of tzds on prohibitin or other chaperone proteins.

our study also shows the binding of radiolabeled pgz to mature complex i and subcomplexes of  <dig> and  <dig> kda of molecular weight . little information is available in the literature concerning the interaction of tzd with complex i proteins, although it has been suggested that pparγ ligands interact directly with this complex  <cit> . only colca et al. have studied the interaction of pgz with mitochondrial membranes and found that radiolabeled pgz binds to a 17-kda mitochondrial protein  <cit> . our study shows the binding of pgz to complex i components, particularly to ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufa <dig> subunits . these subunits are hydrophobic and are situated in the inner mitochondrial membrane. tzd, like other inhibitors of this complex  <cit> , are highly lipophilic and bind mitochondrial membrane  <cit> . thus, we could speculate that molecular changes induced by the binding of pgz to these subunits may destabilize complex i resulting in the progressive fragmentation of its membrane arm.

the decrease in complex iii activity observed after in vitro treatment of mitochondria with pgz may be ascribed to the fact that complexes i and iii interact physically to form supercomplexes that improves electron transfer between them  <cit>  and stabilizes complex iii  <cit> . therefore, pgz-induced disassembly of complex i may also indirectly compromise complex iii stability and activity. in accordance with these facts, our study shows that in vitro addition of pgz to isolated mitochondria reduced not only the amount of complex i, but also the formation of supercomplexes ci+ciii2+civn and ci+ciii <dig> . in contrast, supercomplexes ci+ciii2+civn and ci+ciii <dig> were clearly increased in mice treated with pgz for  <dig> weeks. this increase in the formation of supercomplexes in pgz-treated mice, may justify why complex iii activity remained normal in these animals . this elevated accumulation of complex i and iii to form supercomplexes might be a consequence of the association of mrc complexes to form more efficient respiratory structures  <cit>  that might compensate the reduced activity of complex i and iii of the mrc. this increase in supercomplex formation may also contribute to the elevated synthesis of complex i and iii subunits.

the present study also shows that treatment of mice with pgz for  <dig> weeks increased the amount of fully assembled complex i , although its activity was significantly decreased . similar to what occurred in in vitro studies, these in vivo studies demonstrated the presence of two additional subcomplexes of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda  indicating that complex i was also disassembled. the increased amount of fully assembled complex i found in pgz-treated mice may be ascribed to the fact that gene expression of nuclear dna-encoded complex i subunits was significantly increased . our study shows that pgz increased gene expression of complex i and, to a lesser extent, complex iii subunits in mice and hepg <dig> cells . these effects may be interpreted as a compensatory response to the decreased activity of these complexes found after treatment with pgz. transcription of mrc subunits is coordinated with energetic needs of the cells. thus, the cellular pool of atp, the primary end product of oxidative phosphorylation, plays a key role in the control of nuclear and mitochondrial transcription  <cit> . in the present study we clearly show that incubation of hepg <dig> cells with pgz significantly decreased cellular content of atp . therefore, it might be expected that decreased atp formation as a result of the pgz-induced complex i inhibition might lead to an increased transcription of some components of the mrc. the lack of increased expression of mtdna-encoded subunits in pgz-treated mice may be attributed to the reduced ability of cells to repair mtdna damage  <cit> . a large number of transcription factors have been shown to be involved in the regulation of genes encoding mrc proteins and assembly factors, including stimulatory protein  <dig> , errα, and transcriptional coactivator pparγ , among others  <cit> . in particular, transcriptional coactivator pgc1α plays a critical role in adaptation mechanisms to caloric restriction and atp reduction  <cit> . in our study, we show that treatment of mice with pgz or exposition of hepg <dig> cells to pgz induced the expression of transcription factors sp <dig> and particularly pgc1α . very little information is available about the effects of tzd on gene expression of components of the mrc and its regulatory factors. strum et al. found that rosiglitazone increases expression of genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in mice and that this effect was associated with an increased level of errα mrna but not of pgc1α mrna  <cit> . however, boden et al. found that troglitazone and other tzds, upregulated gene expression and synthesis of proteins involved in electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in subcutaneous fat  <cit> , and mensink et al. demonstrated that rosiglitazone increased pgc1α gene expression in patients with type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in the present study we show that pgz binds complex i subunits, likely ndufa <dig>  ndub <dig>  and ndufa <dig>  which may induce disassembly of this complex, reduces its activity, depletes cellular atp, and, in mice and hepg <dig> cells, upregulates nuclear dna-encoded gene expression of complex i and iii subunits. elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which pgz binding provokes disassembly of complex i requires further studies.
