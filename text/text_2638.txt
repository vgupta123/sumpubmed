BACKGROUND
the ascomycetous family of chaetomiaceae  includes numerous soilborn, saprotrophic, endophytic and pathogenic fungi that apparently exhibit a large flexibility in their adaptation to various growth conditions and living niches. in mycobank  currently up to  <dig> members of this abundant fungal family are registered but only from two representatives  the completely sequenced genomes are available. analysis of the genome of c. thermophilum  <cit>  mainly focused on the presence of genes coding for nucleoporins of high thermal stability, whereas the draft genome of chaetomium globosum  <cit>  was mainly asked for diverse genes coding cellulolytic pathways.

the filamentous fungus chaetomium cochliodes was long considered to be a variant of chaetomium globosum  but already in very early studies e.g.  <cit>  it was shown that c. cochliodes produces the antibiotic chaetomin which was shown to be highly active mainly against gram-positive bacteria. additionally, studies from our laboratory revealed differences between c. globosum and c. cochliodes in the primary sequence and expression profile of peroxisomal catalase-peroxidases  <cit> . these findings – together with the fact that peroxidases participate in diverse fungal secondary metabolism pathways  – prompted us to sequence the entire genome of chaetomium cochliodes strain ccm-f <dig> for detailed comparative studies.

here we release the draft genome of c. cochliodes, reconstruct its phylogeny and analyse the occurrence of abundant genes coding for heme containing peroxidases and catalases with respect to the recently described four distinct heme peroxidase superfamilies  <cit>  and the heme catalase super family  <cit> . interestingly, representatives from all five families were found including putative bifunctional catalase-peroxidase, cytochrome c peroxidase, hybrid b peroxidases, cyclooxygenase-like enzymes, dye-decolorizing peroxidases, heme thiolate peroxidases as well as large- and small-subunit monofunctional catalases. the occurrence of this large number and variability of genes encoding heme hydroperoxidases in c. cochliodes is discussed in comparison with related fungal genomes. we support our genomic findings with a first round of a quantitative expression analysis of selected genes from all mentioned superfamilies involved in the catabolism of h2o <dig> 

methods
source and cultivation of chaetomium cochliodes and isolation of genomic dna
chaetomium cochliodes ccm f- <dig> was obtained from czech collection of microorganisms at the masaryk university, faculty of natural sciences in brno, czech republic. the composition of the incubation medium and the growth conditions were the same as described previously  <cit> .

genomic dna from 100 mg of frozen fungal mycelium was isolated with the method of carlson  <cit>  by using 2 % ctab in a modification suitable for genome sequencing described in  <cit> . finally, extracted dna was completely dissolved in te buffer  to a final volume of 100 μl. the concentration of obtained sample was measured in nanodrop  <dig> .

library preparation for dna sequencing
approximately 1 μg of high quality genomic dna was fragmented in 50 μl low te buffer  by bioruptor ucd- <dig> sonication system  to obtain a population of ~190 bp long fragments. the length and the quantity of generated fragments were assessed by bioanalyzer chip technology  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the protocol of the library builder™ system  was used for adaptor ligation, nick repair and fragment purification. the selection of 270 bp long fragments was conducted by the pippin prep instrument  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. library quantification was carried out using the taqman qpcr protocol of life technologies.

genomic dna sequencing and orf prediction
whole genome sequencing was carried out using the ion proton technology , according to the instructions of the manufacturer. a total of  <dig>  mbp, with a median read length of 180 bp, were assembled into a draft genome containing  <dig> contigs . the genome assembly was performed with newbler  <dig> . genome coverage of this sequencing was  <dig> x. the entire genome shotgun project was deposited at genbank under accession lsby <dig>  bioproject prjna <dig>  biosample samn <dig>  for comparative genomic analyses of chaetomium cochliodes genes ensembl fungi  was used.

for gene prediction in sequenced c. cochliodes contigs, hmm-based methods fgenesh and fgenesh+ located at www.softberry.com  <cit>  trained for closely related c. globosum & c. thermophilum were used. for all peroxidase and catalase genes they were also curated manually.

reconstruction of fungal phylogeny
selected dna sequence spanning the region from the 3′ end of the 18s rdna, the complete its <dig>   <dig> s rdna, its <dig> and the 5′ end of the 28s rdna from corresponding c. cochliodes contigs was aligned with  <dig> related sequences from ascomycetes in exactly the same region obtained from genbank . this dna alignment was performed with the muscle program  <cit>  implemented in mega  <dig> package with its default parameters and  <dig> iterations. for subsequent phylogeny reconstruction mega  <dig> program suite  <cit>  was applied on this 2474 bp long dna alignment containing the typical fungal barcode motif  <cit> . maximum likelihood method with  <dig> bootstrap replications and general time reversed substitution model were applied. further, uniform rates of substitutions with invariant sites and involvement of all aligned sites with nearest-neighbour interchange and very strong branch swap filter were selected as optimised parameters. the resulting tree was rendered with tree explorer of the same mega package. for additional verification, the same 2474 bp long dna alignment was subjected to phylogeny reconstruction using mrbayes  <dig>   <cit> . majority consensus tree was obtained from all credible topologies sampled by mrbayes over  <dig>  generations  by using the same gtr substitution model with gamma distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites.table  <dig> list of all dna sequences with their genbank accession numbers used for phylogeny reconstruction in the region 18s, its <dig>   <dig> s, its <dig>  28s-rdna



reconstruction of molecular phylogeny of protein superfamilies
selected protein sequences translated from c. cochliodes contigs  and similar protein sequences coding for various peroxidases and catalases  were aligned with the muscle program  <cit>  using default parameters and  <dig> iterations. obtained alignments were inspected and ambiguously aligned regions were excluded from further analysis. resulting alignments were subjected to protein phylogeny reconstruction using mega  <dig>  <cit>  with optimized parameters according to lowest bayesian information criterion scores . maximum likelihood method with  <dig> bootstraps was chosen using the best substitution model for each alignment , gamma distribution of rates  and the presence of invariant sites. nearest-neighbour interchange was used as heuristic method and very strong branch swap filter was applied. the same protein alignments were subjected to phylogeny reconstruction using mrbayes  <dig>   <cit> . majority consensus tree was obtained from all credible topologies sampled by mrbayes over  <dig>  generations  by using the same substitution model as in mega. resulting trees were rendered with figtree graphic suite available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree as cladograms with transformed branches.table  <dig> list of potentially all genes coding for enzymes involved in h2o <dig> metabolism in contigs of c. cochliodes genome

transcriptional analysis of genes involved in peroxide catabolism with rt-qpcr
to study the level of expression of genes involved in peroxide catabolism either non-induced c. cochliodes samples or samples induced in the early exponential phase of growth with 5 mm h2o <dig> or 5 mm paa  were used for total rna isolation with rneasy plus mini kit . obtained rna samples were directly subjected to rt-qpcr assays in ariamx <dig> device  using the brilliant iii ultra fast sybr green master mix  with specific primers for selected genes listed in table  <dig> table  <dig> list of primers for c.cochliodes peroxidase & catalase genes



RESULTS
overview of the sequenced genome of chaetomium cochliodes ccm f-232
in total  <dig> contigs were obtained from the genomic dna of c. cochliodes strain ccm f- <dig> deposited at genbank under accession lsby <dig>  bioproject prjna <dig>  biosample samn <dig>   <dig> of these contigs were larger than 500 bp. the genome size of the complete assembly was determined to be  <dig> ,808 bp. this value is very near to previously determined size of closely related c. globosum   <cit> . the gc content of the entire genome of c. cochliodes was estimated to  <dig>  % which is a slight difference to the corresponding value for c. globosum . the average size of c. cochliodes large genomic contigs  in this experiment was determined as 8256 bp, the n <dig> contig size was  <dig>  bp and the largest assembled contig comprised  <dig>  bp. as a quality control phred quality scores were determined according to illumina device: the portion of q40+ bases was  <dig> , <dig>  whereas q39− bases portion was only  <dig>  . prediction of all possible orfs of c. cochliodes with chaetomia-optimised fgenesh suite  <cit>  led in both dna strands to a total value of  <dig> . this count is lower than the estimation for mesophilic c. globosum  <cit>  but much higher than the estimation for c. thermophilum  <cit>  or related thermophilic fungi. a brief comparison of three related fungal genomes is presented in table  <dig>  the average count of exons per predicted c. cochliodes gene was calculated as  <dig> with fgenesh.table  <dig> comparison of three related chaetomia genomes

phylogeny reconstruction in the 18s r dna – its <dig> –  <dig> s r dna – its <dig> – 28s r dna region
first, we were interested in the exact phylogenetic position of chaetomium cochliodes. for this purpose we have reconstructed the dna phylogeny of its 2217 bp region spanning the region from the 3′ end of the 18s rdna, the complete its <dig>   <dig> s rdna, its <dig> and the 5′ end of the 28s rdna containing the highly conserved locus described as universal fungal barcode  <cit> . besides all corresponding dna sequences for species of the chaetomiaceae family currently available in genbank, also sequences from related ascomycetous families were included in this reconstruction . the dna alignment used for the phylogeny reconstruction  reveals clear differences  in the sequence of c. cochliodes if compared with corresponding sequences of c. globosum in the entire region. the phylogenetic output presented in fig.  <dig>  clearly segregates chaetomium cochliodes from closely related c. elatum which is a root-colonizing fungus whose genome is not yet sequenced  <cit> . both these fungi are separated from a sister clade represented by three different dna sequences within this region coding for various c. globosum strains with a high statistical support. this figure clearly demonstrates that the thermophilic representatives  of the chaetomiaceae family can be considered as basal lineages of the chaetomia clade thus suggesting that mesophily has evolved only secondarily in this lineage. our results correlate with the previous work on thermophilic fungi  <cit>  and particularly on the thermostability of chaetomiaceae  <cit>  where c. cochliodes was not included at that time.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship among  <dig> ascomycetes reconstructed from the conserved region spanning 18s-its1- <dig> s-its2-28s rdna genes. maximum likelihood method from mega <dig> with  <dig> bootstraps and mrbayes method over  <dig>  generations were applied on the same dna sequence alignment  <dig>  bp long . bootstrap values above  <dig> & posterior probabilities are shown, respectively. scale bare represents the frequency of ml substitutions



putative heme peroxidases & catalases in chaetomium cochliodes
intracellular hydrogen peroxide is a by-product of various physiological pathways but, unique among all reactive oxygen species, it serves also as an important signalling molecule in apoptosis and ageing  <cit> . in filamentous fungi hydrogen peroxide was shown to be implicated in essential proliferation and differentiation processes  <cit> . thus we have performed this genomic screening for all possible orfs coding for a) enzymes supposed to release h2o <dig> during their reaction and b) two main types of enzymes involved in the catabolism of hydrogen peroxide in a novel genome of a soil ascomycete. with tblastx method we could identify  <dig> genes for various oxidoreductases producing h2o <dig>  and up to  <dig> distinct genes belonging to various heme and non-heme peroxidase superfamilies as well as to the heme catalase superfamily. overview on all these genes together with their introns composition is presented in table 2b. all presented sequences are from contigs of the genome project deposited at genbank under accession lsby <dig>  bioproject prjna <dig>  biosample samn <dig>  from table  <dig> it is obvious that genes coding h2o <dig> degradation exhibit a higher diversity than genes coding h2o2-releasing enzymes. detected genes for non-heme peroxidases include vanadium-containing haloperoxidase, glutathione peroxidase as well as 1-cysteine and 2-cystein peroxiredoxins. this work focuses further on genes coding for heme peroxidases.

as was presented recently, there are at least four heme peroxidase superfamilies and one heme catalase superfamily that arose independently during a convergent evolution. they differ in overall fold, active site architecture and enzymatic activities  <cit> . the following sections aim to discover all genes for representatives of all five superfamilies within the genome of c. cochliodes and to determine their exact phylogenetic positions. heme peroxidases are found in all kingdoms of life and typically catalyse the one- and two-electron oxidation of a myriad of organic and inorganic substrates. in addition to the basal peroxidatic activity distinct families show pronounced catalase, cyclooxygenase, chlorite dismutase or peroxygenase activities.

peroxidase-catalase superfamily
the peroxidase-catalase superfamily is currently the most abundant peroxidase superfamily in various gene and protein databases. it is comprised of three distinct families  and hybrid peroxidases that represent transition forms  between these families. here we present an updated reconstruction of the phylogeny of this largest known heme peroxidase superfamily analysed previously  <cit> . our updated input included already  <dig> complete sequences and is presented in fig.  <dig>  we focus here on the phylogenetic positions of all representatives  found in chaetomia.fig.  <dig> reconstructed phylogeny of the peroxidase-catalase superfamily with focus on newly sequenced chaetomia orfs. the complete tree from  <dig> full length sequences with  <dig> sites aligned is presented with collapsed branches that do not contain any chaetomia sequences. distinct subfamilies are labelled in different colours. c. cochliodes sequences are labelled red. values in nodes represent bootstrap values above  <dig>  and posterior probabilities , respectively. abbreviations of peroxidase names are listed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  abbreviations of taxa: pb, proteobacteria; as, ascomycota; ba, basidiomycota; chy, chytridiomycota; st, stramenopiles; chl, chlorophyta; vi, viridiplantae



family i of the peroxidase-catalase superfamily typically contains catalase-peroxidases , ascorbate peroxidases and cytochrome c peroxidases   <cit> . a hgt-event from bacteroidetes to filamentous ascomycetes was previously reported as a peculiarity of katg gene family evolution  <cit> . circular tree of the whole superfamily clearly demonstrates that all katg <dig> genes from the chaetomiaceae family  apparently are late descendants of this hgt event . within the upper clades we observe a basal position of the thermophilic variants from which their mesophilic counterparts descended. however, a question remains whether only the coding region of katgs was transferred from bacteria to fungi or whether some neighbouring regions were also included in such a transfer? we demonstrate for the gene encoding katg <dig> in c. cochliodes  that the regulatory elements located on 5′ and 3′ regions embedding the orf are clearly of eukaryotic origin . in the promoter region there is  a typical regulatory sequence – the “ccaat” box involved in eukaryotic oxidative stress response  <cit> . in the 3′ untranslated region the poly-a site for corresponding mrna formation can be predicted with a high probability. thus, we can conclude that a prokaryotic katg was inserted in the fungal genome but received a typical eukaryotic transcription regulation during later evolution. the main physiological role of katg in c. cochliodes is most propable dismutation of metabolically-generated hydrogen peroxide to molecular oxygen and water, similar to typical  catalases   <cit> . in addition to katg chaetomia contain genes  encoding cytochrome c peroxidases . the relationships among the fungi presented in the ccp phylogenetic analysis suggest that this protein has evolved vertically throughout ascomycetes. for ccp genes from both c. globosum and c. cochliodes a basal lineage represented by c. thermophilum and m. thermophila is apparent in the reconstructed tree. the physiological role of ccp is still under discussion.fig.  <dig> presentation of the promoter region for ccochkatg gene showing typical eukaryotic regulatory elements for a hgt-related bacterial gene. sequence analysis was performed in contig  <dig> between positions  <dig>  -  <dig>  with fgenesh software  <cit> , drawn to scale



further phylogenetic reconstruction of the peroxidase-catalase superfamily reveals that in c. cochliodes but not in c. globosum a family ii representative is present . this is very surprising for such closely related fungal species. however, the family ii representative from c. cochliodes has its closest neighbour in c. thermophilum. family ii ascomycetous genes code for hypothetical heme peroxidases with yet unknown reaction specificity but are closely related with well investigated basidiomycetous manganese and lignin peroxidases . the latter are involved in oxidative degradation of lignin-containing soil debris and typically use mn2+ or small organic molecules as electron donors.

additional representatives from the peroxidase-catalase superfamily in c. cochliodes include two paralogs of hybrid b heme peroxidases discovered as a new gene family only recently  <cit> . hybrid-type b peroxidases are present solely in fungi but are related to family iii  and also to family ii . the basal lineage for the first paralog  together with its closely related c. globosum counterpart appears among mesophilic sordariomycetes . the second variant  containing besides the peroxidase domain also an additional c-terminal wsc  domain is not closely related with c. globosum ortholog . thus, both these hybpox paralogs are not the result of a recent gene duplication but segregated rather early in the evolution of fungal genomes. transcription analysis  reveals a slight induction of both hybpox genes selectively with peroxyacetic acid in the cultivation medium. in contrast, previous results  <cit>  reveal a constitutive mode of expression for distantly related katg <dig> gene with hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid.table  <dig> transcription analysis of  <dig> selected genes for peroxide catabolism in c. cochliodes recorded with rt-qpcr. quantitative values representing relative changes of the transcription level were obtained by comparison of the expression of a particular gene in 30 min. induced vs. non induced samples. the constitutively expressed its <dig> region was used as internal standard for normalization

peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily
members of the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily  are widely distributed among all domains of life. in many cases they are multidomain proteins with one heme peroxidase domain  <cit> . family iv is comprised of bifunctional cyclooxygenases possessing both peroxidase and cyclooxygenase activities. they are involved in various physiological and pathophysiological processes  <cit> . in mammals they are located in the luminal membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum and mediate the conversion of free essential fatty acids to prostanoids by a two-step process  <cit> . the structure and function of the two distinct human paralogs  were intensively investigated but a comprehensive analysis of their diverse paralogs among eukaryotic microbes or even among prokaryots was only recently reported  <cit> . evolutionary relationships among fungal cyclooxygenase genes were not analysed in sufficient detail yet.

our current reconstruction based on the phylogeny of selected members from the whole superfamily  is presented in fig.  <dig>  genome analysis suggests the occurrence of two representatives of this superfamily in chaetomia, a cyclooxygenase-like enzyme and a linoleate diol synthase. cyclooxygenase genes from c. cochliodes and c. globosum share their closest phylogenetic neighbour  in the genome of m. mycetomatis, a human pathogenic fungus that grows optimally at room temperature  <cit> . no cyclooxygenase genes were found in thermophilic fungi so far. in contrast, the evolutionary reconstruction of another important subfamily of family iv, linoleate diol synthases, reveals a very similar pattern for chaetomiaceae as already described for the previous superfamily. corresponding part of the tree  demonstrates that genes encoding linoleate diol synthases  from thermophilic fungi  represent basal lineages for corresponding genes in mesophilic chaetomia. only recently it was shown that fatty acid diol synthases are unique fusion proteins containing a n-terminal heme peroxidase domain joined with a c-terminal p450-heme thiolate domain for conversion of unsaturated fatty acids to dihydroxy-fatty acids  <cit> . these enzymes are an essential part of the psi factor sexual inducer cascade in various fungi  <cit> . their exact physiological role within the life cycle of chaetomiaceae needs to be elucidated in the future. our first round of transcription analysis revealed around 2-fold induction of expression of both cyox <dig> and lds genes in a medium with peroxyacetic acid .fig.  <dig> reconstructed phylogeny of the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily with focus on chaetomia orfs. the complete tree from  <dig> full length sequences with  <dig>  aligned sites is presented. c. cochliodes sequences are labelled red. distinct subfamilies are labelled in different colours. values in nodes represent bootstrap values above  <dig>  and posterior probabilities , respectively. abbreviations of peroxidase names are listed in additional file 5: table s <dig>  abbreviations of taxa: ac, actinobacteria; acb, acidobacteria; cy, cyanobacteria; prb, proteobacteria; plb, planctomycetes ; as, ascomycota; ba, basidiomycota; mu, mucoromycota; st, stramenopiles; cn, cnidaria; de, deuterostomia



peroxidase-chlorite dismutase superfamily
our next screening within the c. cochliodes genome focused on the presence of genes encoding dye-decolorizing peroxidases . these heme enzymes were first isolated from soil basidiomycetes but were further shown to be present in a wide variety of fungi and bacteria  <cit> . dyps catalyse the h2o2-mediated oxidation of a very broad substrate range. originally, fungal representatives were found to degrade bulky dyes. a detailed structure- and sequence-based comparison demonstrated that dyps together with chlorite dismutases and chlorite-dismutase like proteins  constitute the cde superfamily  <cit> , also designated as peroxidase-chlorite dismutase superfamily  <cit> . the reconstructed evolution of dyps within this superfamily is shown in fig.  <dig>  in fungal genomes mainly representatives of the subfamilies dyp-type d and dyp-type b can be found as paralogs. interestingly, in the genome of c. cochliodes only a fused version of dyp-pfl is present, i.e. an n-terminal dyp peroxidase domain connected with a c-terminal pyruvate formate-lyase  domain known as a glycyl radical containing region  <cit> . this unique gene fusion was detected also in other distantly related prokaryotic & eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . the pfl domain can be activated by pfl activase, a radical sam superfamily member  <cit> , but the significance of a pfl fusion with a peroxidase domain remains elusive. we could detect a putative pfl activase in c. cochliodes contig  <dig> revealing 81 % identity with chgg_ <dig> from c. globosum and other putative pfl activases from filamentous fungi. thus, c. cochliodes possesses both components necessary for the glycyl radical formation with yet unknown physiological function. a hgt event with a high bootstrap support in the clade of fused dyps b can be observed between proteobacteria and ascomycetous fungi . as the fused dyp b-pfl proteins are yet hypothetical, their physiological relevance has to be determined among chaetomiaceae. our first round of transcription analysis of dyprx gene exhibited the highest induction observed among all  <dig> superfamilies followed in this study with hydrogen peroxide  and mainly with peroxyacetic acid  in the cultivation medium .fig.  <dig> reconstructed phylogeny of the peroxidase-dismutase superfamily with focus on newly discovered chaetomia sequences forming a separate clade of dyp-bs together with fused bacterial representatives from which they were derived by a hgt event. the complete tree from  <dig> full length sequences is presented with  <dig> sites aligned. c. cochliodes sequence is labelled red. distinct subfamilies are labelled in different colours. values in nodes represent bootstrap values above  <dig>  and posterior probabilities , respectively. abbreviations of peroxidase names are listed in additional file 6: table s <dig>  abbreviations of taxa: vir, dna viruses; ac, actinobacteria; aci, acidobacteria; bi, bacteroidetes; chl, chloroflexi ; cy, cyanobacteria; dei, deinococci; fi, firmicutes; pb, proteobacteria; pmc, planctomycetes; as, ascomycota; ba, basidiomycota; alv, alveolata; amb, ameboflagellates; de, deuterostomia; mol, mollusca



peroxidase-peroxygenase superfamily
heme-thiolate peroxidases from fungi and stramenopiles constitute the peroxidase-peroxygenase superfamily  <cit> . enzymes encoded by htp genes represent probably the most versatile catalysts among peroxidase superfamilies thus catalysing on one side classical heme peroxidase reactions and on the other side monooxygenase  reactions like cytochrome p450s  <cit> . the reconstructed phylogenetic tree for the peroxidase-peroxygenase superfamily  reveals the distribution of three gene paralogs of this superfamily within the chaetomium cochliodes genome. the presence of multiple gene paralogs in genomes of ascomycetous fungi is frequent and occurred by repeated gene duplications of this rather short gene but the phylogenetic distribution of c. cochliodes paralogs is variable . whereas there is a thermophilic basal lineage for ccochhtp <dig> and ccochhtp <dig> and their corresponding counterparts in c. globosum, the situation for paralog ccochhtp <dig> is different. corresponding genes from pathogenic fungi represent a basal lineage for closely related ccochhtp <dig> and cghtp <dig>  it is unknown so far whether these three putative heme-thiolate peroxidases exhibit different enzymatic properties but they were segregated early during the evolution of fungal genomes and thus they all may be interesting for biotechnological applications. we have also performed transcription analysis of htp <dig> gene paralog resulting in almost 3-fold induction both with hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid present in the cultivation medium .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of the peroxidase-peroxygenase superfamily representing numerous gene paralogs of this superfamily among chaetomiaceae. the complete tree from  <dig> full length sequences is presented with  <dig> sites aligned. c. cochliodes paralogs are labelled red. distinct subfamilies are labelled in different colours. values in nodes represent bootstrap values above  <dig>  and posterior probabilities , respectively. abbreviations of peroxidase names are listed in additional file 7: table s <dig>  abbreviations of taxa: as, ascomycota; ba, basidiomycota; mu, mucoromycota; st, stramenopiles



putative heme catalases in chaetomia
typical  heme catalases are enzymes that very efficiently dismutase hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. in contrast with heme peroxidases they can both reduce and oxidize hydrogen peroxide and have negligible peroxidatic activity  <cit> . heme catalases represent a monophyletic group that evolved as a distinct gene family from prokaryotes to almost all lineages of eukaryotes  <cit> . in fig.  <dig> the phylogeny focused on fungal heme catalases is presented. there are  <dig> distinct clades of genes for typical catalases defined by klotz et al.  <cit> . in fungi only representatives of clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig>  can be found. there are up to four gene paralogs of a catalase gene within c. cochliodes genome that underlines the importance of mostly monofunctional catalases for the removal of h2o <dig>  there are thermophilic basal lineages for the large subunit secretory catalases ccochkata <dig>  ccochkata <dig> and their c. globosum counterparts, a situation very similar to the peroxidase superfamilies. in contrast, there are mesophilic basal lineages for the small subunit peroxisomal catalases ccochkatb <dig> and ccochkatb <dig> . in particular, ccochkatb <dig> and cgkatb <dig> have a basal lineage among catalases from various soil and phytopathogenic fungi. surprisingly, ccochkatb <dig> has no counterpart in the closely related genome of c. globosum. putative catalase from a widely distributed soil fungus s. schenckii shares a common ancestor with this unique small subunit peroxisomal catalase of c. cochliodes . possible involvement of c. cochliodes four catalase isozymes in the defence against oxidative stress was analysed by rt-pcr. obtained results in the early exponential phase of fungal growth show only a slight induction of the paralog katb <dig> in the medium containing peroxyacetic acid .fig.  <dig> reconstructed phylogeny of the heme catalase super family with focus on clade  <dig> and  <dig> representing the distribution of ascomycetous large subunit as well as small subunit catalases . the complete tree from  <dig> full length sequences is presented with  <dig> sites aligned. c. cochliodes paralogs are labelled red. distinct clades are labelled in different colours. values in nodes represent bootstrap values above  <dig>  and posterior probabilities , respectively. abbreviations of peroxidase names are listed in additional file 8: table s <dig>  abbreviations of taxa: ar, archaea; ac, actinobacteria; aci, acidobacteria; bi, bacteroidetes; chl, chloroflexi ; cy, cyanobacteria; dei, deinococci; fi, firmicutes; pb, proteobacteria; pmc, planctomycetes; as, ascomycota; ba, basidiomycota; chy, chytridiomycota; zy, zygomycota; cn, cnidaria; ich, ichthyosporea; chlph, chlorophyta; bmagno, basal magnoliophyta; my, mycetozoa; cryp, cryptogams, eudi, eudicotyledons, mctd, monocotyledons; de, deuterostomia; ec, ecdysozoa



CONCLUSIONS
in conlusion genomic sequence analysis revealed that chaetomium cochliodes is closely related to c. globosum & c. elatum. these three filamentous fungi are mesophilic but probably have thermophilic ancestors as revealed from their basal lineage. c. cochliodes contains heme peroxidases and catalases from all so far described superfamilies. ascomycetous genes encoding catalase-peroxidase and dye decolorizing peroxidase were obtained during the evolution by horizontal gene transfer from various bacteria. several heme peroxidases of chaetomia like hybrid heme b peroxidase, linoleate diol synthase or dyp-type b form fusions with additional functional domains that might enable a broader catalytic variability. furthermore cytochrome c peroxidase, manganese and three paralogs of heme-thiolate peroxidases are found in addition to typical  catalases of large and small subunit architecture. our transcription analysis reveals the highest induction of a fused dyprx gene with hydrogen peroxide and mainly with peroxyacetic acid in the cultivation medium followed by moderate inductions of htp <dig> and hybpox <dig> genes.
