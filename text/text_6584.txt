BACKGROUND
india ranks sixth in the world in sheep production with an estimated  <dig>  million sheep  <cit> . sheep farming is the main livestock industry in northern hilly areas, such as kashmir, where it serves as a major source of income for poor, rural communities who farm sheep for mutton and wool. the system of sheep rearing in kashmir is semi-migratory. flocks  are kept housed by owners for 4- <dig> months during winter. in spring, they are grouped together with other flocks under the care of a "chopan" , who takes them to graze high altitude sub-himalayan and himalayan pastures. in the autumn, sheep are walked back to the valley mostly by road and are returned to their owners  <cit> .

footrot is an important, endemic disease of sheep in many countries including australia, the uk, and new zealand. footrot is caused by dichelobacter nodosus  <cit> . the current understanding is that dichelobacter nodosus causes footrot. other organisms, fusobacterium necrophorum in particular, play an important role in facilitating the development of footrot according to some authors  <cit>  or increasing its severity according to others  <cit> . clinically, disease initially presents as an interdigital dermatitis that can progress to separation of hoof horn from the underlying sensitive tissue; there is a characteristic foul smell with all stages of disease  <cit> . footrot lesions are acute when sheep have been lame for a short period of time with the above characteristic clinical signs but the foot has no chronic inflammation. footrot lesions are chronic when in addition to the characteristic clinical signs, the hoof horn is thickened, mis-shapen or overgrown with some degree of under-running  <cit> . sheep with chronic lesions have been reported to be lame for several weeks/months  <cit> .

in the past few years footrot has become one of the biggest challenges for sheep farmers in kashmir with a reported prevalence of  <dig> to 16%  <cit>  and an estimated annual economic cost of approximately  <dig> million rupees  to the sheep industry in south kashmir  <cit> . footrot spreads between sheep when they are up on the himalayan pastures because of the warm, wet conditions  <cit>  under foot during the day and the high stocking densities at night when sheep are grouped in paddocks to protect them from predators.

lame sheep are not treated until they return to the villages for the winter. the most common treatment for footrot used by farmers in kashmir is a topical application of potassium permanganate solution  to the lesion. there is no estimate of the efficacy of this method but farmers indicated that despite this treatment sheep are often lame with footrot for several months or years . farmers state that lame sheep are very unproductive and are often killed because of this lack of productivity.

there is evidence from clinical trials in australia that treatment with short acting parenteral antibacterials such as penicillin and streptomycin, lincomycin, lincospectin and erythromycin  <cit>  are effective against acute footrot and efficacy is improved by provision of a dry environment for  <dig> hours after treatment  <cit> . there is evidence from clinical trials in the uk that rapid recovery from footrot occurs within 3- <dig> days of administering long acting parenteral oxytetracycline without provision of a dry environment  <cit> .

the use of parenteral antibacterials to treat footrot is not common in kashmir and no clinical trials have been conducted in india to investigate the efficacy of such treatments for footrot. in addition, there have been no studies internationally of the efficacy of parenteral antibacterials to treat chronic footrot. the aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of two long acting parenteral antibacterials  on the time to recovery from both acute and chronic footrot lesions and the associated lameness in sheep in the kashmir region of india.

methods
study design
a clinical trial was conducted on seven farms with a laboratory diagnosed history of footrot in kashmir, north india from december  <dig> to may  <dig>  sheep were sourced from six private owners in the villages of brinty and laroo in the anantnag district and fatehpora, wahidpora, sailgam saloora, and shawlbugh in the ganderbal district and finally from the government sheep breeding farm, goabal, also in the ganderbal district. ninety two cross bred sheep with a minimum severity of lameness of score  <dig>  i.e. visible nodding of the head and irregular stride but weight bearing on all four feet  <cit>  and with active footrot  were recruited into the trial. their identification, age , sex, body condition score, duration of lameness at recruitment  and the presence of pus in affected feet were recorded.

footrot was categorized as chronic when there was an active lesion with a characteristic foul smell plus hyperplasia of the sole and/or wall horn with some degree of separation of the hoof from the underlying sensitive tissue and the sheep had been lame for at least  <dig> days. footrot was considered acute when there was an active lesion with characteristic foul smell, interdigital inflammation with or without hoof horn separation, no hyperplasia of the sole and/or wall horn and the sheep had been lame for less than  <dig> days. there were  <dig> sheep with acute lesions and  <dig> sheep with chronic lesions.

the severity of footrot was scored using the system described by egerton and roberts  <cit>  on a scale of  <dig> to  <dig>  for acute lesions and lesion scores 3- <dig> for chronic lesions.

sheep with acute and chronic footrot were compared in two separate trials. in the first trial, sheep with acute footrot were randomly allocated , by drawing a coloured ball from a bag, to one of two treatment groups: long acting oxytetracycline  , long acting enrofloxacin   and a third group was used as a control where  <dig> sheep  were randomly allocated to receive indian sheep farmers' traditional treatment of topical application of potassium permanganate solution. sheep received treatment on day  <dig>  the day of diagnosis. researchers treated the first two groups and owner of the sheep treated the third group.

the second trial was a quasi-experiment with a pre-post treatment design  <cit> . thirty sheep with chronic footrot, previously treated with local topical treatment, were stratified by maximum footrot score and then randomly allocated, by drawing a coloured ball from a bag, to one of the two antibacterial treatments ; n =  <dig> ) as described in the first trial. sheep were treated with antibacterials on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

for both the trials, antibacterials were sourced from a reputable retailer and one batch number of each antibacterial type was used. the data were collected by one of  <dig> trained researchers who made all the observations on a farm. sheep were inspected by researchers on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and locomotion and lesion scores were recorded. a sheep recovered from lameness when it was bearing weight on all four feet with no signs of uneven posture or shortened stride   <cit> . a foot was considered recovered from acute or chronic footrot when the lesion was not active: there was no foul smell or exudate and there was healing, although the tissue had not completely returned to normal.

the trial protocol was ethically approved by the institutional ethical committee of faculty of veterinary sciences and animal husbandry, skuast-k, shuhama , srinagar, jammu and kashmir, india and informed consent was obtained from the farmers.

data analysis
data were stored in microsoft access  and stata  <dig>  se  was used for statistical analyses. acute and chronically affected sheep were analysed separately throughout. a wilcoxon sign-rank test was used to compare the duration of lameness in sheep with chronic footrot pre and post treatment. the correlation between time to recovery from lameness and lesions for sheep with chronic or acute footrot was assessed using pearson's correlation coefficients . kaplan-meier survival curves and median time to recovery with 95% confidence interval  were calculated for each variable and a log-rank test was used to compare equality of survivor functions by category within a variable  <cit> ; the log-rank test for trend was conducted for ordered categories  <cit> . p values â‰¤  <dig>  were considered significant.

RESULTS
the distribution of acute and chronic footrot cases by farm is presented in table  <dig> 

trial i: acute footrot
there were  <dig> rams and  <dig> ewes with acute footrot. a total of 56/ <dig> sheep had one foot affected and six sheep had  <dig> feet affected. all sheep, except eight, recovered from footrot and lameness within  <dig> days: 6/ <dig> sheep that did not recover had been treated with topical potassium permanganate solution. of the sheep that recovered, the median time to recovery from lesions and lameness was  <dig> days . there was a very strong positive correlation between recovery from lesions and lameness ; all sheep recovered from lesions and lameness at the same observation except three sheep with acute footrot, which were lame for one week after recovery from lesions. there was no significant difference in time to recovery by the type of antibacterial used with sheep recovering in a median time of  <dig> days  with both antibacterials. however, sheep that were treated with a topical application of potassium permanganate solution were significantly less likely to recover  in comparison with injectable antibacterials . time to recovery increased significantly with the severity of lesions  . there was no significant difference in time to recovery by sex, farm, duration lame before treatment, age, body condition score, or presence of pus at diagnosis.

*one observation; ^less than 50% sheep recovered; ne not estimated

trial ii: chronic footrot
there were  <dig> ewes with chronic footrot;  <dig> had one foot affected and three had two feet affected. there was a significant difference  in the duration of lameness before treatment : 60-135) and after parenteral antibacterial administration  . there was a very strong positive correlation between recovery from lesions  and lameness ; there was only one sheep with chronic footrot that was lame for one week after lesions started to heal. there was no significant difference in the duration of lameness by type of antibacterial used . all sheep, except three, recovered from chronic footrot and lameness within  <dig> days of parenteral antibacterial treatment. sheep with chronic footrot had a significantly more rapid recovery on two farms   with sheep on these farms recovering in a median of  <dig> days compared with 17- <dig> days on the other three farms.

as with sheep with acute footrot, the median time to recovery from chronic footrot increased with lesion severity: with a median time to recovery of  <dig> d and  <dig> d for lesion scores  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . there was no significant difference in time to recovery after parenteral antibacterial treatment by duration of lameness before treatment, age, body condition score, or presence of pus at diagnosis.

the time to recovery  for sheep with chronic footrot was significantly higher  than for sheep with acute footrot . sheep with chronic footrot had lower body condition scores  than sheep with acute footrot . a significantly higher  percentage of sheep with chronic footrot had pus in the foot compared with sheep with acute footrot .

no sheep became lame again during the  <dig> day observation period in both the trials.

discussion
this is the first clinical trial, to the authors' knowledge, to demonstrate recovery from chronic footrot and its associated lameness. the rapid time to recovery with parenteral antibacterials is remarkable given that these sheep had been lame from  <dig> days to two years. it does highlight that systemic treatment with  <dig> days of therapeutic level of antibacterials is highly effective against this bacterial disease, even for chronic lesions where sheep have a persistent footrot lesion with hyperplasia and misshapen hoof horn  <cit> . although sheep with chronic lesions recovered from lameness and had no active footrot lesion in the current study, we do not know whether or when feet with hyperplastic horn returned to normal physical conformation. hoof horn damage takes several months to resolve  <cit>  and the follow up period for the current trial was only  <dig> days, hence no information could be collected on improvement in physical conformation. there is evidence that sheep with poor foot shape are more likely to improve their foot quality after treatment with parenteral antibacterials  <cit> .

there were no time parallel controls in the trial with sheep with chronic footrot, instead, sheep acted as their own control in a pre and post quasi experimental design. these sheep had been lame for such a long time and given local treatments so it seemed unethical to not give these sheep the parenteral antibacterials that are the best known treatment for footrot  <cit> . quasi experimental designs are widely used in medical and social research where it is unethical to either withhold a treatment that has known efficacy or where there is a need to intervene quickly e.g. to prevent spread of infectious disease  <cit> . there is a possibility of confounding by factors that could have been different between the two time periods  such as climate. climate has been shown to influence both the severity and spread of footrot  <cit> . however, given that there was a wide range of time in the duration of lameness it is highly unlikely that recovery after treatment with antibacterials occurred for any other reason than the treatment given.

in kashmir, there are many challenges faced by farmers in managing footrot. due to practical constraints, sheep that develop footrot whilst on himalayan pastures are not treated until they return to the valley. they walk a substantial distance to return home, usually on hard roads that thicken and harden the hoof horn. once home, lame sheep are typically treated as described in the introduction. parenteral antibacterials are generally not used; farmers have been told they are ineffective and there are always concerns about the price and quality of pharmaceuticals . the results from the current trial indicate that if farmers use a course of four long acting injections of a relatively inexpensive well sourced antibacterial, there will be welfare benefits to the sheep and economic gain to the owners because once they are not lame and in pain  <cit>  these sheep will gain body condition and have improved conception rates and lambing percentages  <cit> . there are sheep both in india and other countries with chronic footrot--either through neglect or inappropriate treatment. there is every reason to consider that the treatment presented in the current study would be effective in resolving footrot in these sheep.

as importantly, sheep with acute footrot recovered in a median  <dig> days after treatment with antibacterials, similar to other studies  <cit> . however, sheep that received the traditional treatment of topical potassium permanganate solution were lame for longer with only  <dig> recovering within  <dig> days suggesting that this is an ineffective treatment. a solution of potassium permanganate is generally made at home by using the crystals that are readily available and cheap . its use is common in these communities to disinfect water and as a general antiseptic for human skin conditions at concentration of  <dig> %  <cit> . factors such as the deep seated location of d. nodous in footrot lesions  <cit>  and/or an incorrect concentration of the solution could have contributed to low cure rates. it is possible that for very mild cases of interdigital dermatitis topical application leads to recovery. the lesions that received topical treatment in the current study ranged from moderate interdigital damage to some separation. there was no information collected on the strength of solution used by the farmers.

there was no significant difference between long acting oxytetracycline and enrofloxacin on time to recovery from footrot in the current trial. enrofloxacin is a third generation fluoroquinolone, a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibacterial that is commonly used in veterinary and human medicine in india  <cit> . it was used in the current trial because of its common use and accessibility in india. given the global concern with the development of antibacterial resistance with flouroquinolones  <cit>  and the fact that the long acting oxytetracycline was equally effective, we consider that long acting oxytetracycline, which is rarely used in human medicine, should be used to treat sheep with acute or chronic footrot in india.

in the current trial, sheep were followed for up to  <dig> days after recovery or a maximum of  <dig> days after treatment. no sheep treated with parenteral antibacterials became lame again during this period; however, we do not know whether footrot recurred after the end of the trial. sheep with acute footrot with damaged feet and poor foot integrity are more likely to get footrot again, although this is less likely if they have been given parenteral antibacterials  <cit> .

there was a significant association between lesion severity and time to recovery from footrot in both acute and chronic cases, with severe lesions with extensive interdigital dermatitis and separation of horn taking longer to heal. this is in contrast to other trials  <cit>  which reported no link between severity of lesions and time to recovery. however, in kaler et al.  <cit>  and jordan et al.  <cit>  the majority of the sheep  had the most severe lesion score , in addition, kaler et al.  <cit>  used a different system to classify lesion severity which might have affected the results obtained.

sheep in the current trial were scored by three trained observers ; this could have led to some observer bias. however, the same observer was used to score all the sheep and follow up observations to minimize observer variability. unlike sheep with acute lesions where there was no difference in recovery by farm, sheep with chronic lesions had a significantly shorter time to recovery on two farms compared with the other three farms. the sheep on each of these farms were scored by two different observers. the fact that these observers also scored acute cases and that there was no differences in time to recovery by farm suggests that this is less likely to be observer bias unless observers were only biased when scoring recovery from chronic lesions. sheep on these two farms had lesion score severities  <dig> and  <dig> and duration of lameness from  <dig> months to  <dig> years which suggests the rapid recovery was unlikely to be a confounding effect of severity of footrot or duration of lameness. there is a possibility that the treated chronic cases on these two farms had better foot integrity than other farms which led to rapid recovery  <cit> , however, no information on foot integrity was recorded in this trial to investigate this.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that parenteral antibacterials are an effective treatment for both acute and chronic footrot and associated lameness in sheep in india. their use to treat sheep lame with footrot in kashmir would vastly improve welfare of these sheep with considerable economic benefit to the farmers.
