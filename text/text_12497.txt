BACKGROUND
bacterial identification becomes a challenge particularly in case they are either involved in an industrial process with heavy investments at risk or are a serious threat to human beings. sequencing of the rrs  of bacteria is vigorously pursued for correct identification and classification  <cit> . it has led to a large database of  <dig> , <dig> entries http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/. the key questions which we are addressing: whether there are certain latent and as yet un-explored features in the nucleotide sequences of the rrs, which can be used to define the phylogenetic limits of a particular genus or species? are there certain unique patterns of nucleotide strings  and signatures within them, which can enable tracking the identity of an organism within the phylogenetic framework? in fact, it has been stated that novel biological findings are being driven by comparison and integration of massive data sets  <cit> . they also predict that numerous tools will be designed to use such large and well organized data. comparative analyses of rrs sequences of clostridium spp. can be exploited to develop molecular tools for defining the genetic variability and tracking the evolutionary events.

clostridium represents a large bacterial genus of significant biotechnological as well as medical importance. the diversity of its economic importance varies from production of solvents - clostridium beijerinckii, c. acetobutylicum, c. saccharoperbutylacetonicum and c. sachharobutylicum  <cit> , biofuels such as ethanol and hydrogen - clostridium thermocellum and c. acetobutylicum  <cit> , indigo dye and flax retting to enzymes as therapeutic and cosmetic agents  <cit> . the potential of clostridium butyricum to naturally produce  <dig> -propanediol holds promise as base material for fiber - poly industry  <cit> . cheese  industry is invariably plagued by defects caused by clostridium tyrobutyricum, c. beijerinckii, c. butyricum and c. sporogenes  <cit> . in contrast are the clostridium strains with medical relevance particularly those with abilities to produce some of the deadliest toxins, leading to devastating clinical conditions  <cit> . production of potent extracellular toxins by clostridium spp. especially those due to c. botulinum, c. perfringens, c. tetani and c. difficile result in diseases such as botulism, gas gangrene, tetanus, pseudomembranous colitis and food-borne illness in man and animals  <cit> . to summarize, members of the clostridium spp. are responsible for economic and medical problems  <cit> .

multiple methods have been employed for the identification of strains and/or samples of clostridium and its species, such as pcr-ribotyping combined with dna-dna reassociation  <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , randomly amplified polymorphic dna  <cit> , multilocus sequence typing  <cit> , restriction enzyme  analysis  <cit>  and microarray  <cit> .

the heterogeneity of clostridium species
c. botulinum
the heterogeneity of c. botulinum is evident from the variability of neurotoxins produced by them. genetic studies reveal complex relationship between their taxonomy and toxin types, which needs a thorough re-examination. certain non-toxigenic strains of c. botulinum, which have been genotypically shown to be authentic members of this species possess cryptic/silent genes or sequences coding for bont  <cit>  but are functionally categorized as "non-producers". the complexity of the identification process is further enhanced by strains which phenotypically resemble clostridium baratii and c. butyricum yet produce bont types f and e, respectively  <cit> . so these strains are referred to as c. botulinum in spite of the observations made on their dna-dna pairing hybridization, rrs sequencing and bont-encoding plasmids, etc.  <cit> .

c. acetobutylicum
different studies have provided evidences to support high genetic variability within c. acetobutylicum  <cit> . c. acetobutylicum is phylogenetically close to c. felsineum but dna-dna hybridization studies classify them as distinct species  <cit> . a genome wide comparison of c. acetobutylicum with bacillus subtilis reveals significant local conservation of gene order  <cit> . such high homology between proteins from other taxa emphasizes the potential of horizontal gene transfer, which leads to microbial evolution  <cit> . interestingly, b. subtilis itself has been shown to be very heterogeneous  <cit> . clostridial and bacillus binary toxins share 80-85% identity within the i toxin family  <cit> . phylogeny and evolutionary relationship within clostridium are poorly understood even today  <cit> .

the needs of the genus clostridium
clostridium are phylogenetically extremely heterogeneous bacteria  <cit> , with many non-spore formers grouped along with spore forming clostridium spp.  <cit> . clostridium contains both gram-positive and gram-negative species - c. phytofermentans shows a gram-negative reaction in spite of possessing a gram-positive cell wall ultrastructure  <cit> . in view of multiple hindrances encountered in accurately identifying these organisms it becomes difficult to establish a good co-relation between their pathogenic potential and disease manifestation  <cit> . the need is to have a reliable identification system  <cit>  and to recognize distinct genetic-based clusters, which would help to establish a phenotype to genotype co-relation and lead to a clear taxonomic classification  <cit> . since symptoms can be confusing, the need is to develop molecular genetics tools for improved diagnosis of clostridium species  <cit> . another, equaling challenging scenario is encountered due to their gc content, which varies from  <dig> mol%   <cit>  to  <dig> mol%   <cit> . such a wide range of gc content is perhaps too great for a single genus  <cit>  and may even demand re-classification.

a new dimension to establish evolutionary relationship among bacteria in general and specifically clostridium species has been added by the availability of a large reservoir of rrs sequencing data http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/. another important development has been the  <dig> sequenced genomes http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi including  <dig> firmicutes consisting of  <dig> clostridium spp. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi. all these put together are expected to prove helpful in redefining microbial taxonomy and phylogeny  <cit> . it may be remarked that studies based on rrs sequences need to be supplemented with information on other genes for authentic segregation of isolates  <cit> . recent studies based on certain 'latent' features  of rrs alone could very clearly distinguish the two subgroups of b. subtilis  <cit> , where as others have resorted to gyra gene to elucidate this genetic variability  <cit> . it also proved instrumental in evaluating the biodiversity of stenotrophomonas spp.  <cit> . the sequence of the 16s rdna contains potential opportunities to characterize and differentiate species.

in this study, we have used rrs sequences to identify molecular markers, which may be sufficient enough to segregate clostridium spp. here, we have carried out comparative analyses of rrs sequences belonging to  <dig> clostridium species as reference sets for generating species specific:  phylogenetic frameworks,  signatures  and  in silico re digestion patterns with  <dig> type ii res. these tools were then used for identifying:  clostridium sp. up to species level,  identifying potential novel species, and  tracking phylogenetic relationships among the other clostridium species, which have fewer members at present.

RESULTS
the genus clostridium has been reported  belonging to these  <dig> clostridium species have been grouped into three categories :   <dig> clostridium spp. with relatively higher number  of identified organisms,   <dig> clostridium spp.  with relatively low frequency  of identified organisms and   <dig> organisms identified only up to genus level - clostridium sp. out of a total of  <dig> rrs sequences of different clostridium species, we chose  <dig> for generating phylogenetic framework for the following  <dig> species belonging to the first group : c. botulinum -  <dig>  c. perfringens -  <dig>  c. butyricum -  <dig>  c. acetobutylicum -  <dig>  c. beijerinckii -  <dig>  c. novyi -  <dig>  c. kluyveri -  <dig>  c. pasteurianum -  <dig>  c. sporogenes -  <dig>  c. colicanis and c. sardiniense -  <dig> each, c. baratii, c. chauvoei, c. subterminale and c. tetani -  <dig> each. the species-specific phylogenetic framework developed here was used as a tool for  identifying  <dig> organisms clostridium sp. up to genus level, and  establishing the phylogenetic relationships among  <dig> organisms reported to be occur in low frequency .

phylogenetic framework for clostridium species
c. botulinum
phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences of  <dig> strains of c. botulinum revealed their segregation into  <dig> major clusters  . these different clusters were represented by 3- <dig> strains. these four clusters may be representing  <dig> distinct lineages  of c. botulinum, which have been segregated on the basis of neurotoxin  produced by them  <cit> . this segregation at this stage was supported by varied bootstrap value : cboi showed a bv in the range of 4- <dig> and exceptionally a value of  <dig>  indicating very high genetic variability among its members. members of the cluster cboii had bv in the range of 242- <dig>  a relatively low genetic heterogeneity was recorded among members of clusters cboiii and cboiv, where bv varied from 495- <dig>  in view of the high genetic variability among the different isolates, we selected four rrs sequences to represent cboi, whereas two sequences each were selected for representing the rest three clusters: cboii-cboiv. in all, the  <dig> representative sequences including the type strains s <dig> and s <dig> were short listed. these rrs sequences were distributed all along the phylogenetic tree of c. botulinum. further analyses based on nucleotide signatures and in silico re digestion patterns supported the selection of these representatives.

c. perfringens
a phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences of  <dig> strains of c. perfringens showed  <dig> distinct clusters   each consisting of between 3- <dig> strains. four out of these  <dig> strains did not fell into any of these clusters. high genetic diversity among the different strains of c. perfringens was supported by low bv in each of the clusters. a total of ten representative sequences, including the one of the type strain  were selected from  <dig> clusters  for developing phylogenetic framework.

c. butyricum
the  <dig> different rrs sequences of c. butyricum were distributed largely on  <dig> different clusters   of the phylogenetic tree. these different clusters were represented by 2- <dig> strains each. the low bv in different clades is a clear reflection on the high genetic heterogeneity within this clostridium species. in order to represent the genetic heterogeneity of this clostridium species in the phylogenetic framework,  <dig> rrs sequences were short listed  from different clades - cbuii, cbuv and cbuvi.

c. acetobutylicum
the  <dig> strains of c. acetobutylicum were very heterogeneously distributed on their rrs sequence based phylogenetic tree. the two major clades   consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> sequences each, with a bv in the range of 393- <dig> and 338- <dig>  respectively. the rest  <dig> sequences were segregated into  <dig> different branches with a bv ranging from 7- <dig> and exceptionally it was  <dig>  the selection of five rrs sequences to develop a phylogenetic frame work was done in order to cover maximum range of the genetic diversity. two of the selected strains  represented the extreme ends of the phylogenetic tree, whereas the type strain s <dig> was located almost in its middle. a support to high genetic variability within c. acetobutylicum has been reported  <cit> , with high potential for horizontal gene transfers  <cit> .

c. beijerinckii
the  <dig> sequences of rrs of c. beijerinckii further supported the genetic heterogeneity within clostridium. four distinct clusters   each containing 3- <dig> strains were represented by highly variable bvs: 197- <dig>  95- <dig>  86- <dig>  and 160- <dig>  respectively. three sequences were selected to represent the diversity of the evolutionary tree:  <dig> from cbei and the type strain  from cbeiv.

c. novyi
phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from  <dig> strains of c. novyi showed  <dig> distinct clusters   with 1- <dig> strains each. only one strain  was on an extreme end of these clusters. four strains, including the type strain  spanning the whole phylogenetic tree were taken into consideration while developing the framework.

c. kluyveri
a phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences of  <dig> strains of c. kluyveri formed  <dig> distinct clusters   each containing at least  <dig> strains and a maximum of  <dig> strains. two of the  <dig> strains, present almost at the extreme ends of the phylogenetic tree were selected for further use as framework sequences.

c. pasteurianum
the low genetic diversity among the  <dig> strains of c. pasteurianum was evident in their rrs sequence based phylogenetic tree. it showed a major cluster   , whereas the rest of the sequences were distributed on independent branches with a maximum of two in a group. a total of three strains, including the type strain , were selected for framework sequences.

c. sporogenes
phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from  <dig> strains of c. sporogenes formed a single group . two strains, including type strain  and another from the extreme end of the tree were selected for framework sequences were taken to represent maximum diversity within this species.

c. colicanis
phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from  <dig> strains of c. colicanis showed no clear cut grouping as evident by the low bv . two strains, including type strain , representing the two extreme ends of the phylogenetic tree were selected as framework sequences.

c. sardiniense
high genetic diversity in the phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from  <dig> strains of c. sardiniense was supported by low bv in most of the branches . three strains, including type strain , were selected as framework sequences to represent maximum genetic diversity within the species.

c. baratii
phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from  <dig> strains of c. baratii showed a single major group with high bv among most of the strains . three strains, including type strain , were selected for framework sequences.

c. chauvoei
phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from  <dig> strains of c. chauvoei showed no clear cut grouping as reflected by the wide range of bv, which varied from 246- <dig> . two strains, including type strain , one from either end of the tree were selected for developing the phylogenetic framework.

c. subterminale
the genetic diversity within the rrs sequences of  <dig> strains of c. subterminale was quite low, as evident from the phylogenetic tree  . two representatives, one from each cluster, including the type strain  were found to be sufficient for developing the phylogenetic frame work.

c. tetani
phylogenetic tree based on the rrs sequences from  <dig> strains of c. tetani species showed three small groups  . two strains, including type strain , one from each end of the tree were selected for framework sequences to ensure inclusion of maximum diversity within the species in the study.

a total of  <dig> rrs sequences were short listed to represent the genetic diversity in  <dig> different clostridium species . a reference phylogenetic tree based on framework sequences  shows clear cut segregation of rrs sequences into separate clades, each consisting of members of c. butyricum, c. chauvoei, c. colicanis, c. kluyveri, c. perfringens and c. tetani. in contrast, c. acetobutylicum was found to be segregated into two groups  one close to c. pasteurianum  and  another showing high similarity with c. beijerinckii and c. butyricum. high heterogeneity was observed between c. baratii and c. sardiniense. the most heterogeneous group was represented by the strains of c. botulinum. four different associations were recorded between c. botulinum and  c. sporogenes,  c. subterminale,  c. novyi and  a group of c. acetobutylicum and c. butyricum the most interesting feature of the reference phylogenetic framework tree were  completely independent placing of c. chauvoei, c. kluyveri, c. tetani and  close relationships among  c. acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum and c. butyricum ,  c. baratii, c. colicanis and c. sardiniense ,  c. botulinum and c. novyi , and  c. acetobutylicum, c. botulinum, c. pasteurianum and c. subterminale .

validation of species-specific phylogenetic framework sequences
in our quest to validate the phylogenetic framework sequences, different phylogenetic trees were drawn on the basis of  <dig> rrs sequences belonging to  <dig> different clostridium species along with  <dig> reference sequences. seven different phylogenetic trees  very clearly showed that the clostridium isolates segregated well within their respective phylogenetic framework sequences except c. acetobutylicum . in the case of c. acetobutylicum eighteen rrs sequences segregated well with the type strain  and  <dig> framework sequences and the rest six  formed an independent group, which was quite close to c. beijerinckii along with c. butyricum.

 phylogenetic relationships of clostridium sp
the phylogenetic framework of rrs sequences described above was used to check if  <dig> isolates identified as clostridium sp. can be classified among these clostridium species reported to occur with high frequency . out of these  <dig> clostridium sp.,  <dig> were found to segregate among  <dig> clostridium species with a high bv : c. acetobutylicum -  <dig>  c. subterminale -  <dig> , c. tetani -  <dig>  c. baratii and c. botulinum -  <dig> each, c. sporogenes/c. botulinum and c. chauvoei -  <dig> each, c. pasteurianum and c. kluyveri -  <dig> each, c. botulinum/c. butyricum -  <dig> and c. perfringens -  <dig> . a unique case of  <dig> clostridium sp. was their association with c. acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii albeit with low bv of 350- <dig> . however, subsequent analyses  revealed that these  <dig> clostridium species can be classified as c. beijerinckii. incidentally, none of the clostridium sp. was found to belong to c. sardiniense, c. novyi and c. colicanis. a group of  <dig> rrs sequences of clostridium sp. could not be grouped among the  <dig> known clostridium species . since these  <dig> isolates have the potential to be classified as novel clostridium species, these were also checked for their phylogenetic relationships with clostridium spp. with low frequency of occurrence.

no clostridium sp. could be assigned to c. butyricum, c. colicanis and c. sardiniense.

 phylogenetic relationships of clostridium species with low frequency occurrence
a total of  <dig> rrs sequences of clostridium isolates belonging to  <dig> distinct species and  <dig> groups which have been classified as swine manure, intestinal bacterium, eubacterium, etc.  were found to form distinct phylogenetic groups . the evolutionary relationship among the  <dig> rrs sequences of clostridium spp.  which have been reported so far to occur with a low frequency formed a few very distinct and independent groups along with those occurring with relatively high frequency, for example - c. subterminale and c. estertheticum. although these appear to be close on a single clade but are phylogenetically quite distant as evident by low bv  <dig>  another clade, which harbored c. subterminale was associated quite closely  with clostridium tunisiense, and red sea bacterium on one clade, clostridium sulfidigenes, c. thiosulfatireducens and bacterium isolates  on a second clade and yet another branch carried swine manure bacterium . the two species - c. acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii reported to occur with high frequency were weakly grouped along with clostridium diolis , c. chromoreductans , and c. corinoforum and c. saccharoperbutylacetonicum , but showed strong association with c. roseum , c. puniceum and c. favososporum , . these diverse clostridium species are quite heterogeneous and reflect their individual identities. however, their grouping together indicates the possibility of their common origin, which was quite high in the case of c. kluyveri branching with c. tyrobutyricum  but moderate in the case of clostridium ljungdahlii . c. botulinum, which is known to be genetically quite heterogeneous, showed close relationship with eubacterium and rumen bacterium  on one hand and with c. neonatale on the other . similarly, c. acetobutylicum showed strong association with clostridium aurantibutyricum, c. felsineum and c. roseum . it also branched along with clostridium collagenovorans albeit with a relatively low bv of  <dig>  c. botulinum and c. novyi shared a branch on the phylogenetic tree along with c. haemolyticum . c. tetani is a unique clostridium sp. which appears to be of independent origin; however, it showed closeness to clostridium cochlearium and c. tetanomorphum . c. chauvoei was found to be close to clostridium carnis and c. septicum , whereas c. pasteurianum showed high homology with c. acidisoli and c. akagii  and less homology with clostridiales in general  . thirty one rrs sequences of clostridium isolates belonging to swine fecal, unidentified eubacterium and clostrideaceae bacterium , which did not cluster with clostridium spp., were found to have an overall low phylogenetic relationship . the evolutionary relationship among the rest  <dig> of  <dig> rrs sequences of clostridium spp. which have been reported so far to occur with a low frequency formed a few very distinct and independent groups .

a,b,dclostridium spp. known to occur with low frequency were found to be phylogentically close to clostridium spp. used for developing framework  were also similar with respect to their in silico reb digestion pattern and uniquec nucleotide signatures   c+/- denotes presence/absence of a nucleotide signature also found in the respective species represented in the phylogenetic framework.

 phylogenetic relationships of novel clostridium species
out of  <dig> isolates of clostridium sp.,  <dig> rrs sequences which have the potential to be classified as novel were found to be represented by  <dig> groups . a quite low bvs among them implies high genetic heterogeneity . to further verify if these  <dig> clostridium sp. are of independent origin, their phylogenetic relationships were checked with clostridium spp. reported to occur with low frequency . it can be seen from the phylogenetic trees  that they are quite independent as supported by low bv. the possibility of assigning these  <dig> rrs sequences to novel clostridium species was further supported by subsequent analyses - nucleotide signatures and in silico re digestion patterns.

in silico restriction enzyme activity
our recent studies  <cit>  have revealed a high level of latent characteristics within rrs sequences based on in silico digestion with  <dig> type ii res. these in silico digestions have resulted in predicting clear cut fragment lengths in the rrs with six res: alui, bfai, dpnii, haeiii, rsai and tru9i  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> res - alui, bfai, dpnii, haeiii, rsai, smai and tru9i were found effective in drawing meaningful conclusions . re sites for bamhi, noti, psti and saci were almost completely absent from the rrs sequences of all the strains of  <dig> clostridium spp. and thus proved to be ''non"-cutters . another group, which did not permit clear cut conclusions to be drawn was composed of the following three res: ecori, hindiii, and nrui, with one re site each  in most of the clostridium strains.

alui
in silico digestion of rrs sequences of  <dig> different clostridium spp. with re - alui resulted in 4- <dig> fragments. the segregation of clostridium species was evident at two levels -  intra-species and  inter-species. intra-species variation was observed among c. pasteurianum - rrs sequences, which were found to possess 4- <dig> re - alui digestion sites. two fragments of 186- <dig> nts were found in all the four groups. at the 5' end, upstream of the  <dig> nts fragments, the re sites were not detectable such that the two fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> nts seem to have merged together to generate a 61/ <dig> nts long fragment. similarly on the 3' end, the merger of the two fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> nts resulted in a larger nucleotide fragment of  <dig> nts .

intra-species level segregation was also evident in case of c. botulinum. here, the 120/ <dig> rrs sequences were found to be distributed into  <dig> groups of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences each. the largest group of  <dig> sequences of c. botulinum had  <dig> re - alui digestion sites resulting in the following fragments between them: 170-795-265- <dig> nts. the next group of  <dig> sequences of c. botulinum was quite close to the former. however, it lacked a re site at the 5' end, such that one could not predict the presence of  <dig> nts sized fragment. the two smaller groups of  <dig> and  <dig> rrs sequences of c. botulinum had 6- <dig> re - alui sites each. these two groups shared the following fragment sizes and the order of their occurrence: 566-228/230-205/207-57- <dig> nts. the later group of  <dig> of c. botulinum sequences had an additional re site which led to the prediction of a  <dig> nts fragment at the 5' end of this gene. it may be remarked that these four groups differed because of the absence/presence of re sites .

variability in the re - alui sites among rrs sequences of c. acetobutylicum was also quite high. out of  <dig> rrs sequences,  <dig> of them showed two re - alui sites resulting in clear cut fragment of  <dig> nts. on the other hand, a small group of  <dig> sequences had additional re sites, which resulted in additional fragments of  <dig> nts at 5' end and  <dig> nts at 3' end. c. butyricum 3/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> c. acetobutylicum rrs sequences show high homology in their re - alui digestion pattern. c. baratii and c. sardiniense had similar re patterns leading to the following order of fragments - 186-604/605-206-57- <dig> nts. the situation of c. colicanis was unique as it resembled c. baratii and c. sardiniense except in the absence of a re - alui site resulting in the merger of 206- <dig> nts fragments into a single fragment of  <dig> nts. on the other hand, c. colicanis showed high resemblance in its in silico re digestion pattern to most c. perfringens  .

a perusal of all the numbers and the order of occurrence of the fragments predicted to be generated by re -alui in silico digestion enabled us to segregate the following:  c. acetobutylicum ,  c. chauvoei,  c. colicanis,  c. kluyveri,  c. pasteurianum,  c. perfringens, and  c. subterminale . c. sporogenes/c. botulinum  are indistinguishable here but can be distinguished on the basis of other res .

bfai
with re - bfai in silico digestion of rrs sequences of  <dig> clostridium species predicted the presence of 5- <dig> fragments of distinct nucleotide sizes. intra-species level variability among re - bfai generated fragments was evident in c. acetobutylicum and c. botulinum. re digestion of c. acetobutylicum rrs sequences resulted in segregating them into two populations -  16/ <dig> sequences and  4/ <dig> sequences. these two populations of c. acetobutylicum showed high similarity in re pattern towards their 3' end: 146-159/160-161/164-68- <dig> nts fragments. they differed by the presence of two additional re - bfai sites, which resulted in two more fragments of 378- <dig> nts towards the 5'end of the 4/ <dig> rrs sequences of c. acetobutylicum .

on the basis of re - bfai in silico digestion of rrs of c. botulinum, high genetic heterogeneity was evident among the  <dig> isolates. the four groups of c. botulinum were composed of as follows:   <dig>    <dig>    <dig>  and  34/ <dig> sequences. all the four groups of c. botulinum could be easily distinguished on the basis of their re - bfai digestion fragment lengths. the first group of 57/ <dig> c. botulinum had a unique re - bfai digestion pattern: 195-20-163-29-146-185- <dig> nts in their rrs. second group of 27/ <dig> c. botulinum had similarity only with c. sporogenes for their re - bfai digestion pattern: 378-29-146-185- <dig> nts in their rrs. it differed from the first group due to merger of three fragments 195-20- <dig> at the 5' end in to a single fragment of  <dig> nts in the latter. the third group of 9/ <dig> c. botulinum were found to possess an in silico re - bfai digestion pattern: 378-29-146-158-231- <dig> nts in their rrs sequences. it was similar to that observed in c. novyi and c. tetani. the fourth cluster of c. botulinum , did not show any genetic variability with respect to re - bfai in silico activities with respect to those observed in c. beijerinckii, c. butyricum, c. sardiniense, c. subterminale, and c. acetobutylicum  . this feature implies that these species might have a common phylogenetic origin.

on the basis of inter-species variation in the re - bfai sites on the rrs the following clostridium species can be distinguished from the rest of the species: c. acetobutylicum , c. baratii, c. botulinum , c. chauvoei, c. colicanis, c. kluyveri, c. pasteurianum and c. perfringens .

dpnii
in the case of in silico digestion of rrs sequences with re - dpnii, a large intra-species variation was evident in the cases of  <dig> different clostridium species:  c. acetobutylicum,  c. baratii,  c. beijerinckii,  c. botulinum,  c. butyricum,  c. kluyveri,  c. novyi,  c. pasteurianum and  c. perfringens. on the other hand, interspecies variation was evident in the cases of c. chauvoei, c. colicanis, c. sardiniense, c. subterminale and c. tetani. in spite of high homology among different clostridium species in terms of the order, number and length of the fragments generated by re - dpnii, the following seven clostridium species: c. butyricum, c. chauvoei, c. colicanis, c. kluyveri, c. subterminale and c. tetani could still be easily distinguished . on the other hand, in spite of certain unique features in c. acetobutylicum and c. perfringens, intra-species variation did not allow complete segregation and may need supplementary information from other res.

haeiii, rsai, smai and tru9i
in silico re - haeiii, rsai, smai and tru9i digestion of rrs of  <dig> clostridium species resulted in predicting the presence of 1- <dig> sites. due to high variation in the characteristics of the nucleotide fragments within and among clostridium species, a unique re digestion pattern was observed in in the following cases:  c. chauvoei, c. colicanis, c. kluyveri and c. tetani with haeiii ,  c. novyi with rsai ,  c. colicanis with smai  and  c. baratii, c. novyi and c. sardiniense with tru9i . it implies limited scope for exploiting these res for identification purposes.

ano unique digestion pattern was detected

bit denotes unique in terms of fragment length , order and number

cin the cases of c. acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum and c. sporogenes, no unique pattern could be detected and have been discussed separately. the different groups are based on their phylogenetic relationship . it is further assumed here that c. beijerinckii is a part of population comprised of c. acetobutylicum and similarly c. sporogenes is a part of c. botulinum.

in silico re digestion of rrs of  <dig> clostridium species enabled us to identify unique features  of this gene which can be used as bio-markers . c. butyricum, c. perfringens and c. sardiniense could be distinguished from all other clostridium spp. on the basis of the in silico digestion with re - dpnii, bfai and tru9i, respectively. c. baratii, c. novyi, c. pasteurianum, c. subterminale and c. tetani could be distinguished from the rest of the species on the basis of in silico digestion pattern of their rrs with all res except smai. the most interesting features seem to reside in the rrs sequences of c. chauvoei, c. colicanis and c. kluyveri, which possessed unique pattern of active sites for 4- <dig> different res such that any one of these was sufficient to identify them. in the cases of c. acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum and c. sporogenes, no unique pattern could be detected. for the groups comprised of  c. botulinum - c. sporogenes and  c. acetobutylicum - c. beijerinckii, we could not detect any unique re digestion patterns and may need to be compared with a combination of res. the close phylogenetic relationship between c. botulinum and c. sporogenes has been reported previously also  <cit> . since they differ on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship , it appears that c. beijerinckii is a part of population comprised of c. acetobutylicum and similarly c. sporogenes is a part of isolates belonging to c. botulinum. alternatively, the issue can be resolved by creating new species by subdividing c. acetobutylicum and c. botulinum.

validation of framework sequences by in silico re activity on 16s rdna sequences of organisms identified as clostridium sp
the second level of investigation after segregating clostridium sp.   on the basis of phylogenetic frame work was to validate them on the basis of unique re digestion patterns deduced from the rrs sequences of  <dig> known clostridium spp.

c. acetobutylicum
in the case of c. acetobutylicum, two distinct populations were observed in the initial phylogenetic tree which was based on rrs sequences of  <dig> isolates of this species. a similar trend of two major groups was very clearly evident also on the basis of re - alui in silico digestion patterns:  186-611- <dig> nts and   <dig> nts. the  <dig> clostridium sp., which we could classify as c. acetobutylicum on the basis of phylogenetic framework  were further supported by re digestion patterns of their rrs sequences. here also we could observe that the total population was composed of  <dig> different groups, consisting of  <dig> and  <dig> organisms each. the two groups segregated due to single nucleotide polymorphism  at re sites. modifications in re sites can arise primarily through single nucleotide insertion, deletion and/or substitution  <cit> .

c. beijerinckii
high homology between c. beijerinckii and c. acetobutylicum was evident due to similarities in in silico digestion pattern generated by the action of most of the res employed in this study especially - alui, bfai, haeiii, rsai, smai and tru9i. however, it was "unique" in its re pattern with respect to dpnii. the rrs sequences of c. beijerinckii on digestion with re - tru9i showed a pattern of 114-40-363-26-251-34-52-56-76-76- <dig> nts, which is quite similar to that recorded with a proportion of c. acetobutylicum population. however, these could be distinguished on the basis of re - dpnii in silico digestion fragments  <dig> or 287- <dig> nts found in rrs sequences of c. acetobutylicum, but were absent in these  <dig> newly identified c. beijerinckii isolates. thus, we recommend the usage of a combination of dpnii and tru9i to validate the identification of  <dig> clostridium sp. as c. beijerinckii .

c. subterminale
the phylogenetic framework based on  <dig> rrs sequences of c. subterminale allowed identification of  <dig> unique in silico re digestion patterns with alui and dpnii. the validation of  <dig> clostridium sp. which could be classified as c. subterminale through phylogenetic framework  was done through in silico re digestion of their 16s rdna with both the res. thus in silico digestions supported the segregation of these clostridium sp. as c. subterminale. two of three populations were distinct on the basis of the uniqueness of their fragment characteristics - number, length and order of occurrence  re - alui a) 345-450- <dig> nts and b) 170-796-207- <dig> nts and  re - dpnii a) 285-565- <dig> and b) 273- <dig> nts. however, the third group of isolates identified as c. subterminale was intermediate to the other two populations with respect to the patterns obtained with both the res - alui and dpnii.

c. botulinum and c. sporogenes
c. botulinum sp. produces seven serotypes  of botulinum neurotoxins   <cit> . it shows  <dig> distinct lineages   <cit> , where good correlations have been found between their phenotypes and phylogenetic classification:  group i - proteolytic c. botulinum types a, b and f which are close to c. sporogenes,  group ii consists of saccharolytic types b, e and f,  group iii includes types c and d and c. novyi type a and  group iv has clostridium argentinense  and c. subterminale  <cit> . based on dna s <dig> nuclease analysis, c. botulinum was found to be genetically close to c. sporogenes at the species level, however, the later was proposed to be conserved for non-toxigenic strains  <cit> .

in a phylogenetic tree based only on the framework sequences, c. botulinum and c. sporogenes were found to occur together on a single clade. a comparison of the different in silico re digestion patterns of rrs of c. sporogenes and c. botulinum showed exact homology in the cases of res - alui, bfai, haeiii, rsai, tru9i and smai except dpnii . in the case of dpnii, c. sporogenes was segregated into  <dig> populations, where one of them showed exact homology with c. botulinum and the other one was different and unique in comparison to all other clostridium species. it may not be too inappropriate to suggest that c. sporogenes is perhaps a sub-species of c. botulinum or it may find its appropriate place if c. botulinum can be reclassified as  <dig> different sub-species. this proposal finds support from the re pattern of sequences of clostridium species  which had been classified as c. sporogenes with the help of phylogenetic frame work. nine clostridium sp. which appeared close to c. botulinum, c. sporogenes and c. novyi  were found to be similar to each other with respect to the in silico activities of one or more res - tru9i, haeiii, alui and bfai.

other clostridium spp
the rest  <dig> clostridium sp. identified up to species level on the basis of phylogenetic framework , could be supported also by high similarity in the in silico re digestion pattern of their rrs:  c. tetani - haeiii,  c. chauvoei - alui and bfai,  c. kluyveri - alui,  c. pasteurianum and c. perfringens - bfai and  c. baratii - tru9i and bfai .

the phylogenetic relationships observed among clostridium spp. reported to occur with low frequency formed quite distinct clusters. sixty eight rrs sequences belonging to  <dig> species were found to clusters along with  <dig> clostridium spp. used for framework analysis. the close relationship among the different clostridium spp. was validated by comparing their in silico analysis re digestion pattern of their rrs , which matched invariably with the unique re pattern of known clostridium spp. it is perhaps the first report where in  <dig> different clostridium species have been segregated among  <dig> groups based on phylogeny and in silico re digestion pattern of their rrs.

nucleotide signature analysis - frequency and distribution pattern
to further validate the segregation of clostridium sp. done on the basis of phylogenetic frame work, we investigated them for the presence of nucleotide signatures  deduced from isolates of the  <dig> known clostridium spp. the validity of the nucleotide signatures was done through the frequency of occurrence of the reference organism among the top  <dig> hits .

the sequences of 8- <dig> data sets submitted group-wise to meme  program http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_5_0/cgi-bin/meme.cgi revealed ten signatures  for each species. regular expression diagram of signatures   and the frequency of occurrence of motifs obtained through meme for different taxonomic groups have been presented with reference to  <dig> clostridium spp. .

out of the  <dig> signatures , identified in each of the  <dig> different clostridium spp., unique signatures in the rrs sequences  were found in the following cases: c. beijerinckii and c. sporogenes -  <dig> each, c. butyricum -  <dig>  c. colicanis -  <dig>  c. kluyveri, c. pasteurianum and c. perfringens -  <dig> each, c. chauvoei -  <dig> and c. tetani -  <dig>  however, using similar strategy, no unique signatures could be identified in the cases of  c. baratii and c. sardiniense,  c. botulinum, c. novyi and c. subterminale and  c. acetobutyilicum. these latter  <dig> clostridium spp. have been dealt with separately as detailed below.

ccan be designated as unique signatures if we assume i) c. baratii and  c. sardiniense and ii) c. botulinum, c. novyi and c. subterminale to belong to single sp. based on phylogenetic framework and in silico analyses

dout of the two groups of  <dig> and  <dig> organisms, no unique signature could be detected in the first group

c. baratii and c. sardiniense
out of  <dig> signatures deduced among the rrs sequences of  <dig> isolates of c. baratii only two - m <dig> and m <dig> could be designated as "unique". in fact, these two signatures were absent from all other clostridium spp. except c. sardiniense. similarly, in c. sardiniense  <dig> out of  <dig> nucleotide signatures were found to be "unique" to it but were present in the overall rrs sequence of c. baratii. we may conclude that although these two clostridium spp. did not show any exact resemblance in their signatures, however, they shared  <dig> out of  <dig> signatures in their overall rrs sequence. thus it is difficult to use them for segregating the two clostridium species. this observation of high homology is further supported by the fact that c. baratii and c. sardiniense are phylogenetically present on a single clade and had high bv in the range of 654- <dig> . in spite of such high similarity they could be separated on the basis of nucleotide signature  of c. baratii - 5-tattgttagttgctaccatttagttgagca-3' .

c. botulinum and c. acetobutylicum
organisms belonging to c. botulinum were segregated phylogenetically into  <dig> groups. distinct nucleotide signatures could be detected on segregating  <dig> rrs sequences of c. botulinum isolates into two groups - i)  <dig> equivalent to cboi of the phylogenetic tree  and ii)  <dig> representing  . the first group of  <dig> isolates had  <dig> unique nucleotide signatures, which could be used to distinguish them from all other clostridium species except c. sporogenes isolates. on the other hand,  <dig> rrs sequences of isolates belonging to cboii-cboiv could not be distinguished on the basis of the  <dig> nucleotide signatures deduced from their rrs sequences. previous reports of screening with four res and  <dig> primers combinations revealed that hindiii and hpych4iv are effective in demonstrating extensive diversity among c. botulinum type e, whereas c. botulinum group i indicted low genetic diversity  <cit> . a similar scenario was evident also in the case of c. acetobutylicum. it prompted us to conclude that c. acetobutylicum and c. botulinum perhaps represent ancestral clostridium species.

validation of framework sequences for clostridium sp: nucleotide signatures
to validate the categorization and classification of  <dig> rrs sequences of clostridium sp. belonging to  <dig> clostridium spp. , we looked up for  <dig> nucleotide signatures of the reference framework sequences in them. of these  <dig> signatures, the emphasis has been laid on i) the signatures unique to a particular clostridium sp. and ii) presence of rest of the signatures. on the basis of these two criteria, we may conclude that clostridium spp.: c. subterminale - 16/ <dig> sequences, c. tetani - 2/ <dig> sequences, c. perfringens - 1/ <dig> sequence, c. pasteurianum - 4/ <dig> sequences, c. baratii and c. sardiniense - 5/ <dig> sequences showed quite close match with the reference framework sequences. on the other hand, c. beijerinckii had only one unique signature which was absent in 13/ <dig> sequences of clostridium sp. but due to the presence of all other signatures we may conclude that they are quite close to the reference framework sequences. similarly, c. acetobutylicum showed that 29/ <dig> clostridium sp. were quite similar to the reference sequences. this implies that in these cases signature analysis supports the framework sequence based analysis. however, in the following clostridium spp., the identified clostridium sp. did not show much homology with respect to the signatures found in the reference framework sequences:  c. botulinum,  c. chauvoei, c. kluyveri, c. novyi and c. sporogenes.

discussion
molecular techniques have added new dimensions and sensitivity to the phylogeny and taxonomy of organisms. the most remarkable and widely acknowledged are the unique features of highly conserved gene - rrs  <cit> . based on rrs sequencing collins et al. revealed the polyphyletic nature of clostridium sensu stricto  <cit> . since then there have been many additions and rectifications in the classification of clostridium  <cit> . there are two major issues with respect to clostridial taxonomy and phylogeny. first is the high genetic diversity - gc content, which varies from  <dig> mol%   <cit>  to  <dig> mol%   <cit> . it is perhaps too wide a range to encompass a single genus  <cit>  and may need revision. secondly, clostridium comprises a very heterogeneous group of bacteria representing more than  <dig> spp., with a large proportion having only 1- <dig> strains. the question is whether we should split the genus clostridium  and/or we may merge quite a few of its species . in certain cases of recent speciation events, where rrs is not sufficient to discriminate phylogenetically close relatives, one resorts to dna-dna reassociation technique  <cit> . in spite of an ever increasing knowledge about various conserved genes for distinguishing microbes  <cit> , rrs continues to be quite effective in segregating and even in reclassifying quite a few microbial isolates as new genera and species. a large number of organisms reported initially as bacillus species  <cit>  have been reclassified as genus geobacillus  <cit> , sporosarcina  <cit> , or marinibacillus marinus  <cit> . in fact, many species of clostridium  <cit>  have also been reclassified as new genera, such as sedimentibacter  <cit> . the three clostridium spp. - c. carboxidivorans, c. drakei, and c. scatologenes, which showed high  sequence similarity for their rrs sequences  <cit>  were later found to be distinct species based on their dna-dna reassociation values  <cit> . in spite of such high volume of data available on rrs http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/, the fact remains that it needs support from other genes to arrive at authentic conclusions. does it imply that rrs is already at its dead end? or do we need to look deeper into the latent and as yet un-explored features of this wonderful gene?

our recent studies on the diversity of bacillus spp.  <cit>  and stenotrophomonas isolates  <cit>  revealed certain very interesting 'latent' features of rrs. we could designate rrs of certain isolates as phylogenetic framework sequences. these were supported by species specific unique signatures and in silico re patterns. together, all these features of rrs allowed us to  classify bacillus sp., reveal novel lineages and distinguish the two subgroups of b. subtilis  <cit>  and  evaluate the biodiversity of stenotrophomonas isolates  <cit> . these studies indicate towards unexplored features within the rrs to define and circumscribe the genus clostridium sensu stricto  <cit> .

the species-specific phylogenetic framework developed here proved instrumental as a tool to deducing the limits of genetic diversity within  <dig> clostridium spp. the validity of the phylogenetic framework sequences was established by clear cut segregation of members of a given clostridium sp. against a total of  <dig> rrs sequences . high genetic heterogeneity was recorded among members of c. acetobutylicum and c. botulinum in our study. it has been previously supported by significant differences in their physiological and genetic characteristics  <cit> . within the  <dig> framework sequences of 16s rdna of  <dig> clostridium spp. based phylogenetic tree, we observed the  <dig> framework sequences of c. acetobutylicum to segregate in to two groups:   <dig> sequences were close to c. beijerinckii and c. butyricum and   <dig> were close to c. pasteurianum . the findings in our study find support from previous phylogenetic studies based on concatenated sequences of  <dig> proteins, which showed that c. acetobutylicum clusters along with c. beijerinckii in addition to other species such as c. botulinum, c. kluyveri, c. novyi, c. perfringens, and c. tetani with 100% bv  <cit> . in fact,  <dig> strains belonging to c. acetobutylicum were reclassified as either c. beijerinckii  or c. saccharobutylicum  <cit> . here, we observed that some strains of c. acetobutylicum are phylogenetically close to c. felsineum, however dna-dna hybridization study  <cit>  shows them to be distinct species.

similarly, c. botulinum is well known to for its segregation on the basis of a wide range of neurotoxins produced by them  <cit> . here in our study, c. botulinum 16s rdna sequences showed  <dig> clear grouping in accordance with those reported in literature  <cit> :  c. sporogenes,  a group of c. butyricum and c. acetobutylicum,  c. novyi and  c. subterminale. this close relationship among the species of clostridium cluster i  finds support from the presence of  <dig> amino acid insert in a highly conserved region of gyrase a protein, which could not be traced in any other clostridia or other group of bacteria  <cit> . high phylogenetic closeness based on rrs has been reported between c. botulinum and c. sporogenes  <cit>  and c. botulinum type g and c. subterminale  <cit> . three distinct lineages of c. botulinum were confirmed by aflp analysis of their rrs sequences  <cit> . in the present work, other close relationships were observed among  c. baratii, c. colicanis and c. sardiniense  and  c. botulinum and c. novyi . a complete molecular typing of c. botulinum is needed for correct classification of this species  <cit> . in depth analysis of rrs reported here can in fact provide enough supplementary information to counter multilocus sequence typing recommended for elucidating phylogeny of c. botulinum  <cit> . on the basis of the evidences provided here , we further propose here that c. botulinum needs to be reclassified in to  <dig> different -species, as is generally believed by many researchers  <cit> . the validity of framework sequences was further confirmed in the case of the classification of  <dig> clostridium sp. up to species level, by in silico re digestions especially - alui, bfai and dpnii .

our present analysis which shows a close phylogenetic relationship between c. subterminale and certain clostridium spp. such as c. argentinense, c. estertheticum, and c. thiosulfatireducens , finds support from the previous reports of spring et al.,  <cit> . although c. tetanomorphum has been observed to be close to c. subterminale and c. thiosulfatireducens with a 97% bv  <cit>  but we found it to be close to c. tetani . unlike previous studies  <cit> , we could demonstrate closer relationships among  c. puniceum, c. beijerinckii and c. butyricum and  c. haemolyticum and c. novyi with a much smaller number of rrs frame work sequences.

quite a few species of other clostridial genera in cluster i belong to eubacterium moniliforme, e. terantellae, ancerobacter polyendosporus, sarcina ventriculi and s. maxima  <cit> . as far as eubacterium is concerned, several clostridium spp. have been reclassified within newly created genera: moorella and oxobacter  <cit>  or within eubacterium itself  <cit> . c. barkeri, a member of cluster xv was found close to eubacterium limosum with a level of similarity as high as 95%  <cit> . in cluster xvi: phylogenetically significant association was observed among the  <dig> species - eubacterium biforme, c. innocuum, and streptococcus pleomorphus  <cit> . in the present study, eubacterium combesii, e. moniliforme and e. budayi were found to cluster with c. botulinum, c. baratii and c. sardiniense, respectively.

high similarity in the nucleotide signatures within rrs sequences of c. acetobutylicum and c. botulinum prompt us to speculate that c. acetobutylicum and c. botulinum might have common ancestor. in fact, these two clostridium spp. shared 34-35% of the total rrs sequences. similarly, we have observed that certain signatures are common to almost all the  <dig> clostridium spp. which were used for developing framework sequences. it may be remarked that at least  <dig> common signatures  were distributed along the length of the rrs . the most unique features were the positions of signatures with maximum frequency, which varied from 394- <dig>  implying higher susceptibility of the flanking regions to genetic modifications. in fact, such large core regions were also observed in bacillus sp.  <cit> . it can be concluded that about  <dig> nts were shared by different clostridium spp. and may represent those sequences which are highly conserved during evolution and may be designated as representatives of the genus clostridium.

CONCLUSIONS
rrs sequences have certain features such as nucleotide signatures  and unique re digestion patterns which can be exploited for defining bacterial taxonomy and phylogeny. this approach enabled us to develop species specific phylogenetic framework. these genetic tools allowed us to categorize clostridium isolates which have been classified presently up to genus level into  well defined clostridium spp. and  as novel species. it also holds promise to reduce the number of clostridium species represented by small populations. this integrated approach is quite sensitive and can be easily extended as a molecular tool for diagnosis of microbes used in food industries and health departments.

it appears as if we are reiterating  the statement made by prof. c.l. oakley, almost  <dig> decades ago: "little is gained by multiplying genera to include rare or imperfectly-described forms, though increase in our knowledge may justify subdivision of the genus  in the future."  <cit> .
