BACKGROUND
segmental duplications  are euchromatic portions of genomic dna  that occur at more than one site within the genome and typically share a high level of sequence identity   <cit> . both in situ hybridization and in silico analyses have shown that ~5% of the human genome is composed of duplicated sequences  <cit> . duplications that can be traced to an ancestral or donor location are named duplicons. based on a neutral model of genome evolution  <cit> , duplicons with approximately 10% sequence divergence correspond to duplication events that have occurred 30– <dig> million years ago , i.e. before the radiation of old world monkey and hominoid species  <cit> . furthermore, a conspicuous bias of interchromosomal sds toward pericentromeric regions, or euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions in general, was detected  <cit> . fine-scale analyses of pericentromeric regions disclosed a two-step model for the formation of such dynamic regions. an initial pericentromeric "seeding" event followed by subsequent exchange  of duplicon blocks between pericentromeric regions has been proposed  <cit> . both homologous and non-homologous processes were shown to be involved in "seeding" and "swapping" of pericentromeric sds in human and great ape genomes  <cit>  . the duplicative architecture of human and higher primate genomes has been shown to be a major force promoting rapid evolutionary turnover  <cit> . although the predisposition to expansion of interspersed segmental duplication is common to human and great apes, it appears that many species-specific duplication events have taken place at different regions of their genomes. interestingly, two independent approaches determined the fraction of species-specific sds in chimpanzee and human to be ~30%, while ~66% of sds seem to be shared between both species  <cit> . thus, species-specific sds are thought to have contributed to a larger extent to the genetic difference between chimpanzee and human than single-base mutations  <cit> . moreover, sds seem to be sites of recurrent large-scale structural variations  <cit>  and it has been estimated that ~20% of sds are polymorphic within the human and chimpanzee genome  <cit> .

interestingly, among all human chromosomes the y chromosome has the highest relative sd content  <cit> . recently, we have analyzed  <dig> kb of y-chromosomal non-palindromic sds delineating the four euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions in yp <dig> /yp <dig> , yq <dig> /yq <dig> , yq <dig> /yq <dig> and yq12/ypar <dig>  <cit> .

here we report the detailed investigation of the chek <dig> duplicons, one of which is embedded within the analyzed yq <dig> /yq <dig>  sd cluster. the ancestral duplicated region, containing the proximal part of the functional chek <dig> gene  and the distal part of ttc <dig> , is located in 22q <dig>   <cit> . chek <dig> has been shown to be a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene  <cit> . interestingly, chk <dig>  the protein encoded by chek <dig>  is a cell cycle checkpoint kinase acting in the dna-damage response signalling pathway  <cit> . cell cycle checkpoints monitor the structural integrity of chromosomes before their progression through crucial cell cycle stages. chk <dig> homologues were found in yeast and higher eukaryotes  <cit>  indicating an important role throughout eukaryotic evolution in controlling the integrity of the genome. the continuous presence of the chek <dig> gene in all eukaryotes  <cit>  and its important role in maintaining genome stability  <cit>  prompted us to investigate the duplicative evolution and phylogeny of chek <dig> and its paralogs during anthropoid evolution. we applied a combination of comparative fish and in silico analyses. in addition, we used inter-species quantitative pcr for further validation and for detection of intra-species specific chek <dig> copy number variations.

methods
y-chromosomal cosmid library screening
we screened the lloync <dig> "m"  y-chromosomal library  for chek <dig> duplicon containing cosmids using a y-chromosomal probe generated by the following pcr-conditions: 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, 62°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> min and finally 72°c for  <dig> min. the following primers were used to generate a  <dig> bp probe: ip-cos-sd1-for 5'-acccccttagtagcgtccttagctc-3' and ip-cos-sd1-rev 5'-accaccggagtttcacaaagaaagt-3'. the gel-purified probe was radioactively labelled according to the 'random priming' protocol  <cit> . prehybridization and hybridization of the high density gridded filters were carried out for  <dig> hrs at 42°c according to the manufacturer's protocol. final filter-washing was carried out in 1%sds/2xssc solution for  <dig> hr at 65°c. primers located proximal and distal of the derivative y-chromosomal chek <dig> duplicon were used for pcr  to identify cosmids containing the entire duplicon:

pb-cos-sd1-for 5'-agcgcaaattgcagaattacaaaga-3', pb-cos-sd1-rev 5'-ggttagagaggataagccgcatgtt-3', db-cos-sd1-for 5'-gatcccgcacatttgttcattagag-3', db-cos-sd1-rev 5'-caaaagcttgaattctgtgcctcagt-3'

detection of derived caggg repeat sequences in the y-chromosomal cosmid lloync <dig> "m" 22e01
we used repeatmasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/ and tandem repeats finder  <cit>  to search for caggg repeat sequences within the y-chromosomal chek <dig> duplicon containing cosmid lloync03"m" 22e <dig>  both analyses failed to identify caggg repeat sequences in the derivative chek <dig> duplicon and in both adjacent derivative duplicons, which are the igl@-  and the nhedc1-  duplicons. nevertheless, repeatmasker and tandem repeats finder analysis revealed the presence of extensive caggg repeat sequences within the ancestral igl@ locus in 22q <dig>  . subsequent pairwise alignment of both ancestral and the derivative y-chromosomal igl@ loci disclosed a more diverged caggg repeat like sequence. by using the dnasp ver. <dig> . <dig> software 72% nucleotide sequence identity was detected between the caggg repeats present within the ancestral igl@-duplicon  and the derivative caggg repeats in yq <dig> /yq <dig>  .

blood samples and cell lines
the following blood samples from non-related individuals were used for qpcr analysis: blood samples from the chimpanzees  max  and fritz  were obtained from the zoologisch-botanischer garten wilhelma stuttgart . the blood sample from chimpanzee marcel  was obtained from tno primate centre rijswijk . lowland gorilla  blood samples of jangu , gaidi  and fritz  were obtained from the zoo wuppertal, the zoo leipzig and the tiergarten nürnberg, respectively. two blood samples of the bornean orangutans  thai  and napoleon  were obtained from the zoo duisburg  and the zoo studen , respectively. blood samples from two rhesus macaque individuals  and one hamadryas baboon individual  were obtained from the deutsches primaten zentrum göttingen .

skin tissue of a pig-tailed macaque  was provided by the deutsches primaten zentrum göttingen  and was used to establish a fibroblast cell line. for each species one of the above listed blood samples and the fibroblast cell line were used for fish analysis. lymphoblastoid cell lines of the white-cheeked crested gibbon  and the common marmoset  were kindly provided by s. müller  and were used for fish analysis.

fluorescence in situ hybridization 
fish analysis of metaphase spreads derived from lymphocytes or lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines from non-related human  and non-human primate males was performed. prior to fish, the slides were treated with rnase followed by pepsin digestion as described  <cit> . fish was carried out following the protocol described previously  <cit> . chromosome in situ suppression was applied to clones from the human fosmid library wi- <dig>  and from the y chromosome specific cosmid library lloynco3"m" . human whole-chromosome painting  libraries  <cit>  were used to unequivocally assign hybridizing signals to orthologous regions in lesser apes, old world monkeys and new world monkeys. pmr <dig>  a mouse-derived rdna-containing plasmid, was used to tag the old world monkey marker chromosome. after fish the slides were counterstained with dapi  and mounted in vectashield . preparations were evaluated using a zeiss axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with single-bandpass filters for excitation of red, green, and blue . during exposures, only excitation filters were changed allowing for pixel-shift-free image recording. images of high magnification and resolution were obtained using a black-and-white ccd camera  connected to the axiophot. camera control and digital image acquisition involved the use of an apple macintosh quadra  <dig> computer.

phylogenetic analysis
fasta formatted sequence files used to generate phylogenetic trees were extracted from the corresponding genbank accession numbers. sequence alignments were built by using clustalw   <cit> , and neighbor-joining phylograms created by using mega  v <dig>  http://www.megasoftware.net <cit> . neighbor-joining analysis was used with complete deletion parameters and bootstrap  to provide confidence of each branching point in the phylogenetic trees. neighbor-joining methods were chosen as they are amenable to calculating divergence times between sequence taxa. we estimated the number of substitutions per site per year by correcting the divergence times for multiple substitutions using kimura's two-parameter model  <cit> . as the rates of nucleotide substitution vary for pseudogenic sequences, the rate of nucleotide substitution was calibrated based on orthologous sequence comparisons using a divergence of  <dig> mya for macaque-human divergence  <cit> . duplication timing events were calculated by applying the equation r = k/ <dig> t  <cit> , where r is the rate of nucleotide changes per bp per yr, k is the distance calculated between the ancestral and paralogous sequences, and t is the time of divergence of the molecules.

quantitative pcr
interspecies quantitative pcr was carried out using primers specific for chek <dig> exon  <dig>  primers were designed with the assistance of the promega plexor primer design software. the following primer sequences were used: chek2-exon14-f 5'-ggaccttgtcaagaagttgttggt-3', chek2-exon14-r 5'-ggtgtcttaaggcttcttctgtcgta-3', cftr-f 5'-cgcgatttatctaggcataggc-3' and cftr-r 5'-tgtgatgaaggccaaaaatgg-3'

we used the abi prism  <dig> ht system  for real time detection. reactions contained  <dig>  μm of each primer and  <dig> μl of quantitec sybr® green pcr master mix  in a total of  <dig> μl. assays included dna standards at a final concentration of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/μl, a no-template control, or  <dig> ng/μl of the species dna in two replicates. cycling conditions were 50°c for two minutes, 95°c for  <dig> minutes, and  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec, 58°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> sec.

to avoid the generation of non-specific products, a melting curve analysis of products was routinely undertaken following the amplification. a standard curve was constructed by plotting the cycle number , at which the amount of target in standard dilutions reaches a fixed threshold, against the log of the amount of starting target. for standard curve construction genomic dna from the rhesus macaque mmu# <dig> was used as a chek <dig> single copy reference. the chek <dig> single copy status in the rhesus macaque genome was verified by both fish and in silico analysis. absolute quantification of copy number in the different species was subsequently done by interpolation of the threshold cycle number  against the corresponding standard curve. copy numbers of the test genes in primate samples were normalised to the copy number of the cftr gene , which serves as a control representative of a single gene per haploid genome  <cit> . cftr primers perfectly match the cftr gene in all targeted species genomes. the ratio of the chek <dig> copy number to cftr copy number in each sample normalised the results with respect to differing starting quantity and quality of the template dna in each reaction  <cit> . standard errors of the normalised chek <dig> copy numbers were calculated from the standard deviations of the values of the cftr and chek <dig> genes using the formula provided by the user menu . comparisons between the mean values were performed using the student unpaired t-test. a p-value < <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
identification and comparative fish of a chek <dig> duplicon containing y-chromosomal cosmid probe
to investigate the evolution of the chek <dig> duplicon we screened a y-chromosomal cosmid library  with a y-derived chek <dig> duplicon probe . a total of  <dig> positive clones were detected. probes bordering the y-chromosomal chek <dig> duplicon were subsequently used to identify cosmids containing the entire derivative duplicon. out of four positive clones cosmid lloync03"m"22e <dig>  was chosen for comparative fish on human, great ape, old world monkey  and new world monkey  metaphase chromosomes . in the human genome cosmid 22e <dig> hybridized to euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions yq <dig> /yq <dig>  and yq <dig> /yq <dig>  and to additional  <dig> transition regions on  <dig> different autosomes. the only interstitial hybridization signal detected was assigned to the ancestral chek <dig> locus in 22q <dig> . with only a few exceptions signals were detected in orthologous positions on chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes . signals on human and chimpanzee chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were missing on the orthologous gorilla chromosomes and species-specific signals were restricted to human chromosome  <dig>  and to gorilla chromosomes 2b and  <dig>  in contrast to the multi-site signal patterns found in all african great ape species, in the genomes of orangutan, the rhesus macaque and the common marmoset signals were detected at chromosomal sites orthologous to human 22q <dig> . additional signals with cosmid 22e <dig> were only detected in the proximal long arm  on the nor  – containing "marker-chromosome"  <dig>  <cit>  of all three investigated owm species . sequences covered by cosmid 22e <dig> were subjected to repeat finding programs . these analyses suggested that the additional signal on the repeat-rich owm "marker-chromosome" may be due to diverged caggg repeats within the y-chromosomal cosmid probe. such caggg repeats were previously identified as a single repeat block on the proximal long arm of the "marker-chromosome" of the crab-eating macaque  <cit>  and were shown to have been distributed toward many pericentromeric regions during great ape evolution  <cit> . in addition, preliminary analysis of other y-chromosomal sds indicate that there may be further diverged caggg repeat sequences located on the y chromosome that remained undetected by repeat finding programs. these undetected caggg repeat sequences may be located in the yq <dig> /yq <dig> transition region and in the proximal part of the yq <dig> /yq <dig>  transition region. fish with large insert genomic clones from both regions showed signals on the proximal long arm of the owm chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

comparative fish with chek <dig> fosmid probes from 22q <dig>  in anthropoids
for unambiguous detection of chek <dig> duplicons in anthropoids we performed further fish experiments with fosmid wi2-1621d <dig> , which derives from human chromosome 22q <dig> . this fosmid contains the complete duplicated portion of the ancestral chek2/ttc <dig> locus. no caggg repeat sequences are contained within this chek <dig> duplicon probe. apart from the signal tagging the ancestral chek <dig> locus in 22q <dig>  the probe showed the expected multi-site signal pattern in human . signals were detected on  <dig> different chromosomes. on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and y signals seemed to be restricted to one chromosomal location, whereas chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed a signal cluster, indicating the presence of at least two chek <dig> duplicons on each of these three chromosomes. in contrast to the y-chromosomal cosmid probe no signals were detected with the fosmid on human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and yq <dig> /yq <dig> . this observation might be explained by the absence of caggg repeat sequences in the fosmid probe. the fosmid wi2-1621d <dig> hybridized to  <dig> different autosomal chimpanzee chromosomes and the observed signal distribution was highly similar to the human pattern. nevertheless, no signal was detected on chimpanzee chromosome  <dig> and only a single signal on chimpanzee chromosome  <dig>  substantial differences to the y-chromosomal cosmid probe were detected in the gorilla genome. only three gorilla chromosomes were tagged. gorilla chromosome  <dig> showed two signals located in the proximal and distal transition regions of the heterochromatin block on the short arm , indicating gorilla-specific reorganization or acquisition of chek <dig> duplicons on this chromosome. gorilla chromosome  <dig> showed two distinct signal localizations. one signal mapped to the ancestral interstitial chek <dig> locus and one to the pericentromeric region of the long arm. as in the chimpanzee genome, this probe generated no signal on gorilla chromosome  <dig>  favouring a human-specific chek <dig> duplication event towards the short arm of human chromosome  <dig>  the orangutan genome revealed differences in the signal pattern between both probes, too. in contrast to the y-chromosomal cosmid probe, two signals were detected on orangutan chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  this observation indicates the occurrence of a first chek <dig> duplication event before the radiation of the great apes and, in addition, shows that sequences located on chromosome  <dig> are more related to the ancestral than to the derivative locus on the human y chromosome. furthermore, hybridization of fosmid wi2-1621d <dig> on metaphase chromosomes of the white-cheeked crested gibbon, the rhesus macaque, the pig-tailed macaque and the common marmoset revealed a single chek <dig> copy status. in all these species, only the chromosomal region orthologous to human chromosome 22q <dig> was labelled. this observation contrasts the signal location of the y-chromosomal cosmid probe in the analysed owm species, but can again be explained by the absence of caggg repeat sequences in the ancestral chek <dig> fosmid probe.

to verify the single-copy status of the non-duplicated portion of the chek <dig> locus, we performed fish with the fosmid probe wi2-819h <dig> . in all analysed primate species, including human, this probe hybridized to a single genomic localisation corresponding to the human 22q <dig>  orthologous regions. in conclusion, our comparative fish results with fosmid probe wi2-1621d <dig>  show the single-copy status of chek <dig> in all tested new world and old world monkeys and in the white-cheeked crested gibbon. while a first chek <dig> duplication event was detected in the orangutan, a burst of duplication, giving rise to the complex signal pattern, occurred before the radiation of african great apes. except for chromosomes  <dig> and y all signals present in non-human primates were also detected in the orthologous human regions.

comparative in silico analysis of chek <dig> duplicons in anthropoids
we used the sequence from the human ancestral chek <dig> locus for megablast analysis  of the human genome. this analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> derivative chek <dig> duplicons in the current human reference genome assembly, while two additional duplicons were identified in the celera whole genome assembly . the largest chek <dig> duplicon is located in 16p <dig>   and spans  <dig> basepairs of the ancestral chek <dig> locus. this duplicon includes exons  <dig> to  <dig> of chek <dig> and exon  <dig> of ttc <dig>  furthermore, three additional smaller duplicons  were detected on chromosome  <dig>  duplicons 16p <dig> c and 16p <dig> d are about  <dig> kb in size and share 99% sequence identity, indicating a recent duplication event. in addition, both duplicons terminate within an alusq-element, which has been shown to be enriched within sd junctions  <cit> . slightly shorter than duplicon 16p <dig> a is the chek <dig> duplicon located in 15q <dig> . a second chek <dig> duplicon on chromosome  <dig> was only detected in the celera whole genome assembly and is assigned to chromosome band 15p <dig>  both chromosome  <dig> duplicons share 99% sequence identity. as our detailed fish analysis also indicated the presence of at least two different chek <dig> duplicon copies on human chromosome  <dig>  we conclude that these two duplicons are the result of a recent intrachromosomal duplication event or might reflect individual genomic variation. furthermore, the 15q <dig>  duplicon exhibits an internal  <dig>  kb deletion not present in the 15p <dig> duplicon. both deletion breakpoints reside in alusq-elements, one of them being identical to the one terminating the duplicons 16p <dig> c and 16p <dig> d. this deletion was shown to be present in two different bac libraries, rpci- <dig> and rpci- <dig>  thus almost certainly ruling out individual variation. in summary, duplicons located at chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> revealed a high intrachromosomal sequence identity. this observation is concordant with previous investigations showing that intrachromosomal duplications share higher sequence identity than interchromosomal duplications, thus pointing to a recent intrachromosomal expansion of the human genome  <cit> . it should be mentioned that the high degree of sequence identity between intrachromosomal duplicons might also be due to nonallelic homologous recombination  and/or gene conversion  <cit> . additional chek <dig> duplicons, containing almost the entire chek <dig> duplicated portion, are located in 2p <dig> /2p <dig> , 10p <dig> , 22q <dig>  and yq <dig> /yq <dig> . furthermore, one chek <dig> duplicon sequence in the human genome remains chromosomally unassigned , but may be located in the 1q12/1q <dig> euchromatin/heterochromatin transition region or on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  fish signals within these two regions  do not correspond to any chromosomally assigned chek <dig> duplicon in the current human whole genome assemblies. interestingly, duplicons located in 2p <dig> /2p <dig> , 10p <dig> , 22q <dig> , yq <dig> /yq <dig>  and chr_random share the same  <dig> kb line <dig>  integration, thereby suggesting a common origin. the smallest chek <dig> duplicon was found in 10q <dig>  and is about  <dig>  kb in size.

to elucidate the molecular evolution of the derivative chek <dig> duplicons we investigated their flanking paralogous sequences. all known chek <dig> duplicons extend into the same proximal duplicated sequence, indicating a single initial pericentromeric "seeding" event. subsequent pericentromeric "swaps" of the larger duplicon cassette led to the chek <dig> duplicon distribution observed in the human genome. the ancestral location of the duplicon proximal to all chek <dig> duplicons resides within the igl@ locus in 22q <dig> . the duplicated sequences extending beyond the distal chek <dig> duplicon junctions are not identical for all derivative duplicons. while chek <dig> duplicons 16p <dig> a and 15q <dig>  show the same distal homology, duplicons 2q <dig> /2q <dig> , 10p <dig> , 16p <dig> b, 22q <dig> , yq <dig> /yq <dig>  and chr_random share a different distal duplicated sequence. thus, the latter set of duplicons may have arisen by a duplication of the 16p <dig> b duplicon, followed by a line <dig> element integration and successive pericentromeric exchange.

subsequently, we used the same in silico approach to determine the chek <dig> duplicon architecture of the chimpanzee genome . chromosomally assigned duplicons in the chimpanzee genome showed chromosomal designations corresponding to the human genome locations. duplicons were detected on chimpanzee chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and y , but not on chromosome 2a. two duplications containing almost the entire chek <dig> duplicon and  <dig> smaller duplicon fragments were not chromosomally assigned in the current chimpanzee whole genome assembly. similar to the human genome the largest chek <dig> duplicon is assigned to chromosome  <dig> and a slightly shorter chek <dig> duplicon is located on chromosome  <dig>  in contrast to the human genome the chromosome  <dig> duplicon contains no deletion, indicating that this deletion is human specific. in addition, duplicons on chimpanzee chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contained small internal duplications and chromosome  <dig> duplicons seemed to be more fragmented . these findings might be explained by chimpanzee-specific rearrangements or, more likely, by the inherent problem of generating highly reliable contiguous sequence assemblies in regions enriched in sds.

comparative in silico analysis  and rhesus macaque  whole genome assemblies using the human duplicated chek <dig> sequence yield just one copy in the respective genomes on their orthologous chromosome  <dig>  no chek <dig> duplicon was found on orangutan chromosome  <dig> by this approach, but this may be due to the underrepresentation of segmentally duplicated sequences within pericentromeric regions in the whole genome assemblies  <cit> . the unduplicated status of chek <dig> in the rhesus macaque genome assembly is concordant with our fish results obtained with fosmid wi2-1621d <dig> 

phylogenetic reconstruction of chek <dig> duplicon events in anthropoids
to further delineate the evolution of the chek <dig> duplicons we performed phylogenetic analysis with non-coding and non-repetitive sequences using the mega <dig>   <cit>  software . the multi-sequence alignment was composed of  <dig> basepairs derived from two loci within the chek <dig> duplicons. the proximal sequence is located upstream of exon  <dig> of ttc <dig>  and the distal sequence is located in intron  <dig> of chek <dig> . we aligned all human and chimpanzee derivative duplicons as well as the ancestral sequences of human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. our phylogenetic analyses placed all chromosomally assigned chimpanzee chek <dig> duplicons next to the human chek <dig> duplicons showing the same chromosomal designations . we therefore concluded the orthologous nature of the particular human and chimpanzee chek <dig> duplicons on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and y. based on an estimated divergence time of  <dig> million years between human and rhesus macaque lineages  <cit> , we calculated the effective nucleotide substitution rates  . calculated times for pericentromeric "seed" and onset of "swaps", are ~ <dig>  mya and ~ <dig>  mya, respectively. replacing the human lineage by the chimpanzee lineage, a pericentromeric seed of ~ <dig>  mya and an onset of swaps of ~ <dig>  mya was calculated. both independent calculations placed the initial duplication event before the radiation of orangutan and african great apes about  <dig> mya  <cit>  thereby coinciding with our fish results of fosmid clone wi2-1621d <dig> on orangutan metaphase chromosomes . no signs of duplication were detected on metaphase chromosomes of the white-cheeked crested gibbon, which is thought to have split from the great ape-human lineage about  <dig> mya. only one signal in 7qdist representing the orthologous region of human 22q <dig> was detected by fish . this might either be explained by the loss of the primary chek <dig> duplicon in the gibbon lineage or the high degree of sequence divergence between the putative gibbon duplicon and the human ancestral chek <dig> locus. such a high degree of sequence divergence is a very likely explanation supported by previous investigations, which detected an acceleration of substitution rates after the duplication event  <cit> . phylogenetic reconstruction of the duplication events revealed that the largest human and chimpanzee duplicons located on chromosome  <dig> share the highest degree of sequence identity with the ancestral chek <dig> locus . this indicates, in combination with our fish results, that the first duplication event was a pericentromeric "seed" from the ancestral interstitial chek <dig> locus toward the pericentromeric region of chromosome  <dig> . the duplicons located on chromosomes  <dig> of chimpanzee and human share the highest degree of sequence identity with the largest chromosome  <dig> duplicons of human and chimpanzee  suggesting a pericentromeric "swapping" event from chromosome  <dig> towards chromosome  <dig>  phylogenetic reconstruction identifies the duplicons located in the pericentromeric regions of human chromosome  <dig> and human and chimpanzee chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and y as the most recent ones in the respective genomes. this finding concurs with the in silico results, which showed these duplicons to harbour a unique line <dig> element integration.

detection of inter-species copy number variations of chek <dig> by quantitative pcr
the paralogous chek <dig> duplicons in human and african great apes are part of sds. sds are known to be frequently associated with copy number variation  <cit> . a robust approach to specifically target such variable regions is quantitative pcr . to independently determine the chek <dig> duplicon numbers in the genomes of anthropoids we performed inter-species quantitative pcr with primers located in exon  <dig>  the complete alignment of exonic sequences from all known chek <dig> duplicons of the human, chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque genome was used to determine the set of primers best matching the sequences. nevertheless, we cannot rule out that these primers do not match perfectly to all chek <dig> duplicons in all analysed species. as fish and in silico analyses consistently demonstrated the single copy status of chek <dig> in the rhesus macaque genome we used rhesus macaque genomic dna as the reference dna for chek <dig> copy number prediction in human, great ape and owm species. we determined the copy numbers of five different human individuals, three chimpanzee and gorilla individuals each, two orangutan and rhesus macaque individuals each and one individual each of the pig-tailed macaque and baboon . all analysed baboon, pig-tailed macaque, rhesus macaque and orangutan individuals revealed just one chek <dig> copy per haploid genome. a drastic increase in copy number was detected for the african great apes with seven and nine chek <dig> copies in the haploid genomes of gorilla and chimpanzee, respectively. the human genome presented the highest increase in chek <dig> copy number, with a variation between  <dig> to  <dig> chek <dig> copies per haploid human genome. our results significantly demonstrate, that the analysed human individuals have a higher chek <dig> copy number than chimpanzee and gorilla  and a higher chek <dig> copy number than orangutan and all analysed owms . in addition, chimpanzee and gorilla have a significantly higher chek <dig> copy number than orangutan and owms . this observation confirms our fish investigation and phylogenetic analysis, which placed the burst of chek <dig> duplication after the radiation of orangutan and african great apes. furthermore, we detected different numbers of chek <dig> copies within the analysed human individuals. taking into account the sample size, we can only presume whether there is chek <dig> copy number variation in the human population. as mentioned above, our qpcr approach revealed only one chek <dig> copy per haploid orangutan genome, whereas fish detected two signals on orangutan chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and phylogenetic analyses indicated the occurrence of a first chek <dig> duplication event before the radiation of orangutan and african great apes . the failure to amplify the second chek <dig> copy in the orangutan genome might be explained either by primer mismatch or loss of exon  <dig> in the orangutan chromosome  <dig> copy. therefore, real chek <dig> copy numbers in non-human primates may be even higher than were predicted by our approach.

CONCLUSIONS
chek <dig>  which is essential for genomic stability  <cit> , is known to be a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene and is frequently analysed in tumour diagnostics, e.g. of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer  <cit> . chek <dig> is one of a multitude of genes known to be part of sds  <cit> . our detailed three-pronged approach clearly demonstrates that chek <dig> duplicons show a high degree of both copy number variation and sequence identity. furthermore, there is strong evidence, that not all duplicons in the human genome have been sequenced yet. thus, molecular diagnostics of chek <dig> inside the duplicated region might be hampered by the individual-specific set of chek <dig> duplicons. one previously published variant  of the functional chek <dig> gene, was thought to predispose to li-fraumeni syndrome  <cit> , but subsequently was shown to be the genomic sequence of a chek <dig> duplicon  <cit> . to avoid such diagnostic pitfalls in the analysis of duplicated disease related genes, it is essential to close the still existing gaps in the human genome sequence by closely examining segmentally duplicated regions. additionally, copy number and sequence variation within sds might require further efforts to adapt the diagnostic settings to different ethnic backgrounds.

furthermore, our detailed chek <dig> analysis revealed its highly dynamic nature during anthropoid evolution. both, fish and phylogenetic analyses suggest the first duplication event to have occurred before the radiation of the great ape species. extensive pericentromeric exchange and intrachromosomal duplication events led to a burst of chek <dig> duplications before the radiation of the african great apes followed by lineage specific rearrangements creating species-specific distribution patterns in great apes and human. in conclusion, our analysis of the chek <dig> duplicon evolution reveals, that sds contribute to inter-species variation.

evolutionary distances overview. based on the kimura two-parameter model the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site  were calculated for outgroup distances: all human sequences to macaque sequences , all human non-ancestral paralogs to the macaque outgroup  and the human ancestral duplicon to the macaque outgroup . comparison of these values with two human interparalog distances, i.e. human ancestral to all human paralogs  and the average k of all human paralogs , provides information on the timing of the initial duplicationevent  and the onset of secondary duplications . we calculated locus-specific effective nucleotide substitution rates  based on an estimated divergence time of  <dig> million years between the human and the old world monkeys. in addition, all calculations were performed replacing the human lineage by the chimpanzee lineage.

sequence identity matrix of sequences used for the phylogenetic analysis. we created a sequence identity matrix of all sequences, which were used for our phylogenetic analysis. multi-sequence alignments were composed of  <dig> basepairs derived from two loci within the chek <dig> duplicons. the proximal sequence is located upstream of exon  <dig> of ttc <dig>  and the distal sequence is located within intron  <dig> of chek <dig> . the sequence identity matrix of these sequence alignments was generated with the bioedit software .
