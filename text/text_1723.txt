BACKGROUND
the microbial flora found in the gastrointestinal tract influences human metabolism and physiology and is thus likely to impact aging  <cit> . changes in the microbial flora are associated with obesity  <cit>  and microbial metabolism may influence cardiovascular disease  <cit> . in the c. elegans model, the e. coli foodstuff must be alive, but not necessarily able to divide, for the worm to achieve maximal growth and reproduction  <cit> , suggesting that microbial metabolic activity is required for optimal c. elegans nutrition. dietary restriction of c. elegans by limiting e. coli availability extends lifespan but the mechanisms involved remain unclear  <cit> . treating e. coli with antibiotics that either stop proliferation or kill the bacteria increases c. elegans lifespan  <cit>  and it has been previously suggested the mutants in e. coli genes that disrupt ubiquinone synthesis increase c. elegans lifespan by blocking bacterial respiration  <cit> . however, slowing or stopping bacterial growth is not a viable starting point to treat healthy microbiota. lipopolysaccharide structures on the e. coli cell surface explain bacterial strain-specific effects on c. elegans lifespan and interactions with the c. elegans sensory system but do not provide a clear route to slow aging  <cit> . here we explore the c. elegans/e. coli interaction further and identify microbial folate synthesis as a specific target to slow animal aging pharmacologically without cost to the microbe or animal.

RESULTS
a spontaneous mutation in the e. coli gene arod increases c. elegans lifespan
while performing lifespan experiments using rna interference  by feeding, we discovered an e. coli ht <dig> rnai strain, for the c. elegans ugt- <dig> gene, that causes a substantial  increase in lifespan of the long-lived daf- <dig> mutant of c. elegans compared to animals maintained on the ht <dig> control . the strain also extends the lifespan of wild type c. elegans, and a daf- <dig> mutant lacking the foxo transcription factor required for daf- <dig> mutant longevity . surprisingly, the lifespan increase persisted once the rnai plasmid was lost, implicating a spontaneous mutation of the e. coli strain as the causative factor . consistent with this conclusion, fresh ht <dig> bacteria transformed with the ugt- <dig> rnai plasmid had no effect on lifespan . unlike previously identified e. coli mutants that result in extended c. elegans lifespan  <cit> , this mutant e. coli strain was able to respire but unable to grow on minimal media. this auxotrophy allowed us to perform a plasmid complementation screen leading to the identification of an is <dig> transposon insertion in the gene arod . plasmid rescue with arod confirmed that mutation of this gene increased c. elegans lifespan . a deletion mutation of arod from the keio strain collection also showed an increased lifespan compared to animals fed the control strain  <cit> . , demonstrating that the effect was not allele- or strain-specific.

folate synthesis is the limiting factor that causes the arod mutant to increase c. elegans lifespan
the arod gene encodes the enzyme 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, a core component of the shikimic acid pathway that produces chorismate, a precursor to all aromatic compounds in the bacterial cell   <cit> . consistent with the involvement of this pathway, supplementation of the media with shikimic acid causes the lifespan of c. elegans on arod mutant bacteria to revert to normal . the arod mutant can grow on the peptone-based media used in c. elegans studies, so the media must be able to provide either all the essential aromatic compounds needed for growth or the relevant precursors. to test whether the lifespan effect was caused by one of these compounds being present in limiting amounts, we added back compounds known to support growth of aro mutants: the aromatic amino acids, the folate precursor para-aminobenzoic acid  and the ubiquinone precursor para-hydroxybenzoic acid   <cit> . of these, only paba reversed the lifespan increase completely, suggesting that a decrease in bacterial folate synthesis in the arod mutant is the major cause of the increased c. elegans lifespan . paba supplementation had no effect on c. elegans maintained on the control ht <dig> strain or on the extended lifespan of worms on the q-deficient ubig mutant bacteria ruling out a toxic effect of paba . an alternate pathway for ubiquinone synthesis using paba instead of phb has been shown in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  but as phb has no effect on lifespan  we think it unlikely that ubiquinone synthesis is the limiting factor in the arod mutant. folates are needed in all cells for biosynthesis. generation of purines, pyrimidines, certain amino acids and methyl donors depends on cycling between the various folate species: dihydrofolate , tetrahydrofolate , 10-formyl thf,  <dig> -methenyl thf,  <dig> -methylene thf and 5-methyl thf  <cit> . in addition, over  <dig> possible folate species result from further derivatization with up to  <dig> glutamate residues. to understand the effect of the arod mutation on bacterial folates, we used liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  to detect individual folate species  <cit> . the most abundant folate species detected in e. coli grown as lawns on ngm agar corresponded to formyl thfglu <dig>  we found that the arod mutation in ht <dig> caused a large decrease in the detectable levels of this folate and other detectable folate species , confirming the effect of the mutation on bacterial folates. folic acid cannot be taken up directly by e. coli. however, adding back folic acid to the media resulted in a partial suppression of the increase in lifespan, probably because folic acid led to restoration of folate synthesis in the arod mutant bacteria . it has been shown that e. coli can use a breakdown product of folic acid to make paba  <cit> .

pharmacological inhibition of e. coli folate synthesis increases c. elegans lifespan
to test further the impact of microbial folate synthesis on c. elegans aging, we employed sulfamethoxazole , a sulfonamide drug that blocks folate synthesis by competing with paba for the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase  <cit> . addition of smx to the media caused a dose-dependent increase in the lifespan of worms maintained on e. coli op <dig>  the strain used in most c. elegans studies , with  <dig> μg/ml being the minimal dose that gave a reproducible and statistically significant effect. with increasing drug concentration, the relationship between mean lifespan and log is approximately linear until  <dig> μg/ml, the concentration of smx that consistently produced the highest increase in mean lifespan . this linear relationship suggests a dose response that is pharmacologically amenable. addition of paba reverses the increase in lifespan, consistent with folate synthesis being the relevant target of smx . to assess the impact of smx on bacterial folates, we measured formyl thfglu <dig>  starting at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml, smx reduced the levels of formyl thfglu <dig> in op <dig> such that at a dose of  <dig> μg/ml smx it was effectively below the level of detection . to determine whether smx increased lifespan through any direct effects on the worm and/or any non-specific targets in e. coli, we performed lifespan experiments with a sulfonamide-resistant strain of op <dig>  which contains the multiresistance plasmid r <dig> encoding a drug-insensitive allele of dihydropteroate synthase  <cit> . under these conditions, smx had no effect on c. elegans lifespan , demonstrating that smx acts through inhibition of bacterial folate synthesis to increase c. elegans lifespan.

smx has no effect on bacterial growth or viability
smx is known to have antibiotic properties. however, we found that in nematode growth media , concentrations of smx that extended c. elegans lifespan had no significant effect on e. coli growth in liquid culture  or on the final size of the e. coli lawn grown on the solid media used to culture worms . these results suggest that smx does not extend lifespan by inhibiting e. coli proliferation as suggested for other antibiotics  <cit> . to test whether smx-treated e. coli encountered by worms had a decreased ability to proliferate, we tested e. coli lawns for cell viability. in contrast to kanamycin treatment,  <dig> μg/ml smx had no effect on the colony-forming ability of op <dig> . given that the folate cycle is required for cell growth, these results suggest that e. coli can use metabolites from the media to overcome decreased folate synthesis. in agreement with this model, paba and pabb mutants are reported to be viable and grow normally on rich media  <cit> . thus, there are conditions that folate synthesis can be inhibited without affecting bacterial growth and it may be that e. coli are adapted for such conditions in the mammalian intestine.

both the arod mutation and smx treatment have minor effects on metabolism
to examine the effects of smx on broader metabolism, we re-analyzed the metabolite data from the lc-ms analysis of e. coli folates. we performed a global comparison between the arod mutant, the ht <dig> wild type, op <dig> and op <dig> treated with  <dig> μg/ml smx. a total of  <dig>  features were detected, including common metabolites such as atp, nadph and acetyl coa. partial least squares discriminant analysis  of the data  shows that both the smx and the arod mutation have metabolite profiles very similar to their respective controls, having a smaller effect than the difference between the op <dig> and ht <dig> control strains . this analysis supports the hypothesis that the inhibition of folate synthesis under conditions that result in increased lifespan has only a minor effect on whole cell metabolism.

smx leads to a decrease in c. elegans folate levels without adverse effects
all animals must obtain folate from their food or intestinal microbes so inhibition of bacterial folate synthesis would be expected to decrease c. elegans folate levels. 5-methylthfglu <dig> was the most abundant folate species we could detect in worms. smx decreased levels of this folate substantially but detectable levels remained . to test whether this decrease in folate levels led to a functional deficiency, we examined nuc- <dig> mutants, which are sensitized to methotrexate, an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. concentrations of methotrexate that have no effect on the wild-type animals cause nuc- <dig> mutants to produce sterile and uncoordinated progeny  <cit>  . however, smx had no effect on nuc- <dig> mutants , demonstrating that animals maintain a functional folate cycle. to test folate sufficiency further, we examined developmental rate and fecundity in the presence of smx. we found that smx had no effect on the time taken for animals to reach reproductive age or their subsequent brood size . this result suggests that smx does not impact the biosynthetic capability of the folate cycle. further, this result confirms the drug does not interfere with c. elegans nutrition, or cause dietary restriction in the usual sense. however, it remains possible that life extension in c. elegans by dietary restriction via limitation of e. coli, and inhibition of microbial folate synthesis involve some common mechanisms.

our data show that, via inhibition of bacterial folate synthesis, it is possible to slow animal aging with a minimal effect on bacterial growth. such an intervention may allow manipulation in the mammalian gut without large disruption of the microbiota. intriguingly, an early study showed that administration of a sulfonamide  extends the lifespan of rodents  <cit> . moreover, as in the present study, this effect was reversed by the addition of paba, implicating microbial folate synthesis as the target. several species of bacteria, including e. coli, excrete folates, suggesting that they produce more than they need  <cit> . in our system, c. elegans is solely dependent on bacterial folate, and yet we can achieve a positive effect on lifespan without compromising healthy development, suggesting that the c. elegans requirement for folate is much lower than is available to them from e. coli. interestingly, when added to high-folate rat food, the sulfonamide succinyl sulfathiazole, inhibited bacterial folate synthesis but had only a minor effect on rat liver folate levels  <cit> , raising the possiblity that we can reduce folate specifically in the gut bacteria, without folate restricting the animal.

CONCLUSIONS
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of e. coli folate synthesis leads to an increase in c. elegans lifespan without causing detrimental effects on either the microbe or the animal. whether a decrease in folate acts on a process in the microbe or directly in the animal or both to extend lifespan remains to be determined. however, the identification of bacterial folate synthesis as a target suggests that eliminating excessive microbial folate in the gut microbe environment could be a route to slow aging.
