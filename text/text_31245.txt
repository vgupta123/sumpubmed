BACKGROUND
currently, 24% of gene therapy clinical trials worldwide are using adenovirus serotype  <dig>  as the delivery vehicle  <cit> . first generation ad <dig> vectors were created by deletion of the genes for the viral transactivator  and e1b proteins to render the vector replication-incompetent and deletion of the e <dig> genes, the products of which are non-essential for in vitro growth  <cit> . these vectors have capacity for up to ~ <dig> kbp transgene sequence, can grow to high titres in e1-complementing cells and have the ability to infect a wide range of cells. however, although the ability of these vectors to replicate is significantly inhibited compared to wt virus, they still exhibit low levels of viral late protein expression, and transgene expression in vivo is only transient  <cit> . this is in part because the vector dna does not integrate and therefore has no mechanism of maintenance in a dividing cell population. however, transience is primarily due to the elimination of cells by the initiation of an immune response to viral vector gene expression products  <cit> . second generation vectors are rendered more completely replication-incompetent by the further mutation of e <dig> or e <dig> genes  <cit> . whilst these give improved persistence of transgene in vivo because of reduced immune responses, the stability and level of transgene expression is variable  <cit> . the most promising ad <dig> vectors for long-term gene delivery in vivo have been those that do not contain any viral coding sequence  <cit> . however, to grow these gutted vectors, they must be complemented with helper viruses as no cell line expressing the full array of viral proteins is available; although yields of vector from such systems can be high, there is the additional problem that the helper virus must be inactivated or removed before the vector can be used and residual contamination with helper is likely  <cit> . therefore, a vector which retained the practical advantages of earlier ad <dig> vectors but displayed further reduced viral gene expression and hence induced less toxicity and reduced inflammatory and immune responses would be an ideal gene delivery vehicle. for reviews on adenovirus vectors see  <cit> .

the ad <dig> l <dig> region encodes three non-structural proteins, l4-100k, -22k and -33k, which have been shown to be essential for structural protein expression in the late phase of infection. l4-22k acts both at the level of transcription and post-transcriptionally to support late mrna production  <cit> . in addition, this l <dig> protein has been shown to be a packaging factor  <cit> . l4-33k is a splice factor that is essential for production of a subset of late mrnas  <cit> . l4-100k is responsible for selective translation of late mrnas  <cit>  and for the stabilisation and assembly of hexon trimers, which form the major part of the capsid of progeny particles  <cit> . as might therefore be expected, an l <dig> 100k-mutated, e1-, e3- vector was previously reported to have reduced liver toxicity in mice  <cit> . a vector deleted for all three l <dig> proteins would still retain the ability to replicate its dna, and hence to express transgenes to high level, but would be further improved by being unable to produce any of the late structural proteins associated with toxicity and the induction of an inflammatory response.

the propagation of new adenovirus vectors is dependent upon the creation of cell lines to provide the proteins necessary for virion production that the vector is unable to encode. the classic method for generating ad <dig> vector complementing cell lines is to transfect cells with a construct containing the viral gene under the control of either its own or a heterologous promoter and to select for cells stably expressing the viral protein, either directly or via a co-transfected or linked antibiotic-resistance gene. this method relies on the integration of the complete construct in one or a few random positions within the chromosome. the site of integration of such expression cassettes affects expression of the inserted gene as gene expression in mammalian cells is controlled by chromatin structure  <cit> . chromatin remodelling within the transgene, imposed by the adjacent chromatin structure, can result in promoter silencing  <cit> . therefore, a large number of cell lines must be isolated and characterised to identify one that has the desired expression characteristics, which can be inconvenient and time consuming. furthermore, many proteins, including in our experience l4-100k, are toxic to cells when over-expressed. to obtain cell lines expressing such proteins requires gene expression to be made tightly inducible, thus adding another trait which needs to be tested in potential cell lines. l4-100k cytotoxicity likely reflects its effects on host cell translation; this toxicity may explain the very low level of 100k expression previously achieved by standard cell line techniques  <cit> .

recombination-mediated cassette exchange  using loxp/cre-mediated recombination  <cit>  has been used previously for a wide range of applications including: engineering cell lines to express high levels of recombinant proteins  <cit> ; generating cell lines to study panels of mutant proteins  <cit> ; and generating transgenic stem cell lines  <cit> . rmce relies on the pre-insertion into the chromosome of a cassette that contains a loxp site placed between the promoter and coding sequence of a marker gene. cell clones with the desired characteristics of marker gene expression are first isolated and then used as the parent for insertion of the gene of interest at the loxp site by cre-mediated recombination; at the same time the marker gene is displaced from the promoter. each resulting clone should have the same characteristics of expression as the marker gene in the parent cell line, because the site of insertion into host chromatin will be identical. chromosomal positioning effects and silencing of the transgene are therefore avoided. although the initial workload to isolate and characterise the parent cell lines is equal to that used in the conventional method, the choice of an appropriate marker gene can speed up the screening process and, once generated, such cell lines can be used to generate multiple complementing cell lines with reliable expression characteristics.

here we report the use of loxp/cre rmce to generate an inducible ad <dig> l4-complementing cell line. first, a panel of gfp loxp parent cell lines was generated and characterised with respect to the inducibility and stability of gfp expression. one parent cell line, selected for its favourable properties, was then used to generate a cell line that expressed ad <dig> l <dig> proteins and was able to support productive infection of l4-mutant viruses.

RESULTS
generation of loxp parent cell lines
 <dig> cells are ad <dig> e1-complementing cell lines that support the growth of e1- ad <dig> vectors to high titres  <cit> . a derivative of these cells, 293tetoff, which constitutively expresses the tetracycline transactivator protein tta, was used as the starting point for the work, with the aim of isolating cell lines exhibiting regulated transgene expression. the overall strategy for creation of ad <dig> l4-expressing cell lines from 293tetoff cells by loxp/cre rmce is shown in figure 1a. 293tetoff cells were first transfected with ploxpgfp, which carries gfp under the control of the tetracycline-regulated pbi promoter, and selected for zeocin resistance. a population of cells was obtained that had a broad range of gfp expression levels in the absence of the tetracycline analogue, doxycycline  ; 66% of the population showed little or no gfp expression . preliminary experiments had indicated that clones expressing low levels of gfp  typically lost transgene expression by  <dig> days of selection, probably due to chromatin remodelling and promoter silencing since they remained zeocin-resistant . therefore, to enrich for cells that might subsequently show stable gfp expression and to reduce the number of cells that were not expressing gfp prior to isolating single-cell clones, the zeocin-resistant population was sorted into low gfp expression  and high gfp expression  populations . the proportion of cells that did not express gfp in these sorted populations was reduced to 30% and 16% respectively. individual cell clones  were then isolated from the high-expressing population.

loxp parent cell lines show varying gfp regulation and expression
the gfp expression characteristics of loxp parent clones was expected to vary because regulation of the pbi promoter by dox is dependent upon the site of integration within the chromosome  <cit> . we wished to obtain a loxp parent clone that displayed very low basal expression in the presence of dox, good inducibility upon dox removal and long-term stability of this inducible expression.  <dig> loxp parent cell clones were isolated and tested for their level and regulation of gfp expression; figure 2a shows a representative selection of these clones. all clones except b <dig> expressed levels of gfp  in the range of 100- <dig>  f.u., as expected since they were isolated from the high-expressing sorted population .  <dig> clones exhibited tight regulation of gfp expression by dox, e.g. clones a <dig> and a <dig> ; tight regulation was defined as less than 5% of cells expressing > <dig> f.u. gfp  under conditions of dox-mediated repression of the gfp transgene. the other  <dig> clones, in contrast, showed leaky expression in the presence of dox, e.g. clones a <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> .

clone b <dig> appeared to comprise of two distinct populations, one expressing and one not expressing gfp upon induction . to determine whether b <dig> was in fact not clonal or alternatively if its gfp expression phenotype was unstable, the cells were sorted into expressing and non-expressing populations and gfp expression in the expressing population analysed over  <dig> days. this revealed that b <dig> gfp expression was unstable, since the proportion of cells induced to express gfp decreased from 90% at day  <dig> post-sorting to 86% at day  <dig> and 25% at day  <dig> . this instability may be due to heterochromatin assembly on the transgene promoter imposed by the integration context.

characterisation of loxp parent cell line clone a1
clone a <dig> was picked as a potential loxp parent line from which to generate ad <dig> l4-complementing cell lines due to its tight regulation and good inducibility, hence its properties were analysed further. to assess how quickly clone a <dig> accumulated gfp after the removal of dox, the cells were grown in the presence or absence of dox for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days .  <dig> days post dox removal, 36% of cells expressed gfp, increasing to 70% by day  <dig> and peaking at 75% by day  <dig> after the removal of dox. the low level of recovery of expression by day  <dig> reflects the difficulty in removing dox from the cell system, even with daily media washes  <cit> . greater than 70% of the cell population expressed gfp for over  <dig> days showing that transgene expression was stable and prolonged in the absence of dox. these properties of clone a <dig> were stable during  <dig> days of growth under conditions of dox repression, with tight promoter regulation in the presence of dox and a good level of inducible expression of gfp upon dox withdrawal being maintained throughout . this level and duration of expression, applied to an ad5-complementing transgene, should be more than adequate for the growth of adenovirus vectors, which have a 24- <dig> hour replication cycle in complementing cells and produce plaques within 7- <dig> days.

to be useful as a parent for cell line generation by a rmce strategy, it was important that clone a <dig> cells contained only one copy of the loxp-gfp cassette, which would be the target for cre-mediated insertion of the transgene. to test this, genomic dna from clone a <dig>  and clone a <dig> included for comparison, was analysed by southern blot using a probe for the gfp gene . this probe, which gave specific hybridisation since control cell 293tetoff dna gave no bands, detected the expected fragments of  <dig>  kbp and  <dig>  kbp in ecori and kpni digests of the input plasmid ploxpgfp. clone a <dig> dna also gave single probe-specific fragments in the two digests, however these were in each case larger than the equivalent fragments from the input plasmid. the increase in size results from the linking of probe target sequence in the plasmid to genomic dna to create hybrid ecori and kpni fragments. the fact that there was only one such fragment in each digest from the clone a <dig> cells indicated that a single integration event had occurred. clone a <dig> dna also gave single major bands in each of the two digests with sizes distinct from those in both clone a <dig> and the plasmid control, indicating the presence of a different single integration site in this clone. two weak additional bands from the a <dig> ecori digest probably arose from incomplete digestion. we did not assess the proportion of isolated clones that carried single insertions of the regulated hrgfp cassette, however the fact that two randomly selected clones had single inserts suggests this frequency was high.

generation of a1-l <dig> cell lines
the l <dig> region of ad <dig> is part of the major late transcription unit  and is expressed from the major late promoter  during the late phase of infection  <cit> . specific mrnas able to encode l4-100k, -22k or 33k are generated from a single primary transcript by alternative splicing, which links the relevant 3' exons to a tripartite leader sequence  comprised of leaders  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the tpl allows selective translation of mrna late in infection when host cell shutoff has been initiated  <cit> . to allow creation of inducible l <dig> cells from loxp parent clone a <dig>  a promoterless l <dig> cassette suitable for cre-mediated insertion was designed that included the l4-100k, -22k and -33k orfs. the cassette also included a 5' tpl sequence and, as spliced mrnas are exported more efficiently from the nucleus than unspliced mrnas  <cit> , a  <dig> bp internally truncated intron comprising the tpl leader  <dig> splice donor and the l4-100k splice acceptor sites .

clone a <dig> cells were transfected with a plasmid containing this cassette  and pcre to give hygromycin-resistant l4-expressing cells by cre-mediated recombination. in the uncloned population of a1-l <dig> cells, analysed  <dig> days after selection, only 27% of cells expressed gfp  <dig> days after the removal of dox compared to 66% of the parental cells . this loss of gfp expression was accompanied by the gain of l4-100k expression as detected by western blotting . this pattern of gene expression is consistent with insertion of the l <dig> cassette at the loxp site as planned.

to confirm that the l <dig> cassette had been inserted downstream of the pbi promoter, a single cell clone, clone a1-l <dig>  was isolated from the a1-l <dig> population for further characterisation. genomic dna from clone a1-l <dig> and from its parent a <dig> was used as template to amplify a pcr product using primers designed against pbi and tpl leader  <dig> within the l <dig> cassette. a product will only be obtained if the tpl-l <dig> cassette is in the correct location so as to bring these two primer binding sites, one from the a <dig> parent and one from the shuttle plasmid, into proximity. a product of the expected size,  <dig> bp, was amplified from clone a1-l <dig> but not clone a <dig> genomic dna . taken together, these data show that recombination has occurred between the genomic dna and the shuttle plasmid, resulting in the displacement of the gfp gene from the tetracycline-regulated promoter.

l4-100k can only be expressed from the l <dig> cassette via the pbi promoter and thus its expression and regulation in clone a1-l <dig> should be similar to that of gfp in clone a <dig>  however, l4-22k and l4-33kflag can also be expressed from a recently identified l <dig> promoter located within the l4-100k orf  and so should be constitutively expressed  <cit> . to confirm these patterns of expression, clone a1-l <dig> cells were examined by immunofluorescence . as expected, l4-100k was expressed in an inducible manner . l4-33kflag was also detected but its expression was not repressed by dox  consistent with expression occurring from the l <dig> promoter. l4-33kflag fluorescence was not significantly increased in the absence of dox compared to levels in the presence of dox, implying either that expression of l4-33kflag from the inducible pbi promoter is low in comparison with its expression from the l <dig> promoter or that expression from the pbi promoter inhibits and therefore replaces expression from the l <dig> promoter once dox repression is removed. in the first case, it is possible that alternative splicing of pbi-derived transcripts does not favour production of 33k mrna, although it is clear that mltu splicing in the natural context can give 33k expression  <cit> . in the second case, expression from the l <dig> promoter may be inhibited by competition with pbi for cellular transcription factors or by promoter occlusion from overriding pbi-derived transcription, or else translation of 33kflag from l <dig> promoter-derived mrnas may be inhibited in the presence of l4-100k expressed from pbi because they lack a tpl sequence  <cit> . although l4-22k protein expression from clone a1-l <dig> was not tested as no specific antibody was available, it would be expected that this protein, which shares the same start site as l4-33kflag and is expressed from the same l <dig> promoter, should resemble l4-33k in its expression. equivalent constructs have been shown to express functional levels of l4-22k in another context  <cit> .

only a low frequency of l4-100k expressing cells was detected by immunofluorescence . this may be as a consequence of the cytotoxicity of l4-100k, although cells were fixed and stained only  <dig> days after dox removal to avoid any excessive cell death due to overexpression of l4-100k. in contrast, l4-33kflag was detected in 100% of cells and, as expected from the facs analysis of the uncloned a1-l <dig> pool , clone a1-l <dig> did not express gfp under any conditions, unlike clone a <dig> which expressed gfp in the absence but not in the presence of dox . both these findings confirmed that the clone a1-l <dig> cells were homogeneous with respect to other aspects of transgene expression. since l4-100k expression was assessed only  <dig> days after dox withdrawal, a time when the proportion of equivalently treated parent a <dig> cells expressing gfp ranged from 36-66% , the most likely interpretation of the low frequency of 100k expression is that it reflects incomplete recovery following dox-removal and hence, under conditions where dox has been fully removed, all cells of clone a1-l <dig> should express l4-100k.

clone a1-l <dig> expresses functional levels of l <dig> proteins
having isolated clone a1-l <dig> and shown it expressed detectable amounts of l <dig> proteins, we now wished to show that these proteins could offer functional complementation of l <dig> deficiencies. we previously showed that full late gene expression from plasmid pbil1- <dig>  which contains the tpl and mltu regions l1- <dig> under the control of the pbi promoter, required l4-22k, -33k and -100k proteins in trans  <cit> . therefore, to examine the functionality of the l <dig> proteins expressed by clone a1-l <dig>  the ability of this cell line to support full late gene expression from pbil1- <dig> plasmid was investigated. the amount of the late proteins hexon, penton base and l2-v expressed from the plasmid was greater in clone a1-l <dig> than 293tetoff cells  showing that functional levels of the l <dig> proteins were produced. however, this late protein expression was still limited, and could be further increased by the co-transfection of an l4-22k/33kflag expression plasmid to provide additional l <dig> protein , indicating that levels of 22k and/or 33k in a1-l <dig> cells were limiting. hexon was produced under these conditions, which indicated that the level of l4-100k  was not a limiting factor. this conclusion is further supported by the fact that hexon protein levels expressed from pbil1- <dig> in clone a1-l <dig> cells were similar in the presence and absence of additional exogenous l4-100k . thus clone a1-l <dig> cells express functional levels of l <dig> proteins.

to investigate whether clone a1-l <dig> could complement l <dig> mutations in virus, linear wild-type  or l4-mutant viral genomes were transfected into 293tetoff or clone a1-l <dig> cells. wt genome induced a cytopathic effect , indicative of productive infection, in both cell types. the l4-33k mutant genome Δ <dig>  <cit>  induced cpe in clone a1-l <dig> cells only, both in the presence and absence of dox, but to a lesser extent under the former conditions . this was expected as the complementing protein for Δ <dig>  l4-33k, is produced under both these conditions . in contrast, cpe induced by the Δl <dig> mutant genome, which requires complementation by l4-100k, -22k and -33k, was only observed in clone a1-l <dig> cells in the absence of dox . collectively, these data suggested that clone a1-l <dig> could provide functional complementation for l <dig> deficiencies.

to confirm this, and to determine if infectious virus had been produced in these transfections, second passage stocks of Δ <dig>  Δl <dig> and wt viruses that had been recovered from the genome transfections described above were used to infect cells that were then analysed for early and late viral antigens by immunofluorescence. the stocks were used untitred because the complementing a1-l <dig> cells could not be sustained under agar as required for a plaque assay. infections of complementing  and non-complementing cells  were compared to confirm that the intended virus had been rescued without reversion .

wt virus expressed dna binding protein  from the e2a gene in distinctive foci within the cell nuclei that are indicative of active replication  <cit> ; it also expressed a high level of late proteins as expected of a normally progressing infection  <dig> hours post-infection . Δ <dig> virus in control 293tetoff cells, either in the presence  or the absence of dox , expressed large amounts of dbp but only low levels of late proteins. moreover, dbp staining was either diffuse in the cell nuclei or present in one large replication centre per cell, indicating that infection was stalled at an early stage. Δ <dig> gave a similar pattern of expression in clone a1-l <dig> cells under conditions of pbi repression , even though l4-33k is expressed from the l <dig> promoter under these conditions. this result suggests that the amount of l4-33k expressed from the l <dig> promoter alone is not sufficient for efficient propagation of Δ <dig> virus, and correlates with the lower level of cpe observed in cells transfected with Δ <dig> genome in the presence of dox than in its absence. the fact that a low level of late protein expression was observed from Δ <dig> virus under these non-complementing conditions was expected as Δ <dig> genome has previously been reported to express some late proteins, in particular 100k and hexon  <cit> . in complete contrast, in clone a1-l <dig> cells where l <dig> expression from pbi was induced by the removal of dox, Δ <dig> virus-infected cells expressed dbp that was incorporated into numerous replication centres and also produced high levels of late proteins . the number of replication centres and level of late protein staining was similar to that of wt virus, showing that the transition between early and late phase infection, for which l4-33k is required, had occurred. taken together, these data show that clone a1-l <dig> can complement an l4-33k-defective ad <dig> when l <dig> protein expression from the cell line is induced by dox removal.

Δl <dig> virus produced numerous dbp-containing replication centres in 293tetoff and clone a1-l <dig> cells , similar to wt virus and indicating that the infection had entered the late phase. from our previous data showing that the l <dig> proteins are essential for late gene expression, and the need for complementation from a1-l <dig> cells for Δl <dig> genome to cause cpe, these Δl <dig> virus infections were expected to be completely defective in late gene expression in non-complementing cells. however, although most Δl4-infected  cells showed the expected absence of late proteins in contrast to wt virus , a minority of the Δl4-infected cells expressed a significant amount of late proteins. one possible explanation for this was the presence of some wt virus in the Δl <dig> virus stock arising by reversion during virus isolation. to confirm that this was not the case, a pcr was performed on purified packaged dna from a Δl <dig> infection. using primers spanning the l <dig> region, a band of  <dig> bp was amplified from Δl <dig> compared to  <dig> bp from wt. absence of this  <dig>  kbp band in Δl <dig> reactions showed there was no detectable wt contamination in the Δl <dig> stock and that Δl <dig> virus defective in l4-100k, -22k and -33k had therefore been grown successfully using clone a1-l <dig> cells.

discussion
recent advances in our understanding of basic adenovirus biology have led to the possibility of generating vectors deleted in the regulatory proteins, l4-100k, -22k and -33k, that are now known to be required for structural protein expression. in theory such vectors would have reduced toxicity and immunogenicity as they would be unable to express the immunogenic virion proteins within transduced cells  <cit> . however, the propagation of l4-deficient vectors is reliant upon the development of cell lines that are able to support the growth of these replication incompetent vectors in vitro. using conventional methods to generate cell lines expressing a heterologous protein results in the random integration of one or several copies of an expression cassette into the genome and the level and stability of expression is then subject to chromosomal positioning effects. in this study we deployed a loxp/cre rmce strategy to overcome this problem and produce a cell line capable of inducibly expressing ad <dig> l <dig> proteins.

the design of the rmce system used here was carefully considered to maximise the potential for success. firstly, humanised renilla reniformis gfp was used as the reporter gene to screen loxp parent cell lines as it has been reported that this form of gfp is less toxic than enhanced gfp or its relatives  <cit> , thus permitting long term expression. this was an important factor as the selection process used required long periods of gfp expression without being compromised by cytotoxicity. secondly, due to the potential toxicity of viral l <dig> genes to be expressed by the eventual cell line, the tetracycline-regulated promoter, pbi, was chosen to drive transgene expression. this promoter, which comprises multiple copies of teto, the recognition site for tetracycline transactivator protein tta, and a minimal cmv promoter  <cit> , gives expression that is tightly repressed in cell lines containg tta in the presence of tetracycline or dox and which can be strongly induced upon dox withdrawal. thirdly, the zeocin and hygromycin resistance genes were placed under the control of the relatively weak herpes simplex virus tk promoter to limit potential effects on pbi regulation of having a constitutive promoter located in close proximity within the inserted construct. fourthly, the l <dig> cassette for transfection into gfp-expressing parent cells was designed so that the l <dig> mrnas produced from it would resemble those seen in an ad <dig> infection, thus maintaining the natural stability, processing and transport of these mrnas. finally, the absence of a promoter from the l <dig> cassette limited the potential for cytotoxicity due to expression of l4-100k during cell line isolation, either from unintegrated plasmid or due to random integration of the plasmid into the genome at sites other than the intended, regulated expression site.

the first stage in an rmce protocol is equivalent to standard cell line generation methodology, and here resulted in a population of zeocin-resistant cells with a broad range of gfp fluorescence expression characteristics from which individual cell clones were isolated and characterised. to reduce the work involved in identifying clones with appropriate expression characteristics for use as loxp parent cell lines in this study, the zeocin-resistant population was initially sorted by facs, based on the level of induced gfp expression, prior to isolating individual clones. this step enriched the uncloned population for cells where the hrgfp gene had been integrated into transcripionally active regions. it would also be possible to further enhance the efficiency of the screening process by adding an additional sorting step to eliminate cells which exhibited leaky gene regulation under conditions of dox-mediated repression.

 <dig> loxp parent clones were isolated and screened, 98% of which expressed gfp. the level and stringency of regulation of gfp expression was shown to be clone-specific. it has previously been reported that when this system of regulation is used in  <dig> cells, protein expression is detected at low levels even in the presence of dox  <cit> . here too, the pbi promoter in most of the loxp parent cell lines that exhibited what we defined as tight regulation also had a very low activity in the presence of dox . even tighter regulation might be achieved by using as the parent cell line something other than  <dig> cells, since variability in basal activity of pbi between cell lines has been reported  <cit> . however it was necessary to use  <dig> cells for this study as they constitutively express the ad <dig> e <dig> proteins that are required for the propagation of e1- vectors, which would form the genetic backbone of any new l4-deficient ad <dig> vector construct.

although insertion of l <dig> at the loxp site of loxp parent clone a <dig> should abolish gfp expression, some gfp-expressing cells were seen in the uncloned a1-l <dig> population. cre-mediated recombination between loxp sites in a circular plasmid and the target chromosome results in the inserted dna being flanked by loxp sites, meaning that re-excision of the inserted gene can occur by the further action of cre recombinase  <cit> . this flipping effect may account for the presence of these few gfp+ cells. the copy number of pcre and thus the amount of cre recombinase in the transfected cells during isolation of an expressing cell population should reduce progressively over time through cell division, leading eventually to a stable position. moreover, ongoing growth in the presence of hygromycin gives selection pressure for cells that do not harbour cre recombinase as this will permit the stable retention and expression of the hygromycin resistance gene. however, there remains the possibility that in a small number of cells cre recombinase could become stably integrated, giving rise to ongoing transgene instability. an alternative explanation for the residual gfp-expressing cells in the uncloned a1-l <dig> population is that non-resistant cells simply required longer exposure to hygromycin to achieve cell death. no gfp expression was observed in clone a1-l <dig> cells, indicating that the recombination event that gave rise to this cell line was stable.

the level of l4-100k expression in clone a1-l <dig> cells was substantial, and apparently was not limiting for complementation within the tests performed here. previously, a cell line expressing very low levels of 100k was able to complement a 100k-mutated vector for growth to high titre  <cit> , suggesting only low amounts of 100k are required. however, the 100k mutation employed in that study was an in-frame deletion of residues 315- <dig> within the  <dig> residue protein and so may not have been defective for all functions of this multifunctional protein. substantial amounts of 100k are made during ad <dig> infection, so higher levels of 100k are likely to be important for some aspects of its function.

although clone a1-l <dig> cells were able to provide functional levels of l4-100k, -33k and -22k in two assay systems, the amount of l4-22k and l4-33k appeared to be limiting. this was surprising as these two proteins can be expressed from a natural promoter, the l4-promoter, located within l4-100k orf and therefore, unlike l4-100k, their expression is not subject to inhibition by dox. however, we have previously shown that the l4-promoter is activated by early and intermediate viral proteins and by viral genome replication  <cit> . since none of these was present in the functionality assay utilising pbil1- <dig> in this study, activity of this promoter would have been suboptimal. the l4-promoter should have been maximally active in the genome/virus complementation experiments however, despite this, clone a1-l <dig> cells did not appear to support the growth of Δ <dig> virus unless full expression of the l <dig> cassette from pbi was induced by dox removal. whilst some cpe was observed for cells transfected with Δ <dig> genome in the presence of dox, this was less than that seen when dox was washed out of the system. this is the first time Δ <dig> virus  <cit>  has been grown from its cloned genome as a complementing cell line was not previously available.

growth of Δl <dig> virus also depended on the use of complementing a1-l <dig> cells. when Δl <dig> virus was used to infect non-complementing cells, it gave significant amounts of late proteins in a few of the cells . previously, we have shown that a genome deficient in l4-22/33k expression during the intermediate phase of infection  still made some l <dig> penton base protein  <cit> . the polyclonal serum used here detects this protein, meaning that the positive late protein immunofluorescence signal in the absence of l <dig> complementation may be accounted for by penton base expression without full late protein expression and consequent production of virus occurring.

the loxp/cre rmce strategy employed here to generate an ad <dig> l <dig> complementing cell line could also be used to create cell lines to complement other viral vectors. advantages of this system are that once the loxp parent cell lines have been characterised, they represent a resource from which it is quick, easy and efficient to generate cell lines with predetermined transgene expression profiles. isolation of useful loxp parent lines is facilitated by prior cell sorting, which reduces the number of clones that need to be screened. as well as providing a means to isolate useful complementing cell lines, the rmce approach should permit comparative studies of the functional properties of a series of transgenes, e.g. l4-100k mutant genes, without the confounding issue of variable expression levels.

CONCLUSIONS
rmce is a powerful tool in the recombineering of mammalian cell lines. this study has highlighted the potential of this approach for the generation of complementing cell lines for the growth of gene-deleted virus vectors by utilizing one of a series of loxp parent  <dig> cell lines to generate an ad <dig> l4-complementing cell line that was able to support the propagation of l4-mutant ad <dig> viruses. the generation of further ad <dig> complementing cell lines from any of the loxp parent cell lines isolated here should be facilitated as the cell lines obtained will have predetermined expression properties.
