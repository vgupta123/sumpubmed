BACKGROUND
transcription factors  regulate the expression of genes by interacting with cis-regulatory elements in dna sequences in response to internal and external stimuli. genomic comparisons have shown that most of these cis-regulatory elements are located in the conserved non-coding region of the genome  <cit> . over the past decade, many bioinformatics tools have been developed to detect de novo dna motifs bound by tfs that are overrepresented in the promoters of a group of co-regulated genes. despite the tremendous efforts in algorithm development, discovering human regulatory motifs from a set of co-regulated promoter sequences remains very challenging  <cit> . in this study, we developed a novel approach to identify human tf dna-binding motifs for a set of co-regulated genes by combining comparative genomics with de novo motif discovery. this approach restricted the motif search in the human promoter regions that are conserved across multiple species.

most of the current programs combining comparative genomics with de novo motif discovery use human-mouse orthologous sequences  <cit>  or human-mouse-rat orthologs  <cit>  to obtain the conserved promoter regions. our approach is the first to use an 8-species  genome comparison to derive the human conserved regions. the method takes the advantage that the ability to detect tf binding sites improves with both the number of comparison species and the evolution distance between species  <cit> .

the motif discovery algorithm in our approach is a modification of the original weeder program  <cit> , which is based on the exhaustive oligomer enumeration technique. current programs that combine comparative genomics with de novo motif discovery are based on a greedy search algorithm, gibbs sampling or expectation maximization techniques  <cit> . these techniques are all heuristic. depending on the initial configuration, these heuristic algorithms might be trapped in local maxima  <cit> . in contrast, due to the exhaustive characteristic of the weeder algorithm, a single run is sufficient to identify the specified number of most over-represented motifs. in addition, in a recent assessment comparing the performance of various sequence-based motif discovery programs  <cit> , the original weeder outperformed the other programs, which included the gibbs sampling and expectation maximization based algorithms, in most measurements. we modified the original weeder program to incorporate conservation information derived from the comparative genomics. the modified program was implemented in c under linux.

RESULTS
effects of masking methods
a stringent masking method  and a window-based masking method  were developed to extract conserved upstream regions of human genes from a multiple-species genome alignment. both methods masked the non-conserved nucleotides and thus reduced the size of sequence space to be searched for regulatory motifs. however, the methods may also eliminate the true tf binding sites as the number of species required to have the same base as human in a multiple alignment column, t , approaches  <dig>  we used the muscle data set to assess the effect of masking methods on the size of searching space and on the percentage of true binding sites retained. the muscle specific gene set was experimentally verified to be regulated by transcription factors myf, srf, mef <dig>  sp <dig>  tef and nvl  <cit> . fourteen myf binding sites and  <dig> mef <dig> binding sites determined by experiments were mapped to the upstream sequences of the human genes. for the assessment, an experimentally determined binding site was considered to be retained if a sequence of at least  <dig> consecutive bases within the binding site was unmasked. such a binding site can be sampled by a 6-bp motif.

as expected, when more and more stringent conservation criteria were imposed by increasing the t value, the number of 6-mers retained in the data set decreased. when t was set at  <dig>  78% of 6-mers in the data set were masked out for smm and 59% for wbmm; when t increased to  <dig>  96% of 6-mers were masked out for smm and 91% for wbmm . since wbmm relaxes conservation criteria imposed by the corresponding smm, it increased the number of oligomers retained. in contrast to the significant reduction in the overall number of 6-mers, 100% of mef <dig> binding sites and at least 70% of myf binding sites were retained for both smm and wbmm as long as t was set below or equal to  <dig> .

motif discovery for the muscle gene set
motif discovery results obtained by using different masking parameters were compared . when at least one of the seven species was imposed to share the same base with human  for smm, only the myf dna-binding motif was detected with low sensitivity and low positive prediction rate . when t was set at  <dig> using smm, myf, srf, mef <dig>  and nvl dna-binding motifs were detected with a combined sensitivity rising to  <dig>  and ppr  <dig> . among the four detected motifs, the myf motif predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> sites bound by the tf, and the mef <dig> motif predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> sites bound by the tf. when wbmm was applied and t was set at  <dig>  the same four tf dna binding motifs were detected with combined sensitivity equal to  <dig>  and ppr  <dig> . among them, the srf motif predicted three binding sites of which two were true hits. we also used the 5000-bp upstream sequences  for which only the repeat regions were masked, and the algorithm detected myf, srf and nvl dna binding motifs . however, all three motifs showed low ppr. for example, the ppr for the srf motif is only  <dig> . for comparison, compareprospector  <cit>  and toucan  <cit>  were also applied to detect dna binding motifs for the muscle gene set, and the result was included in table  <dig>  compareprospector detected four tf dna binding motifs  with combined sensitivity equal to  <dig>  and ppr  <dig> . toucan only detected the myf and nvl motif, and the combined sensitivity and ppr were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

discussion
in this study, we combined comparative genomics with de novo motif discovery to identify human tf dna-binding motifs. based on the 8-species multiple alignments, smm and wbmm were developed to extract conserved upstream regions of human genes. using smm or wbmm with appropriate parameter settings we could substantially reduce the amount of sequence space to be searched for the identification of regulatory motifs while having most of the true binding sites retained . such properties of the masking method may significantly increase the possibility of finding true binding sites by a motif discovery program, which is evidenced by the motif discovery results for the muscle specific gene set . compared with the performance of the motifs identified using upstream sequences for which only repeat regions were masked, both the combined sensitivity and ppr for smm  as well as for wbmm  were improved significantly .

our de novo motif discovery algorithm in combination with the masking method outperformed compareprospector and toucan according to the motif discovery results for the muscle gene set. both compareprospector and our approach using wbmm with t set to  <dig> identified four tf regulatory motifs , however, our approach exhibited higher sensitivity and higher prediction rates than compareprospector . our approach correctly predicted  <dig> out of the  <dig> true binding sites for the muscle genes which substantially exceed the  <dig> true binding sites identified by compareprospector. in comparison, toucan only identified two tf dna-binding motifs. both the combined sensitivity and ppr for toucan are lower than our approach using wbmm with t set to  <dig>  both compareprospector and toucan biased motif searches in the human-mouse conserved regions, and they both employ gibbs sampling technique for the motif discovery. in contrast, our approach requires motifs to be conserved over multiple species and uses exhaustive oligomer enumeration technique to discover motifs. it is likely that both the properties of the masking method and motif discovery technique contribute to the superior performance of our approach.

CONCLUSIONS
deciphering human regulatory motifs is crucial for understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control gene expression in response to various stimuli. recent advances in genomics have enabled large scale investigation of gene regulation by microarray technology, which can identify genes with similar expression patterns by clustering analysis. these gene clusters with similar expression patterns are likely to be regulated by common transcription factors. it is feasible to apply the approach developed in this study to analyze the gene clusters for the extraction of regulatory signals.
