this correlated with a short-term induction of foliar sucrolytic activity, differential gene expression of a vacuolar invertase and its inhibitor, and induction of a sucrose transporter gene.
amaranthus cruentus and a. hypochondriacus are crop plants grown for grain production in subtropical countries.
promoter analysis of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase and vacuolar invertase genes indicated the presence of cis-regulatory elements that supported their responsiveness to defoliation.
it is concluded that a rapid reduction of nsc reserves in leaves, stems and roots followed by their long-term recovery underlies tolerance to defoliation in grain amaranth.
a multi-level approach was followed involving gene expression analysis, enzyme activity and metabolite measurements.
defoliation by insect herbivory  or mechanical damage  led to a rapid and transient reduction of non-structural carbohydrates  in all tissues examined.
fatty-acid accumulation in roots coincided with a high expression of a phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate transporter gene.
recently, the generation of large-scale transcriptomic data opened the possibility to study representative genes of primary metabolism to gain a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying tolerance to defoliation in these species.
in all tissues there was a long-term replenishment of most metabolite pools, which allowed damaged plants to maintain unaltered growth and grain yield.
leaf starch in defoliated plants correlated negatively with amylolytic activity and expression of a Î²-amylase- <dig> gene and positively with a soluble starch synthase gene.
hd and md had differential effects on transcripts, enzyme activities and metabolites.
