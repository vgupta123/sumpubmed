we implement this as a tool within the database of macromolecular motions, molmovdb.org.
quantitative results demonstrate our method's ability to predict known hinges from the database of macromolecular motions.
protein motions play an essential role in catalysis and protein-ligand interactions, but are difficult to observe directly.
here we present the novel flexoracle hinge prediction approach based on the ideas that energetic interactions are stronger within structural domains than between them, and that fragments generated by cleaving the protein at the hinge site are independently stable.
for these proteins, the accurate identification of flexible hinges connecting rigid domains would provide significant insight into motion.
for a given structure, we generate pairs of fragments based on scanning all possible cleavage points on the protein chain, compute the energy of the fragments compared with the undivided protein, and predict hinges where this quantity is minimal.
in the first, we consider only pairs of fragments generated by cutting at a single location on the protein chain and then use a standard molecular mechanics force field to calculate the enthalpies of the two fragments.
in the third, we generate fragment pairs by cutting at two points on the protein chain and then calculate their free energies.
