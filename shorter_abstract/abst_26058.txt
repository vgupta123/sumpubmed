six libraries of rna sequence tags from immature inflorescence tissues were constructed and matched to their respective loci in the annotated arabidopsis genome.
moreover, empirical validations confirm mpss predictions for several genes with previously uncharacterized expression patterns.
these signature libraries survey the floral transcriptome of wild-type tissue as well as the floral homeotic mutants, apetala <dig>  apetala <dig>  agamous, a superman/apetala <dig> double mutant, and differentiated ovules dissected from the gynoecia of wild-type inflorescences.
a number of well-characterized genes were accurately delineated within our system of transcript filtration.
validation of the computational analyses was performed by comparison with previously published expression data, in situ hybridizations, promoter-reporter fusions, and reverse transcription pcr.
spatial floral expression data accrued by mpss and similar methods will be advantageous in the elucidation of more comprehensive genetic regulatory networks governing floral development.
the bulk of characterized organ-enriched transcript diversity was noted in the gynoecia and stamens, whereas fewer genes demonstrated sepal or petal-localized expression.
we have further characterized floral organ-localized gene expression in the inflorescence of arabidopsis thaliana by comparison of massively parallel signature sequencing  data.
