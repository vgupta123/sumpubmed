therefore, understanding the neddylation mechanism and determining neddylation targets possibly bears a huge importance in further understanding the cellular processes.
neddylation is a reversible post-translational modification that plays a vital role in maintaining cellular machinery.
independent test set results validated the robustness of reported new method.
using  <dig> amino acid long lysine-centred windows, our model was able to predict neddylation sites successfully, with an average 5-fold stratified cross validation performance of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  for accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, matthew's correlation coefficient and area under curve, respectively.
additionally, we observed that neddylation sites are commonly flexible and there is a significant positively charged amino acid presence in neddylation sites.
common characteristics of neddylation sites and their discriminative properties were explored for further in silico studies on neddylation.
this study is the first attempt to predict neddylated sites from protein sequences by using several sequence and sequence-based structural features.
lastly, up-to-date neddylation dataset was provided for researchers working on post-translational modifications in the accompanying supplementary material of this article.
