here, we report the first statistical comparisons contrasting the performance of covarion and mbl modeling strategies.
we also analyze three large datasets , and find the optimal number of components of the mbl model to be two for all datasets, indicating that this model is preferred over the standard homogeneous model.
however, the covarion model is always favored over the optimal mbl model.
we demonstrated, using three large datasets, that the covarion model is more efficient at handling heterotachy than the mbl model.
this is probably due to the fact that the mbl model requires a serious increase in the number of parameters, as compared to two supplementary parameters of the covarion approach.
using simulations under heterotachous conditions, we explore the properties of three model comparison methods: the akaike information criterion, the bayesian information criterion, and cross validation.
although more time consuming, cross validation appears more reliable than aic and bic as it directly measures the predictive power of a model on 'future' data.
