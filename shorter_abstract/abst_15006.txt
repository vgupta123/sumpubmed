statistical methods are utilized more in this domain.
most of them were observed to be related to solve the classification issue since they were dominant in the diagnostic category of the dataset for which they were selected as features.
hence the present method may be tried in conjunction with other classification methods.
wavelets, one of such techniques, have the potential to be utilized in feature selection method.
we analyzed the wavelet power spectrum of genes and proposed a clustering and feature selection method useful for classification based on haar wavelet power spectrum.
the qualities of the genes selected by the present method were analysed through their gene expression data.
in the present paper, the problem of feature selection of microarray gene expression data was considered.
application of this technique in this area is novel, simple, and faster than other methods, fit for a wide range of data types.
the aim of this paper is to assess the capability of haar wavelet power spectrum in the problem of clustering and gene selection based on expression data in the context of disease classification and to propose a method based on haar wavelet power spectrum.
the results are encouraging and throw light into the possibility of using this technique for problem domains like disease classification, gene network identification and personalized drug design.
most of the genes selected by earlier complex methods were selected by the very simple present method.
most of them do not fit for a wide range of datasets.
feature selection is an approach to overcome the 'curse of dimensionality' in complex researches like disease classification using microarrays.
