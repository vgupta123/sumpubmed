we show that concentration-dependent oligomerisation is sufficient to cause ire1α cytosolic domain rnase activity in vitro.
kinase activity can also be made redundant by small molecules which bind the atp binding site.
the resulting increase in ire1α rnase activity causes sequence-specific cleavage of x-box binding protein  <dig>  mrna, resulting in upregulation of the unfolded protein response and cellular adaptation to stress.
we demonstrate a role for the kinase activity by showing that autophosphorylation enhances rnase activity.
inclusion of the ire1α linker domain in protein constructs allows hyperphosphorylation and further enhancement of rnase activity, highlighting the importance of kinase activity.
we show that ire1α phosphorylation status correlates with an increased propensity to form oligomeric complexes and that forced dimerisation causes great enhancement in rnase activity.
taken together these experiments support the hypothesis that phosphorylation is important in modulating ire1α rnase activity which is achieved by increasing the propensity of ire1α to dimerise.
endoplasmic reticulum stress, caused by the presence of misfolded proteins, activates the stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α .
the role of ire1α kinase activity is disputed, as results from the generation of various kinase-inactivating mutations in either yeast or human cells are discordant.
we set out to uncover a role for ire1α kinase activity using wild-type cytosolic protein constructs.
this work supports the development of ire1α kinase inhibitors for use in the treatment of secretory cancers.
