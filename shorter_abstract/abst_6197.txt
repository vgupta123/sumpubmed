however, cdna-sscp analysis revealed that the expression patterns were dramatically altered between duplicated genes: nine of  <dig> duplicated genes exhibited expression divergence in o. minuta.
here, we performed a comparative study of a large genomic region surrounding the shattering <dig> locus in o. minuta, as well as in o. punctata and o. officinalis.
tandem duplicated gene clusters are prevalent in the sh <dig> region, and segmental duplication followed by random deletion is illustrated to explain the gene gain-and-loss process.
our study revealed both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in duplicated gene silencing in the allotetraploid o. minuta.
we identified one case in which dna methylation differences within promoter regions that were associated with the insertion of one hat element were probably responsible for gene silencing, suggesting a potential epigenetic gene silencing pathway triggered by te movement.
duplicated genomes in o. minuta have maintained the diploid genome organization, except for several structural variations mediated by transposon movement.
both copies of most duplicated genes still persist in o. minuta.
