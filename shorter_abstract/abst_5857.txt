here, we present an r-based implementation  of an analytical approach to obtain accurate, per-branch expectations of numbers of state transitions and dwelling times.
sfreemap confirmed theoretical expectations outperforming make.simmap in every experiment and reducing computation time of relatively modest datasets from hours to minutes.
we also introduce an intuitive way of visualizing the results by integrating over the posterior distribution and summarizing the parameters onto a target reference topology  provided by the user.
although execution time tends to be relatively small when simulations are performed on a single tree assumed to be the “true” topology, it may become an issue if analyses are conducted on several trees, such as the ones that make up posterior distributions obtained via bayesian phylogenetic inference.
working with such distributions is preferable to working with a single tree, for they allow the integration of phylogenetic uncertainty into parameter estimation.
sfreemap is an accurate and fast alternative to ancestral state reconstruction via simulation-based stochastic mapping.
we illustrate our visualization strategy using previously published data on the evolution of coloniality in scleractinian corals.
stochastic mapping is frequently used in comparative biology to simulate character evolution, enabling the probabilistic computation of statistics such as number of state transitions along a tree and distribution of states in its internal nodes.
