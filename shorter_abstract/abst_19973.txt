we have developed a procedure to integrate molecular phylogenetic reconstructions of rapidly evolving viral populations into a forensic setting adequate for molecular epidemiological analysis of outbreaks and transmission events.
we applied this procedure to a large outbreak of hepatitis c virus caused by a single source and the results obtained played a key role in the trial that led to the conviction of the suspected source.
molecular phylogenetic analyses are used increasingly in the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks and transmission cases involving rapidly evolving rna viruses.
we used these data to calibrate a relaxed molecular clock and to determine a rough estimate of the time of infection for each patient.
here, we present the results of such an analysis that contributed to the conviction of an anesthetist as being responsible for the infection of  <dig> of his patients with hepatitis c virus.
