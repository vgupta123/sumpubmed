by using network-based analyses, we could establish a significant correlation between genes expressed in response to pg invasion.
microscopic analysis and quantitative pcr  profiling of callose synthase and cellulose synthases revealed a direct involvement of cell wall reinforcement and callose deposition in the pg-resistant phenotype.
we have identified a number of candidate genes possibly involved in the host-pathogen interactions between barley and pg fungus,  <dig> of which are specifically expressed in pg-resistant plants.
the purpose of the present work was to use transcriptomic profiling to highlight barley genes and metabolic pathways affected or altered in response to pg infection and consequently elucidate their involvement and contribution in resistance to leaf stripe.
barley leaf stripe disease, caused by the fungus pyrenophora graminea , is a worldwide crop disease that results in significant loss of barley yield.
collectively, our results suggest that the resistance to leaf stripe in barley proceeds through callose deposition and different oxidation processes.
our study examined and compared the transcriptomes of two barley genotypes using an established differential display reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  strategy at  <dig> and 20 days post-inoculation .
the analysis of gene expression changes during the course of infection with pg suggested the involvement of  <dig> upregulated genes during the immunity response.
a total of  <dig> significantly modulated expressed sequence tags  were identified.
