here, we present phydesign, a platform-independent online application that implements the townsend  phylogenetic informativeness analysis, providing a quantitative prediction of the utility of loci to solve specific phylogenetic questions.
by providing these profiles, phydesign facilitates locus prioritization increasing the efficiency of sequencing for phylogenetic purposes compared to traditional studies with more laborious and low capacity screening methods, as well as increasing the accuracy of phylogenetic studies.
the rapid increase in number of sequenced genomes for species across of the tree of life is revealing a diverse suite of orthologous genes that could potentially be employed to inform molecular phylogenetic studies that encompass broader taxonomic sampling.
however, no software or automated methodology to evaluate sequence alignments and estimate the phylogenetic informativeness metric has been available.
together with a manual and sample files, the application is freely accessible at http://phydesign.townsend.yale.edu.
