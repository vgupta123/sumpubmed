semantic similarity scores for protein pairs are widely applied in functional genomic researches for finding functional clusters of proteins, predicting protein functions and protein-protein interactions, and for identifying putative disease genes.
thus, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of the bias on semantic similarity scores between proteins and then find a method to avoid them.
first, we evaluated  <dig> commonly used semantic similarity scores for protein pairs and demonstrated that they significantly correlated with the numbers of annotation terms for the proteins .
these results suggested that current applications of the semantic similarity scores between proteins might be unreliable.
then, to reduce this annotation bias effect, we proposed normalizing the semantic similarity scores between proteins using the power transformation of the scores.
this affects applications that are based on these semantic similarity scores, especially in clustering studies that rely on score magnitudes.
we provide evidence that this improves performance in some applications.
however, because some proteins, such as those related to diseases, tend to be studied more intensively, annotations are likely to be biased, which may affect applications based on semantic similarity measures.
current semantic similarity measures for protein pairs are highly dependent on protein annotation lengths, which are subject to biological research bias.
