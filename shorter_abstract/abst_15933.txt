moreover, the common workflow processed in this field fails to identify microbial communities and their effect on a specific disease status.
to preset a user-friendly r package, we have built a dedicated website, https://github.com/bm2-lab/metatopics, which includes free downloads, detailed tutorials and illustration examples.
metatopics is the first interactive r package to integrate the state-of-arts topic model derived from statistical learning community to analyze and visualize the metagenomics taxonomy data.
even the relationships and interactions between different bacteria in a microbial community keep unknown.

furthermore, a quantitative measurement, quetelet index, is defined to estimate the influence of a latent sub-community on a certain disease status for given samples.
deciphering taxonomical structures based on high dimensional sequencing data is still challenging in metagenomics study.
