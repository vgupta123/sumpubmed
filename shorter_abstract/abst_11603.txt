vascular homeostasis and response to injury are dependent on the coordinated activity of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor-a .
we show that vegff, unlike vegf, does not bind ecm, fibronectin, or np- <dig>  using computational simulations, we find that excess vegff can lead to increased binding of vegf to vegfr <dig> through vegff binding to vegfr <dig> and subsequent liberation of np- <dig>  we show experimentally that vegf-induced migration has a biphasic response to conversion of vegf to vegff.
vegf also binds to extracellular matrix  and neuropilin , a cell surface glycoprotein that enhances vegf binding to vegfr <dig> while inhibiting vegf-vegfr <dig> interactions.
proteases such as neutrophil elastase release vegf bound to ecm; however, this results in proteolytic processing of vegf to a smaller species termed vegf fragment .
these findings suggest that proteolytic damage at sites of tissue injury and inflammation has the potential to modulate the vegf system through a complex process and highlight the need for quantitative analysis to reveal mechanisms of growth factor control.
