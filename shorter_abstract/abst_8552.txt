the transcription factors associated with the hox genes known to specify cell fate during embryonic development and promote embryonic stem cells differentiation were down-regulated in both nude and e <dig>  among the genes enriched in the nude skin but not shared with e <dig> fetuses were members of the wnt and matrix metalloproteinases  families whereas bmp and notch related genes were down-regulated.
in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that foxn <dig> expression in the skin is an essential condition to establish the adult skin phenotype and that foxn <dig> inactivity in nude mice keeps skin in the immature stage resembling the phenomena of neoteny.
differentially regulated genes indicated that nude mice were more similar to e <dig>  and b <dig> were more similar to e <dig> .
e <dig> and nude mice exhibit prominent up-regulation of keratin , involucrin  and filaggrin  genes.
nude mice may be considered as a model of neoteny among mammals.
uninjured skin of adult c57bl/6j  mice, mouse fetuses at days  <dig>  and  <dig>  of embryonic development and b <dig> cg-foxn <dig> nu  mice were characterized for their gene expression profiles by rna sequencing that was validated through qrt-pcr, western blot and immunohistochemistry.
the resemblance of gene expression profiles in the skin of both nude and e <dig> mice are direct or indirect consequences of the foxn <dig> deficiency.
in summary, foxn <dig> appears to be a pivotal control element of the developmental program and skin maturation.
foxn <dig> appears to regulate the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation and its inactivity creates a pro-regenerative environment.
mouse fetuses up to 16Â day of embryonic development and nude  mice are examples of animals that undergo regenerative  skin healing.
the up-regulated genes in nude and e <dig> mice were associated with tissue remodeling, cytoskeletal rearrangement, wound healing and immune response, whereas the down-regulated genes were associated with differentiation.
the expression of transcription factor foxn <dig> in the epidermis of mouse fetuses begins at embryonic day  <dig>  which coincides with the transition point from scar-free to scar-forming skin wound healing.
