together with bayesian skyeline plots, our data further suggest that both lineages experienced post-divergence demographic growth, followed by refugial isolation, divergence, and in the case of var.
our findings highlight the important influence of ancient sea-level changes on the diversification of east asia’s temperate flora.
molecular data were obtained from  <dig> p. arguta populations to infer current patterns of molecular structure and diversity in relation to past  and present distributions based on ecological niche modelling .
implicitly, they challenge the notion of general temperate forest expansion across the ecs land bridge, demonstrating instead its ‘filter’ effect owing to an unsuitable environment for certain species and their biological  properties.
here, we investigate the effects of quaternary changes in climate and sea level on the evolutionary and demographic history of platycrater arguta, a rare temperate understorey shrub with disjunct distributions in east china  and south japan .
combining information from nuclear/chloroplast sequence data with nuclear microsatellites, our im analyses identify the two varieties as genetically distinct units that evolved in strict allopatry since the mid-pleistocene, c.  <dig>   ma.
however, it is less clear when and how lineages diverged in this region, whether in full isolation or in the face of post-divergence gene flow.
