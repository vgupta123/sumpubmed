until now their implication in the mammary gland biology was suggested by few studies mainly focusing on pathological situations allowing the characterization of mirnas as markers of breast cancer tumour classes.
if in the normal mammary gland, the expression of known mirnas has been studied in human and mice but the full repertoire of mirnas expressed in this tissue is not yet available.
to extend the repertoire of mouse mammary gland expressed mirnas, we have constructed several libraries of small mirnas allowing the cloning of  <dig> sequences.
the cloning approach has allowed improving the repertoire of mirnas in the mammary gland, an evolutionary recent organ.
if none of them is mammary gland specific, a few of them are not ubiquitously expressed.
after bioinformatics' analysis,  <dig> known mirna  and  <dig> new mirnas were identified.
this tissue is a good candidate to find tissue-specific mirnas and to detect mirna specific to mammals.
for the first time  <dig> mouse specific mirna have been identified.
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that have been found to play important roles in silencing target genes and that are involved in the regulation of various normal cellular processes.
no correlation could be established between their expression pattern and evolutionary conservation.
