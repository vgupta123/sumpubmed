the latter genes may be candidates as biomarkers predictive of early events in the multistep carcinogenic process.
the aim of this study was to identify genes whose level of expression is altered by dehp by using a global wide-genome approach in syrian hamster embryo  cells, a model similar to human cells regarding their responses to this type of carcinogen.
this is the first study that elucidates the genomic changes of dehp involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton.
with mrna differential display , we analysed the transcriptional regulation of she cells exposed to  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> Î¼m of dehp for  <dig> hrs, conditions which induced neoplastic transformation of these cells.
the genes of interest were involved in many biological pathways, including signal transduction, regulation of the cytoskeleton, xenobiotic metabolism, apoptosis, lipidogenesis, protein conformation, transport and cell cycle.
the gene expression changes identified in the present study were ppar-independent.
this study identified a set of genes whose expression is altered by dehp exposure in mammalian embryo cells.
gene expression profiling showed  <dig> differentially-expressed fragments corresponding to  <dig> genes after tblastx comparisons,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated.
we then focused particularly on genes involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, one of the processes occurring during carcinogenesis and in the early steps of neoplastic transformation.
di--phthalate  is a commonly used plasticizer in polyvinylchloride  formulations and a potentially non-genotoxic carcinogen.
the up-regulated genes were involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and this would suggest a role of cellular plasticity in the mechanism of chemical carcinogenesis.
