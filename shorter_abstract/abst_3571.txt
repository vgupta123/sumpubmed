we compared expression of mirnas between different tissues and between males and females to identify tissue associated and sex associated mirnas respectively.
the prediction tool identified a total of  <dig> novel pre-mirnas.
further, we have discovered  <dig> novel pre-mirnas  as a genomic resource which can facilitate further investigations to understand mirna-mrna gene regulatory networks in zebrafish which will have implications in understanding the function of human homologs.
we sequenced small rnas from brain, gut, liver, ovary, testis, eye, heart and embryo of zebrafish.
using the mirna discovery tool , we discovered novel mirnas from the unannotated reads that ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> Â %, with exceptions of ovary  and testis .
the role of micrornas in gene regulation has been well established.
