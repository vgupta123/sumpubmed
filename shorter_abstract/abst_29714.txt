substrate utilization and substrate range of bacterial assemblages differed within and among enrichments types, and not simply between simple and complex n-enrichments.
n substrate use patterns differed between isolates from some complex and simple n-enrichments while others were unexpectedly similar.
the nitrogen  cycle consists of complex microbe-mediated transformations driven by a variety of factors, including diversity and concentrations of n compounds.
ultimately, our results imply that the available n pool influences physiology and selects for bacteria with various abilities that are unrelated to their taxonomic affiliation.
in this study, we examined taxonomic diversity and n substrate utilization by heterotrophic bacteria isolated from streams under complex and simple n-enrichment conditions.
taxonomic composition of isolates did not differ among enrichments and was unrelated to n use suggesting strong functional redundancy.
