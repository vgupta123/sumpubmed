to capture the essence of the genome methylation level and to meet the efficiency for running online, we introduce a straightforward method for measuring genome methylation in each sequence context by gene.
tea is freely accessible for academic users at: http://tea.iis.sinica.edu.tw.
through a simple data uploading process, the tea server deploys a web-based platform for deep analysis by linking data to an updated arabidopsis annotation database and toolkits.
one single data from a bs-seq experiment is resolved into many features according to the sequence contexts, making methylome data analysis and data visualization a complex task.
bisulfite sequencing  has become a standard technology to profile genome-wide dna methylation at single-base resolution.
the method is scripted in java to process bs-seq mapping results.
it provides several ways to help users exploit wgbs data.
