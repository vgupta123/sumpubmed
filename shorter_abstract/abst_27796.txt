although the primary objective of forensic dna analyses of unidentified human remains is positive identification, cases involving historical or archaeological skeletal remains often lack reference samples for comparison.
in this study, mps was used to characterize 140-year-old human skeletal remains discovered at a historical site in deadwood, south dakota, united states.
results were obtained for 25/ <dig> y-strs, 34/ <dig> y snps, 166/ <dig> ancestry-informative snps, 24/ <dig> phenotype-informative snps, 102/ <dig> human identity snps, 27/ <dig> autosomal strs , and 4/ <dig> x-strs .
the genetic results are consistent with anthropological findings that the remains belong to a male of european ancestry .

the outcome demonstrates that substantially more genetic information can be obtained from the same initial quantities of dna as that of current ce-based analyses.
phenotype-informative snp data provided strong support that the individual had light red hair and brown eyes.
this study is among the first to genetically characterize historical human remains with forensic genetic marker kits specifically designed for mps.
massively parallel sequencing  offers an opportunity to provide biometric data in such cases, and these cases provide valuable data on the feasibility of applying mps for characterization of modern forensic casework samples.
ancestry-informative snp analysis also supported european ancestry.
both of these haplogroups are the most common haplogroups in western europe.
