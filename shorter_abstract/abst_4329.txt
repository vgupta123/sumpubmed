pearl millet  is a widely cultivated drought- and high-temperature tolerant c <dig> cereal grown under dryland, rainfed and irrigated conditions in drought-prone regions of the tropics and sub-tropics of africa, south asia and the americas.
eighty-nine est-ssr marker loci from this consensus map had significant blast hits  on the genome sequences of rice, foxtail millet, sorghum, maize and brachypodium with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci, respectively.
the consensus map developed in the present study contains the largest set of mapped ssrs reported to date for pearl millet, and represents a major consolidation of existing pearl millet genetic mapping information.
this study increased numbers of mapped pearl millet ssr markers by >50%, filling important gaps in previously published ssr-based linkage maps for this species and will greatly facilitate ssr-based qtl mapping and applied marker-assisted selection programs.

newly developed est-ssr markers , along with previously mapped est-ssr , genomic ssr  and sts  markers, were used to construct linkage maps of four f <dig> recombinant inbred populations  based on crosses icmb 841-p <dig> × 863b-p <dig> , h 77/833- <dig> × prlt 2/89- <dig> , 81b-p <dig> × icmp 451-p <dig>  and pt 732b-p <dig> × p1449-2-p <dig> .
a consensus map of  <dig> loci  detected by  <dig> primer pairs was constructed using mergemap to integrate the individual linkage maps.
locus order in the consensus map was well conserved for nearly all linkage groups.
mapped loci numbers were greatest for rip a , followed by rip b , rip c  and rip d .
