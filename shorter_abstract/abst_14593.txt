this study aimed to answer three questions related to chronic myofascial pain syndrome : 1) is the motor cortex excitability, as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation parameters , related to state-trait anxiety?
3) does the state-trait anxiety predict the response to pain evoked by qst if simultaneously receiving a heterotopic stimulus ?
motor cortex excitability was assessed by tms, and anxiety was assessed based on the state-trait anxiety inventory.
in patients, trait-anxiety was positively correlated to intracortical facilitation  at baseline and after qst evoked pain  and negatively correlated to the cortical silent period   .
2) does anxiety modulate corticospinal excitability changes after evoked pain by quantitative sensory testing ?
the disability related to pain  was assessed by the profile of chronic pain scale for the brazilian population , and the psychophysical pain measurements were measured by the qst and cpm.
pain scores during cpm were positively correlated with trait-anxiety when it was concurrently with high drp .
