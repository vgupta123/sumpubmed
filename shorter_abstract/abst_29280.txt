interestingly, many intronizations were promoted not by base substitutions but by cryptic splice sites, which were silent in the parental genes but active in the retrogenes.
the activation of cryptic splice sites in the intronization of retrogenes may be triggered by the change of gene structure after retroposition.
intron gains in retrogenes are not as rare as previously thought.
however, in some instances, retrogenes may recruit internal exonic sequences as introns, which is known as intronization.
furthermore, diverse mechanisms may lead to intron creation in retrogenes.
our results provide novel insights into the evolutionary role of introns.
alignment of pairs of retrogenes and their parents indicated that, in addition to intronization , retrogenes also may have gained introns by insertion of external sequences into the genes  or reversal of the orientation of transcription .
a high percentage of non-frameshift introns in retrogenes may be because non-frameshift introns do not dramatically affect host proteins.
