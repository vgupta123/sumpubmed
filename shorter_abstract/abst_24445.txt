a shorter part originated from the entire length of the lateral edge of the dens of axis and terminated on the internal wall of the vertebral foramen of atlas and thus was called the lateral part.
two parts of the alar ligaments were found.
the sesamoid and periosteal fibrocartilage supports the transverse ligament of the atlas whereas the alar ligaments have no cartilage.

recent new anatomical and histological features of craniocervical junction in dogs and cats were described providing evidence of differences between the carnivore species.
the transverse ligament of the atlas was widened in the mid region, above the dens of axis, and thickened at enthesis.
periosteal fibrocartilage was detected in the transverse ligament of the atlas at the enthesis, and sesamoid fibrocartilage was present on periphery in the middle of the ligament.
a longer one aroused from dens of axis to the internal  surface of the occipital condyles and was called apical part.
the craniocervical junction in foxes differs in part from other carnivores such as dogs and cats but resembles that of mesaticephalic dogs.
