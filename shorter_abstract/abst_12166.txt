establishing domain-specific knowledge bases may be a more effective and efficient way to manage and query information within specific biomedical fields.
we present an open source infrastructure that provides a powerful capacity for managing and mining data within a domain-specific knowledge base.
the open source system infrastructure presented in this paper provides a novel approach to managing and querying information and knowledge from domain-specific pubmed data.
information retrieval and usability tests demonstrated that the system had high rates of recall and precision, 90% and 93% respectively.
in addition, by using mvc-based design and java as a platform-independent programming language, this system provides a potential infrastructure for any domain-specific knowledge base in the biomedical field.
