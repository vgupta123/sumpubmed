we anticipate that diverse groups studying microbial genetics and associated phenotypes will employ omp for standardizing microbial phenotype annotation, much as the gene ontology has standardized gene product annotation.
the ontology of microbial phenotypes  has been created to standardize the capture of such phenotypic information from microbes.
omp has been built on the foundations of the basic formal ontology and the phenotype and trait ontology.
however, previous to this work, there was no generalizable system in place for the structured storage and retrieval of phenotypic information for bacteria.
terms have logical definitions that can facilitate computational searching of phenotypes and their associated genes.
phenotypic data are routinely used to elucidate gene function in organisms amenable to genetic manipulation.
