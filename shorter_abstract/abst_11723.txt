although ssas have been studied before for exact matching of short reads, an elegant way of approximate matching capability was missing.
among many strategies proposed for this alignment process, indexing the reference genome and short read searching over the index is a dominant technique.
we concentrate on indexing dna sequences via sparse suffix arrays  and propose a new short read aligner named Ψ-ra .
we give comparisons with some of the well-known short read aligners, and show that indexing a genome with ssa is a good alternative to the burrows-wheeler transform or seed-based solutions.
it is possible to fine tune the space consumption of the index based on the available memory of the machine and the minimum length of the arriving pattern queries.
we provide this by defining the rightmost mismatch criteria that prioritize the errors towards the end of the reads, where errors are more probable.
our goal is to design a space-efficient indexing structure with fast searching capability to catch the massive short reads produced by the next generation high-throughput dna sequencing technology.

genomic read alignment involves mapping  short reads from a particular individual onto a pre-sequenced reference genome of the same species.
