by analyzing spectra of images post gabor filtering and fast fourier transform, we were able to measure subtle changes in collagen fibre orientation intractable to existing techniques.

for example, cross-polar images of picrosirius stained skin reveal exquisite structure, allowing changes in the basketweave conformation of healthy collagen to be assessed.
we detected the progressive loss of collagen basketweave structure in a series of chronologically aged skin samples, as well as in skin derived from a model of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus.
