the high sensitivity and specificity value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for plant;  <dig>  and  <dig>  for drosophila;  <dig>  and  <dig>  for human;  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mouse and  <dig>  and  <dig>  for rat demonstrate that this technique is less prone to false positive results and exhibits better performance than many other tools.
the increased availability of sequence data for various eukaryotic organisms in recent years has necessitated for better tools and techniques for the prediction and analysis of promoters in eukaryotic sequences.
secondly improved performance can be achieved by enhancing the predictive ability of the machine learning algorithms used.
the high sensitivity and specificity indicate that 4-mer frequencies in conjunction with supervised machine-learning methods can be beneficial in the identification of rna pol ii promoters comparative to other methods.
