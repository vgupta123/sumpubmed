mass spectrometry was performed to analyse the hdgfstrep-tag interactome.
hdgf has mitogenic, angiogenic, neurotrophic and antiapoptotic activity but the molecular mechanisms by which it exerts these activities are largely unknown nor has its biological function in tumours been elucidated.
the results provide evidence for the existence of hdgf and nucleolin containing nucleoprotein complexes which formation depends on the presence of specific mrnas.
when bcl- <dig> coding sequence within the full length cdna is replaced by a sequence coding for secretory alkaline phosphatase complex formation is not enhanced.
