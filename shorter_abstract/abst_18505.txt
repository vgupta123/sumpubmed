using flowmatch, the meta-clusters across samples can be matched to assess overall differences among the samples of various phenotypes or time-points.
when flow cytometric data on mixtures of cell populations are collected from samples under different experimental conditions, computational methods are needed  to classify the samples into similar groups, and  to characterize the changes within the corresponding populations due to the different conditions.
we designed a hierarchical algorithm, flowmatch, to first match the corresponding clusters across samples for producing robust meta-clusters, and to then construct a high-dimensional template as a collection of meta-clusters for each class of samples.
the templates of the pre-stimulation and post-stimulation data corresponding to memory and naive t cell populations clearly show, at the level of the meta-clusters, the overall phosphorylation shift due to the stimulation.
the flowmatch algorithm is able to construct representative templates from the samples before and after stimulation, and to match corresponding meta-clusters across templates.
we applied the algorithm on flow cytometry data obtained from human blood cells before and after stimulation with anti-cd <dig> monoclonal antibody, which is reported to change phosphorylation responses of memory and naive t cells.
