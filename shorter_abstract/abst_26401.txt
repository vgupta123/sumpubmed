such improvement in mapping efficiency is related to sequence entropy.
the hairpin recovery technique improves mapping efficiency, and sequence entropy relates to mapping efficiency.
however, despite intense effort, a much smaller proportion of the reads derived from bisulfite treated dna  can be mapped than regular short reads mapping , and it is unclear what factors lead to this low mapping efficiency.
dna methylation is an important epigenetic mark relevant to normal development and disease genesis.
a common approach to characterizing genome-wide dna methylation is using next generation sequencing technology to sequence bisulfite treated dna.
the short sequence reads are mapped to the reference genome to determine the methylation statuses of cs.
