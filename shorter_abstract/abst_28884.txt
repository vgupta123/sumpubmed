we were interested to learn that the two taagos are also differentially expressed in developing wheat plants and that their expression patterns are variously affected by vernalization treatment.
argonaute proteins are key components of rna interference , playing important roles in rna-directed gene silencing.
expression analysis indicated that both genes are ubiquitously expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs, including the root, stem, leaf, anther, ovule, and seed.
further investigation revealed that they can be induced by cold accumulation during vernalization.
phylogenetic analysis, prediction of conserved domains and catalytic motifs, and modelling of their protein structures suggested that they encode functional argonaute proteins.
temporal and spatial expression analyses indicated that these genes are potentially involved in developmental regulation of wheat plants.
however, they are differentially expressed in germinating endosperm tissues.
protein structural analysis demonstrated that typical paz and piwi domains were found in both taago1b and taago <dig>  from the highly conserved piwi domains, we detected conserved asp-asp-his  motifs that function as a catalytic triad and have critical roles during the process of sequence-specific cleavage in the rnai machinery.
various classes of argonaute genes have been identified from plants and might be involved in developmental regulation.
two putative wheat argonaute genes, taago1b and taago <dig>  were cloned.
structural modelling indicated that both taagos can fold to a specific α/β structure.
moreover, the three aligned ddh residues are spatially close to each other at the “slicer” site of the piwi domain.
the 3157-bp taago <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids, with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and pi of  <dig> .
in this study, two full-length cdnas of argonaute were cloned from wheat, designated as taago1b and taago <dig>  the cdna of taago1b is  <dig> bp long and encodes  <dig> amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of ~ <dig>  kda and pi of  <dig> .
