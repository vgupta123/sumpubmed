previous studies have shown that the mrna expressions of numerous genes are regulated by nitrogen supplies; however, little is known about the expressed non-coding elements, for example long non-coding rnas  that control the response of maize  to nitrogen.
we identified a large number of lncrnas in maize and illustrated their potential regulatory roles in response to n stress.
the results lay the foundation for further in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lncrnasâ€™ role in response to nitrogen stresses.
by integration with mrna expression profiles and physiological evaluations,  <dig> lncrnas and  <dig> nitrogen-responsive lncrnas were identified that exhibited unique expression patterns.
co-expression network analysis showed that the nitrogen-responsive lncrnas were enriched mainly in one of the three co-expressed modules.
in this study, we surveyed the intergenic/intronic lncrnas in maize b <dig> leaves at the v <dig> stage under conditions of n-deficiency and n-sufficiency using ribosomal rna depletion and ultra-deep total rna sequencing approaches.
the genes in the enriched module are mainly involved in nadh dehydrogenase activity, oxidative phosphorylation and the nitrogen compounds metabolic process.
