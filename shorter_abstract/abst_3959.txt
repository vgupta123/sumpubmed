in other words, to enable the inter-cellular crosstalk required to obtain an immune activation in which the macrophage plays its role, the simulated networks are not taken in isolation but combined with other cellular agents, thus setting up a discrete minimalistic model of the immune system at the microscopic/intracellular  and mesoscopic/intercellular scale.
to test the model, we simulated a large number of such networks as in a statistical ensemble.

macrophages cover a major role in the immune system, being the most plastic cell yielding several key immune functions.
