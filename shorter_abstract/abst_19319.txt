the performance of functions is often evaluated by discrimination ability using decoy structures of target proteins.
only the main-chain atom coordinates of n, cα, and c atoms for the respective amino acid residues are required as input data for structure evaluation.
the  <dig> target structures in  <dig> different types of decoy sets were separated into  <dig> and  <dig> targets, and function training and the subsequent performance test were performed using the respective target sets.
the average cα rmsd of the test set resulted in  <dig>  with the tuned parameters.
a function that can evaluate coarse-grained structures is advantageous from many aspects, such as relatively easy generation and manipulation of model structures; however, the reduction of structural representation is often accompanied by degradation of the structure discrimination performance.
the major part of the discrimination performance was supported by the orientation-dependent component.
the function can be applied to the identification of near-native structures in structure prediction experiments.
the function  consists of six pseudo-energy calculation components that deal with different structural features.
despite the reduced representation of input structures, dfmac showed considerable structure discrimination ability.
the use of knowledge-based potential function is a powerful method for protein structure evaluation.
