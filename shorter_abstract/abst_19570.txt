3of <dig> increases the fidelity of pattern matching and finds all possible solutions in protein sequences in cases of length-ambiguous patterns instead of simply reporting the longest or shortest hits.
the n-of-m pattern type can be combined with common regular expression terms and thus also allows for a comprehensive description of complex patterns.
the n-of-m pattern type offers an improved accuracy for pattern matching in combination with the ability to find all solutions, without compromising the user friendliness of regular expression terms.
they are frequently described using terms of regular expressions  because of the user-friendly terminology.
the number of distinct elements can be constrained by operators, and individual characters may be excluded.
3of <dig> is named after a special use of its main feature, the novel n-of-m pattern type.
frequently such patterns are complex and highly variable, especially in protein sequences.
we have implemented the 3of <dig> web application in order to enable complex pattern matching in protein sequences.
