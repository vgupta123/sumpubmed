however, due to missing data and high redundancy among the features used, different protein pairs may benefit from different features based on the set of attributes available.
the individual experts use logistic regression and their scores are combined using another logistic regression.
high-throughput methods can directly detect the set of interacting proteins in model species but the results are often incomplete and exhibit high false positive and false negative rates.
in addition, in many cases it is hard to directly determine which of the data sources contributed to a prediction.
to address these challenges we propose a mixture-of-feature-experts method for protein-protein interaction prediction.
our method improved upon the best previous methods for this task.
thus, different experts will have different influence on the prediction depending on the available features.
when combining the scores the weighting of each expert depends on the set of input attributes available for that pair.
