of  <dig> miscellaneous variations,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were inter-chromosomal variations , intra-chromosomal variations  and inversions  respectively.
in order to harness the untapped genetic potential available for chickpea improvement, we re-sequenced  <dig> chickpea genotypes representing parental lines of  <dig> mapping populations segregating for abiotic , biotic stresses  and nutritionally important  traits using whole genome re-sequencing approach.
in addition, copy number variations  such as gene deletions and duplications were identified across the chickpea parental genotypes, which were minimum in pi  <dig>  and maximum in jg  <dig> .

a total of  <dig>  line specific variations  with the highest percentage were identified in coding regions in icc  <dig>  followed by iccv  <dig> .
genome-wide snps, indels, cnvs, pavs, and miscellaneous variations identified in different mapping populations are a valuable resource in genetic research and helpful in locating genes/genomic segments responsible for economically important traits.
further, the genome-wide variations identified in the present study can be used for developing high density snp arrays for genetics and breeding applications.
chickpea  is the second most important grain legume cultivated by resource poor farmers in south asia and sub-saharan africa.
