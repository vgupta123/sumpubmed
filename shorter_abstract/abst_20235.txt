these resources will provide a robust platform for future high-resolution mapping, map-based cloning, comparative genomics and assembly of whole-genome sequencing data for the species.
the nll bac library and bac-end sequences are powerful resources for genetic and genomic research on lupin.
both ends of  <dig> randomly selected bac clones were sequenced to generate  <dig> bac end-sequences , covering approximately 1% of the nll genome.
these bess permitted a preliminary characterisation of the nll genome such as organisation and composition, with the bess having approximately 39% g:c content,  <dig> % repetitive dna and  <dig> % putative gene-encoding regions.
a nll bac library was constructed consisting of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig>  kbp from cv tanjil.
