a total of  <dig> est sequences from the coffee genome database were selected for a microarray analysis.
up-regulated genes include those responsible for defense mechanisms, hypersensitive response and genes involved with cellular function and maintenance.
the microarray analysis indicated that resistant plants differ in gene expression profile.
expression changes  were found in resistant plants for  <dig> genes .
also, our analyses indicated that differential expression profiles between resistant and susceptible genotypes are observed in the absence of leaf-miner, indicating that defense is already build up in resistant plants, as a priming mechanism.
to understand the transcriptional basis of this response, we compare gene expression profiles of two coffee genotypes, susceptible and resistant to leaf miner .
plants have evolved complex mechanisms to recognize such attacks, and to trigger a defense response.
our results show evidences that coffee defense responses against leaf-miner attack are balanced with other cellular functions.
fluorescence probes were synthesized using mrna from the infested and non-infested coffee plants.
