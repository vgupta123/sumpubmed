there is a significant loss of 5′ ppar-γ methylation from normal lung to primary lung cancer and metastatic osa , however altered ppar-γ promoter methylation at the interrogated locus does not appear to be associated with changes in protein expression.
ppar-γ protein is expressed in normal canine lung tissue, canine primary lung cancer, and metastatic osa.
these results are the first to describe epigenetic marks and protein localization of ppar-γ among different lung pathologies in the dog.
the protein was studied using immunohistochemistry  and dna methylation was studied using combined bisulfite restriction analysis , and methylation-specific pcr .
the objective of this study was to determine the tissue distribution of ppar-γ in normal canine lung, canine lung cancer, and metastatic to lung cancer, as well as determine the role, if any, of dna methylation in epigenetic control of gene expression.
ppar-γ is expressed in all large conducting airways, particularly in goblet cells and bronchial glands, in the canine lung.
it has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in many solid tumors including human prostate, breast, colon, and lung cancer.
confirmation of ppar-γ protein expression in tumor-bearing dogs supports the investigation of ppar-γ agonists in this subset of veterinary patients.
ppar-γ is expressed in 33 % of canine non-small cell lung cancer  cases and 66 % of metastatic osteosarcoma  cases.
