the most effective methods were alternating decision tree and multilayer perceptron.
statistical machine learning methods such as alternating decision tree and multilayer perceptron can replace the energy based classifier, with advantage of very significantly reduced computational time and simplicity to perform the analysis.
additionally, a decision tree provides a set of very easily interpretable rules.
the computational time was reduced from 18- <dig> cpu-hours  to  <dig>  cpu-hours  to seconds .
many of them underlie serious diseases, like alzheimer disease.
our new dataset proved representative enough to use simple statistical methods for testing the amylogenicity based only on six letter sequences.
3d profile is a physicochemical-based method that has generated the most numerous dataset - zipperdb.
two methods to increase the classification efficiency of amyloidogenic candidates are presented and tested: simplified 3d profile generation and machine learning methods.
we generated a new dataset of hexapeptides, using more economical 3d profile algorithm, which showed very good classification overlap with zipperdb .
the dataset of 6-residue sequences with their binary classification, based on the energy of the segment, was applied for training machine learning methods.
the new part of our dataset contains  <dig> segments, with  <dig> classified as amyloidogenic.
instead, they can be predicted by computational methods.
recent studies indicate that amyloidogenic properties can be associated with short segments of aminoacids, which transform the structure when exposed.
a few hundreds of such peptides have been experimentally found.
a few other machine learning methods also achieved a good performance.
