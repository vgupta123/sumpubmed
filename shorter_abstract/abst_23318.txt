this methodology may allow the use of avidin as a universal scaffold in the development of novel receptors for small molecules.
furthermore, a gene library based on the sbavd- <dig> gene was created by randomizing the loop area between Î²-strands  <dig> and  <dig>  phage display selection from this library led to the isolation of a steroid-binding protein with significantly decreased biotin binding affinity compared to sbavd- <dig>  importantly, differential scanning calorimetry and analytical gel-filtration revealed that the high stability and the tetrameric structure were preserved in these engineered avidins.
the high stability and structural properties of avidin make it an attractive molecule for the engineering of novel receptors.
selection from the generated library led to the isolation of a steroid-binding avidin mutant  showing micromolar affinity towards testosterone .
when compared to antibodies, tailored proteins may provide advantageous properties such as a smaller size or a more stable structure.
to tailor the binding properties of avidin, we have designed a sequence-randomized avidin library with mutagenesis focused at the loop area of the binding site.
