we used a combined computational-experimental approach to detect and characterize regions exhibiting strong purifying selection against synonymous substitutions along the hiv- <dig> genome.
this superimposition of functions leads to complex selective forces acting on all levels of the genome and proteome.
the contradiction between the inferred purifying selective forces and the lack of effect of these mutations on viral replication may be explained by the fact that the phenotype was measured in single-cycle infection assays in cell culture.
these models are combined with a randomization procedure to automatically identify the most statistically significant regions of conserved synonymous sites along the genome.
in our assays aiming to quantify viral fitness in both early and late stages of the replication cycle, no differences were observed between the mutated and the wild type virus following the introduction of synonymous mutations.
such observations suggest the existence of stretches of codon sites that are evolutionary conserved at both dna-rna and protein levels.
our methodology is based on advanced probabilistic evolutionary models that explicitly account for synonymous rate variation among sites and rate dependencies among adjacent sites.
such a system does not account for the complexity of hiv- <dig> infections in vivo, which involves multiple infection cycles and interaction with the host immune system.
considering the constraints on hiv- <dig> to maintain such a highly compact genome, we hypothesized that stretches of synonymous conservation would be common within its genome.
such stretches may point to functionally important regions within protein coding sequences not necessarily reflecting functional constraints on the amino-acid sequence.
