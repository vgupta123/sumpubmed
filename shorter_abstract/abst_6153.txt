national studies have documented the presence of c. burnetii in dairy herds in indiana.
c. burnetii is present in dairy herds throughout indiana.
bulk tank milk samples were collected between june and august of  <dig> by the indiana state board of animal health .
c. burnetii is considered to be enzootic in ruminants, but clinical signs of infection do not always manifest.
the geographic distribution of dairies testing positive for c. burnetii dna and the identified sts were also evaluated.
the estimated overall herd prevalence for c. burnetii dna was  <dig>  % .
the presence of multiple sts in a single bulk tank sample indicates that multiple strains of c. burnetii can circulate within a herd.
this represents an opportunity to better characterize the distribution and prevalence of c. burnetii infection at the state scale, allowing evaluation of the need for surveillance and response planning to occur at this level.
a cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the herd prevalence of c. burnetii in commercial cattle dairies in indiana and characterize the strains of c. burnetii within these dairies.
a total of  <dig> of these samples were tested for the is <dig> transposon of c. burnetii using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction .
this supports potential transmission of c. burnetii between goats and cattle, presenting the potential for a switch in the dominant genotype found in a given species.
coxiella burnetii is the etiologic agent of q fever, a zoonotic disease causing influenza-like illness, pregnancy loss, cardiovascular disease and chronic fatigue syndrome in people.
the highest estimated regional prevalence was  <dig>  % in the central region of indiana.
