we developed three software packages that parse and load medline, and ran each package to install separate instances of the medline database.
we have developed software tools to parse the medline data files and load their contents into a relational database.
for each installation, we collected data on loading time and disk-space utilization to provide examples of the process in different settings.
the loading times for the three installations were  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> hours, and disk-space utilization was  <dig>  gb,  <dig>  gb, and  <dig>  gb, respectively.
disk-space utilization depended on the number of medline files processed, amount of indexing, and whether abstracts were stored as character large objects or truncated.
the national library of medicine  distributes medline in extensible markup language -formatted text files, but it is difficult to query medline in that format.
because there is variation in hardware, software, and network infrastructures across sites, we cannot predict the exact time required for a user to load medline, but our results suggest that performance of the software is reasonable.
researchers who use medline for text mining, information extraction, or natural language processing may benefit from having a copy of medline that they can manage locally.
loading time also depended on whether data were written to intermediate files or not, and on whether input files were processed in sequence or in parallel.
relational database  technology supports indexing and querying of very large datasets, and can accommodate a locally stored version of medline.
our database schemas and conversion software are publicly available at .
