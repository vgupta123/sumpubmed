the associated evolution of on-plant  and soil seed storage, and later ant dispersal, affirms them as ancient adaptations to fire among flowering plants.
using a molecular-dated phylogeny for the great gondwanan family proteaceae, with a 113-million-year evolutionary history, we show that the ancestors of many of its characteristic sclerophyll genera, such as protea, conospermum, leucadendron, petrophile, adenanthos and leucospermum , occurred in fireprone habitats from  <dig> ma .
focusing on the widespread 113-million-year-old family proteaceae, fireproneness among gondwanan angiosperm floras can now be traced back almost  <dig> million years into the fiery cretaceous.
yet it is commonly believed that fireprone communities existed only after the global climate became more arid and seasonal  <dig> ma.
