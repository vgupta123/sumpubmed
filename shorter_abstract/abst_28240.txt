we identified and significantly replicated three novel snps for crp in or near ctsb/fdft <dig> , stag1/pccb  and fto .
we aimed to identify genetic pleiotropy among crp and lipids in order to better understand the shared biology of chronic inflammation and lipid metabolism.
in addition, we provide evidence for fdft <dig>  pccb and fto to be associated with crp levels.
in a bivariate gwas, we combined summary statistics of published gwas on crp  and lipids, including ldl-cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol , using an empirical weighted linear-combined test statistic.
fifty potentially pleiotropic snps were identified among crp and lipids:  <dig> for ldl-cholesterol and crp,  <dig> for hdl-cholesterol and crp,  <dig> for triglycerides, and crp and  <dig> for total cholesterol and crp.
genome-wide association studies  have identified multiple genetic loci for c-reactive protein  and lipids, of which some overlap.
seven pleiotropic lipid loci were replicated in the independent set of metabochip samples of the global lipids genetics consortium.

annotating the effect of replicated crp snps to the expression of nearby genes, we observed an effect of rs <dig> on gene expression of fdft <dig>  and an effect of rs <dig> on pccb.
we sought replication for novel crp associations in an independent sample of  <dig>  genotyped individuals, and performed in silico replication of novel lipid variants in  <dig>  individuals.
