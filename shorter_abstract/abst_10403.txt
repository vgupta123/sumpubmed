the prediction of such regions through computational immunology techniques is a challenging goal, which will ultimately lead to a drastic limitation of the experimental tests required to validate their efficiency.
the features are related to the type of amino acid, its conservation in homologous proteins, and its tendency of being exposed to the solvent, soluble, flexible, and disordered.
the highest signal is obtained from statistical amino acid preferences, but all  <dig> features contribute non-negligibly in the predictor.
sepia was applied to a test protein whose epitopes are known, human β <dig> adrenergic g-protein-coupled receptor, with promising results.
it is based on  <dig> sequence-based features, whose values in a 9-residue sequence window are compiled to predict the epitope/non-epitope state of the central residue.
sepia’s average prediction accuracy is limited, with an auc score  that reaches  <dig>  both in 10-fold cross-validation and on an independent test set.
although the actual auc score is rather low, many of the predicted epitopes cluster together and overlap the experimental epitope region.
we developed sepia, a b-cell epitope predictor from the protein sequence, which is sufficiently fast to be applicable on a large scale.
the identification of immunogenic regions on the surface of antigens, which are able to be recognized by antibodies and to trigger an immune response, is a major challenge for the design of new and effective vaccines.
the originality of sepia lies in the combination of two classifiers, a naïve bayesian and a random forest classifier, through a voting algorithm that exploits the advantages of both.
