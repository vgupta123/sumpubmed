protein degradation by the ubiquitin system plays a crucial role in numerous cellular signaling pathways.
here, we report that the overexpression of these proteins, with exception of usp17n, leads to apoptosis, suggesting that the hyaluronan and rna binding motifs in these enzymes play an important role in regulating signal transduction involved in cell death.
while identifying putative ubiquitin specific protease  enzymes that contain a conserved asp  domain in humans,  <dig> usp <dig> subfamily members, highly homologous to dub- <dig>  have been found , from human chorionic villi.
amino acid sequence analysis revealed that they contain the highly conserved cys, his, and asp domains which are responsible for the deubiquitinating activity.
interestingly, the sequence analysis showed that these proteins, with exception of usp17n, contain the putative hyaluronan/rna binding motifs, and cetylpyridinium chloride -precipitation analysis confirmed the association between these proteins and intracellular hyaluronan and rna.
