a genetic linkage map of  <dig> markers was constructed and 92% of the markers’ orders in the genetic map were in accordance with the orders in chromosomes.

meanwhile, the bioinformatics simulation in  <dig> species showed that the bsaxi had the most widespread recognition sites, indicating that 2b-rad tags had a powerful application potentiality for high density genetic map.
firstly, it doesn’t include the samples pooling in library preparation as other reduced representation libraries.
a f <dig> population of rice  was genotyped to validate the new approach.
secondly, the information of 2b-rad tags, such as tags numbers and distributions, in most of species are unknown.
it could be adjusted by selecting different enzymes and adapters to fit for alternative uses including chromosomes assembly, qtl fine mapping and even natural population analysis.
for saving costs, we used non-phosphorylated adapters and indexed pcr primers.
a library approach comprising digestion, ligation, pooling, pcr and size selection were established.
on average,  <dig> high quality reads of each sample were obtained with high evenness.
however, there is still plenty of room for improvement for the existent 2b-rad approach.
the purposes of the research are to improve a new 2b-rad approach which possesses samples pooling, moreover to figure out the characteristic and application potentiality of 2b-rad tags by bioinformatics analysis.
the method was a simple, fast, cost-effective and multiplex sequencing library approach.
