retrotransposons have been suggested to provide a substrate for non-allelic homologous recombination  and thereby promote gene family expansion.
using dot plot analysis, we found that the most recent duplication in the abp region of the mouse genome is flanked by l1md_t elements.
by contrast, the proportion of shared vs. lineage-specific ervii repeats in the abp region resembles the rest of the genome.
high densities of l <dig> and ervii repeats were found in the abp gene region with abrupt transitions at the region boundaries, suggesting that their higher densities are tightly associated with abp gene duplication.
l <dig> and ervii retrotransposons are considerably denser in the abp regions than in one mb flanking regions, while other repeat types are depleted in the abp regions compared to flanking regions.
we observed that the major accumulation of l <dig> elements occurred after the split of the mouse and rat lineages and that there is a striking overlap between the timing of l <dig> accumulation and expansion of the abp gene family in the mouse genome.
we confirmed the role of l <dig> repeats in abp gene duplication with the identification of recombinant l1md_t elements at the edges of the most recent mouse abp gene duplication.
l <dig> retrotransposons preferentially accumulated in the abp gene regions after lineage separation and roughly followed the pattern of abp gene expansion.
here we ask whether retrotransposons contributed to the recent expansions of the androgen-binding protein  gene families that occurred independently in the mouse and rat genomes.
establishing a link between the accumulation of l <dig> elements and the expansion of the abp gene family and identification of an nahr-related breakpoint in the most recent duplication are the main contributions of our study.
