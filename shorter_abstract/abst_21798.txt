the normalization factor that showed the least age dependence was total nmr intensity, which was consistent with uplc/ms data.
the data normalization factor was shown to have a great impact on the statistical and quantitative results indicating the need to carefully consider how to best normalize the data within a particular study and when comparing different studies.
the greater the normalization factor was related to age, the greater the separation between age groups was observed in subsequent pca analyses.
normalization by total intensity attempts to make corrections due to dietary and water intake of the individual animal, which is especially useful in metabonomics evaluations of urine.
each normalization method resulted in altered relative positions of significant pca loadings for each sample spectra but it did not alter which chemical shifts had the highest loadings.
the effects of data normalization procedures on principal component analysis  and quantitative analysis of nmr-based metabonomics data were investigated.
this study compared four different normalization methods for the nmr-based metabonomics spectra from an age-related study.
it was shown that each method of normalization has a great effect on both the statistical and quantitative analyses.
additionally, the effects of age on the metabolic profiles were examined by both nmr and uplc/ms analyses.
additionally, metabonomics evaluations of age-related effects showed decreased concentrations of many krebs cycle intermediates along with increased levels of oxidized antioxidants in urine of older rats, which is consistent with current theories on aging and its association with diminishing mitochondrial function and increasing levels of reactive oxygen species.
nmr indicated many metabolites associated with the krebs cycle decrease while citrate and 2-oxoglutarate, also associated with the krebs cycle, increase in older rats.
