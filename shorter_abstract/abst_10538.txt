peculiarly a cluster of np precursors with tandem nps was detected in b. multicinctus.
in total,  <dig> valid expressed sequences tags  for b. multicinctus and  <dig> ests for n. atra were generated.
the data also revealed that tandem duplications contributed the most to the expansion of toxin multigene families.
to unveil their detailed venoms and their evolutionary patterns, we constructed venom gland cdna libraries and genomic bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries for bungarus multicinctus and naja atra, respectively.
based on the toxin ests and 3ftx gene sequences, the major components of b. multicinctus venom transcriptome are neurotoxins, including long chain alpha neurotoxins  and the recently originated β bungarotoxin, whereas the n. atra venom transcriptome mainly contains 3ftxs with cytotoxicity and neurotoxicity .
analysis of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratios  indicates that not only multigene toxin families but also other less abundant toxins might have been under rapid diversifying evolution.
we sequenced about  <dig> cdna clones for each of the venom cdna libraries and screened bac libraries of the two snakes by blot analysis using four kinds of toxin probes; i.e., three-finger toxin , phospholipase a <dig> , kunitz-type protease inhibitor , and natriuretic peptide .
3ftx  and β bungarotoxin  comprise the main toxin classes in b. multicinctus, while 3ftx  is the dominant toxin in n. atra.
a total of  <dig> positive toxin bac clones in b. multicinctus and n. atra were identified using four kinds of toxin probes , among which  <dig> 3ftx-postive bacs were sequenced to reveal gene structures of 3ftx toxin genes.
we also observed several less abundant venom families in b. multicinctus and n. atra, such as pla <dig>  c-type lectins, and kunitz.
