a. siro produced a high level of alpha-amylase activity attributed to aca s  <dig>  this enzyme was purified and identified by protein sequencing and lc-ms/ms analysis.
enzymatic allergens of storage mites that contaminate stored food products are poorly characterized.
we present the first protein-level characterization of a group  <dig> allergen from storage mites.

due to its high production and ige reactivity, aca s  <dig> is potentially relevant to allergic hypersensitivity.
aca s  <dig> showed a distinct inhibition pattern and an unusual alpha-amylolytic activity with low sensitivity to activation by chloride ions.
we describe biochemical and immunological properties of the native alpha-amylase allergen aca s  <dig> from acarus siro, a medically important storage mite.
