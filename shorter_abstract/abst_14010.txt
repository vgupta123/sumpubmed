the effects were validated in an embryonic kidney cell line  and in hlrcc-patient derived cells  via both genetic and pharmacological inhibition.
here, we perform a high-throughput rnai screen to identify synthetic lethal genes with fumarate hydratase , a metabolic tumor suppressor whose loss-of-function has been associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma .
furthermore, we identified an enrichment of synthetic lethality with adenylate cyclases.
the reliance on adenylate cyclases in fh-deficient cells is consistent with increased cyclic-amp levels, which may act to regulate cellular energy metabolism.
the identified synthetic lethality of fh with adenylate cyclases suggests a new potential target for treating hlrcc patients.
high-throughput rnai-based screens have been successfully used to identify synthetic lethal pathways with well-characterized tumor suppressors and oncogenes.
the recent identification of metabolic tumor suppressors suggests that the concept of synthetic lethality can be applied to selectively target cancer metabolism as well.
synthetic lethality is an appealing technique for selectively targeting cancer cells which have acquired molecular changes that distinguish them from normal cells.
our unbiased screen identified synthetic lethality between fh and several genes in heme metabolism, in accordance with recent findings.
