these common genes mainly consisted of both udp glucuronosyltransferase and interferon alpha families, implying the connection between sds and the evolution of these gene families.
segmental duplications  commonly exist in plant and animal genomes, playing crucial roles in genomic rearrangement, gene innovation and the formation of copy number variants.

accordingly we identified sds for each species with the length of from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, and  <dig> to  <dig>  genes were harboured within the sd regions across different species.
we also found the existence of  <dig> common genes within sd regions in all studied species except goat.
aiming at characterizing sds across the genomes of diverse livestock species, we mapped genome-wide sds of horse, rabbit, goat, sheep and chicken, and also enhanced the existing sd maps of cattle and pig genomes based on the most updated genome assemblies.
however, they have received little attention in most livestock species.
more interestingly, many of these sd-related genes were involved in the process of immunity and response to external stimuli.
