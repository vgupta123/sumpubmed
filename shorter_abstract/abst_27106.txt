poor health was the primary driver of does exiting the herd.
kid production traits analyzed across herd life were the total number of kids weaned and cumulative kid weight weaned to the 2-, 3-, and 5-year stayability endpoints.
most  doe exits were illness-related under the actual culling method.
reproductive failure represented 51% of doe exits under the alternative culling protocol.
survival curves were analyzed for  <dig> culling methods.
boer does had lower stayability rates  at each year endpoint for both culling protocols.
boer does had lower  total number of kids weaned and cumulative weight weaned through each stayability endpoint compared with kiko and spanish.
under the alternative protocol, over 50% of boer does failed to complete 2 years, whereas over 50% of kiko and spanish does successfully completed 4 years.
an alternative culling protocol removed doe records after the first failure to wean a kid.
boer does had greater survival declines  from  <dig> to 6 years of herd life compared with kiko and spanish under both culling protocols.
longevity is the amount of time breeding females stay active in a herd by avoiding death or culling because of illness or reproductive failure.
