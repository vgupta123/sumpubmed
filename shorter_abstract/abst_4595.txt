given that aric participants were older, we investigated an age effect; age was a significant modifier of the observed interaction.
to further understand this relationship, we evaluated the interaction in two additional large cohorts of african americans for a total of  <dig>  unrelated individuals from the howard university family study , the natural history of apol1-associated nephropathy study , and the atherosclerosis risk in communities study .
despite evidence of an association between variants at the apolipoprotein l <dig> gene  locus and a spectrum of related kidney diseases, underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown.
an earlier preliminary study published by our group showed that an apol <dig> variant  modified the association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  and estimated glomerular filtration rate  in african americans.

among individuals homozygous for the risk genotype, a strong inverse hdlc-egfr association was observed, with a positive association in others .
