the myeloid translocation gene  proteins are non-dna-binding transcriptional regulators capable of interacting with chromatin modifying proteins.
both wild type mtgs and chimeric aml1-mtg proteins display in vitro rna-binding properties, thus opening new perspectives on the possible involvement of an rna component in mtg-mediated chromatin regulation.
the aml1-mtg fusion proteins, as the wild type mtgs, display four conserved homology regions  related to the drosophila nervy protein.
evidence has been accumulating that rna plays a role in transcriptional control.
the rna-binding properties can be traced to two regions: the zinc finger domains in the nhr <dig>  which mediate zinc-dependent rna binding, and a novel short basic region  upstream of the nhr <dig>  which mediates zinc-independent rna binding.
by using an rna-binding assay based on synthetic rna homopolymers and a panel of mtg deletion mutants, here we show that all the mtg proteins can bind rna.
as a consequence of leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations, two of the mtg proteins, mtg <dig> and mtg <dig>  are fused to the dna-binding domain of aml <dig>  a transcriptional activator crucial for hematopoiesis.
structural protein analyses led us to test the hypothesis that specific mtg domains may mediate rna binding.
