oxidative stress status in plasma was compared between pulmonary tb  patients and those with latent m. tuberculosis infection  or healthy uninfected individuals.
the capacity of nac to control m. tuberculosis infection was further tested in vivo in a mouse  model.
nac exhibits potent anti-mycobacterial effects and may limit m. tuberculosis infection and disease both through suppression of the host oxidative response and through direct antimicrobial activity.
short-term nac treatment of m. tuberculosis infected mice in vivo resulted in a significant reduction of mycobacterial loads in the lungs.
mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is thought to induce oxidative stress.
ptb patients exhibited elevated levels of oxidation products and a reduction of anti-oxidants compared with ltbi cases or uninfected controls.
m. tuberculosis, m. avium and m. bovis bcg cultures were also exposed to different doses of nac with or without medium ph adjustment to control for acidity.
importantly, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in metabolic activity and in vitro growth of nac treated m. tuberculosis, m. avium and m. bovis bcg.
nac treatment in m. tuberculosis-infected human macrophages resulted in a decrease of oxidative stress and cell death evoked by mycobacteria.
lipid peroxidation, dna oxidation and cell death, as well as accumulation of reactive oxygen species  were measured in cultures of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages infected with m. tuberculosis and treated or not with nac.

the anti-mycobacterial effect of nac was assessed in m. tuberculosis infected human thp- <dig> cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice lacking a fully functional nadph oxidase system.
furthermore, anti-mycobacterial activity in infected macrophages was shown to be independent of the effects of nac on the host nadph oxidase system in vitro.
