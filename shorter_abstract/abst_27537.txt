application of this 3-step culture protocol consistently produced more than  <dig> log <dig> cfu/ml of viable cells in the middle part of the logarithmic phase of their growth curve.
a controlled inoculum size grown in  <dig> successive steps in supplemented agar and broth under 5% co <dig> atmosphere, with ph adjustment and specific incubation times, allowed production of great numbers of prsp without untimely activation of autolysis mechanisms.
we developed a simple and reproducible method for culture of diverse strains of prsp representing several invasive serotypes of clinical and epidemiological importance in colombia.
streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly penicillin-resistant strains , constitute one of the most important causes of serious infections worldwide.
