programs like blast or the orthology search engine inparanoid can be used to find orthologs when the similarity between two sequences is sufficiently high.
based on relaxed sequence similarity searches, morfeus selects sequences based on the similarity of their alignments to the query, tests for orthology by iterative reciprocal blast searches and calculates a network score for the resulting network of orthologs that is a measure of orthology independent of the e-value.
based on our results, we conclude that morfeus is a powerful and specific search method for detecting remotely conserved orthologs.
searching the orthologs of a given protein or dna sequence is one of the most important and most commonly used bioinformatics methods in biology.
