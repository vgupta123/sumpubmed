further studies of these signature molecules may eventually allow us to develop more sophisticated protocols for pharmaceutical interventions.
lines of evidence revealed in this study not only support previous hypotheses, primarily based on studies of animal models and other types of arterial disease, that inflammatory responses may influence the development of pad, but also permit the recognition of a wide spectrum of immune/inflammatory genes that can serve as signatures for disease progression in pad.
through literature mining and pathway analysis using different databases such as gene ontology , and the kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genomics , genes involved in immune/inflammatory responses were significantly enriched in up-regulated genes at different stages of pad, revealing a significant correlation between immune/inflammatory responses and disease progression.
in these differentially regulated genes, immune/inflammatory genes were significantly up-regulated in different stages of pad, .
peripheral arterial disease , a major manifestation of atherosclerosis, is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity, limb loss and death.
after histological classification, a total of  <dig> femoral artery samples, including  <dig> intermediate lesions,  <dig> advanced lesions and  <dig> normal femoral arteries, were profiled using affymetrix microarray platform.
under a stringent cutoff, i.e., a false discovery rate  < <dig> %, we found  <dig> genes were differentially regulated in intermediate lesions and  <dig> in advanced lesions.
moreover, immune-related pathways such as toll-like receptor signaling and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity were particularly enriched in intermediate and advanced lesions , highlighting their pathogenic significance during disease progression.
genome-wide gene expression profiling of clinical samples may represent an effective approach to gain relevant information.
