in this study, a new genotypic method to detect clarithromycin resistance in clinical samples, based on fluorescent in situ hybridization  using a set of peptide nucleic acid probes , is proposed.
the set of probes targeting the point mutations responsible for clarithromycin resistance was applied to h. pylori suspensions and showed 100% sensitivity and specificity .
the optimized pna-fish based diagnostic method to detect h. pylori clarithromycin resistance shown to be a very sensitive and specific method for the detection of clarithromycin resistance in the h. pylori smears and also proved to be a reliable method for the diagnosis of this pathogen in clinical samples and an alternative to existing plating methods.
this method can also be amenable for application to gastric biopsy samples, as resistance to clarithromycin was also detected when histological slides were tested.
triple therapy is the gold standard treatment for helicobacter pylori eradication from the human stomach, but increased resistance to clarithromycin became the main factor of treatment failure.
