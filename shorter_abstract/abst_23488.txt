a phylogenetic tree of concatenated well-defined core genes supported divergence of the east asian lineage  from the european lineage ancestor, and then from the amerind lineage ancestor.
positively selected amino acid changes between hspeasia and hpeurope were mapped to products of caga, vaca, homc , sotb , and a translation fidelity factor .
the east asian strains appear to differ greatly from the european strains in electron transfer and redox reactions.
these results demonstrate dramatic genome evolution within a species, especially in likely host interaction genes.
the results define h. pylori east asian lineages and provide essential information for understanding their pathogenesis and designing drugs and therapies that target them.
phylogenetic analysis revealed greater divergence between the east asian  and the european  genomes in proteins in host interaction, specifically virulence factors , outer membrane proteins, and lipopolysaccharide synthesis  enzymes.
the genome of helicobacter pylori, an oncogenic bacterium in the human stomach, rapidly evolves and shows wide geographical divergence.
we used newly developed comparative methods to follow the evolution of east asian h. pylori genomes using  <dig> complete genome sequences from japanese, korean, amerind, european, and west african strains.
these findings also suggest a model of adaptive evolution through proteome diversification and selection through modulation of translational fidelity.
divergence was also seen in proteins in electron transfer and translation fidelity , a dna recombinase/exonuclease that recognizes genome identity , and dna/rna hybrid nucleases .
two pathways linking acetyl~coa and acetate appeared intact in some japanese strains.
the high incidence of stomach cancer in east asia might be related to bacterial genotype.
phylogenetic profiling revealed a large difference in the repertoire of outer membrane proteins  through gene loss, gain, and mutation.
