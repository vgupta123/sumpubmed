we study whether post-processing metagenomic assemblies with the original input long reads can result in quality improvement.
bigmac demonstrates the effectiveness of the post-processing approach in improving the quality of metagenomic assemblies.
the problem of de-novo assembly for metagenomes using only long reads is gaining attention.
our experiments on metagenomes assembled from long reads show that bigmac can improve assembly quality by reducing the number of mis-assemblies while maintaining or increasing n <dig> and n <dig>  moreover, bigmac shows the largest n <dig> to number of mis-assemblies ratio on all tested datasets when compared to other post-processing tools.
using both the assembled contigs and original long reads as input, bigmac first breaks the contigs at potentially mis-assembled locations and subsequently scaffolds contigs.
