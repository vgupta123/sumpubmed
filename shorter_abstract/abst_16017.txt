additionally, our method suggests candidate genes for mammalian seizures based only on bacterial phenotypes and gene orthology.
such “orthologous phenotypes,” or “phenologs,” are examples of deep homology, and may be used to predict additional candidate disease genes.
we also explore the prediction of plant gene–phenotype associations, as for the arabidopsis response to vernalization phenotype.
finally, we offer testable candidates for a variety of human diseases, plant traits, and other classes of phenotypes across a wide array of species.
we also improve upon the original method by extending the theory to paralogous phenotypes.
we suggest gene candidates for pharmacologically-induced seizures in mouse, solely based on orthologous phenotypes from e. coli.
we demonstrate that phenotype information may come from diverse sources, including drug sensitivities, gene ontology biological processes, and in situ hybridization annotations.
our algorithm makes use of additional phenotype data — from chicken, zebrafish, and e. coli, as well as new datasets for c. elegans — establishing that several types of annotations may be treated as phenotypes.
