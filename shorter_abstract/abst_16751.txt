soybean  is one of the most important oil crops in the world.
these results provide a comprehensive molecular biology background for research on soybean seed development, particularly with respect to the process of oil accumulation.
here, we evaluated changes in gene expression over the course of seed development using illumina  rna-sequencing.
of these,  <dig> showed significant changes in expression levels  during seed development.
gene ontology analyses detected  <dig> co-expressed unigenes associated with lipid biosynthesis.
pathway analysis revealed  <dig> co-expressed transcripts involved in lipid biosynthesis and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways.
the results were consistent with those obtained from solexa sequencing.
however, it is still uncertain how many genes and which genes are involved in lipid biosynthesis.
all of the genes identified in our research have significance for breeding soybeans with increased oil contents.
