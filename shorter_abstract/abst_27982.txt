we introduce pan-tetris, a java based interactive software tool that provides a clearly structured and suitable way for the visual inspection of gene occurrences in a pan-genome table.
we demonstrate an application of pan-tetris to the pan-genome of staphylococcus aureus.
also alignment-based approaches which take the gene neighbourhood into account often need additional manual curation of the results.
they offer a framework to assess the genomic diversity of a given collection of individual genomes and moreover they help to consolidate gene predictions and annotations.
this is quite time consuming and so far there is no visualisation tool available that offers an interactive gui for the pan-genome to support curating pan-genomic computations or annotations of orthologous genes.
