blockade of nmda by mk <dig> lends support to the potential importance of nmda antagonists as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.
in fact  <dig> hours after injury, the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury , infiltration of neutrophils, nf-Îºb activation, inos, cytokines levels , neurotrophin expression were markedly reduced by mk <dig> treatment.
the spinal cord trauma was induced by the application of vascular clips to the dura via a four-level t5-t <dig> laminectomy.
glutamergic excitotoxicity has been shown to play a deleterious role in the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury .
spinal cord injury in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis.
the aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of dizocilpine maleate, mk <dig>  in a mice model of sci.
