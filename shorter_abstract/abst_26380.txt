here we specifically focus on two ecotypes of the alpine leaf beetle oreina speciosissima , which have been shown to exhibit morphological differences in male genitalia roughly corresponding to the subspecies oreina speciosissima sensu stricto and oreina speciosissima troglodytes.
through use of gene sequencing and genome fingerprinting  we analyzed the genetic structure and habitat use of oreina speciosissima populations from the swiss alps to examine whether the two ecotypes have a genetic basis.
while little phylogenetic resolution was observed based on the sequencing of four dna regions, the topology and clustering resulting from aflp genotyping grouped specimens according to their habitat, mostly defined by plant associations.
the prominent role of leaf beetles in the insect world, their omnipresence across all terrestrial biomes and their economic importance as common agricultural pest organisms make this family particularly interesting for studying the mechanisms that drive diversification.
both host plants and leaf beetles have a patchy geographical distribution.
these results were discussed in an ecological speciation framework.
a few specimens with intermediate morphologies clustered with one of the two ecotypes or formed separate clusters consistent with habitat differences.
in general the two ecotypes segregate along an elevation gradient and by host plants: oreina speciosissima sensu stricto colonizes high forb vegetation at low altitude and oreina speciosissima troglodytes is found in stone run vegetation at higher elevations.
