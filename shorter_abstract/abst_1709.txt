approximately  <dig> target genes potentially regulated by mtra, including the isoniazid inducible gene inib, were further characterized from m. tuberculosis and m. smegmatis genomes.
in such environments, mtrab has been reported to regulate the expression of the m. tuberculosis replication initiator gene, dnaa.
these findings yield critical information about the regulatory mechanisms of the mtrab two-component system and its role in the drug resistance of m. smegmatis.
in this study, a  <dig> bp sequence motif in the dnaa promoter region was identified for mtra binding using dnasei footprinting assays and surface plasmon resonance  analysis.
the two-component systems of mycobacterium tuberculosis are apparently required for its growth and resistance in hostile host environments.
however, the dnaa promoter binding sites and many potential target genes for mtra have yet to be precisely characterized.
when assayed using quantitative real-time pcr , many of the target genes demonstrated significant expression changes when the antisense mrna of the mtra gene was expressed in m. smegmatis.
