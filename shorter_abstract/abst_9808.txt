furthermore, the expression of atpnp-a was determined to be significantly correlated with the sar annotated transcription factor, wrky  <dig>  and the promoters of atpnp-a and the correlated genes contain an enrichment in the core wrky binding w-box cis-elements.
transcription of these genes is strongly induced in response to salicylic acid  and its functional synthetic analogue benzothiadiazole s-methylester , a number of biotic and abiotic stresses including many sa-mediated sar-inducing conditions, as well as in the constitutive sar expressing mutants cpr <dig> and mpk <dig> which have elevated sa levels.
atpnp-a shares many characteristics with pr proteins in that its transcription is strongly induced in response to pathogen challenges, it contains an n-terminal signalling peptide and is secreted into the extracellular space and along with pr- <dig>  pr- <dig> and pr- <dig> proteins it has been isolated from the arabidopsis apoplast.
based on these findings we suggest that atpnp-a could be classified as a newly identified pr protein.
the co-expression analyses, both in wild type and mutants, provides compelling evidence that suggests atpnp-a may function as a component of plant defence responses and sar in particular.
while several physiological responses to pnps have been reported, their biological role has remained elusive.
here we use a combination of expression correlation analysis, meta-analysis of gene expression profiles in response to specific stimuli and in selected mutants, and promoter content analysis to infer the biological role of the arabidopsis thaliana pnp, atpnp-a.
in constitutively expressing wrky  <dig> lines the expression of atpnp-a and the correlated genes, including the sar marker genes, pr- <dig> and pr- <dig>  were determined to be strongly induced.
