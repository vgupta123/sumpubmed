the data include time course gene expression profiles, genome-wide location analysis data, binding sequence data, and gene ontology  information.
this paper introduces a computational framework for utilizing data from multiple sources to infer tf-target gene relationships on the basis of nms.
the proposed computational framework was tested using gene expression data associated with cell cycle progression in yeast.
the major contribution of this study is the development of a computational framework to assist the inference of trn by integrating heterogeneous data from multiple sources and by decomposing a trn into nm-based modules.
the identified relationships between tfs and gene clusters were evaluated using the following biological validation and statistical analyses:  gene set enrichment analysis  to evaluate the clustering results;  leave-one-out cross-validation  to ensure that the svm classifiers assign tfs to nm categories with high confidence;  binding site enrichment analysis  to determine enrichment of the gene clusters for the cognate binding sites of their predicted tfs;  comparison with previously reported results in the literatures to confirm the inferred regulations.
the relationships between tfs and potential target gene clusters were examined by training recurrent neural networks whose topologies mimic the nms to which the tfs are classified.
the potential downstream target genes for the tfs were clustered into  <dig> biologically significant groups.
decomposing the trn into a small set of recurring regulatory patterns, called network motifs , facilitates the inference.
the proposed framework is useful for inferring small nm-based modules of tf-target gene relationships that can serve as a basis for generating new testable hypotheses.
