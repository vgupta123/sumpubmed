transforming growth factor-β <dig>  plays a key role in mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition  during peritoneal dialysis .
however, the role of akt in mmt transformation in pd is not clear.
these changes were reversed with the treatment of a pi3k/akt inhibitor ly <dig> in vivo or in cells transfected with akt dominant-negative  plasmids in vitro.
it was associated with thickening of the peritoneum and up-regulation of tgf-β <dig>  upregulation of pakt paralleled with the increased expression of smad ubiquitination regulatory factor  <dig> , vimentin and fibronectin , and decreased expression of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog  <dig>  and zonula occludens protein  <dig> in mice undergoing pd treatment and in tgf-β <dig> induced human peritoneal mesothelial cells .
these data implied that akt mediated mmt in pd via smurf <dig> modulation/and or smad <dig> degradation while conceivably maintaining the tβri stability, most likely by the usp <dig>
