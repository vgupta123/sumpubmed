gh146-glial cells originate in the brain and migrate to the antenna along the newly formed olfactory axons.
these glia wrap around the developing olfactory axons early during development and pattern the three distinct fascicles as they exit the antenna.
in this work, we have investigated whether similar types of cells exist in the drosophila antenna.
we have used different p lines to drive green fluorescent protein  in distinct populations of cells within the drosophila antenna.
we have demonstrated the presence of at least two distinct populations of glial cells within the drosophila antenna.
in the moth manduca sexta, an additional set of central glia migrate to the base of the antennal nerve where axons sort to their glomerular targets.
in the adult, processes of gh146-glial cells ensheath the olfactory receptor neurons directly, while those of the mz317-glia form a peripheral layer.
in the drosophila olfactory system, peripheral glial cells arise from sensory lineages specified by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, atonal.
an additional ~ <dig> glial cells detected by gh146::gfp do not derive from any of the sensory lineages and appear to migrate into the antenna from the brain.
mz317::gfp, a marker for cell body and perineural glia, labels the majority of peripheral glia.
their appearance in the third antennal segment is regulated by normal function of the epidermal growth factor receptor and small gtpases.
