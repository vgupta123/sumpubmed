by identifying configurations of gene-cut pairs, where cut expression originates from the gene 5’ or 3′ nucleosome free region, we observed distinct gene expression trends specific to these configurations which were most prevalent in the presence of conserved cut expression.
cryptic unstable transcripts  are a largely unexplored class of nuclear exosome degraded, non-coding rnas in budding yeast.
utilizing a four-way genomic alignment we identified a large population of cuts with conserved syntenic expression across all four strains.

our rna-seq based method has greatly expanded upon previous cut annotations in s.cerevisiae underscoring the extensive and pervasive nature of unstable transcription.
we sequenced the wt and rrp6Δ transcriptomes of three s.cerevisiae strains: s288c, Σ1278b, jay <dig> and the s.paradoxus strain n <dig> and utilized a hidden markov model to annotate cuts in these four strains.
divergent pairs correlate with higher expression of genes, and convergent pairs correlate with reduced gene expression.
furthermore we provide the first assessment of conserved cut expression in yeast and globally demonstrate possible modes of cut-based regulation of gene expression.
