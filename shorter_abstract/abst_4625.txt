however, the distribution of p-biases differs significantly from what is expected by chance that, along with the high mean connectivity, is found to cause the core grn of s. cerevisiae's to have an overall sensitivity similar to critical boolean networks.
in agreement, we find that the amount of information propagated between nodes in finite time series is much higher in the inferred core grn of s. cerevisiae than what is expected by chance.
we suggest that s. cerevisiae is likely to have evolved a core grn with enhanced information propagation among its genes.
we find that this core network has a generalized clustering coefficient that is much higher than chance.
