therefore, the present study aimed to determine the expression stability of ten commonly used reference genes ; tbp, tata box binding protein; ywhaz, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide) in the rat hippocampus four, seven and twenty-one days after cardiac arrest.
expression stability of candidate reference genes was analyzed using genorm and normfinder software tools.
cardiac arrest, and the associated arrest of blood circulation, immediately leads to permanent brain damage because of the exhaustion of oxygen, glucose and energy resources in the brain.
cypa is most favorable if restriction to a single reference gene for all time points is required.
however, proper validation of the applied normalization strategy is a crucial prerequisite for reliable conclusions.
b2m turned out to be the most variable candidate reference gene, being about 2-fold upregulated in the cardiac arrest treatment groups.
for normalization purposes in gene profiling studies a combination of cypa and pgk <dig> should be considered  <dig> and  <dig> days post injury, whereas cypa and gapdh is the best combination at  <dig> days.
the microglial marker mac- <dig>  used as a target gene to validate the experimental model, was found to be upregulated about 10- to 20-fold after cardiac arrest.
cypa and pgk <dig> were identified by genorm as the two most stable genes  <dig> and  <dig> days after asphyxial cardiac arrest, cypa and gapdh at  <dig> days post treatment.
we have validated endogenous control genes for qrt-pcr analysis of gene expression in rat hippocampus after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.
moreover, experimental groups treated with the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic drug minocycline have been included in the study as well.
