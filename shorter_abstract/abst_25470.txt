thinning increased the source/sink ratio from  <dig>  to  <dig>  m <dig> leaf area per kg of berries and boosted the sugar and anthocyanin content at harvest.
this included the enhanced modulation of genes that are normally regulated during berry development and the induction of a large set of genes that are not usually expressed.
cluster thinning is an agronomic practice in which a proportion of berry clusters are removed from the vine to increase the source/sink ratio and improve the quality of the remaining berries.
cluster thinning has a profound effect on several important cellular processes and metabolic pathways including carbohydrate metabolism and the synthesis and transport of secondary products.
the integrated agronomic, biochemical and transcriptomic data revealed that the positive impact of cluster thinning on final berry composition reflects a much more complex outcome than simply enhancing the normal ripening process.
