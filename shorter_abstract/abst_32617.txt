we propose a new algorithm to infer combinatorial control networks from gene-expression data.
transcriptional gene regulation is one of the most important mechanisms in controlling many essential cellular processes, including cell development, cell-cycle control, and the cellular response to variations in environmental conditions.
moreover, new cases of combinatorial control are predicted, showing how simple models taking this phenomenon into account can lead to informative predictions and allow to extract more putative regulatory interactions from microarray databases.
the algorithm we designed is able to recover biologically meaningful interactions, as shown by recent experimental results  <cit> .
genes are regulated by transcription factors and other genes/proteins via a complex interconnection network.
