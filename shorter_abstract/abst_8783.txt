though various computational methods for predicting ppi have been developed, their robustness for prediction with external datasets is unknown.
the prediction accuracies for various external datasets ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, which are superior to those achieved with previous methods.
deep-learning algorithms have achieved successful results in diverse areas, but their effectiveness for ppi prediction has not been tested.
we used a stacked autoencoder, a type of deep-learning algorithm, to study the sequence-based ppi prediction.
to our knowledge, this research is the first to apply a deep-learning algorithm to sequence-based ppi prediction, and the results demonstrate its potential in this field.
protein-protein interactions  are critical for many biological processes.
the best model achieved an average accuracy of  <dig> % with 10-fold cross-validation.
