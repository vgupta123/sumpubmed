sexual selection is one important explanation for assortment, suggesting that i) one  or both sexes could show preferences for mates of similar size or ii) mutual mate choice could resolve sexual conflict over quality traits into assortment.
these results suggest that the underlying mechanism of assortment in p. taeniatus is mutual mate choice resolving the sexual conflict over mates, rather than preference for mates of similar size.
however, when potential mates were able to interact and assess each other mutually they showed size-assortative mating patterns, i.e.
assortative mating patterns for mate quality traits like body size are often observed in nature.
in mate choice experiments, both sexes preferred large mates irrespective of own body size suggesting mating preferences are not size-assortative.
especially males were highly selective for large females, probably because female body size signals direct fitness benefits.
due to variation in body size, general preferences for large mating partners result in a sexual conflict: small, lower quality individuals who prefer themselves large partners are unacceptable for larger individuals.
relative size mismatches between mates translate into a lower likelihood to mate, suggesting that the threshold to accept mates depends on own body size.
we tested these hypotheses experimentally in the socially monogamous cichlid fish pelvicachromis taeniatus, in which mate choice is mutual.
