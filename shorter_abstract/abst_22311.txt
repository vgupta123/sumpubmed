mrna transcriptome profiling of myogenic cells after cholesterol depletion revealed alterations in transcripts involved in the regulation of apoptosis, focal adhesion, phagosome, tight junction, cell cycle, lysosome, adherens junctions, gap junctions, p <dig> signaling pathway, endocytosis, autophagy and actin cytoskeleton.
this is the first study on the effects of membrane cholesterol depletion in mrna expression in myogenic cells.
our data shows that alterations in the availability of plasma membrane cholesterol lead to transcriptional changes in myogenic cells.
lim domain only protein  <dig> mrna was found to be the highest up-regulated feature after cholesterol depletion.
in this study we used methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin  to extract cholesterol from the membrane of chick skeletal muscle cells grown in culture.
the knowledge of the genes involved in the cellular response to cholesterol depletion could contribute to our understanding of skeletal muscle differentiation.
myoblasts undergo major changes in their plasma membrane during the initial steps of skeletal muscle differentiation, including major alterations in the distribution of cholesterol.
