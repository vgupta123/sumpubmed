using the calibration provided by the isolation of balearic islands, we calculated that the initial radiation of caprines can be dated at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya.
myotragus balearicus was an endemic bovid from the balearic islands  that became extinct around  <dig> - <dig>  years ago.
we have retrieved the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene , plus fragments of the mitochondrial 12s gene and the nuclear 28s rdna multi-copy gene from a well preserved myotragus subfossil bone.
the best resolved phylogenetic trees, obtained with the cytochrome b gene, placed myotragus in a position basal to the ovis group.
in addition, alpine and southern chamois, considered until recently the same species, split around  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, indicating that the two chamois species have been separated much longer than previously thought.
