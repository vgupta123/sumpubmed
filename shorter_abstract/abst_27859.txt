we analyzed the mcfa content in saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in various conditions.
developing yeasts for massive oil production requires increasing yield and modifying the profiles of the fatty acids contained in the oil to satisfy specific technical requirements.
for example, derivatives of medium-chain fatty acids  are used for the production of biodiesels, cleaning products, lubricants and cosmetics.
furthermore, we revealed that yeast lipid biodiversity has not been fully explored, but that yeasts likely harbor as-yet-undiscovered strains or enzymes that can contribute to the production of high-value fatty acids for green chemistry.

we demonstrated that yeasts are amenable to genetic and metabolic engineering to increase their mcfa production.
the results revealed that mcfas preferentially accumulated when cells were grown on synthetic media with a high c/n ratio at low temperature .
upon screening deletion mutant strains for genes encoding lipid droplet-associated proteins, we found two genes, loa <dig> and tgl <dig>  involved in mcfa homeostasis.
over the past few decades, these yeasts have also been studied in the interest of their potential to produce oil to replace fossil resources.
a phylogenetic analysis on  <dig> saccharomycotina species showed that fatty acid profiles differed drastically among yeasts.
