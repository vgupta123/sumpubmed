we then developed a drug prioritization algorithm to reposition drugs from ra-related diseases to treat ra.
when compared to a study that used gwas data to directly connect ra-associated genes to drug targets , our algorithm  achieved a comparable overall performance, but complementary precision and recall in retrospective validation .
we first constructed a genetic disease network using disease genetics data from genome-wide association studies .
the unknown cause of the disease represents a significant challenge in the drug development.
ra affects up to  <dig> % of the population worldwide.
our approach performed significantly better in novel predictions when evaluated using  <dig> not-yet-fda-approved ra drugs .
currently, there are no drugs that can cure ra or achieve sustained remission.
our algorithm found  <dig> of the  <dig> fda-approved ra drugs and ranked them highly , demonstrating the validity of our strategy.
rheumatoid arthritis  is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of synovial joints.
in this study, we address this challenge by proposing an alternative drug discovery approach that integrates and reasons over genetic interrelationships between ra and other genetic diseases as well as a large amount of higher-level drug treatment data.
we developed a network-based ranking algorithm to prioritize diseases genetically-related to ra .
in summary, although the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms remain uncharacterized, our proposed computation-based drug discovery approach to analyzing genetic and treatment interrelationships among thousands of diseases and drugs can facilitate the discovery of innovative drugs for treating ra.
