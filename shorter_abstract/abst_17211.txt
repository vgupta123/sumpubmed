there was a significant response by hp to c. pseudotuberculosis infection and pld challenge.
this study was conducted to investigate the response of acute phase proteins, mainly haptoglobin , serum amyloid a  and the negative acute phase response, especially albumin after an experimental challenge of c. pseudotuberculosis and phospholipase d  in cross bred boer goats.

however, there is paucity of data about goat’s acute phase response during the course of cla.
there were no significant changes in saa concentration between challenged and control goats.
therefore, it concluded that c. pseudotuberculosis and pld can influence the level of acute phase proteins in goats.
serum hp concentration in goats challenged with c. pseudotuberculosis  showed a significant increase,  <dig> fold in males  and  <dig> fold in females  compared to the control .
challenge with pld  also showed significant increase,  <dig> fold in males and females  respectively compared to the control .
