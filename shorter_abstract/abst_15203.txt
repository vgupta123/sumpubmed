in this study, transcription of the three hmg-coa reductase genes  of the Î²-carotene producing mucor circinelloides has been analysed under various culturing conditions; effect of the elevation of their copy number on the carotenoid and ergosterol content as well as on the sensitivity to statins has also been examined.
overexpression of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> by elevating their copy numbers increased the carotenoid content of the fungus and decreased their sensitivity to statins.
overexpression of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> may be used to improve the carotenoid content.
the three hmg-coa reductase genes of m. circinelloides displayed different relative transcript levels under the tested conditions suggesting differences in their regulation.
one of the key enzyme of this pathway is the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa  reductase, which catalyses the conversion of hmg-coa to mevalonate.
transcripts of hmgr <dig> were detected only in the mycelium and its relative transcript level seems to be strongly controlled by the temperature and the oxygen level of the environment.
precursors of sterols, carotenoids, the prenyl groups of several proteins and other terpenoid compounds are synthesised via the acetate-mevalonate pathway.
they seem to be especially involved in the adaptation to the changing oxygen tension and osmotic conditions of the environment as well as to statin treatment.
hmg-coa reductase therefore affects many biological processes, such as morphogenesis, synthesis of different metabolites or adaptation to environmental changes.
