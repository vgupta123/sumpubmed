the aim of the present study was to analyse microarrays studying myogenesis in pigs.
the kegg database was searched for pathway information using this updated gene list.
the kegg database returned  <dig> pathways.
mammalian muscle formation has been previously studied using microarray technology in pigs because these animals are an interesting animal model for muscle formation due to selection for increased muscle mass.
pathways regulating myoblast proliferation and muscle fibre formation were described.
results indicated regulation of the expression of genes involved in proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, and energy metabolism.
these pathways were related to regulation of several steps in myogenesis and energy metabolism.
furthermore, two networks of pathways describing the formation of the myoblast cytoskeleton and regulation of the energy metabolism during myogenesis were presented.
combining microarray results and biological pathway information will add insight into biological processes.
pathway information is widely available in databases through the internet.
combining microarray results and pathways information available through the internet provide biological insight in how the process of porcine myogenesis is regulated.
synonyms of gene names were added to the list by searching the gene ontology database.
