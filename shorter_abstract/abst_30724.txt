functional interpretation of the sequences was carried out by gene ontology assignments from matches to arabidopsis and was shown to cover a broad range of go categories.
due to the large number of reads afforded by the  <dig> dna sequencing technology, it is effective in revealing the expression of transcripts from a broad range of go categories and contains many rare transcripts in normalized cdna libraries, although only a limited portion of their sequence is uncovered.
in this study, we addressed whether a single  <dig> life science gs <dig> sequencing run provides new gene discovery from a normalized cdna library, and whether the short reads produced via this technology are of value in gene structure annotation.
although short, the  <dig> reads are of sufficient length to map to a unique genome location as effectively as longer ests produced by conventional sequencing.
a single  <dig> gs <dig> sequencing run on adapter-ligated cdna, from a normalized cdna library, generated  <dig>  reads that were reduced to  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> nucleotides after cleaning.
within the previously unobserved medicago transcripts, thousands had matches in a comprehensive protein database and one or more of the tigr plant gene indices.
approximately 20% of these novel sequences could be found in the medicago genome sequence.
in parallel to  <dig> sequencing,  <dig>  5'-prime reads were generated by conventional sequencing using the same library and from the assembled sequences it was shown to contain about 52% full length cdnas encoding proteins from  <dig> to over  <dig> amino acids in length.
as with longer ests,  <dig> reads can be mapped uniquely onto genomic sequence to provide support for, and modifications of, gene predictions.
after clustering and assembly, a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were generated containing over  <dig> ssrs.
