comparative transcriptomics analyses with trapline result in a set of differentially expressed genes, their corresponding protein-protein interactions, splice variants, promoter activity, predicted mirna-target interactions and files for single nucleotide polymorphism  calling.
the obtained results are combined into a single file for downstream analysis such as network construction.
trapline supports ngs-based research by providing a workflow that requires no bioinformatics skills, decreases the processing time of the analysis and works in the cloud.
we demonstrate the value of the proposed pipeline by characterizing the transcriptome of our recently described stem cell derived antibiotic selected cardiac bodies .
