in addition, an unusual case of nucleotide polymorphism was discovered.
the tortula chloroplast genome is ~ <dig>  bp, and differs in a number of ways from that of physcomitrella patens, the first published moss chloroplast genome.
although the chloroplast genome of tortula ruralis differs from that of the only other sequenced moss, physcomitrella patens, we have yet to determine the biological significance of the differences.
in this paper, we present the chloroplast genome sequence of t. ruralis, only the second published chloroplast genome for a moss, and the first for a vegetatively desiccation-tolerant plant.
the polymorphisms we have uncovered in the sequencing of the genome offer a rare possibility  of the generation of dna markers for fine-level phylogenetic studies, or to investigate individual variation within populations.
tortula ruralis, a widely distributed species in the moss family pottiaceae, is increasingly used as a model organism for the study of desiccation tolerance and mechanisms of cellular repair.
also, the tortula chloroplast genome lacks petn, a gene found in all known land plant plastid genomes.
