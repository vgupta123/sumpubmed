recent studies have identified circulating hsp as an important mediator in inflammation - the effects of low-grade inflammation in the aging process are overwhelming.
the present data provide new evidence that serum concentration of hsp <dig> decreases with age in a normal population.
heat shock proteins  are ubiquitously synthesised in virtually all species and it is hypothesised that they might have beneficial health effects.
elderly patients presenting inflammation  showed significantly  higher hsp <dig> values; and hsp <dig> correlated positively  with il- <dig> and crp, but not with tnf-alpha or il- <dig>  a significant association was also noted between hsp <dig> levels and the degree of dependency and cognitive decline in geriatric patients.
our study also shows that higher levels of hsp <dig> are associated with inflammation and frailty in elderly patients.
serum hsp <dig>  interleukin  - <dig>  il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor  alpha concentrations were determined in  <dig> hospitalised geriatric patients  and in  <dig> community-dwelling control subjects .
