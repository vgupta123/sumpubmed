nv3dpol can be used as an rna replicase in in vitro rna + protein evolution with the rna of special terminal sequences.
the efficiency of the initiation of replication was dependent on the 3’-terminal structure of single-stranded rna template, and especially, nv3dpol preferred a self-priming small stem-loop.
characteristics of the enzyme nv3dpolin vitro were re-evaluated in this context.
based on these results, we present a scheme of the primer-independent isothermal amplification of rna with nv3dpolin vitro.
the isothermal amplification of rna in vitro has been used for the study of in vitro evolution of rna.
although qβ replicase has been traditionally used as an enzyme for this purpose, we planned to use norovirus replicase  due to its structural simplicity in the scope of in vitro autonomous evolution of the protein.

nv3dpol also showed a weak activity of elongation-reaction from a long primer.
in the non-self-priming and primer-independent replication reaction, the presence of -ccc residues at the 3’-terminus increased the initiation efficiency and we demonstrated the one-pot isothermal rna  amplification by 16-fold.
