we have previously used random mutagenesis and adaptive evolution to generate a mixture of strains of synechocystis sp.
the increased thermal tolerances of the isolated monoclonal strains were validated in larger bioreactors and their whole genomes sequenced.
we used a custom screening platform, based on 96-deepwell microplate culturing in an in house designed cultivation chamber integrated in a liquid handling robot for screening and selection; in addition we also used a more conventional system.
several of the identified mutations are found in various strains and  are likely to have occurred independently.
pcc6803's heat shock response, there is very limited published data concerning the specific genes involved in long term thermal tolerance.
comparison of the sequence information to the parental wild type identified various mutations responsible for the enhanced phenotypes.
the applied methods  were successfully applied to identify various mutations, some of which are very unlikely to have been identified by other approaches.
temperature tolerance is an important aspect for commercial scale outdoor cultivation of microalgae and cyanobacteria.
pcc <dig> with significantly increased thermal tolerance.
this, coupled with the relatively low number of affected genes underscores the significance of these specific mutations to convey thermal tolerance in synechocystis.
the genetic modifications leading to the phenotypes of the newly generated strains are the focus of this work.
while various genes are known to be related to synechocystis sp.
