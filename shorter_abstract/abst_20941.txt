here, we explore this link by comparing stable activity patterns from cortical slice networks recorded with multielectrode arrays to stable patterns produced by a model with a tunable weight distribution.
we find that when the model weight distribution is appropriately skewed, it correctly matches the distribution of repeating patterns observed in the data.
we conclude that local cortical networks are very likely to use a highly skewed weight distribution to optimize information retention, as predicted by theory.
the network must have mechanisms for preserving the overall weight distribution while allowing individual connection strengths to change with learning.
multineuron recordings have shown that sequences of neural activity distributed over many neurons are repeated above chance levels when animals perform well-learned tasks.
this model was previously shown to capture central features of the dynamics in these slice networks, including neuronal avalanche cascades.
the first of these, the "synaptic hypothesis," holds that information can be retained in synaptic connection strengths, or weights, between neurons.
fixed distributions impose constraints on learning, however.
recent work inspired by statistical mechanics has suggested that networks will retain the most information when their weights are distributed in a skewed manner, with many weak weights and only a few strong ones.
in addition, this same distribution of weights maximizes the capacity of the network model to retain stable activity patterns.
how living neural networks retain information is still incompletely understood.
although these two ideas are compelling, no one to our knowledge has yet linked the predicted optimum distribution of weights to stable activity patterns actually observed in living neural networks.
