we validate our methods on two proteomic datasets for the diagnosis of ovarian and prostate cancer.
recent development of mass spectrometry technology enabled the analysis of complex peptide mixtures.
it has been noted that they often lead to different biomarker lists and as a consequence, the patient classification may also vary.
the proposed methodology can improve the classification results and at the same time provide a unified biomarker list for further biological examinations and interpretation.
here we propose a new approach to the biomarker selection problem: to apply several competing feature ranking procedures and compute a consensus list of features based on their outcomes.
