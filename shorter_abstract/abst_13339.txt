our experiment results show that fasttagger is several times faster than existing multi-marker based tag snp selection algorithms, and it consumes much less memory at the same time.
generating multi-marker tagging rules is a computation intensive task, and it is the bottleneck of existing multi-marker based tag snp selection methods.
we propose an efficient algorithm called fasttagger to calculate multi-marker tagging rules and select tag snps based on multi-marker ld.
however, existing tag snp selection algorithms based on multi-marker ld are both time-consuming and memory-consuming.
algorithms based on the r <dig> ld statistic have gained popularity because r <dig> is directly related to statistical power to detect disease associations.
we studied the prediction accuracy of individual rules, and the average accuracy is above 96% when r <dig> â‰¥  <dig> .
many algorithms have been developed to find a small subset of snps called tag snps that are sufficient to infer all the other snps.
recent studies show that multi-marker ld can help further reduce the number of tag snps.
fasttagger also produces smaller sets of tag snps than existing multi-marker based algorithms, and the reduction ratio ranges from 3%-9% when length- <dig> tagging rules are used.
fasttagger uses several techniques to reduce running time and memory consumption.
most of existing r <dig> based algorithms use pairwise ld.
