the first step in biofilm formation is bacterial attachment to solid surfaces, which is dependent on the cell surface physico-chemical properties.
to investigate the role of cwap of non-pathogen gram-positive bacteria in the initial steps of biofilm formation, we evaluated the physico-chemical properties and adhesion to solid surfaces of lactococcus lactis.
the increased bacterial affinity to polar and apolar solvents indicated that exposure of prtp on lactococcal cell surface could enhance the capacity to exchange attractive van der waals interactions, and consequently increase their adhesion to different types of solid surfaces and solvents.
obtained results indicate that exposure of an anchored cell wall proteinase prtp, and not its proteolytic activity, is responsible for greater cell hydrophobicity and adhesion.
to be able to grow in milk this dairy bacterium expresses a cell wall anchored proteinase prtp for breakdown of milk caseins.
the influence of the anchored cell wall proteinase prtp on microbial surface physico-chemical properties, and consequently on adhesion, was evaluated using lactococci carrying different alleles of prtp.
cell wall anchored proteins  are among the known adhesins that confer the adhesive properties to pathogenic gram-positive bacteria.
the presence of cell wall anchored proteinase on the surface of lactococcal cells resulted in an increased affinity to solvents with different physico-chemical properties .
anchored prtp displayed a significant increase in cell adhesion to solid glass and tetrafluoroethylene surfaces.
