to study the contribution of staining methods to degradation of results from gene expression profiling of lcm samples, we subjected pellets of the mouse plasma cell tumor cell line tepc  <dig> to direct rna extraction and to parallel frozen sectioning for lcm and subsequent rna extraction.
rna damage can occur during the staining steps preparatory to laser capture microdissection, with the consequence of loss of representation of certain genes in microarray hybridization analysis.
frozen sections yield higher quality rna than paraffin-imbedded sections, but even with frozen sections, the staining methods used for histological identification of cells of interest could still damage the mrna in the cells.
we used microarray hybridization analysis to compare gene expression profiles of rna from cell pellets with gene expression profiles of rna from frozen sections that had been stained with hematoxylin and eosin , nissl stain , and for immunofluorescence  as well as with the plasma cell-revealing methyl green pyronin  stain.
inclusion of rnaase inhibitor in aqueous staining solutions appears to be important in protecting rna from loss of gene transcripts.
gene expression profiling by microarray analysis of cells enriched by laser capture microdissection  faces several technical challenges.
all rnas were amplified with two rounds of t7-based in vitro transcription and analyzed by two-color expression analysis on 10-k cdna microarrays.
nissl staining was significantly more detrimental to gene expression profiles, presumably owing to an aqueous step in which rna may have been damaged by endogenous or exogenous rnaases.
