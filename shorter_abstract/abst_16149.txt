here we propose the application of network analysis to test for the occurrence of present day hybridization between the two species of brown algae fucus spiralis and f. vesiculosus.
comparison with the bayesian method structure confirmed the usefulness of both approaches and emphasized the reliability of network analysis to unravel and study hybridization
the shared polymorphism in sister species may either be ancestral or derive from hybridization, and the accuracy of analytic methods used thus far to derive convincing evidence for the occurrence of present day hybridization is largely debated.
intermediate individuals linking both clusters on the rd network were those sampled at the limits of the sympatric zone in northwest iberia.
these results suggesting rare hybridization were confirmed by simulation of hybrids and f <dig> with directed backcrosses.
hybridization or divergence between sympatric sister species provides a natural laboratory to study speciation processes.
