the species specific-pcr identified fifteen out of fifty-nine designated r. pickettii isolates as actually being the closely related species r. insidiosa.
r. pickettii species isolated from wide geographic and environmental sources appear to be reasonably homogenous based on genotypic and phenotypic characteristics.
r. insidiosa can at present only be distinguished from r. pickettii using species specific pcr.
r. pickettii and r. insidiosa isolates do not differ significantly phenotypically or genotypically based on environmental or geographical origin.
it has been found in many different environments including clinical situations, soil and industrial high purity water.
ralstonia pickettii is a nosocomial infectious agent and a significant industrial contaminant.

ralstonia isolates  from clinical, industrial and environmental origins were compared genotypically using i) species-specific-pcr, ii) pcr and sequencing of the 16s-23s rrna interspatial region  iii) the flic gene genes, iv) rapd and box-pcr and v) phenotypically using biochemical testing.
