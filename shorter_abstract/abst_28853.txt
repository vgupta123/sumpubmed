to elucidate the scope of the bsan regulon, we used rnaseq analysis to compare the transcriptomes of wild-type b. pseudomallei khw and a bsan deletion mutant.
bsan/bica functions as a central regulator of key virulence clusters in b. pseudomallei within a more extensive network of genetic regulation.
using a promoter-lacz fusion assay in e. coli, we show that bsan together with the chaperone bica directly control the expression of the t3ss <dig> translocon, effector and associated regulatory genes that are organized into at least five operons .
a conserved type iii secretion system  and type vi secretion system  are critical for intracellular survival and growth.
we propose that bsan/bica controls a gene expression program that facilitates the adaption and intracellular survival of the pathogen within eukaryotic hosts.
using a mutagenesis approach, a consensus regulatory motif in the promoter regions of bsan-regulated genes was shown to be essential for transcriptional activation.
the  <dig> genes positively-regulated by bsan include those that we had previously identified in addition to a polyketide biosynthesis locus and genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis.
