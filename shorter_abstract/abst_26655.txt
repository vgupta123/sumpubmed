these results are consistent with the widespread acquisition of antimicrobial resistance among chicken associated campylobacter isolates, either through mutation or horizontal gene transfer, and the expansion of these lineages as a proportion of the population.
erythromycin resistance was associated with campylobacter coli.
there was also evidence of clustering of resistance phenotypes within lineages; indicative of local expansion of resistant strains.
antimicrobial resistance is increasing among clinical campylobacter cases and is common among isolates from other sources, specifically retail poultry - a major source of human infection.
this was compared with a phylogeny for these isolates based upon multi locus sequence typing  to investigate the pattern of antimicrobial resistance acquisition.
antimicrobial resistance was present in all lineage clusters, but statistical testing showed a non-random distribution.
for all antimicrobials tested, resistant isolates were distributed among relatively distant lineages indicative of widespread acquisition.
in this study the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from a uk-wide survey of campylobacter in retail poultry in  <dig> and 2004â€“ <dig> was investigated.
as campylobacter are not known to multiply outside of the host and long-term carriage in humans is extremely infrequent in industrialized countries, the most likely location for the proliferation of resistant lineages is in farmed chickens.
