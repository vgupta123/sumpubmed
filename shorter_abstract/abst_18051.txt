dendritic cells  play a crucial role in initiating effective cell-mediated immune responses, but are dysfunctional and anergic in breast cancer.
dysfunctional and anergic pbdcs and lndcs from patients with operable breast cancer can be optimally reversed by ex vivo culturing of precursor adherent monocytes using a  <dig> ccm containing ifn-Î±.
peripheral blood dcs  and lymph node dcs  generated in vitro from adherent cultures of peripheral blood monocytes  and lymph node monocytes , respectively, using the  <dig> cytokine conditioned medium   or  <dig> ccm  demonstrated a significantly higher degree of recovery and functional capacity in a mixed lymphocyte dc reaction , expressed significantly higher levels of hla-dr, cd <dig>  compared with  <dig> ccm  or medium alone generated dcs from pbms and lnms .
reversal of this dysfunction and establishment of optimal dc function is a key prerequisite for the induction of effective anti-cancer immune responses.
