in the current study we highlight the involvement of parp during d. discoideum development.
though parp's role in cell death is well addressed, its role in development and multicellularity is still an enigma.
we have previously reported the role of parp in oxidative stress induced delayed development of d. discoideum.
constitutive parp down-regulation resulted in blocked development while no effect was observed on d. discoideum growth.
this is the first report where the involvement of parp during normal multicellular development in d. discoideum, an ancient eukaryote, is established which could be of evolutionary significance.
these results emphasize that parp is essential for complex differentiation and its function may be linked to multicellularity.
although parp expression is not affected during oxidative stress but it is involved during normal development as confirmed by our parp down-regulation studies.
oxidative stress affects expression of aca and car <dig> thus affecting aggregation.
interestingly, stage specific parp down-regulation arrested development at the slug stage.
