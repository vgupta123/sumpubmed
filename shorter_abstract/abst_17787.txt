at e <dig> , beads microinjected at e <dig>  into the ectoplacental cone region were found in the placental spongiotrophoblast layer, those injected into the exocoelomic cavity were found on the surface or within the placental labyrinth, and those injected into the amniotic cavity were found on the surface or within the embryo.
this method may be useful for determining the developmental effects of targeted genetic or cellular interventions at critical stages of placentation, gastrulation, axis formation, and neural tube closure.
in  <dig> mhz ultrasound images at e <dig> , the ectoplacental cone region and proamniotic cavity could be visualized.
our success at targeting with few or no beads off-target was 90%  for the ectoplacental cone region and 81%  for the exocoelomic cavity but tended to be less, 68% , for the smaller amniotic cavity.
target accuracy of these sites and of the exocoelomic cavity at e <dig>  was ≥51%.
in utero microinjection has proven valuable for exploring the developmental consequences of altering gene expression, and for studying cell lineage or migration during the latter half of embryonic mouse development ).
the ectoplacental cone region was successfully targeted with  <dig>  nl of a fluorescent bead suspension with few or no beads off-target in 51% of concepti microinjected at e <dig>  .
at e <dig> , the amniotic and exocoelomic cavities, and ectoplacental cone region were discernable.
following microinjection at e <dig> , survival one week after birth was 60%  when the amniotic cavity was the target and 66%  when the target was the ectoplacental cone region.
ultrasound-guided microinjection into the ectoplacental cone region at e <dig>  or e <dig>  and the amniotic cavity at e <dig>  was achieved with a  <dig> day postnatal survival of ≥60%.
in the current study, we use ultrasound guidance to accurately target microinjections in the conceptus at e <dig> –e <dig> , which is prior to cardiovascular or placental dependence.
the survival rate was similar in sham experiments, 54% , for which procedures were identical but no microinjection was performed, suggesting that surgery and manipulation of the uterus were the main causes of embryonic death.
we suggest that this approach may be useful for exploring gene function during early placental and embryonic development.
