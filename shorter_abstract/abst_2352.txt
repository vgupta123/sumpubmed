the secondary hypothesis was that these agents would cause a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation in canine lymphoma cells.
canine clgl- <dig> malignant t cells and cll 17â€“ <dig> cells were incubated in modified rpmi media.
these results confirm the demethylating action of 6-tg and zeb in canine cells which is similar to that shown in human cell lines.
they were treated with 6-tg, zeb, or control media at biologically relevant concentrations.
following treatment with each agent, dnmt <dig> protein and global dna methylation were significantly decreased.
a dose-dependent decrease in cell survival was also observed, with apoptosis being the primary mode of cell death in the clgl- <dig> cell line.
