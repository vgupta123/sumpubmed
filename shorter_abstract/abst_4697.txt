in the european hare, exploration forays occur predominantly in juveniles, the time at which most hares disperse.
overall, we emphasize the need to account for human-related predation risk as a factor driving space-use in harvested species.
in addition, these forays are often preludes to permanent dispersal, because they may help individuals gain cues about their surroundings prior to settlement in a new place.
movements of animals have important consequences, at both the individual and population levels.
contrary to natal dispersal, we did not find strong male-bias in the propensity to engage in explorations.
exploration forays occurred less in juveniles than in adults and later in the season than natal dispersal.
due to its important implications in the evolutionary dynamics of populations, dispersal is one of the most studied types of movement.
in contrast, non-permanent extra home-range movements are often paid less attention.
