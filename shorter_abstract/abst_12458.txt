the time efficiency of the algorithm and its genome-wide applications makes this work of broad interest to scientists interested in transcriptional regulation, motif discovery, and comparative genomics.
the model that we use is a modified ising-type model and it is implemented via statistical mechanics.
we use the model to compare the thermodynamic trends of promoter sequences of several genomes.
dna instability profiles have been used recently for predicting the transcriptional start site and the location of core promoters, and to gain insight into promoter action.
in this work we introduce a new method for computing dna instability profiles.
in addition, we report results that associate the location of local extrema in the instability profiles with the presence of core promoter elements at these locations and with the location of the transcription start sites .
our linear time algorithm computes the profile of a  <dig>  base-pair long sequence in less than one second.
we also analyzed the instability scores of binding sites of several human core promoter elements.
we show that the instability scores of functional binding sites of a given core promoter element are significantly different than the scores of sites with the same motif occurring outside the functional range .
