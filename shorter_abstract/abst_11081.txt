the aim of this study was to compare the performance of five pcr based methods that target regions of 16s rrna, 23s rrna or gyra genes to identify arcobacter species, and to review previous results reported in the literature using these methods.
the worst results obtained were for the identification of arcobacter cryaerophilus and arcobacter butzleri when the 23s rrna gene was used as the target.
in different environments could be expanded if reliable identification methods are applied in future studies.
our results suggest that the known diversity of arcobacter spp.
bacteria belonging to the arcobacter genus are emerging enteropathogens and potential zoonotic agents.
