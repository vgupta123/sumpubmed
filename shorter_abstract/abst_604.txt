this allows us to define the m-th order generalized topological overlap measure  by  counting the number of m-step neighbors that a pair of nodes share and  normalizing it to take a value between  <dig> and  <dig>  using theoretical arguments, a yeast co-expression network application, and a fly protein network application, we illustrate the usefulness of the proposed measure for module detection and gene neighborhood analysis.
the m-th order topological overlap measure allows one to trade-off sensitivity versus specificity when it comes to defining pairwise interconnectedness and network modules.
for example, the topological overlap measure by ravasz et al.
several studies have shown that two proteins having a higher topological overlap are more likely to belong to the same functional class than proteins having a lower topological overlap.
here we address the question whether a measure of topological overlap based on higher-order neighborhoods could give rise to a more robust and sensitive measure of interconnectedness.
we generalize the topological overlap measure from m =  <dig> step neighborhoods to m â‰¥  <dig> step neighborhoods.
topological overlap can serve as an important filter to counter the effects of spurious or missing connections between network nodes.
