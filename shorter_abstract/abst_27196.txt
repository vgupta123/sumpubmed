starch is stored in higher plants as granules composed of semi-crystalline amylopectin and amorphous amylose.
but a portion of dietary starch, termed “resistant starch”  escapes digestion and reaches the large intestine, where it is fermented by colonic bacteria producing short chain fatty acids  which are linked to several health benefits.
starch granules provide energy for the plant during dark periods and for germination of seeds and tubers.
using a chimeric rnai hairpin we simultaneously suppressed all genes coding for starch branching enzymes  in barley , resulting in production of amylose-only starch granules in the endosperm.
this trait was segregating 3: <dig>  amylose-only starch granules were irregularly shaped and showed peculiar thermal properties and crystallinity.

dietary starch is also a highly glycemic carbohydrate being degraded to glucose and rapidly absorbed in the small intestine.
in this study we invented a new method for silencing of multiple genes.
this was achieved by a new method of simultaneous suppression of the entire complement of genes encoding starch branching enzymes.
this is the first time that pure amylose has been generated with high yield in a living organism.
transgenic lines retained high-yield possibly due to a pleiotropic upregualtion of other starch biosynthetic genes compensating the sbes loss.
the amylose-only grains germinated with same frequency as control grains.
