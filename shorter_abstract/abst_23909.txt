we identified  <dig> genes showing large-scale changes in their expression profile: elav-like <dig>  methyltransferase like 7a, dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase, laminin subunit beta- <dig>  gremlin  <dig>  bcl <dig> corepressor-like  <dig>  and three genes of unknown identity.
the connective tissue of tadpoles exposed to larval salamanders may be looser.
the differences in gene expression profiles induced by the two predators suggest that there are functional differences between the altered tail tissues of the two groups of tadpoles.
rana pirica tadpoles show morphological changes in response to a predation threat: larvae of the dragonfly aeshna nigroflava induce heightened tail depth, whereas larval salamander hynobius retardatus induce a bulgy morphology with heightened tail depth.
functional analyses indicated that some of the genes induced by dragonfly larvae caused an increase in laminins necessary for cell adhesion in the extracellular matrix.
predation-threat responsive genes were identified by selecting genes that reverted to control levels of expression following removal of the predator.
a further  <dig> genes showed greater than  <dig> fold differences in expression after exposure to dragonfly larvae and  <dig> genes showed altered expression after exposure to larval salamanders.
exposure to larval salamanders caused down-regulation of xcirp- <dig>  which is known to inhibit expression of adhesion molecules; the tadpoles showed reduced expression of cÎ±-catenin, small muscle protein, dystrophin, and myosin light chain genes.
although both predators induce similar tail morphologies, it is possible that there are functional differences between these tail morphs.
