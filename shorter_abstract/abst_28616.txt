our results demonstrate that inherent sequence characteristics govern variation in coverage and suggest that some of this variation, like gc content, should be controlled for in, for example, rna-seq and detection of copy number variation.
with such extreme depth, stochastic variation in coverage should be negligible, which allows us to provide a very detailed, fine-scale picture of sequence dependent coverage variation and sequencing error rates.
moreover, coverage in orthologous regions was correlated between the two species and was negatively correlated with gc content.
we also found a negative correlation between the site-specific sequencing error rate and coverage, with certain sequence motifs “ccngcc” being particularly prone to high rates of error and low coverage.
