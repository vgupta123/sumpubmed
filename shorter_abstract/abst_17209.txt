moreover, allopolyploid individuals express significantly more gene variants  than their parents, providing clear evidence of increased biological complexity following allopolyploidization.
more genetic mutations seem to have accumulated in the older d. majalis compared with the younger d. traunsteineri since their respective formation.
in addition to stabilizing the allopolyploid genome, genetic and epigenetic alterations are key determinants of adaptive success of the new polyploid species after recurrent allopolyploidization events, potentially triggering reproductive isolation between the resulting lineages.
multiple origins of the polyploids contribute to differential patterns of gene expression with a distinct geographic structure.
analyses of cdna-aflps show a significant increase in the range of gene expression of these allopolyploid lineages, demonstrating higher potential for phenotypic plasticity than is shown by either parent.
dactylorhiza majalis s.s., d. traunsteineri s.l.
and d. ebudensis are three allopolyploid species of a polyploid complex formed through unidirectional  hybridization between the widespread diploids d. fuchsii and d. incarnata.
however, several transcripts conserved within each allopolyploid taxon differ between taxa, indicating that habitat preferences shape similar expression patterns in these independently formed tetraploids.
