however, when retained it may be used as a species-specific mechanism for the reciprocal regulation of neighboring genes.
the comparison to the random distribution also shows that retained overlaps do not exhibit random features: antiparallel overlaps are significantly enriched, while overlaps lying on the same strand and those involving coding sequences are highly underrepresented.
here we report a comparative analysis of overlaps between genes coding for well-annotated proteins in five metazoan genomes .
for all analyzed species the observed number of overlapping genes is always lower than expected assuming functional neutrality, suggesting that gene overlap is negatively selected.
finally, we show that overlapping genes tend to be significantly co-expressed in a breast cancer cdna library obtained by  <dig> deep sequencing, and that different overlap types display different patterns of reciprocal expression.
