emotional scenes and faces have shown to capture and bind visual resources at early sensory processing stages, i.e.
in the current study erps were assessed simultaneously with steady-state visual evoked potentials  to measure attention effects on early visual activity in emotional word processing.
however, emotional words have led to mixed results.
however, emotional words affected the erp.
the n <dig> was reduced for negative compared to neutral words and enhanced for pseudowords compared to words indicating facilitated semantic processing of emotional words.
in line with previous erp and imaging evidence, the present results indicate that written emotional words are facilitated in processing only subsequent to visual analysis.
negative compared to neutral words as well as words compared to pseudowords lead to enhanced deflections in the p <dig> time range indicative of lexico-semantic access.
lpc amplitudes reflected word lexicality and thus the task-relevant response.
emotional word content did not modulate the  <dig>  hz ssvep amplitude, neither did word lexicality.
neutral and negative words were flickered at  <dig>  hz whilst participants performed a lexical decision task.
