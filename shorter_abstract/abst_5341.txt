recent studies show that short segments of aminoacids can be responsible for amyloidogenic properties of a protein.
then the classification is based on maximal distances between co-occurrence matrix of the relevant segments in positive training sequences and the matrix from negative training segments.
our method was first trained on available datasets of hexapeptides with the amyloidogenic classification, using  <dig> or 6-residue sliding windows.
here we propose an original machine learning method for classification of aminoacid sequences, based on discovering a segment with a discriminative pattern of site-specific co-occurrences between sequence elements.
the method reveals characteristic classification pattern of the data and finds the segments where its scoring is the strongest, also in long training sequences.
the method was applied for studying sequences of aminoacids with regard to their amyloidogenic properties.
importantly, the results on 5-residue segments were not significantly worse, although the classification required that algorithm first recognized the most relevant training segments.
the dataset of long sequences, such as sup <dig> prion and a few other amyloid proteins, were applied to test the method and gave encouraging results.
our web tool fish amyloid was trained on all available experimental data 4- <dig> residues long, offers prediction of amyloidogenic segments in protein sequences.
depending on the choice of training and testing datasets, the area under roc curve obtained the value up to  <dig>  for experimental, and  <dig>  for computationally generated  datasets.
applied to the problem of amyloidogenic segments recognition, it showed a good potential for classification problems in bioinformatics.
