this study demonstrates that tat-sa-ppaa is a potential non-viral vector to be utilized in protein therapeutics to deliver biotinylated molecules both into cytoplasm and nucleus of human cells.
when endosomal release of tat-sa was enhanced through the incorporation of a biotinylated, ph-responsive polymer poly , nuclear localization of tat-sa and tat-sa bound to biotin was markedly improved.
the objective of this study was to characterize the uptake and delivery mechanisms of a novel streptavidin fusion construct, tat47â€“57-streptavidin .
by confocal and immunoelectron microscopy the majority of internalized tat-sa was shown to accumulate in perinuclear vesicles in both cancer and non-cancer cell lines.
additionally, no significant cytotoxicity was detected in the tat-sa constructs.
the uptake studies in living cells with various fluorescent endocytic markers and inhibiting agents suggested that tat-sa is internalized into cells efficiently, using both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and lipid-raft-mediated macropinocytosis.
