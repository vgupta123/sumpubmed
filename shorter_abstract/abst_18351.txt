the approach proposed here can be applied to track spatial and temporal changes in the population structure of other microparasite species for which sequence variation in the its or other highly variable genome regions has been documented but other types of polymorphic markers are lacking.
however, the distribution of parasite genotypes was similar across different host species, which might in turn have important consequences for parasite epidemiology.
here, we traced genetic variation  among seven geographically isolated populations of the ichthyosporean caullerya mesnili, a common microparasite of the cladoceran daphnia .
at three sites, we also studied parasite genetic variation over time  and tested for associations between parasite genotypes and host species.
this is particularly true for parasites, as these players have been under-investigated so far due to the lower availability of suitable molecular markers.
moreover, the frequency of parasite genotypes varied significantly over time, suggesting rapid evolutionary change in caullerya.
detailed knowledge of spatial and temporal variation in the genetic population structure of hosts and parasites is required for understanding of host − parasite coevolution.
