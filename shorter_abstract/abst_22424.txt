during protein synthesis, the nascent peptide chain emerges from the ribosome through the ribosomal exit tunnel.
the reported results support the conjecture that the ribosomal exit tunnel interacts with various amino acids and that the nature of these interactions varies among different organisms.

by analyzing multiple ribosome profiling datasets from different organisms , we report for the first time the organism-specific amino acids that significantly lead to ribosome stalling.
we show that the identity of the stalling amino acids vary across the tree of life.
in addition, our analysis supports the conjecture that the stalling effect of positively charged amino acids is not universal and that in certain conditions, negative charge may also induce ribosome stalling.
finally, we show that the beginning part of the tunnel tends to undergo more interactions with the translated amino acids than other positions along the tunnel.
in agreement with previous studies, we observed a remarkable stalling signal of proline and arginine in s. cerevisiae.
biochemical interactions between the nascent peptide and the tunnel may stall the ribosome movement and thus affect the expression level of the protein being synthesized.
