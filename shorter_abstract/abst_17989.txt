taken together our results show that greenhouse agroecosystems can limit gene flow among populations in both climate zones.
however, pest persistence in both climate zones, coupled with increasing opportunities for naturalization in temperate latitudes due to climate change, highlight challenges for the management of cosmopolitan pests in northern and southern europe.
furthermore, there was no temporal genetic structure among populations in finland, suggesting that year-round populations are able to persist in greenhouses.
we undertook the first population genetic study of the greenhouse whitefly , a cosmopolitan invasive herbivore, and examined the genetic structure of this species in northern and southern europe.
using nine microsatellite markers, we genotyped 1274â€‰t. vaporariorum females collected from  <dig> greenhouses in finland and eight greenhouses as well as eight fields in greece.

to predict further invasions of pests it is important to understand what factors contribute to the genetic structure of their populations.
cosmopolitan pest species are ideal for studying how different agroecosystems affect population genetic structure within a species at different climatic extremes.
moreover, there was significant population genetic structure in both countries that was explained by different factors.
habitat  together with longitude explained genetic structure in greece, whereas in finland, genetic structure was explained by host plant species.
