we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by anayzing both real and synthesized data from mlst databases.
we have introduced a model-based tool for automated semi-supervised classification of new pathogen samples that can be integrated into the web interface of the mlst databases.
in particular, when combined with the existing metadata, the semi-supervised labeling may provide invaluable information for assessing the position of a new set of query strains in relation to the particular pathogen population represented by the curated database.
the introduced method for semi-supervised classification of sets of query sts is freely available for windows, mac os x and linux operative systems in baps  <dig>  software which is downloadable at http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf/mate/jc/software/baps.html.
to enable users of mlst schemes to query the databases with sets of new bacterial isolates and to automatically analyze their relation to existing curated sequences, we introduce here a bayesian model-based method for semi-supervised classification of mlst data.
our method can use an mlst database as a training set and assign simultaneously any set of query sequences into the earlier discovered lineages/populations, while also allowing some or all of these sequences to form previously undiscovered genetically distinct groups.
such information will be useful both for clinical and basic research purposes.
worldwide effort on sampling and characterization of molecular variation within a large number of human and animal pathogens has lead to the emergence of multi-locus sequence typing  databases as an important tool for studying the epidemiology and evolution of pathogens.
when combined with the existing metadata, such subsets may provide invaluable information for assessing the position of a new set of isolates in relation to the whole pathogen population.
the latter feature is a necessary prerequisite for an automated access through the mlst web interface.
