key genes that differentiated species responses were linked to photoprotection/redox balance, phytohormone/signalling, primary photosynthesis/cellular metabolism and secondary metabolism based on plant metabolic pathway network analysis.
this knowledge provides the opportunity to further investigate and understand the mechanisms and genetic variation linked to this important environmental response that will assist with genomic efforts in managing native populations as well as in tree improvement programs under future climate scenarios.
climatic and edaphic conditions over geological timescales have generated enormous diversity of adaptive traits and high speciation within the genus eucalyptus .
eucalypt species occur from high rainfall to semi-arid zones and from the tropics to latitudes as high as 43°s.
these results highlight a more definitive response to water deficit by a ‘dry’ climate eucalypt, particularly in stem tissue, identifying key pathways and associated genes that are responsible for the differences between ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ climate eucalypts.
the majority  of these differentially expressed genes, were expressed in stem tissue.
one hundred twenty million high-quality hiseq reads were created from  <dig> tissue samples in plants that had been successfully subjected to a water deficit treatment or a well-watered control.
