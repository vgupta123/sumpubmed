olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug with high clinical efficacy, but which can cause severe weight gain and metabolic disorders in treated patients.
blockade of the histamine  <dig>  receptors is believed to play a crucial role in olanzapine induced weight gain, whereas the therapeutic effects of this drug are mainly attributed to its favourable serotoninergic 2a and dopamine  <dig>  receptor binding affinity ratios.
we suggest that thienobenzodiazepines 8b and 8c with lower binding affinity for the h <dig> receptors, but similar 5ht2a/d <dig> receptor binding affinity ratios to those of olanzapine.
