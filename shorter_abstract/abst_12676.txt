when creating null mutants of all the six genes, three of them, Δtpsa, Δtppa and Δtppb, had lower internal trehalose contents.
gene expressions related to germination have been quantified and deletion mutants characterized: mutants lacking tpsa, tppa or tppb have reduced internal trehalose contents.
in filamentous fungi, such knowledge is limited, although several gene products have been identified.
the Δtppb mutant displayed a low, but not depleted, internal trehalose content, and conidia were more susceptible to thermal stress.
expression of all six genes was confirmed using real-time pcr, and conserved orthologs could be identified in related aspergilli.
using aspergillus niger as a model fungus, the aim of this study was to provide an overview of all genes involved in trehalose synthesis.
a. niger contains at least  <dig> genes putatively involved in trehalose synthesis.
using a two-hybrid approach, there is a strong indication that four of the proteins physically interact, as has previously been shown in s. cerevisiae.
this was also the only mutant with accumulated levels of trehalose-6-phosphate, indicating that the encoded protein is the main phosphatase under normal conditions.
furthermore, tppa, under normal conditions, encodes the functional trehalose-6-phosphate-phosphatase.
besides Δtppa, the most studied deletion mutant in this work was Δtppb.
this gene encodes a protein conserved in filamentous ascomycota.
