the new  <dig> technology has the benefit of high-throughput expression profiling, but introduces time and space problems for assembling large contigs.
our results clearly show the benefit of using the pave assembler to explicitly use mate-pair information and bury ests for large contigs.
the pave data management system uses a mysql database to store multiple libraries of ests along with their metadata; the management system allows multiple assemblies with variations on libraries and parameters.
the pave assembler provides a software package for assembling sanger and/or  <dig> ests.
many laboratories are simultaneously working with the traditional sanger ests and experimenting with ests generated by the  <dig> life science sequencers.
the assembly software, data management software, java viewer and user's guide are freely available.
though sanger ests have been used to generate contigs for many years, no program takes full advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information, hence, many tentative transcripts are assembled into two separate contigs.
a java viewer program is provided for display and analysis of the results.
the pave  assembler takes advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information by requiring that the mate-pairs be assembled into the same contig and joined by n's if the two sub-contigs do not overlap.
