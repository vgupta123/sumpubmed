our comparative analysis of wing venation and body characters demonstrates that the new species belongs to the pteronarcyidae, and is more closely related to pteronarcys than to pteronarcella.
the fossil record of plecoptera  is considered relatively complete, with stem-groups of each of the three major lineages, viz.
however, the family pteronarcyidae  has no fossil record to date, and the family has been suggested to have diverged recently.
this contribution demonstrates the need for investigations of the systematics of fossil stoneflies to refine divergence date estimates for plecoptera lineages.
in this paper, we report on a set of specimens belonging to a new fossil species of stonefly, discovered from the middle jurassic daohugou locality .
it is therefore assigned to a new genus and named pteroliriope sinitshenkovae
