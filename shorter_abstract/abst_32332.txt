for simulated illumina reads, the method has consistently higher sensitivity for both single-end and paired-end data.
our method achieves better results than bowtie and bwa on simulated and real ancient and par-clip reads, as well as on simulated reads from the at rich organism p. falciparum, when modeling the biases of these data.
modern dna sequencing methods produce vast amounts of data that often requires mapping to a reference genome.
we also show that our probabilistic approach can limit the problem of random matches from short reads of contamination and that it improves the mapping of real reads from one organism  to a related genome .
here we present a probabilistic mapping method based on position-specific scoring matrices, which can take into account not only the quality scores of the reads but also user-specified models of evolution and data-specific biases.
the presented work is an implementation of a novel approach to short read mapping where quality scores, prior mismatch probabilities and mapping qualities are handled in a statistically sound manner.
