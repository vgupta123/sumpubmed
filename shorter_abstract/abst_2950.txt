we generated a c0t- <dig> library, representing highly to moderately repetitive sequences, for the characterization of the major b. vulgaris repeat families.
analysis of  <dig> c0t- <dig> dna fragments, providing  <dig> kb sequence data, shows that the satellites pbv and pev are the most abundant repeat families in the b. vulgaris genome while other previously described repeats show lower copy numbers.
bioinformatic analysis and southern hybridization revealed that minisatellites are moderately to highly amplified in b. vulgaris.
the c0t- <dig> library represents major repeat families of the b. vulgaris genome, and analysis of the c0t- <dig> dna was proven to be an efficient method for identification of minisatellites.
repetitive dna is a major fraction of eukaryotic genomes and occurs particularly often in plants.
currently, the sequencing of the sugar beet  genome is under way and knowledge of repetitive dna sequences is critical for the genome annotation.
we established, so far, the broadest analysis of minisatellites in plants and observed their chromosomal localization providing a background for the annotation of the sugar beet genome and for the understanding of the evolution of minisatellites in plant genomes.
we isolated  <dig> novel repetitive sequences and used this fraction for the identification of minisatellite and novel satellite families.
