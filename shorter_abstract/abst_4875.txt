also implemented in biologicalnetworks are the integrated genome viewer and comparative genomics browser applications, which allow for the search and analysis of gene regulatory regions and their conservation in multiple species in conjunction with molecular pathways/networks, experimental data and functional annotations.
the new release of biologicalnetworks together with its back-end database introduces extensive functionality for a more efficient integrated multi-level analysis of microarray, sequence, regulatory, and other data.
here we report on a new version of biologicalnetworks, a research environment for the integral visualization and analysis of heterogeneous biological data.
biologicalnetworks can be queried for properties of thousands of different types of biological entities  and their relations .
numerous sources of heterogeneous data which exist for these subsystems are still not integrated sufficiently enough to give researchers a straightforward opportunity to analyze them together in the same frame of study.
systematic application of data integration methods is also hampered by a multitude of such factors as the orthogonal nature of the integrated data and naming problems.
