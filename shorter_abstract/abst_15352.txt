recombinant xylanase activity increased  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % by supplementing the pichia pastoris culture with 20 g/l wheat bran, 5 mg/l l-histidine, 10 mg/l l-tryptophan and 10 mg/l l-methionine in shake flasks, respectively.
in the initial 72 h of methanol induction, the linear dependence of xylanase activity on methanol intake was observed .
efficient glycerol and methanol fed-batch strategies resulting in desired cell density and xylanase activity should be applied in other p. pastoris fermentation for other recombinant proteins production.
therefore, it is necessary to develop a high amount of effective thermoalkaliphilic xylanases.
the maximum xylanase activity was predicted to be  <dig>  u/ml, while the actual maximum xylanase activity was  <dig>  u/ml, which was  <dig>  times of that in shake flask.
recombinant xylanases with high ph- and thermal-stability showed potential in various industrial applications.
recombinant xylanase retained  <dig> % of its initial activity after pre-incubation at 80 °c for 50 min , and it exhibited excellent stability in the broad temperature  and ph  ranges.
xylanase degrades xylan into monomers of various sizes by catalyzing the endohydrolysis of the  <dig> -β-d-xylosidic linkage randomly, possessing potential in wide industrial applications.
investigation of nutritional fermentation parameters, non-nutritional fermentation parameters and feeding strategies in 1 l bioreactor and 1 l shake flask revealed that glycerol and methanol feeding strategies were the critical factors for high cell density and xylanase activity.
most of xylanases are susceptible to be inactive when suffering high temperature and high alkaline process.
in 50 l bioreactor, a novel glycerol feeding strategy and a four-stage methanol feeding strategy with a stepwise increase in feeding rate were developed to enhance recombinant xylanase production.
