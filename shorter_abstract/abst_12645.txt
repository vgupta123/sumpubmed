we also demonstrated that combining the cn-nam and us-nam populations improves the power to detect qtl by 50 % compared to single nam population mapping.
in addition, genotyping by sequencing  at low coverage not only produces genotyping errors, but also results in large datasets, making the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies computationally inefficient or unfeasible.
available resources include efficient usage of low-coverage genomic sequencing, detailed positions for genes controlling maize flowering, and recombination bin maps and flowering- time data for both cn and us nams.

in contrast, its complementary method, linkage analysis, provides direct genetic confirmation, but with limited resolution.
we developed high-quality recombination maps for each nam population to correct genotyping errors and improve the computational efficiency of the joint linkage analysis.
this study provides directions and resources for the research community, especially maize researchers, for future studies using the recombination bin strategy for joint linkage analysis.
the quantitative trait locus  mapping for flowering time  indicated that the high-density, recombination bin map improved resolution of qtl mapping by 50 % compared with that using a medium-density map.
among the qtls mapped by joint usage of the us-nam and cn-nam maps, 25 % of the qtls overlapped with known flowering-time genes in maize.
to further increase the statistical power and resolution, we merged a new temperate maize nested association mapping  population derived in china  with the existing maize nam population developed in the us .
maize researchers even have the opportunity to grow both cn and us nam populations to study the traits of their interest, as the seeds of both nam populations are available from the seed repository in china and the us.
a genome-wide association study  is the foremost strategy used for finding genes that control human diseases and agriculturally important traits, but it often reports false positives.
in this study, we converted raw snps into effective recombination bins.
a joint approach, using multiple linkage populations, dramatically improves resolution and statistical power.
for example, this approach has been used to confirm that many complex traits, such as flowering time controlling adaptation in maize, are controlled by multiple genes with small effects.
