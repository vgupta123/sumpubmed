we observe that crlmm and genosnp are more accurate at calling snps with low minor allele frequency than gencall or illuminus.
the performance of illuminus is heavily dependent on sample size, with lower no call rates and improved accuracy as the number of samples available increases.
for x chromosome snps, methods with sex-dependent models  perform better than methods which ignore gender information .
a fundamental step in any analysis is the processing of raw allele a and allele b intensities from each snp into genotype calls .
