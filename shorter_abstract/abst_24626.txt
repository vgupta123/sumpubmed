an imputation framework called histone acetylation information aided imputation method  is presented.
the paper explores the feasibility of doing missing value imputation with the help of gene regulatory mechanism.
moreover, with more knowledge accumulated on gene regulatory mechanism in addition to histone acetylation, the performance of our approach can be further improved and verified.
it incorporates the histone acetylation information into the conventional knn and lls imputation algorithms for final prediction of the missing values.
the experimental results indicated that the use of acetylation information can provide significant improvements in microarray imputation accuracy.
we demonstrated that the using of histone acetylation information could greatly improve the performance of the imputation especially at high missing percentages.
furthermore, the proposed methods also outperform goimpute, which is one of the existing related methods that use the functional similarity as the external information.
it is an important pre-processing step to accurately estimate missing values in microarray data, because complete datasets are required in numerous expression profile analysis in bioinformatics.
this idea can be generalized to various imputation methods to facilitate the performance.
the haiimpute methods consistently improve the widely used methods such as knn and lls in terms of normalized root mean squared error .
meanwhile, the genes imputed by haiimpute methods are more correlated with the original complete genes in terms of pearson correlation coefficients.
