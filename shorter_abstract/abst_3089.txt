i have classified the collection into homologous gene families according to distinctive patterns of sequence conservation and intron position.
the evolutionary histories of these gene families are traceable through the appearance of family members in different eukaryotic lineages.
assuming an intron-rich eukaryotic ancestor, the conserved intron patterns distinctive of individual gene families, indicate independent origins of syt, fam <dig> and ntmc <dig> genes.
during the evolution of these gene families, duplications and other gene rearrangements affecting domain composition, have occurred along with sequence divergence, leading to complex family relationships with accordingly complex functional implications.
the plant genes share an additional region of sequence similarity with a group of animal genes named fam <dig>  fam <dig> genes also have a similar domain architecture.
little is known about the functions of the plant genes and animal fam <dig> genes.
the collection comprises six groups of plant genes conserved in embryophytes: ntmc2type <dig> to ntmc2type <dig>  i collected and compared metazoan fam <dig> sequences and identified some similar sequences from other eukaryotic lineages.
i compared the intron patterns of syt genes.
understanding the evolutionary relationships among these genes will help to realize the full implications of functional studies and lead to improved genome annotation.
genes with a similar domain architecture as well as sequence similarity to synaptotagmin c <dig> domains have also been found in plant genomes.
the collection provides a resource for studies of intron evolution.
synaptotagmin genes are found in animal genomes and are known to function in the nervous system.
