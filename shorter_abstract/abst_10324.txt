to assess inter-rater reliability, video-recordings of sedation assessment were randomized and blinded for viewing by  <dig> raters untrained in the scale.
we hypothesized that the chosen sedation scale would be unreliable when used by different raters and show poor discrimination between sedation protocols.
videos were also edited to allow assessment of inter-rater reliability of an abbreviated scale  by  <dig> different raters.
both sedation scales exhibited excellent internal consistency and very good inter-rater reliability .
the aim of this study was to assess validation evidence for a sedation scale for dogs.
a sedation scale  was used to score  <dig> dogs scheduled to receive sedation at two veterinary clinics in a prospective trial.
full and abbreviated scales showed excellent internal consistency and very good reliability between multiple untrained raters.
scores recorded by a single observer were used to assess internal consistency and construct validity of the scores.
the full scale discriminated between the most common protocols: dexmedetomidine-hydromorphone  and acepromazine-hydromorphone .
the full scale differentiated between levels of sedation.
