our systems and network investigations provide convincing pre-clinical evidence in support of the clinical application of gn- <dig> for the reversal of emt and thereby reducing cancer cell aggressiveness.
pathway network analysis of mrna expression using microarrays from gn- <dig> treated kras-hmle-snail cells showed an orchestrated global re-organization of emt network genes.
gn- <dig> induced met was found to be consistent with growth inhibition, suppression of spheroid forming capacity and induction of apoptosis.
in this report, using systems biology and pathway network analysis, we show that gn- <dig> could cause reversal of emt leading to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition  in a well-recognized hmle-snail and kras-hmle-snail models.
