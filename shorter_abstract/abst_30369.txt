for solid sequencer data, sopra uses a dynamic programming approach to robustly translate the color-space assembly to base-space.
however, given the error-prone nature of hts data and the fundamental limitations from the shortness of the reads, the ad hoc greedy algorithms used in the earlier studies are likely to lead to poor quality results in the current context.
vertices of this graph are individual contigs with edges drawn between contigs connected by mate pairs.
scaffold assembly is presented as an optimization problem for variables associated with vertices and with edges of the contig connectivity graph.
these limitations could be partially overcome by utilizing mate pair technology, which provides pairs of short reads separated by a known distance along the genome.
applying sopra to real data from bacterial genomes, we were able to assemble contigs into scaffolds of significant length  with very few errors introduced in the process.
while these short reads are adequate for resequencing applications, de novo assembly of moderate size genomes from such reads remains a significant challenge.
similar graph problems have been invoked in the context of shotgun sequencing and scaffold building for previous generation of sequencing projects.
we have developed sopra, a tool designed to exploit the mate pair/paired-end information for assembly of short reads.
the main focus of the algorithm is selecting a sufficiently large subset of simultaneously satisfiable mate pair constraints to achieve a balance between the size and the quality of the output scaffolds.
in general, the methodology presented here will allow better scaffold assemblies of any type of mate pair sequencing data.
