benzylisoquinoline alkaloids  represent a diverse class of plant specialized metabolites sharing a common biosynthetic origin beginning with tyrosine.
the results presented herein provide essential sequence information and inform experimental design for the continued elucidation of bia metabolism.
homology-based mining of libraries using bia-biosynthetic enzymes as queries yielded ~ <dig> gene candidates potentially involved in alkaloid biosynthesis.
these expression data provide a basis for the rational selection of gene candidates, and suggest possible metabolic bottlenecks within bia metabolism.
the decades-long focus on a select number of plant species as model systems has allowed near or full elucidation of major bia pathways, including those of morphine, sanguinarine and berberine.
assembled data for each transcriptome were deposited into an established web-based blast portal  to allow public access.
further, these non-model species represent a rich source of catalyst diversity valuable to plant biochemists and emerging synthetic biology efforts.
transcriptome resources were used to design and execute a case study of candidate n-methyltransferases  from glaucium flavum, which revealed predicted and novel enzyme activities.
publically accessible, fully annotated, blast-accessible transcriptomes were not previously available for most species included in this report, despite the rich repertoire of bioactive alkaloids found in these plants and their importance to traditional medicine.
in order to access the genetic diversity of non-model plants accumulating bias, we selected  <dig> species representing  <dig> families within the ranunculales.
many bias have potent pharmacological activities, and plants accumulating them boast long histories of use in traditional medicine and cultural practices.
rna extracted from each species was processed for analysis by both 1) roche gs-flx titanium and 2) illumina ga/hiseq platforms, generating a total of  <dig> deep-sequencing transcriptome libraries.
phylogenetic analysis was performed for each of  <dig> different enzyme/protein groupings, highlighting many novel genes with potential involvement in the formation of one or more alkaloid types, including morphinan, aporphine, and phthalideisoquinoline alkaloids.
expression analysis of these candidates was performed using inter-library fpkm normalization methods.
this study establishes an essential resource for the isolation and discovery of 1) functional homologues and 2) entirely novel catalysts within bia metabolism.
