we previously defined a family of restriction endonucleases  from thermus sp., which share common biochemical and biophysical features, such as the fusion of both the nuclease and methyltransferase  activities in a single polypeptide, cleavage at a distance from the recognition site, large molecular size, modulation of activity by s-adenosylmethionine , and incomplete cleavage of the substrate dna.
they comprise a tandem arrangement of type i-like domains, like other type iic enzymes , e.g.
members include related thermophilic reases with five distinct specificities: tspgwi, taqii, tth111ii/tthhb27i, tspdti and tsoi.
their amino acid sequences are similar, which is unusual among reases of different specificity.
to gain insight into this group of reases, tspdti, the prototype member of the thermus sp.
