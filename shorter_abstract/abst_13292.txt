based on this phylogeny we have pinpointed the amino acid positions that have most likely contributed to the diverse functions of these enzymes.
our study has  fully resolved the phylogeny of the mhps and the subsequent pattern of gene duplication, and , we have detected amino acids under positive selection that have most likely contributed to the observed functional shifts in each type of mhp.
our analysis of all available genomic sequence data for the mhps from all available completed mammalian genomes, involved sophisticated methods of phylogeny reconstruction and data treatment.
the mammalian heme peroxidases  are a medically important group of enzymes.
included in this group are myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, and thyroid peroxidase.
sufficient signal exists for the resolution of the evolutionary relationships of this family of enzymes.
despite much effort to elucidate a clearer understanding of the function of the  <dig> major groups of this multigene family, we still do not have a clear understanding of their relationships to each other.
