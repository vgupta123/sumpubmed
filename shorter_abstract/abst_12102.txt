the annotated sequence is deposited in the embl database  and uploaded into the mollicutes database molligen  allowing for comparative genomics.
the genome was sequenced using a combined technique of gs-flx  and sanger sequencing, and annotated by an automatic pipeline that we designed using several tools interconnected via perl scripts.
the mollicute mycoplasma conjunctivae is the etiological agent leading to infectious keratoconjunctivitis  in domestic sheep and wild caprinae.
although this pathogen is relatively benign for domestic animals treated by antibiotics, it can lead wild animals to blindness and death.
we show that our automatic pipeline allows for annotating a complete mycoplasma genome and present several examples of analysis in search for biological targets .
