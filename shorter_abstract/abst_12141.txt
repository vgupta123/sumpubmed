here we present a bayesian implementation of an evolutionary model-based method, the general mixed yule-coalescent model .
we also re-analyze the dataset used to introduce the original gmyc model.
our results suggest that the gmyc model can be useful under a wide variety of circumstances, particularly in cases where divergences are deeper, or taxon sampling is incomplete, as in many studies of ecological communities, but that, in accordance with expectations from coalescent theory, rapid, recent radiations may yield inaccurate results.
we conducted simulations testing the effects of species evolutionary history, levels of intraspecific sampling and number of nucleotides sequenced.
we found that the model results are improved with addition of dna sequence and increased sampling, although these improvements have limits.
recent and rapid divergences result in higher amounts of uncertainty in the model and eventually cause the model to fail to accurately assess uncertainty in species limits.
in such cases dna sequence-based species delimitation has been proposed as a means of estimating species boundaries for further analysis.
our implementation integrates over the parameters of the model and uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships using the output of widely available phylogenetic models and markov-chain monte carlo  simulation in order to produce marginal probabilities of species identities.
