an alternative method for profile analysis of characteristic conserved positions of the motifs within the 3d structures may be needed for functional annotation of protein sequences.
this new approach may be applicable to studying functional sites in un-annotated proteins, for which complete 3d structures are not yet available.
this approach was used to search for functional sites of proteins belonging to the lysozyme and cystatin families.
the same approach was successfully applied to cystatins, especially for postulating the mechanisms of amyloidosis of human cystatin c as well as human lysozyme.
using the approach of quantitative structure-activity relationships , we have proposed a new algorithm for postulating functional mechanisms on the basis of pattern similarity and average of property values of side-chains in segments within sequences.
the profiles of similarity constants and average values of these parameters as functions of their positions in the sequences could identify both active and substrate binding sites of the lysozyme of streptomyces coelicolor, which has been reported as a new fold enzyme .
pattern similarity and average index values of structure-related properties of side chains in short segments of three residues or longer were, for the first time, successfully applied for predicting functional sites in sequences.
although it is generally agreed that topography is more conserved than sequences, proteins sharing the same fold can have different functions, while there are protein families with low sequence similarity.
hydrophobicity and β-turn propensity of reference segments with 3– <dig> residues were used for the homology similarity search  for active sites.
