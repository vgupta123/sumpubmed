laribacter hongkongensis is a newly discovered, facultative anaerobic, gram-negative, motile, sea gull-shaped rod associated with freshwater fish borne gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea.
congruence analysis showed that all the pairwise comparisons of the  <dig> mlst loci were incongruent, indicating that recombination played a substantial role in the evolution of l. hongkongensis.
all seven genes showed very low dn/ds ratios of <  <dig> , indicating that no strong positive selective pressure is present.
standardized index of association  measurement showed significant linkage disequilibrium in isolates from both humans and fish.
the p-value  of sum of the squares of condensed fragments in sawyer's test showed evidence of intragenic recombination in the rho, acnb and thic loci, but the p-value  of maximum condensed fragment in these gene loci did not show evidence of intragenic recombination.
a highly reproducible and discriminative typing system is essential for better understanding of the epidemiology of l. hongkongensis.
in this study, a multilocus sequence typing  system was developed for l. hongkongensis.
the system was used to characterize  <dig> l. hongkongensis isolates, including  <dig> from humans and  <dig> from fish.
a website for l. hongkongensis mlst was set up and can be accessed at http://mlstdb.hku.hk:14206/mlst_index.html.
a highly reproducible and discriminative mlst system was developed for l. hongkongensis.
the overall discriminatory power was  <dig> .
the median number of alleles at each locus was  <dig> .
