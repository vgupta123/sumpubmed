the e. coli orfeome provides a useful resource for functional genomics and other areas of protein research in a highly flexible format.
the collection has been used for protein expression and protein interaction studies.
for example, we have compared interactions among ygjd, yjee and yeaz proteins in e. coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus.
systems biology and functional genomics require genome-wide datasets and resources.
we also compare this orfeome with other gateway-compatible bacterial orfeomes and show its utility for comparative functional genomics.
complete sets of cloned open reading frames  have been made for about a dozen bacterial species and allow researchers to express and study complete proteomes in a high-throughput fashion.
