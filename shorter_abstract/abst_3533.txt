our results show that b. pertussis is a dynamic organism that continues to evolve.
a total of  <dig> regions of difference consisting of one or more contiguous cdss were identified among the variable genes.
bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of human whooping cough  and is particularly severe in infants.
phylogenetic analysis of microarray data generated a minimum spanning tree that depicted the phylogenetic structure of the strains.
an overview of genomic contents of a large collection of isolates from different countries allowed us to derive a core genome and a phylogenetic structure of b. pertussis.
in an attempt to gain insight into the genomic make-up of b. pertussis over the last  <dig> years, we used an oligonucleotide dna microarray to compare the genomic contents of a collection of  <dig> strains of b. pertussis isolates from different countries.
the cgh microarray analysis estimated the core genome of b. pertussis, to consist of  <dig>  cdss that are conserved among all b. pertussis strains, and represent  <dig> % of all cdss found in the  <dig> b. pertussis strains.
cgh data also revealed that the genome size of b. pertussis strains is decreasing progressively over the past  <dig> years.
b. pertussis strains with the same gene content were found in several different countries.
however, geographic specificity of the b. pertussis strains was not observed.
several reasons for the re-emergence of this highly contagious disease have been suggested.
a particularly intriguing possibility is based on evidence indicating that pathogen adaptation may play a role in this process.
the gene content was determined to highly correlate with the ptxp-type of the strains.
