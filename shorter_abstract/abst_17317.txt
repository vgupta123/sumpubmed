three classes of ds elements can cause mutations: ds-del, internal deletions of the  <dig> -kb ac element; ds <dig>  ~400-bp in size and sharing little homology with ac, and ds <dig>  variably-sized elements containing about  <dig>  kb from the ac termini and unrelated internal sequences.
there are  <dig> such elements in b <dig>  ds-l <dig> elements share little similarity with ac outside of the 11-bp tir, have a modal length of ~ <dig> kb, and carry filler dna which, in a few cases, could be matched to gene fragments.
unlike actively transposing elements, many ds-l elements are inserted in repetitive dna, where they probably become methylated and begin to decay.
ds-l <dig> elements lack subterminal homology with ac, but carry transposase gene fragments, and represent decaying ac elements.
there are  <dig> ds <dig> and  <dig> ds <dig> elements, many of which are likely mobilized by ac, and two novel classes of ds-l elements.
only half of ds insertion sites examined are shared between the inbreds b <dig> and w <dig>
none of the ds-l elements tested responded to ac.
the majority of ds-related sequences in maize correspond to ds-l elements that do not transpose in the presence of ac.
