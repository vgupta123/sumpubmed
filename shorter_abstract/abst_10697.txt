in the present study, we compared the behavioral effects of pre- and post-treatment with snp, glyceryl trinitrate , and methylene blue  in the acute ket animal model of schizophrenia.

the present study was designed to test whether acute snp, gtn, and mb treatment taken after  or before  a single ket injection would influence the behavior of rats in the sucrose preference test, object recognition task and open field.
no donors – especially snp – are promising new pharmacological candidates in the treatment of schizophrenia.
therapeutic and preventive snp treatment consistently decreased ket-induced hyperlocomotion.
in addition, we showed that the potential impact of no-related compounds on ket-induced behavioral changes may depend on the temporal window of drug administration.
the therapeutic use of the nitric oxide -donor sodium nitroprusside  in patients with schizophrenia has shown promising results.
the results showed that ket induced cognitive deficits and hyperlocomotion.
gtn pre-, but not post-treatment, tended to increase vertical and horizontal activity in the ket model.
mb pretreatment resulted in long-term memory recovery.
long- term memory improvement was seen with the therapeutic gtn and snp treatment, but not with the preventive one.
