here we describe the development of the rootscope, an automated microscopy system for quantitating heat shock responses in plant roots.
the promoter of hsp <dig>  was used to build a hsp <dig> p:gfp transcriptional reporter that is induced by heat shock in arabidopsis.
this suggests that different mechanisms mediate heat shock responses above and below 37°c.
the rootscope system is a simple and powerful platform for investigating the heat shock response in plants.
an automated fluorescence microscopy system which enables multiple roots to be imaged in rapid succession was used to quantitate hsp <dig> p:gfp response dynamics.
hsp <dig> p:gfp signal increased with temperature increases from 28°c to 37°c.
finally, we demonstrate that hsp <dig> p:gfp expression exhibits wave like dynamics in growing roots.
