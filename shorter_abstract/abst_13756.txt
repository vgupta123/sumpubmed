to correctly annotate the start and stop of the genes, we find that a consensus of all the predictors performs best for shorter read lengths while a unanimous agreement is better for longer read lengths, boosting annotation accuracy by 1-8%.
in this work, we benchmark three metagenomic gene prediction programs and combine their predictions to improve metagenomic read gene annotation.
we also demonstrate use of the classifier combinations on a real dataset.
traditional gene annotation methods rely on characteristics that may not be available in short reads generated from next generation technology, resulting in suboptimal performance for metagenomic  samples.
we demonstrate that most methods predict over 80% coding  reads on a real human gut sample sequenced by illumina technology.
the main deficiencies are in the algorithms' ability to predict non-coding regions and gene edges, resulting in more false-positives and false-negatives than desired.
