some of the genes were related to cell wall degradation, plant hormone signal transduction, and stress response.
further analysis showed that calyx persistence in korla fragment pear was a metabolic process regulated by many genes related to cell wall degradation and plant hormones.
transcriptome and digital gene expression  profiles of flowers, ovaries, and sepals with persistent calyx  were compared with those of flowers, ovaries, and sepals with deciduous calyx .
temporal changes in the expression of selected genes in floral organs with either persistent or deciduous calyx were compared using real-time quantitative pcr .

flowers were collected at early bloom, full bloom, and late bloom.
from sc_ep vs tl_ep,  <dig> degs with known relationship to abscission were identified along with  <dig> degs with unknown function.
the objective of this study was to increase understanding about genetic mechanisms affecting calyx persistence in korla fragrant pear .
more than  <dig> degs were observed that were related to calyx persistence in korla fragrant pear.
from sc_zf vs tl_zf, we identified  <dig> degs with known relationship to abscission and  <dig> degs with unknown function.
