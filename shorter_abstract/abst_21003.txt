environmental ozone can rapidly degrade cyanine  <dig> , a fluorescent dye commonly used in microarray gene expression studies.
cyanine  <dig>  is much less affected by atmospheric ozone.
simple installation of carbon filters in the laboratory air handling system resulted in low and consistent ozone levels.
modest, but significant, increases in cy <dig> and cy <dig> signal intensities were observed after  <dig> or  <dig> hours at 98–99% humidity compared to 42% humidity.
degradation of the cy <dig> signal relative to the cy <dig> signal in 2-color microarrays will adversely reduce the cy5/cy <dig> ratio resulting in unreliable microarray data.
comparisons of identically hybridized microarrays exposed to either carbon-filtered or unfiltered air demonstrated the protective effect of carbon-filtration on microarray data as indicated by cy <dig> and cy <dig> intensities.
this allowed the accurate determination of gene expression by microarray using cy <dig> and cy <dig> fluorescent dyes.
ozone in central arkansas typically ranges between ~ <dig> ppb to ~ <dig> ppb and can be as high as 60– <dig> ppb depending upon season, meteorological conditions, and time of day.
a carbon filter was installed in the laboratory air handling system to reduce ozone levels in the microarray laboratory.
these modifications reduced the ozone within the microarray laboratory to ~2– <dig> ppb.
lowess normalization of the data was not able to completely overcome the effect of ozone-induced reduction of cy <dig> signal.
