fourteen serotypes were detected and the predominant ones were s. bronx , s. newport , followed by s. typhimurium, s. indiana, s. kentucky, s. saintpaul and s. virchow  each.
the aim of this study was therefore to determine the prevalence, serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of salmonella from feces of apparently healthy dogs in addis ababa, ethiopia.

therefore, it is vital to work on raising public awareness on zoonotic canine diseases prevention measures and good hygienic practices.
this study demonstrated high carriage rate of salmonella serotypes known for causing human salmonellosis and large proportion of them were resistant to antimicrobials used in public and veterinary medicine for management of various bacterial infections, suggesting the possible risk of infection of human population in close contact with these dogs by drug resistant pathogens.
the close bond between pet animals and family members poses risk of infection with zoonotic bacterial pathogens such as salmonella.
