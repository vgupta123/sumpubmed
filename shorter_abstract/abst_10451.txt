hypoxia inducible factor  regulates a cascade of transcriptional events in response to decreased oxygenation, acting from the cellular to the physiological level.
transcriptome analysis of vhl mutant embryos detected activation of key hypoxia response genes seen in human cell models of hypoxia, but also suppression of many genes primarily involved in lipid processing.
to further develop fish as a model for studying hypoxic signalling, we examine the transcriptional profile of the vhl mutant with respect to hif-1α.
to identify the dependency of these transcriptional changes on hif, we undertook chromatin immunoprecipitation linked next generation sequencing  for the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1α .
we performed high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis of the gene expression changes in von hippel-lindau mutant zebrafish, which identified up-regulation of well-known hypoxia response genes and down-regulation of genes primarily involved in lipid processing.
previous work from our lab has focused on the phenotypic characterisation of this mutant, establishing the links between vhl mutation, the hypoxic response and cancer.
this response is evolutionarily conserved, allowing the use of zebrafish  as a model for studying the hypoxic response.
activation of the hypoxic response can be achieved in zebrafish by homozygous null mutation of the von hippel-lindau  tumour suppressor gene.
we identified hif-1α binding sites across the genome, with binding sites showing enrichment for an rcgtg motif, showing conservation with the mammalian hypoxia response element.
