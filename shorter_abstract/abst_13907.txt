in silico mapping placed one of these tags  on chromosome 1a.
stripe rust, a highly destructive foliar disease of wheat , causes severe losses, which may be accompanied by reduced photosynthetic activity and accelerated leaf senescence.
the unique chromosomal location and expression mode of wcbp <dig> suggested that wcbp <dig> is the putative candidate gene of yrl <dig>  which was involved in leaf senescence and photosynthesis related to plant responses to stripe rust infection during the grain-filling stage.
primers based on  amplified a polymorphic band, which co-segregated with yrl <dig>  we cloned a candidate gene encoding wheat copper-binding protein  by amplifying the polymorphic region, and we mapped wcbp <dig> to a  <dig>  cm genetic interval.
we used suppression subtractive hybridization  to examine the mechanisms of resistance in the resistant wheat line l <dig> , which was derived from a lineage that includes a wide cross between common and thinopyrum intermedium.
qrt-pcr confirmed that wcbp <dig> expression changes in response to pathogen infection.
sequencing of an ssh cdna library identified  <dig> expressed sequence tags.
