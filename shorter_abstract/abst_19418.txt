using normfinder, our studies demonstrated the suitability of hprt to use as a single gene for normalisation within the normal, inflamed and regenerative groups and gapdh in the atrophic group.
selection of the most stable control gene is therefore critical for the reliable interpretation of gene expression data.
for normalisation across the physiological states, we recommend the use of ubc.
for the purpose of this study,  <dig> commonly used housekeeping genes were investigated in salivary submandibular glands under normal, inflamed, atrophic and regenerative states.
the program normfinder identified the suitability of hprt to use as a single gene for normalisation within the normal, inflamed and regenerative states, and gapdh in the atrophic state.
for normalisation to multiple housekeeping genes, for each individual state, the optimal number of housekeeping genes as given by genorm was: actb/ubc in the normal, actb/ywhaz in the inflamed, actb/hprt in the atrophic and actb/gapdh in the regenerative state.
real-time pcr is a reliable tool with which to measure mrna transcripts, and provides valuable information on gene expression profiles.
