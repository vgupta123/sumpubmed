a number of software packages are available to generate dna multiple sequence alignments  evolved under continuous-time markov processes on phylogenetic trees.
we present the first package designed to generate msas evolving under discrete-time markov processes on phylogenetic trees, directly from probability substitution matrices.
based on the input model and a phylogenetic tree in the newick format , the algorithm produces dna alignments of desired length.
the software presented here is an efficient tool to generate dna msas on a given phylogenetic tree.
moreover, existing software restricts to the time-reversible models and it is not optimized to generate nonhomogeneous data .
on the other hand, methods of simulating the dna msa directly from the transition matrices do not exist.
