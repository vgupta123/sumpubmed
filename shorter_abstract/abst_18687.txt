f. tularensis lvs undergoes considerable gene expression changes in response to mammalian body temperature.
this is the first study identifying a francisella gene that contributes to uptake into both phagocytic and non-phagocytic host cells.
after infecting a mammalian host, the facultative intracellular bacterium, francisella tularensis, encounters an elevated environmental temperature.
the ftl_ <dig> mutant was attenuated in a chicken embryo infection model, which was likely attributable to a defect in survival within macrophages.
our results provide new insight into mechanisms of francisella virulence regulation and pathogenesis.
interestingly, the deob mutant showed diminished entry into mammalian cells compared to wild-type lvs, including primary human macrophages and dendritic cells, the macrophage-like raw  <dig>  line, and non-phagocytic hek- <dig> cells.
microarray analysis of f. tularensis lvs shifted from 26°c  to 37°c  showed ~11% of this bacterium's genes were differentially-regulated.
an analysis of tiva and deob  revealed that these genes contribute to intracellular survival and entry into mammalian cells, respectively.
importantly, the compilation of temperature-regulated genes also defines a rich collection of novel candidate virulence determinants, including tiva .
importantly, 40% of the protein-coding genes that were induced at 37°c have been previously implicated in virulence or intracellular growth of francisella in other studies, associating the bacterial response to this temperature shift with pathogenesis.
forty-four percent of the genes induced at 37°c encode proteins of unknown function, suggesting novel francisella virulence traits are regulated by mammalian temperature.
