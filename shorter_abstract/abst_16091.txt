it is therefore intriguing to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive the evolution of plant nip2s.
all nip2s possess an ar/r filter consisting of g, s, g, and r, except for the cucumber csnip2; <dig>  where a small g in the h <dig> is substituted with the bulkier c residue.
however, to date there is no data-mining or direct experimental evidences for the permeability of such larger solutes for dicot nip2s, although they exhibit similar three-dimensional structures as those in grasses.
the present study provides the first evidences of functional divergence between dicot and monocot nip2s, and suggests that positive selection, as well as a radical shift of evolutionary rate at some critical amino acid sites is the primary driver.
the analysis at the amino acid level provided strong statistical evidences for the functional divergence between monocot and dicot nip iii subgroup proteins.
in addition, several sdps  responsible for functional specificity were predicted.
nod26-like intrinsic proteins  that belong to the aquaporin superfamily are unique to plants.
in some grasses, the nip iii subgroup proteins  were demonstrated to be permeable to solutes with larger diameter, such as silicic acid and arsenous acids.
these findings will expand our understanding to evolutionary mechanisms driving the functional diversification of monocot and dicot nip iii subgroup proteins.
the nip iii subgroup is more ancient with a divergence time that predates the monocot-dicot split.
according to homology modeling and phylogenetic analysis, the nip subfamily can be further divided into three subgroups with distinct biological functions .
our maximum likelihood analysis revealed that nip2s, especially the loop a  region, have undergone strong selective pressure for adaptive evolution.
