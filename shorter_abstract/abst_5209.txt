in a previous study we found a dramatic increase in the size and density of nach accumulations, and a remodeling of nachs at intact and altered myelinated sites at a location just proximal to a combined partial axotomy and chromic suture lesion of the rat infraorbital nerve  with the use of an antibody that identifies all nach isoforms.
the augmentation of nav <dig>  may result from an alteration in axon-schwann cell signaling mechanisms as suggested by changes in caspr expression.
imagej  software was used to quantify the average size and density of nav <dig>  accumulations, while additional single fiber analyses measured the axial length of the nodal gap, and the immunofluorescence intensity of nav <dig>  in nodes and of caspr in the paranodal region.
the findings showed a significant increase in the average size and density of nav <dig>  accumulations in lesioned ions when compared to normal ions.
sections of the ion from normal and ion lesioned subjects were double-stained with antibodies against nav <dig>  and caspr  and then z-series of optically sectioned images were captured with a confocal microscope.
the results of the single fiber analyses in caspr-identified typical nodes showed an increased axial length of the nodal gap, an increased immunofluorescence intensity of nodal nav <dig>  and a decreased immunofluorescence intensity of paranodal caspr in lesioned ions when compared to normal ions.
the results of the present study identify nav <dig>  as one isoform involved in the augmentation and remodeling of nachs at nodal sites following a combined partial axotomy and chromic suture ion lesion.
