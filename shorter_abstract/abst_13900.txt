similarly, adapting the assay to detect 5-hmc finds highly reproducible 5-hmc levels within human, rhesus, and mouse brain tissue that is species-specific with a hierarchical abundance among the three species .
genomic studies of these marks using model systems are limited, particularly with array-based tools, because the standard method of detecting dna methylation cannot distinguish between 5-mc and 5-hmc and most methods have been developed to only survey the human genome.
together, these data show that this array-based methylation assay is generalizable to all mammals for the detection of both 5-mc and 5-hmc, greatly improving the utility of mammalian model systems to study the role of epigenetics in human health, disease, and evolution.
we show that non-human data generated using the optimization of a widely used human dna methylation array, designed only to detect 5-mc, reproducibly distinguishes tissue types within and between chimpanzee, rhesus, and mouse, with correlations near the human dna level .
restricting the analysis to oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes finds  <dig> differentially methylated loci, suggesting that rhesus placental tissue carries a cancer epigenetic signature.
the recent identification of another modified form of cytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine , in both stem cells and post-mitotic neurons, raises new questions as to the role of this base in mediating epigenetic effects.
genome-wide methylation analysis, using this approach, reveals  <dig>  differentially methylated loci between rhesus placental and fetal tissues with pathways analysis significantly overrepresented for developmental processes.
