interestingly cohv- <dig> infection was also confirmed for the first time in four non-raptorial birds.
the current study has shown a high similarity of cohv- <dig> strains and the possible transmission of herpesviruses between domestic rock pigeons and free-ranging birds including raptors and non-raptorial birds.
further studies focused on cloning and the analysis of the whole cohv- <dig> genome which is needed to explain the role of the observed similarities and differences between field strains of columbid herpesviruses.
in case of one cohv- <dig>  infected peregrine falcon , neurological signs were observed.
the identity of herpesviruses isolated in europe from domestic pigeons  as well as falcons and owls remains unknown.
the aim of the conducted study was to detect the occurrence of cohv- <dig> and estimating the similarities and differences in the dna-dependent dna polymerase gene of herpesviruses isolated from domestic pigeons, birds of prey and non-raptorial free-ranging birds in poland.
the falcons and owls are thought to have become infected during the ingestion of pigeon meat thus suggesting the virusâ€™s capacity to infect a wide range of hosts.
nucleotide sequencing of the dna-dependent dna polymerase gene, showed a high similarity among polish strains , independently from the species of the affected birds.
further analysis has shown the identity of dna-dependent dna polymerase of cohv- <dig> strains and other herpesviruses present in poultry as well as other birds ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.
