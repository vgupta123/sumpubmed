by contrast, rfbp resembled a peroxisomal catalase mutation, which augments the cytosolic h2o <dig>  to enhance fd and ap <dig> expression and induce early flowering.
flowering was delayed by the external riboflavin application, which brought gene expression and flavins back to the steady-state levels but only caused 55% reduction of h2o <dig> concentrations in rfbp+ plants.
the repressive effect on metc gene expression is not the only way by which rfbp induces h2o <dig> and currently unappreciated factors may also function under rfbp+ background.
here we report that rfbp-induced h2o <dig> presumably results from electron leakage at the mitochondrial electron transport chain  and this source of h2o <dig> contributes to the early flowering phenotype.
recently we showed that de novo expression of a turtle riboflavin-binding protein  in transgenic arabidopsis increased h2o <dig> concentrations inside leaf cells, enhanced the expression of floral regulatory gene fd and floral meristem identity gene ap <dig> at the shoot apex, and induced early flowering.
while enhanced expression of fd and ap <dig> at the shoot apex was correlated with early flowering, the foliar expression of  <dig> of  <dig> metc genes was repressed in rfbp-expressing  plants.
early flowering no longer occurred when the repression on metc genes was eliminated by rfbp gene silencing, which restored rfbp+ to wild type in levels of fd and ap <dig> expression, h2o <dig>  and flavins.
inside rfbp+ leaf cells, cytosolic h2o <dig> concentrations were increased possibly through electron leakage because similar responses were also induced by a known inducer of electron leakage from metc.
rfbp-repressed metc gene expression potentially causes electron leakage as one of cellular sources for the generation of h2o <dig> with the promoting effect on flowering.
rfbp-repressed metc gene expression remedied the cytosolic h2o <dig> diminution by genetic disruption of transcription factor nfxll and compensated for compromises in fd and ap <dig> expression and flowering time.
