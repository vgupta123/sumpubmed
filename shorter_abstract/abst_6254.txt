mechanical allodynia, cold and thermal hyperalgesia of cci rats began on the 4th day following surgery and maintained at the peak during the period from the 10th to 14th day after operation.
besides, activation of cold receptor trpm <dig> of cci rats by intrathecal application of menthol resulted in the inhibition of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia and the enhancement of cold hyperalgesia.
in contrast, downregulation of trpm <dig> protein in ipsilateral l <dig> drg of cci rats by intrathecal trpm <dig> antisense oligonucleotide attenuated cold hyperalgesia, but it had no effect on cci-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia.
trpm <dig> may play different roles in mechanical allodynia, cold and thermal hyperalgesia that develop after nerve injury, and it is a very promising research direction for the development of new therapies for chronic neuroapthic pain.
this time course of the alteration of trpm <dig> expression was consistent with that of cci-induced hyperalgesic response of the operated hind paw.
chronic neuropathic pain is an intractable pain with few effective treatments.
here we investigate the role of trpm <dig> in the mechanism of chronic neuropathic pain using a rat model of chronic constriction injury  to the sciatic nerve.
the level of trpm <dig> protein in l <dig> dorsal root ganglion  ipsilateral to nerve injury was significantly increased on the 4th day after cci, and reached the peak on the 10th day, and remained elevated on the 14th day following cci.
