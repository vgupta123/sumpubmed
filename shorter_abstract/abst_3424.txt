gbrlk is involved in the drought and high salinity stresses pathway by activating or participating in the aba signaling pathway.
we constructed a vector containing a  <dig> -bp sequence in the 5â€² region upstream of the initiation codon of this promoter and transformed it into arabidopsis thaliana.
gbrlk may be employed in the genetic engineering of novel cotton cultivars in the future.
receptor-like kinase  proteins play important roles in signal transduction and participate in a diverse range of processes in response to plant hormones and environmental cues.
sequence analysis revealed that the promoter region contains many cis-acting stress-responsive elements such as abre, w-box, myb-core, w-box core, tca-element and others.
expression analysis of stress-responsive genes in gbrlk arabidopsis revealed that there was increased expression of genes involved in the aba-dependent signaling pathway  and antioxidant genes  but not ion transporter genes .
transgenic arabidopsis with constitutive overexpression of gbrlk exhibited a reduced rate of water loss in leaves in vitro, along with improved salinity and drought tolerance and increased sensitivity to aba compared with non-transgenic col- <dig> arabidopsis.
overexpression of gbrlk may improve stress tolerance by regulating stress-responsive genes to reduce water loss.
gus histochemical staining analysis showed that gbrlk was expressed mainly in leaf veins, petioles and roots of transgenic arabidopsis, but not in the cotyledons or root hairs.
we cloned the promoter sequence of this gene via self-formed adaptor pcr.
here, we introduced an rlk gene  from cotton into arabidopsis and investigated its role in imparting abiotic stress tolerance.
gbrlk promoter activity was induced by aba, peg, nacl and verticillium dahliae.
