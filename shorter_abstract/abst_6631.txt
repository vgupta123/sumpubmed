targeted mutation of either hmx <dig> or hmx <dig> in mice disrupts the vestibular system.
additionally, these mutant hmx <dig> alleles represent the first mouse models of a recently-discovered oculo-auricular syndrome caused by mutation of the orthologous human gene.
these tandemly duplicated genes have functional overlap as indicated by the loss of the entire vestibular system in double mutants.
the h <dig> homeobox genes hmx <dig>  hmx <dig>  and hmx <dig> , compose a family within the nkl subclass of the antp class of homeobox genes.
hmx gene family expression is mostly limited to sensory organs, branchial  arches, and the rostral part of the central nervous system.
recombinant animals and specific deletion-bearing mice were used to map the dumbo mutation to a  <dig>  mb region on chromosome  <dig>  dna sequencing of genes in this region revealed a nonsense mutation in the first exon of h <dig> homeobox  <dig> .
here, we report on the basis of this phenotype and other abnormalities in the mutant, and identify the causative mutation as being an allele of hmx <dig>  examination of dumbo skulls revealed only subtle changes in cranial bone morphology, namely hyperplasia of the gonial bone and irregularities along the caudal border of the squamous temporal bone.
surviving mutants of both sexes exhibited reduced body mass from ~ <dig> days postpartum onwards.
mutants exhibit enlarged ear pinnae with a distinctive ventrolateral shift.
