cubense tropical race  <dig> , is considered the most lethal disease of cavendish bananas in the world.
this study generated a substantial amount of banana transcript sequences and compared the defense responses against foc tr <dig> between resistant and susceptible cavendish bananas.
expression patterns of genes involved in pathogen-associated molecular pattern  recognition, activation of effector-triggered immunity , ion influx, and biosynthesis of hormones as well as pathogenesis-related  genes, transcription factors, signaling/regulatory genes, cell wall modification genes and genes with other functions were analyzed and compared.
digital gene expression  analysis revealed large differences in the transcriptome profiles of the foc tr4-resistant somaclonal variant and its susceptible wild-type.
however, little information is available on the genetic basis of plant resistance to foc tr <dig>  to a better understand the defense response of resistant banana plants to the fusarium wilt pathogen, the transcriptome profiles in roots of resistant and susceptible cavendish banana challenged with foc tr <dig> were compared.
fusarium wilt, caused by the fungal pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
the results indicated that basal defense mechanisms are involved in the recognition of pamps, and that high levels of defense-related transcripts may contribute to foc tr <dig> resistance in banana.
the results contribute to the identification of candidate genes related to plant resistance in a non-model organism, banana, and help to improve the current understanding of host-pathogen interactions.
