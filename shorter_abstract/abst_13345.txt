we obtained a nearly complete source of transcriptomic sequence as well as marker information for sharpsnout seabream, laying the ground for understanding the complex process of sex differentiation of this economically valuable species.

teleosts are characterized by a remarkable breadth of sexual mechanisms including various forms of hermaphroditism.
focused search for known targets of sex determination and differentiation in vertebrates built the sex-specific expression profile of sharpsnout seabream.
apart from the intriguing reproductive biology, it is economically important with a continuously growing aquaculture in the mediterranean sea, but limited available genetic resources.
the sparid diplodus puntazzo , exhibits rudimentary hermaphroditism characterized by intersexual immature gonads but single-sex mature ones.
the expression analysis uncovered remarkable differences between male and female gonads, while male and female brains were almost identical.
our aim was to characterize the expressed transcriptome of gonads and brains through rna-sequencing and explore the properties of genes that exhibit sex-biased expression profiles.
