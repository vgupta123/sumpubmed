unexpectedly, necdin loss of function has no effect on p75ntr expressing neurons suggesting no direct genetic interaction between necdin and p75ntr in this context.
in this study, we investigate sensory-motor behaviour in necdin deficient mice.
although we exclude a role of necdin in axonal outgrowth from spinal sensory neurons in early developmental stages; such a role could occur later in neuronal differentiation.
overall, our data show clearly that, in early development of the nervous system, necdin is an anti-apoptotic or survival factor.
despite the putative roles attributed to necdin, mainly from in vitro studies, its in vivo function remains unclear.
the human necdin gene is involved in a neurodevelopmental disorder, prader-willi syndrome .
first, we describe the expression pattern of necdin in developing drgs and report a reduction of one-third in specified sensory neurons in dorsal roots ganglia and show that this neuronal loss is achieved by e <dig> , when drgs sensory neurons are specified.
previously we reported a mouse necdin knock-out model with similar defects to pws patients.
we reveal cellular defects and analyse their cause.
finally we also exclude an anti-proliferative role of necdin in developing sensory neurons.
we report sensory differences in necdin deficient mice compared to wild type animals.
in parallel, we observed an increase of 41% in neuronal apoptosis during the wave of naturally occurring cell death at e <dig> .
