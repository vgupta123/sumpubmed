fehv- <dig> was isolated from the conjunctiva, cornea, uveal tract, retina, optic nerve, ciliary ganglion , pterygopalatine ganglion , trigeminal ganglion , brainstem, visual cortex, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb of infected cats during the acute phase, but not the cranial cervical ganglion  and optic chiasm.
using linear regression, a strong correlation existed between clinical score and day  <dig> viral dna copy number within the tg.
the correlation between clinical score and day  <dig> viral dna copy number suggests the severity of the acute clinical infection is related to the quantity of latent viral dna.
the histologic response was similar to that seen during hsv- <dig> or vzv infection.
viral dna was detected in all tissues during acute infection by a real-time quantitative pcr assay.
on day  <dig>  viral dna was detected in all tg, all ccg, and  <dig> ptpg.
herpes simplex virus  <dig>  and varicella zoster virus  cause extensive intra-ocular and neural infections in humans and are closely related to felid herpes virus  <dig> .
histologically mild inflammation and ganglion cell loss were noted within the tg during acute, but not latent infection.
to the authorâ€™s knowledge this is the first report of fehv- <dig> infection involving intraocular structures and autonomic ganglia.
