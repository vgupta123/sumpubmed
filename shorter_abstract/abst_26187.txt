tight junctions  maintain the intestinal mucosal barrier, dysfunction of which plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders.
in addition, ipec-j <dig> cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 24 h, following pre-treatment with l. reuteri i <dig> or its culture supernatant for 2 h. the results showed that lps time-dependently induced  the expression of tnf-α and il- <dig>  and decreased tj proteins, which was reversed by pre-treatment of l. reuteri i <dig> or its culture supernatant.
l. reuteri i <dig> had beneficial effects on the expression of tj proteins in newborn piglets and the in-vitro results showed this strain had a positive effect on teer of cells and inhibited the reduction of tj proteins expression induced by lps.
in vitro, treatment with l. reuteri i <dig> alone maintained the transepithelial electrical resistance  of ipec-j <dig> cells with time.
previously, we have shown that l. reuteri i <dig> maintained the gut epithelial barrier in newborn piglets.
we found that l. reuteri i <dig> significantly increased the protein abundance of intestinal epithelial claudin- <dig>  occludin and zonula occluden- <dig>  in newborn piglets .

these findings indicated l. reuteri i <dig> may have potential roles in protection tj proteins in tj-deficient conditions.
