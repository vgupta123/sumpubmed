the length of cotton fiber is an important agronomic trait that directly affects the quality of yarn and fabric.
further investigations of differentially expressed mirnas in the li <dig> and li <dig> mutants will contribute to better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of cotton fiber development.
thus, our results will contribute to further studies on the role of mirnas in cotton fiber development and will provide a tool for fiber improvement through molecular breeding.
the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas revealed significant negative correlation with fiber lengths of  <dig> cotton lines.
small rna libraries constructed from developing fiber cells of the short fiber mutants li <dig> and li <dig> and their near-isogenic wild type lines were sequenced.
our results suggested that the mutations have changed the regulation of mirnas expression during fiber development.
ligon-lintless- <dig>  and âˆ’ <dig>  are monogenic and dominant mutations that result in an extreme reduction in the length of lint fiber on mature seeds.
in a near-isogenic state with wild type cotton these two short fiber mutants provide an effective model system to study the mechanisms of fiber elongation.
expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas were examined across a fiber developmental time course in wild type and short fiber mutations.
understanding the molecular basis of fiber elongation would provide a means for improvement of fiber length.
four mirnas negatively correlated with fiber length are good candidates for further investigations of mirna regulation of important genotype dependent fiber traits.
we conducted correlation analysis between mirna transcript abundance and the length of fiber for  <dig> diverse upland cotton lines.
the distribution of the target genes into functional categories revealed the largest set of genes were transcription factors.
however, the mechanism underlying the mirna-mediated regulation of fiber development is largely unknown.
we identified  <dig> conservative and  <dig> novel mirna families with targets that were detected through degradome sequencing.
