for egypt, future work should focus on using data about vaccination and live bird markets in phylogeography models to study their impact on h5n <dig> diffusion within the country.
in particular, the al qalyubiyah governorate appears to represent a popular location for virus transition as it represented a large portion of branches in both trees.
phylogeography models of hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase  suggest ash sharqiyah as the origin of virus spread, however the support is weak based on kullbackâ€“leibler values of  <dig>  for ha and  <dig>  for na.
we found that the majority of routes with strong statistical support were in the heavily populated delta region.
influenza a h5n <dig> has killed millions of birds and raises serious public health concern because of its potential to spread to humans and cause a global pandemic.
in addition, the ash sharqiyah to al gharbiyah and al fayyum to al qalyubiyah routes had the strongest statistical support.
this allowed modeling of virus dispersion between egyptian governorates including the most likely origin.
however, there remains uncertainty about virus dispersion to and from this location and thus more research needs to be conducted in order to examine this.
association index  values and parsimony scores  were significant , indicating that dispersion of h5n <dig> in egypt was geographically structured.
while the early focus was in asia, recent evidence suggests that egypt is a new epicenter for the disease.
