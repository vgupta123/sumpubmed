here, we assess mirna strand selection bias in humans and fruit flies by analyzing the sequence composition and relative expression levels of the two strands of the precursor duplex in these species.
finally, the observed strand selection determinants are instrumental in the rational design of efficient mirna-based expression regulators.
further, it indicates that human and fly mirna processing pathways are more distinct than currently recognized.
we find that the sequence elements associated with preferential mirna strand selection and/or rejection differ between the two species.
our result provides clues to the mechanistic aspects of mirna strand selection in humans and other mammals.
further, we identify another feature that distinguishes human and fly mirna processing machinery: the relative accuracy of the drosha and dicer enzymes.
while thermodynamic asymmetry of the duplex ends appears to play a decisive role in the strand selection process, the details of the selection mechanism are not yet understood.
