we sampled  <dig> crater lakes and six potentially-ancestral older lakes and, using both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers, discovered strong genetic and morphological differentiation whereby  geographically close lakes tend to be genetically more similar and  three different geographic areas seem to have been colonized by three independent waves of colonization from the same source population.
a pattern of strong genetic and morphological differentiation was observed in the ugandan crater lakes.
southwestern uganda is an area of high tectonic activity, and is home to numerous crater lakes.
the observed morphological changes in crater lake cichlids are likely to result from a common selective regime.
in particular, haplochromine cichlids, by far the most species-rich lineage of cichlids, are a well-known textbook example for parallel evolution.
many ugandan crater lakes were colonized, apparently independently, by a single lineage of haplochromine cichlids.
thereby, this system could be considered a natural experiment in which one can study the interaction between geographical isolation and natural selection promoting phenotypic diversification.
our data suggest that body shape changes have repeatedly evolved into a more limnetic-like form in several ugandan crater lakes after independent waves of colonization from the same source population.
