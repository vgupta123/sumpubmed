this paper presents a novel approach, namely rbt-ga, to solve the msa problem using a hybrid solution methodology combining the rubber band technique  and the genetic algorithm  metaheuristic.
rbt-ga is a population based optimization algorithm designed to find the optimal alignment for a set of input protein sequences.
the obtained results show that the superiority of the proposed technique even in the case of formidable sequences.
a ga-based optimization process improves these chromosomes gradually yielding a set of mostly optimal answers for the msa problem.
rbt is inspired by the behavior of an elastic rubber band  on a plate with several poles, which is analogues to locations in the input sequences that could potentially be biologically related.
these poles resemble locations in the input sequences that are most likely to be correlated and/or biologically related.
in this novel technique, each alignment answer is modeled as a chromosome consisting of several poles in the rbt framework.
