to visually summarize results, the user interface provides a 2d histogram for user-selected metadata types and mapping of geolocated entries.
along with genomic nucleotide sequence data, this metadata is growing rapidly and becoming a valuable resource not only for research but for biosurveillance and public health.
the software provides a user interface to query metadata and obtain standardized results in an exportable, tab-delimited format.
however, current freely available tools for analyzing this data are geared towards bioinformaticians and/or do not provide summaries and visualizations needed to readily interpret results.
pathogen metadata includes information about where and when a pathogen was collected and the type of environment it came from.
this software enables users to create a local database for pathogen metadata, populate it with data from ncbi, easily query the data, and obtain visual summaries.
the software includes a postgresql database that captures metadata useful for disease outbreak investigations, and scripts for downloading and parsing data from ncbi biosample and bioproject into the database.
we designed a platform to easily access and summarize data about pathogen samples.
