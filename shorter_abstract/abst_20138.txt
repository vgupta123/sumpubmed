holoenzyme molecular mass was defined by dynamic light scattering analysis and gel filtration, and the results suggested that the holoenzyme is a dimer.
the purpose of the present study was to perform extensive sequence analysis to show that the β-cas are present in invertebrates and to clone and characterize a member of this enzyme family from a representative model organism of the animal kingdom, e.g., drosophila melanogaster.
double immunostaining confirmed predictions based on sequence analysis and localized dmbca protein to mitochondria.
it was moderately inhibited by halides, pseudohalides, hydrogen sulfide, bisulfite and sulfate  and more potently by sulfamide .
the corresponding recombinant enzyme was produced in sf <dig> insect cells, purified, kinetically characterized, and its inhibition was investigated with a series of simple, inorganic anions.
the drosophila β-ca represents a highly active mitochondrial enzyme that is a potential model enzyme for anti-parasitic drug development.
the novel β-ca gene, here named dmbca, was identified from flybase, and its orthologs were searched and reconstructed from sequence databases, confirming the presence of β-ca sequences in  <dig> metazoan species.
the enzyme showed high co <dig> hydratase activity, with a kcat of  <dig>  ×  <dig> s- <dig> and a kcat/km of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m-1s- <dig>  dmbca was appreciably inhibited by the clinically-used sulfonamide acetazolamide, with an inhibition constant of  <dig> nm.
