although additional studies are required to conclusively characterize the nature of chlamydial immunoreactivity in the ad brain, these results further implicate c. pneumoniae infection with the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease.
immunoreactivity for c. pneumoniae antigens was observed both intracellularly in neurons, neuroglia, endothelial cells, and peri-endothelial cells, and extracellularly in the frontal and temporal cortices of the ad brain with multiple c. pneumoniae-specific antibodies.
anti-c. pneumoniae antibodies, obtained commercially, identified both typical intracellular and atypical extracellular c. pneumoniae antigens in frontal and temporal cortices of the ad brain.
our current investigation utilized immunohistochemistry with a battery of commercially available anti-c. pneumoniae antibodies to determine whether c. pneumoniae was present in areas typically associated with ad neuropathology from  <dig> ad and  <dig> non-ad control brains.
thioflavin s staining, overlaid with c. pneumoniae immunolabeling, demonstrated no direct co-localization of the organism and amyloid plaques.
further, the specificity of c. pneumoniae labeling of ad brain sections was demonstrated using c. pneumoniae antibodies pre-absorbed against amyloid Î² 1- <dig> and 1- <dig> peptides.
c. pneumoniae, amyloid deposits, and neurofibrillary tangles were present in the same regions of the brain in apposition to one another.
sporadic late-onset alzheimer's disease  appears to evolve from an interplay between genetic and environmental factors.
