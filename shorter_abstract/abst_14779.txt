furthermore, the use of inducible promoters to drive shrna expression allows for more thorough investigations into the specific timing of gene function in a variety of cellular processes.
therefore, we sought to refine a popular vector  and streamline the cloning process with efficient protocols so that researchers can more efficiently utilize this powerful tool.
with this knowledge, anyone can take advantage of this powerful tool to inducibly knockdown any gene of their choosing.
notably, we emphasize the importance of loop sequence design and demonstrate that the addition of a single mismatch in the loop stem can greatly improve shrna efficiency.
our primary modification was to shrink the stuffer region, which allows vector purification via polyethylene glycol precipitation thereby avoiding the need to purify dna through agarose.
lastly, we display the robustness of the system with a doxycycline titration and recovery time course and provide a cost/benefit analysis comparing our system with purchasing pre-designed shrna vectors.
first, we modified the tet-plko-puro vector to make it easy  for molecular cloning .
in addition, we generated ez-tet-plko vectors with hygromycin or blasticidin resistance to provide greater flexibility in cell line engineering.
short hairpin rna  is an established and effective tool for stable knock down of gene expression.
