although evolutionary analysis is important to reveal the functional dynamics of mirnas, few computational tools have been developed to analyze the evolution of mirna sequence and expression across species, especially the newly emerged ones,
we developed mirevo, an integrated software platform with a graphical user interface , to process deep-sequencing data of small rnas and to analyze mirna sequence and expression evolution based on the multiple-species whole genome alignments .
moreover, we demonstrated the utility of mirevo with illumina data sets from drosophila melanogaster and arabidopsis, respectively.
three major features are provided by mirevo:  to identify novel mirnas in both plants and animals, based on a modified mirdeep algorithm,  to detect mirna homologs and measure their pairwise evolutionary distances among multiple species based on a wga, and  to profile mirna expression abundances and analyze expression divergence across multiple species .
