postweaning diarrhoea  in pigs is usually the main infectious problem of large-scale farms and is responsible for significant losses worldwide.
furthermore, our results show that there is a high genetic variation mainly among etec of o149:h <dig> serotype.
the disease is caused mainly by enterotoxigenic e. coli  and shiga-toxin producing e. coli .
in this study a total of  <dig> e. coli isolated from pigs with pwd in slovakia were characterized using phenotypic and genotypic methods.
these  <dig> isolates belonged to  <dig> o:h serotypes.
however, 57% of the isolates belonged to only six serotypes , including two new serotypes  not previously found among porcine etec and stec isolated in other countries.
seropathotype o149:h <dig> lt/stb/east1/f <dig>  was the most commonly detected followed by o163:h- east1/f <dig> , and ont:h <dig> sta/stb/stx2e/f <dig> .
isolates of the same serotype were placed together in the dendrogram, but high degree of polymorphism among certain serotypes was detected.
interestingly, this study shows that two new serotypes  have emerged as pig pathogens in slovakia.
the study of genetic diversity, carried out by pfge of  <dig> representative etec and stec isolates, revealed  <dig> distinct restriction profiles clustered in eight groups.
