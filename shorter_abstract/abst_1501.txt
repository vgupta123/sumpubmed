however, the contribution of this paper is to provide a tool to identify genes that are disconnected between the two systems.
pathway analysis of disconnected genes may improve our understanding of uncertainties in the mechanism of actions of drug candidates in humans, especially concerning the early detection of toxicity.
we also identified compounds that were likely to induce disconnect in gene expression between in vitro and in vivo toxicogenomic rat experiments.

the results confirmed that there are important discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo toxicogenomic experiments.
the analytical framework is based on the joint modeling of dose-dependent in vitro and in vivo data using a fractional polynomial framework and biclustering algorithm.
most disconnected genes identified belonged to known pathways, such as drug metabolism and oxidative stress due to reactive metabolites, bilirubin increase, glutathion depletion and phospholipidosis.
however, general lack of translation of in vitro findings to in vivo systems remains one of the bottle necks in drug development.
