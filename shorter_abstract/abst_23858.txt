the availability of the giant panda complete genome sequences provided the opportunity to carry out genome-wide scans for all types of microsatellites markers, which now opens the way for the analysis and development of microsatellites in giant panda.
finally, a total of  <dig> markers, which showed good polymorphism, stability, and repetition in faecal samples, were used to establish the novel microsatellite marker system for giant panda.
what’s more, a universal individual identification method was established and the genetic diversity were analysed in this study as the applications of this marker system.

microsatellites have been preferred as the most popular molecular markers and proven effective in estimating population size, paternity test, genetic diversity for the critically endangered species.
the individual identification method and the genetic diversity analysis method in this study provided adequate material for the future study of giant panda.
by screening the whole genome sequence of giant panda in silico mining, we identified microsatellites in the genome of giant panda and analyzed their frequency and distribution in different genomic regions.
the  <dig> novel polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci were discovered based on genotyping blood dna from  <dig> captive giant pandas in this study.
meanwhile, a genotyping database for chengdu captive giant pandas  were set up using this standardized system.
the giant panda  is a critically endangered species endemic to china.
the microsatellite abundance and diversity were characterized in giant panda genomes.
a total of  <dig> primer pairs were designed to screen for polymorphic microsatellites using the selected tetranucleotide microsatellite sequences.
