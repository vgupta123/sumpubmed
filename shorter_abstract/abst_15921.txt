loss-of-function of tem <dig> exerts no significant difference on salt tolerance or cor15a expression in arabidopsis.
trihelix transcription factor family is plant-specific and plays important roles in developmental processes.
we studied one member gt- <dig> from arabidopsis in relation to salt stress response.
gt- <dig> expression is induced by salt stress and gt- <dig> protein is localized in nucleus and cytoplasm.
however, double mutant gt-4/tem <dig> shows greater sensitivity to salt stress and lower transcript level of cor15a than gt- <dig> single mutant.
gt- <dig> interacts with tem <dig> and then co-regulates the salt responsive gene cor15a to improve salt stress tolerance.

however, their function in abiotic stress response is largely unclear.
the protein can bind to the cis-elements gt- <dig> box, gt-3b box and mre <dig>  gt- <dig> confers enhanced salt tolerance in arabidopsis likely through direct binding to the promoter and activation of cor15a, in addition to possible regulation of other relevant genes.
gt- <dig> acts as a transcriptional activator and its c-terminal end is the activation domain.
