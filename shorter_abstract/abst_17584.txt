the results showed that both yeast mainly activated the genes related to translation machinery by comparing 12°c with 28°c, but the s. kudriavzevii response was stronger, showing an increased expression of dozens of genes involved in protein synthesis.
in this work, we aimed to provide new insights into the molecular basis determining this better cold adaptation of s. kudriavzevii strains.
we propose that this adaptation is based on its enhanced ability to initiate a quick, efficient translation of crucial genes in cold adaptation among others, a mechanism that has been suggested for other microorganisms.
since the species saccharomyces kudriavzevii is adapted to grow at low temperatures, it has been suggested that it contains physiological adaptations that allow it to rapidly and efficiently acclimatise after cold shock.
this suggested enhanced translation efficiency at low temperatures, which was confirmed when we observed increased resistance to translation inhibitor paromomycin.
this work confirms that s. kudriavzevii is able to grow at low temperatures, an interesting ability for different industrial applications.
to this end, we have compared s. cerevisiae and s. kudriavzevii transcriptome after yeast adapted to cold shock.
finally, 35s-methionine incorporation assays confirmed the increased s. kudriavzevii translation rate after cold shock.
