most evidence-based gene predictors use transcripts from other species to annotate a genome, but the predictive power of procedures that use exclusively transcripts from external species has never been quantified.
we propose a rigorous procedural definition of splicing orthologs, based on the identification of all ortholog pairs of splicing sites in the nucleotide sequences, and alignments at the protein level.
using our definition, we compared  <dig>  <dig> human transcripts and  <dig>  <dig> mouse transcripts from the highly curated ccds database, and identified  <dig>  <dig> splicing orthologs.
transcriptome reconstruction, defined as the identification of all protein isoforms that may be expressed by a gene, is a notably difficult computational task.
while waiting for algorithms and sequencing techniques to improve — as has been strongly suggested in the literature — it is important to evaluate assisted transcriptome prediction; this is the question of how alternative transcription in one species performs as a predictor of protein isoforms in another relatively close species.
in prediction mode, we show that human transcripts can be used to infer over  <dig> % of mouse protein isoforms.
