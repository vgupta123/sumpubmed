therefore, in order to understand the dynamics of growth in fish it is important to consider the background influence of photoperiod regime on gene expression differences.
twenty-three out of  <dig> gene families with previously reported significant snp-based growth differences were detected as having significant expression differences.
large fish display a physiological repertoire that may be consistent with strength/resistance physiology having elevated cytoskeletal gene component expression and glycogen metabolism cycling along with higher pi3k levels.
in many respects small vs. large fish match eccentric vs. concentric muscle expression patterns, respectively.
m and z-line sarcomere remodelling appears to be more prevalent in large fish.
larger fish display a broader array of genes showing higher expression, and their profiles are more similar to those observed in december lot fish .
increasing water temperature elevates growth rates in fishes, but increases in photoperiod regime can have similar influences even at constant temperature.
this study examined the influence of a declining photoperiod regime  compared to an increasing photoperiod regime  on white muscle transcriptome profiles in fast and slow-growing rainbow trout from a commercial aquaculture strain.
slow-growing fish could be characterized as possessing transcriptome profiles that conform in many respects to an endurance training regime in humans.
overall, seasonal timing was coupled to greater differences in gene expression compared to differences associated with fish size.
lipid metabolic genes are also more elevated in larger fish, the most notable being the g0s <dig> switch gene.
