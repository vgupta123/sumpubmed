notorious throughout the world, the quintessential leech family hirudinidae has been taken for granted to be monophyletic, as has the non-bloodfeeding family haemopidae.
members of the non-bloodfeeding family haemopidae were scattered throughout the tree and among traditional hirudinid genera.
the african distribution of species from each of the divergent hirudinid clades suggests that a deep divergence took place in the history of the medicinal leeches hundreds of millions of years ago.
the family hirudinidae must be refined to include only the clade containing hirudo medicinalis  and related leeches irrespective of bloodfeeding behavior.
medicinal leeches became infamous for their utility in bloodletting popularized in the 19th century, and have seen a recent resurgence in post-operative treatments for flap and replantation surgeries, and in terms of characterization of salivary anticoagulants.
