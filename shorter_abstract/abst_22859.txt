we apply the cumulative plot to the detection of regions with copy number variation/alteration, on samples taken from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient.
they represent a new type of mutation and are larger-scaled than the single nucleotide polymorphisms.
regions with copy number variations  or copy number alteration  are of great interest for human disease gene mapping and cancer studies.
two sets of whole-genome genotyping of  <dig> k single nucleotide polymorphisms, one from the normal cell and another from the cancer cell, are analyzed.
we demonstrate the utility of cumulative plot in detecting a  <dig> mb  hemizygous deletion and  <dig> mb homozygous deletion on chromosome  <dig>  we also show the possibility to detect smaller copy number variation/alteration regions below the  <dig> kb range.
as a graphic tool, the cumulative plot is an intuitive and a scale-free  way for detecting copy number variation/alteration regions, especially when such regions are small.
