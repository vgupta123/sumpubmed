these studies demonstrate that pgl4-cish is a novel and sensitive reporter for assessing the activity of the prl/stat <dig> signaling pathway in the er+ human breast cancer cells.
elevations of serum prolactin  are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer.
interestingly, the enhanced function pgl4-cish was restricted to the estrogen receptor positive  human breast cancer cell lines t47d and mcf <dig>  but not in the er-mda- <dig>  bt- <dig>  or mcf10a cell lines.
