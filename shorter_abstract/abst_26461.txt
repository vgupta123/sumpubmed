thus, a full-sib family derived from an intraspecific cross of p. nigra with  <dig> clonally replicated progeny was used to assess the phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation of bud set in two sites of contrasting environmental conditions.
poplar is an ideal model tree to study bud set because of its indeterminate shoot growth.
moreover, a considerable role of genotype Ã— environment  interaction was found in all phenological stages with the lowest temperature appearing to influence the sensitivity of the most plastic genotypes.
comparison between map location of qtl and p. trichocarpa genome sequence allowed the identification of  <dig> gene models,  <dig> bud set-related expressional and six functional candidate genes .
descriptors of growth cessation and bud onset explained the largest part of phenotypic variation of the entire process.
for the four selected traits , the transition from shoot to bud , the duration of bud formation  and bud maturation ) eight and sixteen qtl were mapped on the maternal and paternal map, respectively.
night length appeared to be the most important signal triggering the onset of growth cessation.
six crucial phenological stages of bud set were scored.
nevertheless, the effect of other environmental factors, such as temperature, increased during the process.
the putative qtl identified will be tested for associations in p. nigra natural populations.
