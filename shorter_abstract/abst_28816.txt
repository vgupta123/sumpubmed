serum response factor , a member of the mads box family of nuclear transcription factors, plays an important role in cardiovascular development and function.
tie <dig> is a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed predominantly on endothelial cells that mediates signalling during different stages of blood vessel remodelling.
these results provide the first in vivo evidence in support of a role for srf in endothelial cell function and strongly suggest srf is required for appropriate vascular remodelling.
mice expressing cre recombinase  under tie <dig> promoter control were bred to mice homozygous for srf alleles containing loxp recombination sites within the srf gene .
numerous studies demonstrate a central role for srf in regulating smooth and cardiac muscle cell gene expression.
to investigate this, we generated transgenic mice lacking expression of srf in endothelial cells.
immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of vascular endothelial cells; however, vessels failed to undergo appropriate remodelling.
initial analysis by electron microscopy suggested a lack of appropriate cell-cell contacts between endothelial cells.
tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos appeared to develop normally compared to wild-type littermates until embryonic day  <dig>  .
hearts of mutant embryos were smaller relative to overall body weight compared to wild-type littermates.
consistent with this, loss of srf function blocks differentiation of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells from proepicardial precursors, indicating srf is necessary for coronary vasculogenesis.
beginning at e <dig> , tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos exhibited cerebrovascular hemorrhaging and severely disrupted vascular networks within the yolk sac.
hemorrhaging in mutant embryos became more generalized with age, and by e <dig> , most tie2cre+/-srff/f embryos observed were nonviable and grossly necrotic.
consistent with this, disrupted e-cadherin staining patterns were observed in mutant embryos.
