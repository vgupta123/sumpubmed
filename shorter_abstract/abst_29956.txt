we provide gene expression profile for human glial precursors.
we have generated gene expression databases for human glial precursors, neuronal precursors, astrocyte precursors and neural stem cells and focused on comparing the profile of glial precursors with that of other populations.
such information may be utilized to further purify glial precursor populations, optimize media formulation, or study the effects of glial differentiation.
each population, previously distinguished from each other by immunocytochemical analysis of cell surface markers, expressed genes related to their key differentiation pathways.
we also report genes encoding cell surface markers that may be useful for identification and purification of human glial precursor populations.
our data suggest several signaling pathways that are important for proliferation and differentiation of human glial precursors.
