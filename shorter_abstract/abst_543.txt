machine learning approaches are emerging as a way to discriminate various classes of functional elements.
for instance, bidirectional promoters score very highly among all functional elements for regulatory potential scores.
furthermore bidirectional promoters consistently score at the level of very highly conserved functional elements in the genome- developmental enhancers.
our algorithm measured the robustness of evidence provided by the spliced est annotations and incorporated evidence from annotations of ucsc known genes and genbank mrna.
using a multiple class predictor we are able to discriminate bidirectional promoters from enhancers, non-bidirectional promoters, and non-promoter regions on the basis of rp scores and cpg islands.
these results indicate that high-scoring rp regions can be deconvoluted into various functional classes of genomic elements.
we examine orthology at bidirectional promoters, use discriminatory machine learning approaches to differentiate multiple types of promoters from other functional and nonfunctional features in the genome and begin the process of deconvoluting classes of functional regions that score well with rp scores.
we extended our previous work, which identified over  <dig>  candidate bidirectional promoters in the human genome, to map the orthologous promoter regions in the mouse genome.
we demonstrate that bidirectional promoters can be classified apart from other genomic features including non-bidirectional promoters, i.e.
these types of approaches precede supervised learning techniques to discover unannotated promoter regions.
this result was unexpected due to the limited sequence conservation found in these noncoding regions.
we proposed that knowledge gleaned from those methods could be further refined using a multiple class predictor to separate classes of promoter elements from enhancers or nonfunctional dna.
