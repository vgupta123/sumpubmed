the current gold standard in dimension reduction methods for high-throughput genotype data is the principle component analysis .
further, we compare the performance of ics also to five other popular dimension reduction methods.
second, we apply the ics method on a chicken dataset and also detect there two subgroups.
the ics method was able to detect subgroups in data where the pca fails to detect anything.
we use ics on both, a simulated and a real dataset to demonstrate first some deficiencies of pca and how ics is capable to recover the correct subgroups within the simulated data.
the more commonly known independent component analysis  is in this framework just a special case of ics.
