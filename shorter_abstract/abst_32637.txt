apparently healthy farmed rabbits that go to slaughter may carry m. avium subspecies in gut associated lymphoid tissue.
<dig> %  of the animals presented gross lesions suggestive of lymphoid activation,  <dig> %  presented granulomatous lesions and  <dig> %  contained acid fast bacilli.
although, rabbit meat production worldwide is  <dig> million tons per year, microbiological data on this source of meat is lacking and more specifically reports of mycobacterial presence in industrially reared rabbit for human consumption have not been published.
rabbits are susceptible to infection by different species of the genus mycobacterium.
paratuberculosis, both subspecies of the m. avium complex, has been reported in wildlife conditions.
hominissuis was detected in  <dig>  %  of gut associated lymphoid tissue of sampled animals by pcr, whereas caecal contents were negative.
particularly, development of specific lesions and isolation of mycobacterium avium subsp.
to this end, we sought mycobacteria by microbiological and histopathological methods paying special attention to mycobacterium avium subsp.
avium was detected in  <dig>  %  and mycobacterium avium subsp.
