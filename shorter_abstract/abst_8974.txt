although gains of ubiquitylation sites do not necessarily equate to adaptive evolution, they are useful candidates for molecular functional analyses to identify novel advantageous genetic modifications and innovative phenotypes acquired during human evolution.
post-translational modification of lysine residues of specific proteins by ubiquitin modulates the degradation, localization, and activity of these target proteins.
we analyzed human ubiquitylation site data and multiple alignments of orthologous mammalian proteins including those from humans, primates, other placental mammals, opossum, and platypus.
here, we identified gains of ubiquitylation sites in highly conserved regions of human proteins that occurred during human evolution.
in our analysis, we identified  <dig> ubiquitylation sites in  <dig> proteins that first appeared along the human lineage during primate evolution: one protein had four novel sites; four proteins had three sites each;  <dig> proteins had two sites each; and the remaining  <dig> proteins had one site each.
the gain of novel ubiquitylation sites could be involved in the evolution of protein degradation and other regulatory networks.
thirteen human proteins, including ercc <dig>  and nbr <dig>  gained human-specific ubiquitylated lysines after the human-chimpanzee divergence.
ercc <dig> has a lys/gln polymorphism, the derived  allele of which confers enhanced dna repair capacity and reduced cancer risk compared with the ancestral  allele.
nbr <dig> and eight other proteins that are involved in the human autophagy protein interaction network gained a novel ubiquitylation site.
