it is easy in use, fast, and cheap compared to other high-resolution molecular methods and therefore an important tool for surveillance and outbreak studies for s. enteritidis.
emphasis was given on the most predominant phage types pt <dig> and pt <dig>  the method comprises multiplex pcr specifically amplifying repeated sequences from nine different loci followed by an automatic fragment size analysis using a multicolor capillary electrophoresis instrument.
a total of  <dig> human, animal, food and environmental isolates of s. enteritidis including  <dig> definite phage types were used for development and validation.
furthermore, the mlva types were compared to the phage types of several isolates from two recent outbreaks to determine the concordance between both methods and to estimate their in vivo stability.
seventy-nine different mlva types were identified in  <dig> s. enteritidis strains.
this mlva method is useful to discriminate s. enteritidis strains even within a single phage type.
the in vitro stability of the two mlva types specifically for pt <dig> and pt <dig> strains were determined by multiple freeze-thaw cycles.
the in vitro stability experiments showed no changes of the mlva type compared to the original isolate.
the simpson's diversity index for the mlva method was  <dig>  and nei diversity values for the nine vntr loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .
twenty-four mlva types could be assigned to  <dig> pt <dig> strains and  <dig> types to  <dig> pt <dig> strains.
all outbreak isolates had an indistinguishable outbreak specific mlva type.
