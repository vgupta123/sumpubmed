nf <dig> inactivation may alter the transcriptional landscape of a tumor and allow a machine learning classifier to detect which tumors will benefit from synthetic lethal molecules.
however, recognizing tumors that have inactivation of the nf <dig> tumor suppressor function is challenging because the loss may occur via mechanisms that do not involve mutation of the genomic locus.
on tcga data, the classifier detected nf <dig> mutated tumors  mean =  <dig> , 95% quantile =  <dig>  –  <dig> ) over  <dig> random initializations.
we applied our ensemble classifier trained on the transformed tcga data to a microarray validation set of  <dig> samples with matched rna and nf <dig> protein-level measurements.
the ensemble classifier performed well for samples with very high or very low nf <dig> protein concentrations but had mixed performance in samples with intermediate nf <dig> concentrations.
we developed a strategy to predict tumors with low nf <dig> activity and hence tumors that may respond to treatments that target cells lacking nf <dig>  using rnaseq data from the cancer genome atlas , we trained an ensemble of  <dig> logistic regression classifiers that integrates mutation status with whole transcriptomes to predict nf <dig> inactivation in glioblastoma .
