the phosphoinositide  signalling pathway regulates a series of neuronal processes, such as neurotransmitter release, that are thought to be altered in mood disorders.
furthermore, mood-stabilising drugs have been shown to inhibit key enzymes that regulate pins production and alter neuronal growth cone morphology in an inositol-reversible manner.
the transporter is localised at the golgi apparatus in primary cultured neurones.
we show that hmit is primarily a neuronal transporter widely expressed in the rat and human brain, with particularly high levels in the hippocampus and cortex, as shown by immunohistochemistry.
