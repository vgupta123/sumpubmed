here, we characterize the evolution and function of the spata <dig> gene family , which was previously shown to be among the gene families with the strongest signal of positive selection in hominoids.
segmental duplications are an abundant source for novel gene functions and evolutionary adaptations.
the increased segmental duplications in hominoids as well as its fast evolution suggest the acquisition of further specific functions particularly in humans.

we used crispr/cas mediated mutagenesis to knockout copies of the gene in human primary fibroblast cells.
copy number estimates of spata31a based on digital pcr show an average of  <dig>  with a range of 5– <dig> copies per diploid genome among human individuals.
the primate spata <dig> genes also acquired new protein domains that suggest an involvement in uv response and dna repair.
we find that cell lines with reduced functional copies as well as naturally occurring low copy number hff cells show enhanced sensitivity towards uv-irradiation.
this mechanism of generating novelty was very active during the evolution of primates particularly in the human lineage.
the mouse homologue for this gene family is a single copy gene expressed during spermatogenesis.
