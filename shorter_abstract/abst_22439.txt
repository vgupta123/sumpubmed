however, such methods suffer from low hit rates of positive clones and hence the discovery of novel enzymatic activities from metagenomes has been hampered.
the screens yielded  <dig> positive clones for both libraries, giving hit rates of 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  for rws and tws, respectively.
most current methodologies used to screen for enzymes involved in plant biomass degradation are based on the use of single substrates.
detailed functional analyses showed that clone nt2- <dig>  had highest enzymatic activity at 55 °c and ph  <dig> .
additionally, clone t5- <dig>  showed > 90 % of enzymatic activity at 55 °c and ph  <dig> .
here, we constructed fosmid libraries from two wheat straw-degrading microbial consortia, denoted rws  and tws .
this study employed a high-throughput method for rapid screening of fosmid metagenomic libraries for cellulose-degrading enzymes.
functional metagenomics is a promising strategy for the exploration of the biocatalytic potential of microbiomes in order to uncover novel enzymes for industrial processes .
the approach, consisting of screens on multi-substrates coupled to further analyses, revealed high hit rates, as compared with recent other studies.
