the cellular response to dna damage is immediate and highly coordinated in order to maintain genome integrity and proper cell division.
during the dna damage response , the sensor kinases tel <dig> and mec <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae and atm and atr in human, phosphorylate multiple mediators which activate effector proteins to initiate cell cycle checkpoints and dna repair.
this new scd definition was used in a custom bioinformatics pipeline to generate a census of scd-containing proteins in both yeast and human.
to identify all putative scd-containing proteins, we analyzed the distribution of s/t-q motifs within verified tel1/mec <dig> targets and arrived at a unifying scd definition of at least  <dig> s/t-q within a stretch of  <dig> residues.
we also found a significant enrichment of proteins involved in telophase and cytokinesis, protein transport and endocytosis suggesting possible novel tel1/mec <dig> targets in these pathways.
in the human proteome, a wide range of similar proteins were identified, including homologs of some scd-containing proteins found in yeast.
using a bioinformatic approach, we have generated a census of scd-containing proteins that are involved not only in known ddr pathways but several other pathways under tel1/mec <dig> control suggesting new putative targets for these kinases.
