with the aim of further reducing unwanted side ligation products, we substituted active site residues, known to be important for adenylyltransferase steps of the ligation reaction, in the context of t <dig> rnl2tr.
this reversal of the second step of the ligation reaction correlates with the formation of unwanted ligation products.
thus, t <dig> rn2tr mutants containing the k227q mutation are useful for reducing undesired ligation products.
we characterized the variant ligases for the formation of unwanted ligation side products and for activity in the strand-joining reaction.
t <dig> rna ligases  <dig> and  <dig> are useful tools for rna analysis.
the truncated form of t <dig> rna ligase  <dig>  comprising amino acids 1- <dig> , is an attractive tool for attachment of adapters or labels to rna 3'-ends.
compared to t <dig> rna ligase  <dig>  t <dig> rnl2tr has a decreased ability to ligate 5'-po <dig> ends in single-stranded rna ligations, and compared to the full-length t <dig> rnl <dig>  the t <dig> rnl2tr has an increased activity for joining 5'-adenylated adapters to rna 3'-ends.
the combination of these properties allows adapter attachment to rna 3'-ends with reduced circularization and concatemerization of substrate rna.
