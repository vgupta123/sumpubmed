chab contains a conserved 60-residue region of unknown function found in other bacteria, archaeabacteria and a series of baculoviral proteins.
chab is distinguished from its putative dna binding sequence homologues by a highly charged flexible loop region that has weak affinity to mg2+ and ca2+ divalent metal ions.
chab is a putative regulator of chaa, a na+/h+ antiporter that also has ca+/h+ activity in e. coli.
as part of a structural genomics project, the structure of chab was elucidated by nmr spectroscopy.
