while orthologs for other insulator proteins were absent in all  <dig> analysed nematode species, we find orthologs of ctcf in a subset of nematodes.
we suggest that the insulator protein ctcf has been secondarily lost in derived nematodes like c. elegans.
we show that three zf proteins from three basal nematodes cluster together with known ctcf proteins whereas no zinc finger protein of c. elegans and other derived nematodes does so.
our findings show that ctcf and possibly chromatin insulation are present in basal nematodes.
we propose a switch in the regulation of gene expression during nematode evolution, from the common vertebrate and insect type involving distantly acting regulatory elements and chromatin insulation to a so far poorly characterised mode present in more derived nematodes.
the zinc finger  protein ctcf  is highly conserved in drosophila and vertebrates where it has been shown to mediate chromatin insulation at a genomewide level.
we therefore searched in nematodes for orthologs of proteins that are involved in chromatin insulation.
to investigate the pattern of ctcf occurrence in nematodes, we performed phylogenetic analysis with the zf protein sets of completely sequenced nematodes.
