cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid species with two different genome components, a and b. genetic linkage maps can greatly assist molecular breeding and genomic studies.
however, the development of linkage maps for a. hypogaea is difficult because it has very low levels of polymorphism.
this map is based on an f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals obtained from the cross between the diploid a. ipaÃ«nsis  and the closely related a. magna , the former species being the most probable b genome donor to cultivated peanut.
the development of genetic maps for arachis diploid wild species with a- and b-genomes effectively provides a genetic map for the tetraploid cultivated peanut in two separate diploid components and is a significant advance towards the construction of a transferable reference map for arachis.
the microsatellite markers utilized, developed for other arachis species, showed high transferability .
arachis hypogaea  is an important crop worldwide, being mostly used for edible oil production, direct consumption and animal feed.
this b-genome map was compared to the a-genome map using  <dig> common markers, revealing a high degree of synteny between both genomes.
this can be overcome by the utilization of wild species of arachis, which present the a- and b-genomes in the diploid state, and show high levels of genetic variability.
the map has  <dig> linkage groups, with  <dig> loci spanning a total map distance of  <dig>  cm.
