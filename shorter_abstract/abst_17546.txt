inherited developmental diseases can cause severe animal welfare and economic problems in dairy cattle.
in recent years, an increasing number of finnish ayrshire calves have been identified with signs of ptosis, intellectual disability, retarded growth and mortality, which constitute an inherited disorder classified as pirm syndrome.

ube3b transcript analysis revealed in-frame exon skipping in the affected animals resulting in an altered protein lacking  <dig> amino acids, of which  <dig> are located in the conserved hect-domain, the catalytic site of the ube3b protein.
this study enables the development of a genetic test to efficiently reduce the high frequency of mutant ube3b in ayrshires, significantly improving animal health and reducing economic loss.
we also found that pirm syndrome might be connected to the recently identified ah <dig> haplotype, which has a frequency of  <dig> % in the united states ayrshire population.
we describe pirm syndrome in cattle, which is associated with the mutated ube3b gene.
pirm syndrome might be connected with the recently identified ah <dig> haplotype, which is associated with reduced fertility in the us ayrshire population.
the use of a small number of bulls for artificial insemination  carries a risk that recessive defects rapidly enrich in the population.
the bovine phenotype resembles human kaufman oculocerebrofacial syndrome, which is also caused by mutations in ube3b.
