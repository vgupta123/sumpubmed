in these experiments, the goal is to identify genes differentially expressed in time-course data, measured between different biological conditions.
we model the expression at c <dig> using principal component analysis and represent the expression profile of each gene as a linear combination of the dominant principal components .
the difference between the scores is evaluated using a hypothesis test to quantify the significance of differential expression.
then the expression data from c <dig> is projected on the developed pca model and scores are extracted.
in this paper, we propose a novel method for finding differentially expressed genes in time-course data and across biological conditions .
we evaluate the proposed method to understand differences in two case studies  the heat shock response of wild-type and hsf <dig> knockout mice, and  cell-cycle between wild-type and fkh1/fkh <dig> knockout yeast strains.
