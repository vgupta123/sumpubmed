correct identification of stable domains/fragments within the open reading frame , combined with proper cloning strategies, can greatly enhance the success rate when higher eukaryotic proteins are expressed as these domains/fragments.
this platform will increase the success rate of purification and crystallization dramatically and promote the further advancement of structure genomics/proteomics.
based on the ddbp method, the improved gateway cloning strategy and a robotic platform, we constructed a high throughput  cloning pipeline, including pcr primer design, pcr, bp reaction, transformation, plating, colony picking and entry clones extraction, which have been successfully applied to  <dig> c. elegans genes,  <dig> brucella genes, and  <dig> human genes.
the cloning pipeline, combined with our recombinant protein htp expression pipeline and the crystal screening robots, constitutes a complete platform for structure genomics/proteomics.
expression and purification results showed there was a 10-fold increase in terms of obtaining purified proteins.
combined with an improved cloning strategy, ddbp had been applied to  <dig> proteins from c. elegans.
the ddbp method and improved cloning strategy were satisfactory.
more than 97% of the targeted genes were obtained as entry clones.
