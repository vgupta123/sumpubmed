using two mitochondrial genes , the osprey appeared structured into four genetic groups representing quasi non-overlapping geographical regions.
at a global scale the osprey complex may be composed of four different evolutionary significant units, which should be treated as specific management units.
the four lineages are well differentiated, contrasting with the low genetic variability observed within each clade.
historical demographic reconstructions suggested that three of the four lineages experienced stable trends or slight demographic increases.
we aimed at clarifying its phylogeographic structure and elucidating its taxonomic status .
our biogeographical inference suggests a pattern of colonization from the american continent towards the old world.
molecular dating estimates the initial split between lineages at about  <dig> Â ma ago, in the early pleistocene.
