x chromosomes are subject to dosage compensation in drosophila males.
our data indicate that x chromatin structure is fundamentally different from autosome structure in both sexes.
we find that the general chromatin structure of female x chromosomes is distinct from autosomes.
additionally, specific histone marks associated with dosage compensation and active chromatin marks on the male x chromosome are also enriched on the x chromosomes of females, albeit to a lesser degree.
we suggest that the differences between the x chromosomes and autosomes in females are a consequence of mechanisms that have evolved to ensure sufficient x chromosome expression in the soma of males.
dosage compensation requires cis sequence features of the x chromosome that are present in both sexes by definition and trans acting factors that target chromatin modifying machinery to the x specifically in males.
