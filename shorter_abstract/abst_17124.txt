the unexpected regulatory function of a class i glutamine amidotransferase controls the expression of an aba 8'-hydroxylase pseudogene.
these microarray-based analyses identify regulators of gene expression as either cis-acting factors that regulate proximal genes, or trans-acting factors that function through a variety of mechanisms to affect transcript abundance of unlinked genes.
a candidate gene for a trans-acting regulatory factor was identified through positional cloning.
identification of a candidate gene underlying a trans-eqtl demonstrated the feasibility of eqtl cloning in maize and could help to understand the mechanism of gene expression regulation.
expression qtl analyses have shed light on transcriptional regulation in numerous species of plants, animals, and yeasts.
cases of false-positive eqtl, which results from the lack of complete genomic sequences from both parental genomes, were described.
lack of complete genome sequences from both parents could cause the identification of false-positive cis- and trans-acting eqtl.
