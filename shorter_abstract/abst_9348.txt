while plant rnase t <dig> proteins and the vertebrate rnase a family show evidences of radiation and gene sorting, vertebrate rnase t <dig> proteins form a monophyletic group, but there is also another monophyletic group defining a fish-specific rnase t <dig> clade.
interestingly, in vertebrates most of the biological roles of plant rnase t <dig> proteins are carried out by members of a different family, rnase a. still, rnase t <dig> proteins are conserved in these animals
embryo expression seems to be a conserved characteristic of members of this family, as other plant and animal rnase t <dig> genes show similar high expression during embryo development.
this conserved biological role probably kept rnase t <dig> enzymes in animal genomes in spite of the presence of rnases a. a hypothetical role during embryo development is also discussed.
while several biological functions have been proposed for these enzymes in plants, their role in animals is unknown.
