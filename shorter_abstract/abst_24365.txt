here we expand this approach taking into account amino acid composition at different levels of amino acid exposure.
therefore, the study of protein function can be facilitated by predictions of protein location.
protein location can be predicted either from the sequence of a protein alone by identification of targeting peptide sequences and motifs, or by homology to proteins of known location.
calibration of the method using predicted values of amino acid exposure allows classifying proteins without 3d-information with an accuracy of 62% and discerning proteins in different locations even if they shared high levels of identity.
a third approach, which is complementary, exploits the differences in amino acid composition of proteins associated to different cellular locations, and can be useful if motif and homology information are missing.
for stage one, we trained multiple support vector machines  to score eukaryotic protein sequences for membership to each of three categories: nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular, plus extra category nucleocytoplasmic, accounting for the fact that a large number of proteins shuttles between those two locations.
the method reaches an accuracy of 68% when using as input 3d-derived values of amino acid exposure.
in stage two we use an artificial neural network  to propose a category from the scores given to the four locations in stage one.
