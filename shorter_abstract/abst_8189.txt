integrating epigenetic information for genes with expression data can be useful for comprehending in-depth disease mechanism and for the ultimate goal of better target identification.
epigenetics refers to the reversible functional modifications of the genome that do not correlate to changes in the dna sequence.
a set of common  <dig> significant dna methylated genes located in the promoter section of the true cpg islands were found across stages, and these were: hox genes, foxg <dig>  grik <dig>  hand <dig>  prkcb, etc.
pathway analysis revealed important signaling and metabolic pathways of luad to correlate with epigenetics.
the aim of this study is to understand dna methylation patterns across different stages of lung adenocarcinoma .
the epigenetic analysis identified the following novel genes across all stages: ptgdr, tlx <dig>  and pou4f <dig>  the stage-wise analysis observed the appearance of neurog <dig> gene in stage i and its re-appearance in stage iii.
the analysis showed similar epigenetic pattern across stage i and stage iii.
our study identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant dna methylated genes in stages i, ii and iii respectively.
of the total significant dna methylated genes,  <dig> correlated with transcription function.
a detailed literature analysis elucidated epigenetic genes like foxg <dig>  hla-g, and nkx6- <dig> to be known as prognostic targets.
