slpi neutralization was associated with increased serum levels of tgf-β and increased numbers of foxp3+ cd4+ t cells in lymph nodes.
in vitro, the addition of slpi significantly decreased the number of functional foxp3+ cd25hi cd4+ regulatory t cells in cultures of naive human cd4+ t cells.
adding recombinant tgf-β to slpi-treated human t cell cultures neutralized slpi's inhibitory effect on regulatory t cell differentiation.
the induction of slpi neutralizing antibodies resulted in a milder disease course in mouse and rat eae.
the secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor  exerts wide ranging effects on inflammatory pathways and is upregulated in eae but the biological role of slpi in eae, an animal model of multiple sclerosis is unknown
