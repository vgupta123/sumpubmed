in the latter period, in some flocks of a defined size and species composition, within-flock transmission estimates were not significantly below the threshold for transmission .
however, in some flocks the determinants associated with suboptimal protection need to be further investigated as these may explain the current pattern of infection in animal and human populations.
our results show that infected premises  in the initial  phases of outbreak periods have the highest r <dig> estimates.
our results indicate that the current control policy based on depopulation plus vaccination has protected the majority of poultry flocks against infection.
