two initial candidate sets of  <dig> and  <dig> genes for lung adenocarcinoma  and squamous cell carcinoma , respectively, were generated by identifying genes which have both: a) significant correlation between copy number and gene expression, and b) significant prognostic value at the gene expression level in external databases.
the proposed methodology combines data from patients with and without clinical data with a priori information on the ability of a gene to be a prognostic marker.
these panels, together with clinical data , were used to construct the adc and scc hazard scores combining clinical and genomic data.
using it, we found new prognostic scores based on tumor dna that, jointly with clinical information, are able to predict overall survival  in patients with early-stage adc and scc.
a new integrated bioinformatics searching strategy, that combines gene copy number alterations and expression, together with clinical parameters was applied to derive two prognostic genomic signatures.
the present work provides a methodology to generate a robust signature using copy number data that can be potentially used to any cancer.

the signatures were validated in two independent datasets , confirming that the prognostic value of both clinical-genomic models is robust, statistically significant  and outperforms both the clinical models  and the genomic models applied separately .
