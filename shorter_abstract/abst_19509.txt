this apparent developmentally regulated difference in response to these related growth factors is also reflected in changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of a number of proteins.
we have established that the mitogenic response of fetal cells to both igf-i and -ii is much lower than that seen in postnatal dermal fibroblasts.
dermal fibroblasts exhibit different responses to the two forms of igf depending on their developmental maturity.
further, unlike postnatal cells, fetal cells fail to synthesise collagen in response to igf-i, whereas they do increase synthesis in response to igf-ii.
postnatal cells exhibit a significant increase in phosphorylation of erk  <dig>  in response to igf-i and conversely the p <dig> isoform of shc on igf-ii stimulation.
this may relate to the developmental transition in cutaneous wound healing from regeneration to fibrosis.
it has been well established that human fetuses will heal cutaneous wounds with perfect regeneration.
insulin-like growth factors are pro-fibrotic fibroblast mitogens that have important roles in both adult wound healing and during development, although their relative contribution towards fetal wound healing is currently unknown.
fetal cells however only show a significant increase in an unidentified  <dig> kda tyrosine-phosphorylated protein on stimulation with igf-ii.
