in this work, we isolated and identified mscs from mouse bone marrow.
in addition, neun positive cells could co-localize with th or chat by double-labled immunofluorescence and nissl bodies were found in several differentiated cells by nissl stain.
this study demonstrated that cart could promote the differentiation of bm-mscs into neural cells through increasing neurofactors, including bndf and ngf.
co-cultured with cart  for six days, bm-mscs were differentiated into neuron-like cells by the observation of optical microscopy.
however, the neural differentiation of stem cells influenced by massive factors and interactions is not well studied at present.
cell therapy using bm-mscs  seems like a promising approach for the treatment of neurological diseases.
combined application of cart and bm-mscs may be a promising cell-based therapy for neurological diseases.
