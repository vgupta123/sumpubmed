moreover, maternal obesity and diabetes may affect maternal microenvironments, and oxidative stress related to these can have an impact on the placenta and foetal growth.
thirty-four pregnant women/newborn pairs were included in this study to assess the presence of oxidative stress biomarkers and their relationship with serum cytokine concentrations.
oxidative stress biomarkers and antioxidant enzymes were compared between the mother/offspring pairs.
oxidative stress biomarkers differ between mothers and offspring and can predict maternal and newborn cytokine concentrations, indicating a potential role for oxidative stress in foetal metabolic and immunologic programming.
maternal free fatty acids, nitrites, carbonylated proteins, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase predicted maternal serum concentrations of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ip- <dig> and mip-1β.
nitrites in overweight/obese mothers were statistically lower than in their offspring.
arginase activity in maternal plasma was related to decreased concentrations of il- <dig> and il-1β in cord arterial blood.
oxidative damage present in obese/overweight mothers may lead to further oxidative stress conditions or inflammation in maternal and cord blood samples.
the presence of  <dig> cytokines was measured in maternal and cord blood samples.
significant differences were found in biomarker concentrations between mothers and newborns.

analyses were initially performed between all mothers and newborns and later between normal weight and mothers with overweight and obesity, and diabetic/non-diabetic women.
additionally, superoxide-dismutase activity was higher in pre-pregnancy overweight mothers compared to those with normal weight.
