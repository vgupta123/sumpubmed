in addition, palindromic sequences show a relatively high tendency to form helices, which might play an important role in the evolution of proteins that contain palindromes.
we suggest that the puzzling abundance of palindromic sequences in proteins is mainly due to their frequent concurrence with low-complexity protein regions, rather than a global role in the protein function.
this observation rules out the importance of palindromes for forming symmetrical structures.
although palindromes frequently overlap with conserved blocks, we suggest that palindromes overlap with blocks only by coincidence, rather than being involved with a certain structural fold or protein domain.
do palindromes coincide with conserved protein sequences?
do palindromic protein sequences form regular secondary structures?
does sequence similarity of the two "sides" of a palindrome imply structural similarity?
moreover, reverse similarity in peptides does not necessarily imply significant structural similarity.
nevertheless, this does not rule out the possibility of finding palindromes which play some roles in protein structure and function.
it has been previously shown that palindromic sequences are frequently observed in proteins.
what is the role of sequence complexity in the evolution of palindromic sequences in proteins?
furthermore, to answer the last two questions, the structural characteristics of palindromes were studied.
in fact, we found several palindromes that overlap with conserved protein blocks of different functions.
for the first question, we showed that the complexity of palindromic peptides is significantly lower than randomly generated palindromes.
