the mitors method requires 5 ng total dna as starting material.
the mitors method enables the robust, accurate, and sensitive analysis of a large number of samples.
first, contrary to the diploid nuclear genome, each cell carries several hundred copies of the circular mitochondrial genome.
additionally, the mitochondrial genome has pseudogenized into numerous copies within the nuclear genome over the course of evolution.
here we describe a novel method, named mitors, in which the entire mitochondrial genome is amplified in a single reaction using rolling circle amplification.
fine-tuned parameters are finally applied in the analysis to allow detection of variants even of low frequency heteroplasmy.
because it is cost effective and simple to setup, we anticipate this method will promote the analysis of mtdna variants in large cohorts, and may help assessing the impact of mtdna heteroplasmy on metabolic health, brain function, cancer progression, or ageing.
mutations can therefore be present in only a subset of the mtdna molecules, resulting in a heterogeneous pool of mtdna, a situation referred to as heteroplasmy.
the lower limit for accurate quantification of single nucleotide variants has been measured at 1% frequency.
mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to numerous pathological states, in particular related to metabolism, brain health and ageing.
