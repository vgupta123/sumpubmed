long noncoding rnas  have been shown to play essential roles in almost every important biological process through multiple mechanisms.
an intuitive web interface is available for interactive analysis through both desktops and mobile devices, and programmers can further integrate annolnc into their pipeline through standard json-based web service apis.
based on more than  <dig> data sources and various tool chains, annolnc enables a systematic annotation covering genomic location, secondary structure, expression patterns, transcriptional regulation, mirna interaction, protein interaction, genetic association and evolution.
compared with similar tools, the annotation generated by annolnc covers a much wider spectrum with intuitive visualization.
although the repertoire of human lncrnas has rapidly expanded, their biological function and regulation remain largely elusive, calling for a systematic and integrative annotation tool.
here we present annolnc , a one-stop portal for systematically annotating novel human lncrnas.
to the best of our knowledge, annolnc is the only web server to provide on-the-fly and systematic annotation for newly identified human lncrnas.
case studies demonstrate the power of annolnc in not only rediscovering known functions of human lncrnas but also inspiring novel hypotheses.
