however, more than half of the defined chlorovirus gene families have a potential recent origin , among which a portion shows compositional evidence for horizontal gene transfer.
we finally discuss the incongruence between compositional evidence of horizontal gene transfer and lack of close relative sequences in the databases, which suggests that the recently acquired genes originate from a still largely un-sequenced reservoir of genomes, possibly other unknown viruses that infect the same hosts.
the prototype member of the genus, paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  <dig>  was sequenced more than  <dig> years ago, and to date there are only  <dig> fully sequenced chloroviruses in public databases.
comparison of the chlorovirus phylogeny with that of the algal hosts indicates that chloroviruses have changed hosts in their evolutionary history.
our study shows that the fixation of algal host genes has been anecdotal in the evolutionary history of chloroviruses.
phylogenomic analysis identified only seven proteins whose genes were potentially exchanged between the algal host and the chloroviruses.
presented here are the draft genome sequences of  <dig> additional chloroviruses  collected across the globe; they infect one of three different green algal species.
