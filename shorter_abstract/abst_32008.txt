mirnas with increased abundance in the leaf and root samples of both oe lines  were predicted to target mrnas coding for dof zinc finger protein and apetala  <dig>  proteins, respectively.
in the leaf of oe lines,  <dig> known mirnas increased in abundance and  <dig> mirnas decreased in abundance, whereas in the root of oe lines,  <dig> known mirnas increased in abundance and  <dig> mirnas decreased in abundance.
furthermore, a significant change in the mir173-tasirnas-ppr/tpr network was observed in the leaves of both oe lines.
an induction of mir173-tasirnas-ppr/tpr network was also observed in the oe lines.
overexpression  lines of arabidopsis thaliana purple acid phosphatase  <dig>  were shown to grow faster and exhibit higher atp and sugar contents.
in this study, the srna profiles of the leaf and the root of 20-day-old plants were sequenced and the impacts of high energy status on srna expression were analyzed.
in this study, the impact of high energy content on the srna profiles of arabidopsis is reported.
in higher eukaryotes, small rnas play a role in regulating gene expression.
