since this channel is modulated through a gq-dependent pathway, these data indicate that chpg may exhibit some biased agonist properties on mglur <dig>  closer examination of the voltage-independent, gq-mediated component of mglur-induced calcium current modulation data confirmed that some biased agonism was evident, but the effect was weak and inconsistent.
scg neurons offer a null mglur-background in which specific mglur subtypes can be made to express via intranuclear cdna injection.
the efficacy, potency, and selectivity of the compound 2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine , a nominally selective agonist for metabotropic glutamate receptor  <dig> , were examined with select mglurs by examining their ability to induce modulation of the native voltage dependent ion channels in isolated sympathetic neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglion .
no effect of 1 mm chpg was seen in cells expressing mglur <dig> or mglur <dig>  suggesting that chpg only activates group i mglurs .
surprisingly, chpg also activated two mglur <dig> splice variants with a similar potency as at mglur <dig> when calcium current inhibition was used as an assay for receptor function.
consistent with previous reports, chpg strongly activated mglur5b expressed in scg neurons with an apparent ec <dig> around 60 μm.
