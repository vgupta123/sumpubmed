we analyzed the dna sequence of several large loci in salmo salar and other species for the presence of dna transposon families.
we have identified bursts of activity of  <dig> families of dna transposons  in genome sequences of salmo salar.
tc1-like families show a master gene-like copying process, illustrated by extensive but short burst of copying activity, while the piggybac-like families show a more random copying pattern.
we have identified defined bursts of transposon activity that make use of master-slave and random mechanisms.
several genome duplications have occurred in the evolutionary history of teleost fish.
recent families may include copies with an open reading frame for an active transposase enzyme.
several of these families have similar sequences in a number of closely and distantly related fish, lamprey, and frog species as well as in the parasite schistosoma japonicum.
the bursts occur well after hypothesized polyploidy events and coincide with speciation events.
in returning to a stable diploid state, the polyploid genome reorganized, and large portions are lost, while the fish lines evolved to numerous species.
