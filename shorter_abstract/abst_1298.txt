moreover, the probes were evaluated in mixed samples mimicking women with bv or normal vaginal microflora, demonstrating efficiency and applicability of our pna fish.
our goal was to develop and optimize a novel peptide nucleic acid  fluorescence in situ hybridization assay  for the detection of lactobacillus spp.
specificity and sensitivity of the pna probes were found to be  <dig> % , from  <dig>  to  <dig> %) and 100% , for lactobacillus spp.
this quick method accurately detects lactobacillus spp.

the probes were also tested at different concentrations of g. vaginalis and lactobacillus species in vitro, in the presence of a hela cell line.
and g. vaginalis in mixed samples.
therefore, we evaluated and validated two specific pna probes by using  <dig> representative lactobacillus strains,  <dig> representative g. vaginalis strains and  <dig> other taxonomically related or pathogenic bacterial strains commonly found in vaginal samples.
; and 100%  and 100%  for g. vaginalis.
and g. vaginalis species in mixed samples, thus enabling efficient evaluation of the two bacterial groups, most frequently encountered in the vagina.
it is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to bv is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by lactobacillus species together with an increase of gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes.
bacterial vaginosis  is a common vaginal infection occurring in women of reproductive age.
