horizontal gene transfer has shaped the evolution of the ammonium transporter/ammonia permease gene family.

definitive assessment of gene loss can only be made via whole genome sequencing.
in addition, the four ammonium transporter/ammonia permease genes from cladonia grayi were shown to be functional by expressing the lichen genes in a strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae in which all three native ammonium transporters were deleted, and assaying for growth on limiting ammonia as a sole nitrogen source.
these horizontally transferred genes in the cladonia grayi genome encode functional ammonium transporters/ammonia permeases.
horizontal transfers of ammonium transporter/ammonia permease genes into the fungi include one transfer from archaea to the filamentous ascomycetes associated with the adaptive radiation of the leotiomyceta.
the hypothesis that lichens symbiotic with a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium as a primary photobiont or lichens living in high nitrogen environments lose the plant-like ammonium transporters was upheld, but did not account for additional losses of ammonium transporters/ammonia permeases in the lichens from the acarosporomycetidae, chaetotheriomycetes and arthoniomycetes.
