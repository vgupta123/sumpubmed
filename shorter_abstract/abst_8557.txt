this led to successful amplification and subsequent mapping of  <dig> roscos onto the prunus txe reference map resulting in a genome-wide coverage of  <dig>  to  <dig>  gene-based markers per cm per linkage group.
we identified a set of  <dig>  rosaceaous unigenes comprised of two or more ests that correspond to single copy arabidopsis genes.
conserved orthologous genes are extremely useful for the analysis of genome evolution among closely and distantly related species.
the results presented in this study demonstrate the considerable potential of the mapped prunus roscos for genome-wide marker employment and comparative whole genome studies within the rosaceae family.
furthermore, the roscos primers showed amplification success rates from  <dig> to 100% across the family indicating that a substantial part of the roscos primers can be directly employed in other less studied rosaceaous crops.
detailed comparative genome analyses within the economically important rosaceae family have not been conducted.
this is largely due to the lack of conserved gene-based molecular markers that are transferable among the important crop genera within the family .
the lack of molecular markers and comparative whole genome sequence analysis for this family severely hampers crop improvement efforts as well as qtl confirmation and validation studies.
