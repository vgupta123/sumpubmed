finally, the  <dig> heterogeneous ab subtypes were able to correctly assign into a and b  types based on their genetic characteristics.
even though thymoma is divided into five subgroups following the world health organization classification, the nature of the disease is mixed within the subgroups.
based on these genes, type ab was suggested to be heterogeneous at the molecular level as well as histologically.
we investigated the molecular characteristics of genetic changes variation of thymoma using cdna microarray based-comparative genomic hybridization  with a  <dig> k cdna microarray in an indirect, sex-matched design.
first, the  <dig> significant genes differentiating five subgroups were selected by significance analysis of microarray.
next, we observed that the thymoma was divided into a, b  and b <dig> subgroups with  <dig> significant genes.
genomic dna from the paraffin embedded  <dig> thymoma tissues  labeled with cy- <dig> was co-hybridized with the reference placenta gdna labeled with cy- <dig>  using the camvs software, we investigated the deletions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> throughout the thymoma.
