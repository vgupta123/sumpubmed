following the published procedures, while using the same commercial components, it was impossible to reproduce the skin-explant conditions required for hsc differentiation towards mature t-cells.
consequently it was not possible to reproduce cell-culture conditions required for hsc differentiation into functional t-cells.
fortunately, alternative procedures to speed-up t-cell reconstitution are being established and validated and may become available for patients in the near future.
therefore, it is unlikely that the observed t-lineage commitment from hsc is mediated by dll expressed on keratinocytes.
the keratinocyte maturation procedure resulted in fragile cells with minimum expression of delta-like ligand .
