methionine  residues in proteins can be readily oxidized by reactive oxygen species to met sulfoxide .
the oxidation of cys-free mrps by hydrogen peroxide could be conveniently monitored by sds-page and was specific for met, as evidenced by quantitative reduction of these proteins with msrs in dtt- and thioredoxin-dependent assays.
we used these mrps to examine met oxidation and meto reduction by in-gel shift assays and immunoblot assays with antibodies generated against various oxidized mrps.
our data show that mrps provide a convenient tool for characterization of met oxidation, meto reduction and msr activities, and could be used for various aspects of redox biology involving reversible met oxidation.
conventional methods of assaying meto formation and reduction rely on chromatographic or mass spectrometry procedures, but the use of met-rich proteins  may offer a more streamlined alternative.
meto is a promising physiological marker of oxidative stress and its inefficient repair by meto reductases  has been linked to neurodegeneration and aging.
we carried out a computational search of completely sequenced genomes for mrps deficient in cysteine  residues and identified several proteins containing 20% or more met residues.
