the results of the present study may be valuable for identifying peritonitis and predicting increased morbidity in surgically treated bitches with pyometra.
logistic regression models were used to assess multivariable associations.
the most common complication observed in surgically treated bitches was peritonitis , followed by urinary tract infection , wound infection , uveitis , and cardiac arrhythmia .
the aims of the present study were to describe complications of the disease and to investigate clinically useful indicators associated with peritonitis and/or prolonged postoperative hospitalization.
moderate to severe depression of the general condition, pale mucous membranes and leucopenia were associated with increased risk  for prolonged postoperative hospitalization.
one of the most common diseases in intact bitches is pyometra– a potentially life-threatening disease associated with a variety of clinical and laboratory findings.
fever/hypothermia, depression and pale mucous membranes were associated with increased risk for peritonitis and/or prolonged hospitalization.
a retrospective study was performed using records from  <dig> bitches diagnosed with pyometra during the years 2006– <dig> at the university animal hospital, swedish university of agricultural sciences, uppsala, sweden.
