we then turn to model invalidation and formulate a methodology for discrete-time and continuous-time model invalidation.
nonlinear models of high dimension and with many parameters are impossible to invalidate through simulation and as such the invalidation process is often overlooked or ignored.
however, this is unnecessary since validity of a model cannot be established; model validation is actually a misnomer.
the methodology does not require any simulation of the candidate models; the algorithms presented in this paper have a worst case polynomial time complexity and can provide an exact answer to the invalidation problem.
in principle the only statement that one can make about a system model is that it is incorrect, ie, invalid, a fact which can be established given appropriate experimental data.
we develop different approaches for showing how competing ordinary differential equation  based models of the same biological phenomenon containing nonlinearities and parametric uncertainty can be invalidated using experimental data.
biological models derived from experimental data can never be validated.
we first emphasize the strong interplay between system identification and model invalidation and we describe a method for obtaining a lower bound on the error between candidate model predictions and data.
