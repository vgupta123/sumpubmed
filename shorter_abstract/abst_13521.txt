after 14 days of waterlogging treatment, the transgenic vhb arabidopsis plants remained green, while the controls died.
the vhb gene was also introduced into a maize line through particle bombardment and was then transferred to two elite maize inbred lines through marker-assisted backcrossing.
vitreoscilla hemoglobin  is a type of hemoglobin found in the gram-negative aerobic bacterium vitreoscilla that has been shown to contribute to the tolerance of anaerobic stress in multiple plant species.

under waterlogging, important plant growth traits of vhb plants, including seedling height, primary root length, lateral root number, and shoot dry weight were significantly improved relative to those of the controls.
we overexpressed the vhb gene in arabidopsis and maize under the control of the camv35s promoter.
the introduction of vhb significantly enhanced plant growth under waterlogging stress on traits, including seedling height, primary root length, lateral root number, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight, in both zheng <dig> and cml <dig> maize backgrounds.
these results demonstrate that the exogenous vhb gene confers waterlogging tolerance to the transgenic maize line.
in this study, we approached this problem with the introduction of an exogenous vhb gene.
in maize in the place of to the transgenic maize line, the vhb gene is a useful molecular tool for the improvement of waterlogging and submergence-tolerance.
