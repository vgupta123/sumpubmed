we established two new cell lines from a single cmt, which exhibit significant diversity in cell morphology, protein marker expression, tumorigenicity, and chemoresistance.
on western blots, both cell lines expressed cytokeratin ae <dig>  vimentin, cytokeratin  <dig> , and heat shock protein  <dig> .
in the present study, we established and characterized two new cmt cell lines derived from a single cmt.
establishment and evaluation of tumor cell lines can facilitate investigations of the biological mechanisms of cancer.
morphologically, the dtk-e cells were large, flat, and epithelial-like, whereas dtk-sme cells were round and epithelial-like.
the results of this study revealed that the dtk-sme cell line was more resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and exhibited higher tumorigenicity in vivo than the dtk-e cell line.
we anticipate that the two novel cmt cell lines established in this study will be useful for investigating the tumorigenesis of mammary carcinomas and for screening anticancer drugs.
canine mammary tumors  are the most common type of cancer found in female dogs.
different cell models are used to investigate genetic, epigenetic, and cellular pathways, cancer progression, and cancer therapeutics.
we established two cell lines from a single malignant cmt specimen: dtk-e and dtk-sme.
