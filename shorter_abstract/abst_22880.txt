in a benchmark study with five localizations, multiloc <dig> performs considerably better than other methods for animal and plant proteins and comparably for fungal proteins.
by incorporating phylogenetic profiles and gene ontology terms multiloc <dig> yields higher accuracies compared to its previous version.
knowledge of subcellular localization of proteins is crucial to proteomics, drug target discovery and systems biology since localization and biological function are highly correlated.
one version is specialized for globular proteins and predicts up to five localizations, whereas a second version covers all eleven main eukaryotic subcellular localizations.
furthermore, multiloc <dig> performs clearly better when using a second dataset that extends the benchmark study to all eleven main eukaryotic subcellular localizations.
we extended our previous multiloc predictor by incorporating phylogenetic profiles and gene ontology terms.
in recent years, numerous computational prediction methods have been developed.
nevertheless, there is still a need for prediction methods that show more robustness and higher accuracy.
two different datasets were used for training the system, resulting in two versions of this high-accuracy prediction method.
