the expression of st <dig> transcript and protein levels, and il-33-mediated effects on m <dig>  and m <dig>  chemokine marker expression in human bone marrow-derived macrophages were examined.
together, these data suggest that primary responses to il- <dig> in bone marrow derived human macrophages favors m <dig> chemokine generation while its addition to polarized human macrophages promotes or amplifies m <dig> chemokine expression.
il-33-st <dig> expression and interactions have been explored in mouse macrophages but little is known about the effect of il- <dig> on human macrophages.
human macrophages constitutively expressed the membrane-associated  and the soluble  st <dig> receptors.
similarly, alternatively activated human macrophages treated with il- <dig> exhibited enhanced expression of ccl <dig> and the m <dig> marker mannose receptor above that detected in m <dig> macrophages alone.
when added to na√Øve macrophages alone, il- <dig> directly enhanced the expression of ccl <dig>  in combination with lps, il- <dig> blocked the expression of the m <dig> chemokine marker ccl <dig>  but did not alter ccl <dig> expression in these naive cells.
