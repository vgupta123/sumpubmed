these included pure recombinant proteins, a hapten and complex antigens such as viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface antigens.
the least number of oligonucleotide primers, electroporations and ligation reactions were used to generate a library of  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> individual clones, without generation of sub-libraries.
in particular, we were able to use standard bio-panning method to isolate antibody that can bind to soluble aflatoxin b <dig>  when using bsa-conjugated toxin as a target, as demonstrated by inhibition elisa.
all possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension pcr.
in the early days, it was postulated that this technique would eventually replace hybridoma technology and animal immunisations.
these results suggested that by using an optimized protocol and very high repertoire diversity, a compact and efficient phage antibody library can be generated.
a wide variety of antigens were successfully used to affinity select specific binders.
here we report the simplest and highly efficient method for the construction of a highly useful human single chain variable fragment  library.
