in cd4+ t-cells, a greater increase in ctla- <dig> expressing cells in older persons was the only difference between the age groups.
we found several significant changes in the older individuals in regulatory elements of the adaptive immune system that occur particularly after immune activation.
programmed cell death protein  <dig>  is a cell surface ligand implicated in the induction of anergy, inducible t-cell costimulator  plays a stimulatory role in the development of both cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells, cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen  <dig>  plays a role in inhibitory regulation of t-cell activity, and t cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein  <dig>  has been described as a negative regulatory molecule in cd4+ helper type  <dig> cells and cd8+ cytotoxic type  <dig> cells.
the increase in ctla- <dig> expressing cd8+ t-cells was significantly higher after in vitro induction in older persons, while the increase in cells expressing tim- <dig> and pd- <dig> was significantly reduced.
