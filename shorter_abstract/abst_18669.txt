these results suggest important role for ca-siif in interactions of c. albicans with the host immune system.
next, to identify the biochemical nature of ca-siif, we separated this factor into a concanavalin a -binding glycoprotein fraction  and a non-cona-binding protein fraction  using cona affinity chromatography.
in addition to il- <dig>  cytokine array analysis revealed that ca-siif induced differential production of other cytokines also.
we have previously shown that supernatant from candida albicans  culture contains a secretory interleukin - <dig> inhibitory factor , which inhibits il- <dig> production by human monocytes.
we also found that ca-siif suppressed the maturation of human monocytes to dendritic cells .
both fractions were then tested for this inhibitory effect on human monocyte il- <dig> production.
ca-siif-gp produced a higher inhibitory effect on il- <dig> production compared to ca-siif-ngp and ca-siif crude , proving that ca-siif is a glycoprotein in nature.
investigation of ca-siif's effect on macrophages il- <dig> production in vitro and in vivo also showed that ca-siif inhibited il- <dig> production by murine macrophages both in vitro  and in vivo .
ca-siif is a glycoprotein which exhibits serum-independent inhibition of il- <dig> production from monocytes in vitro and in vivo, and also modulates differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells.
