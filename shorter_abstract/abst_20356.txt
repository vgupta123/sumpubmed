for more traditional kinds of indexing-based applications  to benefit substantially from socially generated metadata in the life sciences, more documents need to be tagged and more tags are needed for each document.
in light of the well-known expansion of information in the life sciences and the need for metadata to enhance its value, these repositories present a potentially valuable new resource for application developers.
we assessed the metadata that users of citeulike and connotea associated with citations in pubmed with the following metrics: coverage of the document space, density of metadata  per document, rates of inter-annotator agreement, and rates of agreement with mesh indexing.
academic social tagging systems, such as connotea and citeulike, provide researchers with a means to organize personal collections of online references with keywords  and to share these collections with others.
inter-annotator agreement within the social tagging systems and the agreement between the aggregated social tagging metadata and mesh indexing was low though the latter could be increased through voting.
