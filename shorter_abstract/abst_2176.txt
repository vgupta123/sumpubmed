existing analytical techniques need to facilitate rapid characterization of algal species by phenotyping hydrocarbon-related constituents.
in botryococcus samples, we identified fatty acids, vitamins, sterols and fatty acid esters and several long chain hydrocarbons.
the algae species c. reinhardtii, b. braunii race a and b. braunii race b were readily discriminated using their hydrocarbon phenotypes.
substructure annotation and spectral clustering yielded network graphs of similar components for visual overviews of abundant and minor constituents.
