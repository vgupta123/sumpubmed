to look for polymorphisms consistent with the linkage data, we sequenced exons with amino acid polymorphisms in two additional m. spretus strains and one additional m. musculus strain generating  <dig>  kb of sequence data.
eight candidate variants were identified that fit with the linkage data.
in previous work, we mapped fifteen loci for skin cancer susceptibility using four different m. spretus by m. musculus f <dig> backcrosses.
despite the value of utilizing m. musculus and m. spretus for quantitative trait locus  mapping, relatively little genomic information on m. spretus exists, and most of the available sequence and polymorphic data is for one strain of m. spretus, spret/ei.
to determine the degree of variation across m. spretus, we conducted phylogenetic analyses.
the relatedness of the m. spretus strains at this locus is consistent with the proximity of region of ascertainment of the ancestral mice.
our analyses suggest that, if skts <dig> on chromosome  <dig> is representative of other regions in the genome, then published genomic data for spret/eij are likely to be of high utility for genomic studies in other m. spretus strains.
mus spretus diverged from mus musculus over one million years ago.
