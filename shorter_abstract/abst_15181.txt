genome-wide expression data from five vitally important organs demonstrates that cnvs in close proximity to transcription start sites associate strongly with expression changes.
these results provide evidence that cnvs shape tissue transcriptomes in monkey populations, potentially offering an adaptive advantage.
this crab-eating macaque is the closest animal model to humans that is used in biomedical research.
copy number variations  are a significant source of genetic diversity and commonly found in mammalian genomes.
among these eqtl genes we find an overrepresentation of genes involved in metabolism, receptor activity, and transcription.
we have generated a genome-wide cnv map for cynomolgus monkeys .
