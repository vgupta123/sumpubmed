the mouse reference genome has over  <dig> functional vrs arranged in highly homologous clusters, but the vast majority are of unknown function.
approximately half of the  <dig> vr genes that we investigated could be successfully resolved, and those that were unambiguously mapped resulted in an extremely accurate dataset.
collectively vrs have over twice the coding sequence variation of the genome average; but we identify striking non-random distribution of these variants within and between genes, clusters, clades and functional classes of vrs.
vomeronasal receptors , expressed in sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ, are thought to bind pheromones and mediate innate behaviours.
together our results suggest that the unusually variable vr repertoires of mice have a significant role in encoding differences in olfactory-mediated responses and behaviours.
