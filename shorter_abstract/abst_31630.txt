taken together, the present study provides insight into the probable mode of action of the antifungal protein, masal on r. solani which could be exploited in future biotechnological applications.
detailed morphological analysis of masal treated r. solani hyphae using different microscopic techniques revealed a detrimental effect of masal on both the cell wall and the plasma membrane.
in conjunction with this observation, evidence of the induction of programmed cell death  was also noted in the masal treated r. solani hyphae.
furthermore, we investigated its interacting partners from r. solani.
besides different fluorescent probes were used for monitoring various intracellular changes associated with masal treatment like change in mitochondrial membrane potential , intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species  and induction of programmed cell death .
moreover, exposure to masal caused the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential  and the subsequent intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species  in the target organism.
in addition ligand blot followed by lc-ms/ms analyses were performed to detect the putative interactors of masal.
mutant allium sativum leaf agglutinin  is a potent, biosafe, antifungal protein that exhibits fungicidal activity against different phytopathogenic fungi, including rhizoctonia solani.
