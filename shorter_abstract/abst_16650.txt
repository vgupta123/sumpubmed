the results demonstrated that the phenome can be further analyzed by a generative model, which can discover probabilistic associations between drugs and therapeutic uses.
the phenome has been also explored for drug repositioning with efforts focusing on the search space for the most similar candidate drugs.
in this regard, lda serves as an enrichment tool to explore new uses of existing drugs by narrowing down the search space.
next, we applied the model on the whole phenome to narrow down repositioning candidates and suggest alternative indications.
correspondingly, we employed latent dirichlet allocation , which introduces latent variables  to govern the phenome distribution.

we first developed a lda model optimized based on its recovery potential through perturbing the drug-phenotype matrix for each of the drug-indication pairs where each drug-indication relationship was switched to “unknown” one at the time and then recovered based on the remaining drug-phenotype pairs.
several of the suggested new uses can be supported with information from the scientific literature.
for a comprehensive analysis of the phenome, we assumed that all phenotypes  were inter-connected with a probabilistic distribution and this characteristic may offer an opportunity to identify new therapeutic indications for a given drug.
for  <dig> drugs that were present with their indication information, our model suggested alternative treatment options for further investigations.
