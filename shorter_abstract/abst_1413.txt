we have investigated genome-wide expression divergence between bt× <dig> and keller under normal and sucrose treatment.
such expression divergence was partially contributed by differential cis-regulatory elements or dna methylation, which was genetically determined by functionally divergent genes between these two varieties.
both tandem and segmental duplication played important roles in the genome evolution and expression divergence.
such an expression divergence is genetically determined by the divergence in genome level.
though both grain  and sweet  sorghum lines originated from the same species sorghum bicolor l., they exhibit obvious phenotypic variations.
we implemented an integrative approach by using computational and experimental analyses to provide a detail insight into phenotypic, genetic variation and expression diversity between bt× <dig> and keller lines.
however, the genome re-sequencing data revealed that they exhibited limited functional diversity in their encoding genes in a genome-wide level.
the result raises the question how the obvious morphological variations between grain and sweet sorghum occurred in a relatively short evolutionary or domesticated period.
substantial differences in gene expression patterns between these two varieties have been observed.
