thus, it was surprising that the gene for 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  <dig> , an enzyme that converts e <dig> to a less potent estrogen, had been mapped to the z sex chromosome.
as a consequence, it was likely that hsd17b <dig> was differentially expressed in males  and females  because dosage compensation of z chromosome genes is incomplete in birds.
our results demonstrate that the hsd17b <dig> gene is expressed and active in the zebra finch brain as an e <dig> metabolizing enzyme, but that dosage compensation of this z-linked gene may occur via post-transcriptional mechanisms.
in this species, only the males sing and they have a much larger and more interconnected song circuit than females.
in the zebra finch, the estrogenic steroid estradiol  is especially effective at promoting growth of the neural circuit specialized for song.
here, we used molecular and biochemical techniques to confirm the hsd17b <dig> z chromosome location in the zebra finch and to determine that hsd17b <dig> mrna and activity were detectable in the early developing and adult brain.
we did not, however, detect significant sex differences in hsd17b <dig> activity levels in the adult brain.
we detected hsd17b <dig> mrna in regions that suggested a role for this enzyme in the early organization and adult function of song nuclei.
