we also showed that the oocytes, which were fertilised during maturation had a similar level of mpf activity as control oocytes, which were not subjected to icsi during maturation, but had reduced level of ip <dig> receptors.
ability to respond to this activating stimulus develops during meiotic maturation of the oocyte.
we observed that refertilised oocytes underwent activation with similar frequency as control oocytes, which also went through maturation in vitro, but were fertilised only once at mii stage .
we found however, that they generated a lower number of transients than control oocytes.
phospholipase cζ, which is introduced by fertilising spermatozoon, triggers i oscillations through the generation of inositol  <dig> ,5-triphosphate , which causes ca2+ release by binding to ip <dig> receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum  of the oocyte.
at mii stage they were fertilised in vitro for the second time .
refertilised mii oocytes were able to develop i oscillations in response to penetration by spermatozoa.
mouse oocytes during maturation in vitro were fertilised by icsi   <dig> –  <dig> h after germinal vesicle break-down  and were subsequently cultured until they reached metaphase ii  stage.
mouse oocytes, which were experimentally fertilised during maturation retain the ability to generate repetitive i transients, and to be activated after completion of maturation.
