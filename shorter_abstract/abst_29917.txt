a number of variants associated with skin color and total cholesterol levels show frequency differentiation between the turkish populations and european populations.
here, we present whole genome sequences of  <dig> turkish individuals resequenced at high coverage .
in addition, we document a significant enrichment of non-synonymous private alleles, consistent with recent observations in european populations.
we show that the genetic variation of the contemporary turkish population clusters with south european populations, as expected, but also shows signatures of relatively recent contribution from ancestral east asian populations.
however, to date, there have been no studies to assess the genetic variation at the whole genome level using whole genome sequencing.
this study provides the first map of common genetic variation from  <dig> western asian individuals and thus helps fill an important geographical gap in analyzing natural human variation and human migration.
furthermore, we have analyzed the 17q <dig>  inversion polymorphism region  and found increased allele frequency of  <dig> % for h1/h <dig> inversion polymorphism when compared to european populations that show about 25% of allele frequency.
our data will help develop population-specific experimental designs for studies investigating disease associations and demographic history in turkey.
