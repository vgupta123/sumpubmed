the tlr <dig> ligand, cl <dig>  as well as the tlr <dig> ligand, lps, resulted in a significant induction of tnf alpha both at the mrna and protein levels in human monocytes.
acute alcohol inhibited tlr8- or tlr4-induced tnf alpha protein and mrna induction while it augmented il- <dig> production in monocytes.
in contrast, prolonged alcohol treatment augmented tnf alpha without affecting il- <dig> production significantly in response to either tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligand stimulation.
in contrast to type i ifn production, the effects of acute and prolonged alcohol were different on inflammatory cytokine activation after tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligand stimulation.
third, the opposite effects of acute  and prolonged alcohol  treatment on pro-inflammatory cytokine activation extend to tlr8-induced signals beyond the previously shown tlr4/lps pathway.
these novel results suggest first, that alcohol has a profound inhibitory effect on type i ifn induction regardless of intracellular  or cell surface-derived  danger signals.
here we hypothesized that alcohol exposure modulates tlr8- and tlr4-ligand-induced monocyte activation and affects both type i ifn and inflammatory cytokine induction.
prolonged alcohol consumption is a significant co-factor in the progression of chronic viral infections including hepatitis c and hiv, which are both single-stranded rna viruses.
we found that both acute and prolonged alcohol treatment resulted in inhibition of type i ifn induction by either tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> ligands in human monocytes at the protein and mrna levels.
second, both acute and prolonged alcohol exposure can inhibit antiviral type i ifn pathway activation.
lipopolysaccharide , a toll like receptor  <dig>  ligand, was shown to affect inflammatory cell activation after alcohol consumption and in hiv and hcv infections.
