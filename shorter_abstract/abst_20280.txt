as a positive side effect of the new data-depth formulation we are able to define the geometric median for the curve ensemble, which was well received by the domain experts.
in this work, we present visual summaries of root ensembles by aggregating root images with identical genetic characteristics.
in addition to spatial distributions, we created a visual representation to encode temporal distributions associated with the development of root individuals.
we use the generalized box plot concept with a new formulation of data depth.
the new formulation of data depth allows for much faster implementation close to interactive frame rates.
