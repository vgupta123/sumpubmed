we observed dramatic enrichment of alleles from the resistant parent in a small region of chromosome  <dig> in drug-treated male and female pools .
identification of parasite genes that underlie traits such as drug resistance and host specificity is challenging using classical linkage mapping approaches.
we explored the utility of this method for mapping a drug resistance gene in the human parasitic fluke schistosoma mansoni.
these results  demonstrate the utility of exome capture for generating reduced representation libraries in schistosoma mansoni, and  provide proof-of-principle that x-qtl methods can be successfully applied to an important human helminth.
we used exome capture to reduce the size of the genome  and exomes from pooled f <dig> progeny  and the two parent parasites were sequenced to high read depth  and allele frequencies at  <dig>  variants compared.
extreme qtl  methods, originally developed by rodent malaria and yeast researchers, promise to increase the power and simplify logistics of linkage mapping in experimental crosses of schistosomes , because many 1000s of progeny can be analysed, phenotyping is not required, and progeny pools rather than individuals are genotyped.
we staged a genetic cross between oxamniquine sensitive and resistant parasites, then between two f <dig> progeny, to generate multiple f <dig> progeny.
