to determine whether this flexibility extended to the associated post-translational modification/processing machinery, the staphylococcin c <dig> structural genes were directly substituted for their lacticin  <dig> counterparts in the ltn operon on the large conjugative lactococcal plasmid pmrc <dig>  it was established that the lacticin ltna <dig> post-translational and processing machinery could produce functionally active c55α, but not c55β.
two component lantibiotics, such as the plasmid-encoded lacticin  <dig> produced by lactococcus lactis dpc <dig> and staphylococcin c <dig> produced by staphylococcus aureus c <dig>  represent an emerging subgroup of bacteriocins.
this may be significant given the positioning of this residue in a putative lipid ii binding loop.
so close is this relatedness that the hybrid peptide pairs ltna1:c55β and c55α:ltna <dig> were found to have activities in the single nanomolar range, comparing well with the native pairings.
