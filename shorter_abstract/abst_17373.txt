in conditions of endothelial dysfunction, angiotensin ii induction of cyclooxygenases increases sensitivity to par <dig> agonist and the preserved vasodilatation mechanism involves activation of sk <dig> .
par2-mediated vasodilatation of resistance type arteries is protected against the negative effects of angiotensin ii-induced vascular dysfunction in mice.
under conditions of cardiovascular dysfunction, protease-activated receptor  <dig>  agonists maintain vasodilatation activity, which has been attributed to increased cyclooxygenase- <dig>  nitric oxide synthase and calcium-activated potassium channel  activities.
protein and mrna expression of cyclooxygenase- <dig> and - <dig> were increased, and cyclooxygenase activity increased the sensitivity of arteries to 2fly in only angiotensin ii-treated wt.
