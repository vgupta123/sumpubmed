of these,  <dig>  had significant sequence similarity to known genes and these were assigned to  <dig> gene ontology  categories and  <dig> clusters of orthologous groups  involved in  <dig> kegg pathways.
the accuracy of the rna-seq derived transcript expression data was validated by analyzing the expression patterns of  <dig> degs by qpcr.
is extremely cold hardy after a full acclimation; however the underlying molecular mechanisms underlying this economically valuable trait remain poorly understood.
this dataset provides valuable information regarding the trifoliate orange transcriptome changes in response to cold stress and may help guide future identification and functional analysis of genes that are importnatn for enhancing cold hardiness.
in addition, a number of genes involved in the catabolism and signaling of hormones, such as abscisic acid, ethylene and gibberellin, were affected by the cold stress.

in this study, global transcriptome profiles of trifoliate orange under cold conditions  over a time course were generated by high-throughput sequencing.
sequences derived from cold-treated and control plants were mapped to the assembled transcriptome, resulting in the identification of  <dig> differentially expressed genes .
more than  <dig> million high-quality reads were produced and assembled into a non-redundant data of  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 1112 bp .
