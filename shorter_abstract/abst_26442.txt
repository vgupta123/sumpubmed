the large genetic differences within one assemblage of g. intestinalis strengthen the argument that the assemblages represent different giardia species.
certain genes, often in small gene families with  <dig> to  <dig> members, localize to the variable regions of the genomes and show high sequence diversity between the assemblage a isolates.
we have performed whole genome sequencing of two sub-assemblage aii isolates, recently axenized from symptomatic human patients, to study the biological and genetic diversity within assemblage a isolates.
the amount of genetic diversity was characterized in relation to the genome of the giardia reference isolate wb, an assemblage ai isolate.
the large gene families of variant-specific surface proteins  and high cysteine membrane proteins  showed isolate-specific divergences of the gene repertoires.
there are significant genomic variations in assemblage a isolates, in terms of chromosome size, gene content, surface protein repertoire and gene polymorphisms and these differences mainly localize to the variable regions of the genomes.
the level of allelic sequence heterozygosity  in the two aii isolates was found to be  <dig> – <dig>  %, which is 25– <dig> fold higher than in the wb isolate and  <dig> fold higher than the assemblage aii isolate dh .
<dig> protein-encoding genes, not found in the wb genome, were identified in the two aii genomes.
giardia genomes are modular with highly conserved core regions mixed up by variable regions containing high levels of ash, snps and variable surface antigens.
the two aii isolates were of different sub-assemblage types  and showed size differences in the smallest chromosomes.
several biological differences between the new and earlier characterized assemblage a isolates were identified, including a difference in growth medium preference.
