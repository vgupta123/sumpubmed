up to  <dig>  of the unigenes were assigned to the protein database clusters of orthologous groups ,  <dig>  were assigned to the term annotation database of gene ontology , and  <dig>  were assigned to  <dig> pathways in the database of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes .
pas cause astringency that is often undesirable for human consumption; thus, the removal of astringency is an important practice in the persimmon industry.
the transcriptome dataset will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tannin coagulation and other biochemical processes in persimmons.
we obtained  <dig> Â mb in clean nucleotides comprising  <dig>  and  <dig>  clean sequencing reads from the tr and co libraries, respectively.
soluble pas can be converted to insoluble pas by enclosing the fruit in a polyethylene bag containing diluted ethanol.
the expression levels of genes involved in pa biosynthesis and tannin coagulation were analysed, and some of them were verified using quantitative real time pcr .
we used  <dig> sequencing for the de novo transcriptome assembly of persimmon fruit treated with 5% ethanol  and without treatment as the control  to investigate the genes and pathways that control pa biosynthesis and other secondary metabolites.
second-generation sequencing is an efficient technique for generating huge sequences that can represent a large number of genes and their expression levels.
