complex insertions and deletions  from next-generation sequencing  data were prone to escape detection by currently available variant callers as shown by large-scale human genomics studies.
somatic and germline complex indels in key disease driver genes could be missed in ngs-based genomics studies.
indelseek also detected all known germline  and somatic  complex indels in human clinical samples .
further experiments validated all  <dig> detected kit complex indels in a discovery cohort of clinical samples.
in silico semi-simulation showed sensitivities of  <dig> – <dig> % based on  <dig> unique complex indels in > <dig> genes from dbsnp and cosmic.
in benchmarking against the reference material na <dig> genome , gatk, samtools and indelseek showed complex indel detection sensitivities of 0%, 0% and 100%, respectively.
we also demonstrated the importance of complex indel detection in accurately annotating brca <dig>  brca <dig> and tp <dig> mutations with gained or rescued protein-truncating effects.
indelseek is an accurate and versatile tool for complex indel detection in ngs data.
indelseek is an open-source complex indel caller designed for ngs data of random fragments and pcr amplicons.
the key differentiating factor of indelseek is that each ngs read alignment was examined as a whole instead of “pileup” of each reference position across multiple alignments.
it complements other variant callers in ngs-based genomics studies targeting a wide spectrum of genetic variations.
