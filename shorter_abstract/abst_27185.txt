for chloroplast genomes, the program selects the chloroplast reads from a whole genome sequencing pool, maps the reads to a reference sequence from a closely related species, and then performs read correction and de novo assembly using sprai.
finally, we present the assembly of two novel chloroplast genomes from the species picea glauca  and sinningia speciosa .
organelle-pba is an easy-to-use perl-based software pipeline that was written specifically to assemble mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes from whole genome pacbio reads.
sequencing organelle genomes using pacbio long-read data is a cost effective, straightforward approach.
we present organelle-pba, a perl program designed specifically for the assembly of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes.
we have evaluated the performance of the software using pacbio reads from different species, read coverage, and reference genomes.
