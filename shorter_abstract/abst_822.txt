furthermore, the super-repeat in the tlr <dig> family suggests strongly that "bacterial" and "typical" lrrs evolved from a common precursor.
we identified and aligned lrrs in tlrs by a new method described here.
the new method utilizes known lrr structures to recognize and align new lrr motifs in tlrs and incorporates multiple sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions.
each of the six major tlr families is characterized by their constituent lrr motifs, their repeat numbers, and their patterns of cysteine clusters.
the central parts of the tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> families and of tlr <dig> have more irregular or longer lrr motifs.
all known domain structures adopt an arc or horseshoe shape.
these central parts are inferred to play a key role in the structure and/or function of their tlrs.
toll-like receptors  play a central role in innate immunity.
vertebrate tlrs form six major families.
the lrrs at the n-terminal part have a super-motif of stt with about  <dig> residues.
the lrrs in tlrs form one or two horseshoe domains and are mostly flanked by two cysteine clusters including two or four cysteine residue.
the lrr domains in tlrs have been inferred to be responsible for molecular recognition.
the repeat numbers of lrrs and their "phasing" in tlrs differ with isoforms and species; they are aligned differently in various databases.
the repeat numbers of the lrrs ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  the lrrs found in tlrs frequently consists of lxxlxlxxnxlxxlxxxxf/lxxlxx  and sometimes short motifs including lxxlxlxxnxlxxlpxlpxx .
