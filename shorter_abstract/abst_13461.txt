we identified putative pheromone receptors and genes that in other fungi are involved in the mating process.
a normalized cdna library generated  <dig>  sequences, which were assembled into  <dig>  unique genes;  <dig> % of them displayed significant similarity to annotated proteins from other organisms,  <dig> % a weak similarity to the same set of known proteins, and  <dig> % were orphans.
this study provides a basis for cloning the mating type locus, for further investigation of pathogenicity genes in the anther smut fungi, and for comparative genomics.
