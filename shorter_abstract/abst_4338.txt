in the present investigation, tobacco cells  were pre-treated with elicitors of defence responses to study whether this would affect permeabilisation.
we suggest that altered membrane lipid composition as induced by cellulase activity may render the cells resistant to alamethicin.
oxygen consumption experiments showed that added cellulase, already upon a limited cell wall digestion, induced a cellular resistance to alamethicin permeabilisation.
we have previously shown that alamethicin efficiently permeabilises the plasma membrane, mitochondria and plastids of cultured plant cells.
this induced resistance could reflect a natural process where the plant cells alter their sensitivity to membrane pore-forming agents secreted by trichoderma spp.
this effect could not be elicited by xylanase or bacterial elicitors such as flg <dig> or elf <dig>  the induction of alamethicin resistance was independent of novel protein synthesis.
as judged by lipid analyses, isolated plasma membranes from cellulase-pretreated tobacco cells contained less negatively charged phospholipids , yet higher ratios of membrane lipid fatty acid to sterol and to protein, as compared to control membranes.
furthermore, our data extends previous reports on artificial membranes on the importance of lipid packing and charge for alamethicin permeabilisation to in vivo conditions.
