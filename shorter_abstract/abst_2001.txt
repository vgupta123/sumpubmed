this array constitutes  <dig>  independent genes representing four individual e. coli genomes, therefore providing the ability to survey genes of several different pathogen types.
the gene content of a diverse group of  <dig> unique escherichia coli and shigella isolates was determined using the affymetrix genechipÂ® e. coli genome  <dig>  array, originally designed for transcriptome analysis, as a genotyping tool.
moreover, these data demonstrate that this novel microarray-based analysis is a powerful tool in the field of molecular epidemiology and the newly emerging field of microbial forensics.
we found that individual strains of o157:h <dig> differed, on average, by  <dig> probe sets.
furthermore, our sampling of  <dig> unique strains of o157:h <dig> showed the ability of this array to discriminate between closely related strains.
the probe set design utilized by this array provided the opportunity to determine the gene content of each strain very accurately and reliably.
