however, phylogenies for taxa that have undergone recent, rapid radiation events often remain unresolved.
the dolphin subfamily delphininae is a group that has likely resulted from a recent and rapid radiation.
the aflp phylogeny is considerably better resolved and more congruent with relationships inferred from morphological data.
the aflp data indicate a close relationship between the two spotted dolphin species and recent ancestry between stenella clymene and s. longirostris.
for closely related, recently diverged taxa, a multi-locus genome-wide survey is likely the most comprehensive approach currently available for phylogenetic inference.
the placement of the lagenodelphis hosei lineage is ambiguous: phenetic analysis of the aflp data is consistent with morphological expectations but the phylogenetic analysis is not.
alternative methodologies for discerning evolutionary relationships under these conditions are desirable.
despite several efforts, the evolutionary relationships among the species in the subfamily remain unclear.
