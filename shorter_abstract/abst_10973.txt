we present a graphical user interface for finding peptide mimetics that can be inserted into a protein or for fitting small molecules into a protein.
supermimic identifies compounds that mimic parts of a protein, or positions in proteins that are suitable for inserting mimetics.
peptide mimetics, is a challenging field in medicinal chemistry.
the application provides libraries that contain peptidomimetic building blocks on the one hand and protein structures on the other.
