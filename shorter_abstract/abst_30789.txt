the efficiency of stabilization may vary depending on the plasmid host so a thorough analysis of stabilization functions is required before use.
the vectors are suitable for testing of various stabilization functions, including plasmid and chromosomal partitioning cassettes encoding parb homologues capable of spreading on dna.
the range of bhr vectors with different reporter cassettes and alternative mobilization systems expands their application in diverse bacterial species.
low-copy-number vectors of potential wide application in biotechnology need to encode stabilization modules ensuring their stable inheritance.
the xyle or lacz reporter systems facilitate easy monitoring of plasmid segregation.
