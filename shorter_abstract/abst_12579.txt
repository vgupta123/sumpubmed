our data extend previous findings to show multiple defects in the retina of npc <dig> mutant mice, suggesting an important role of npc <dig> protein in the normal function of the retina.
we hypothesized that horizontal cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells and glial cells are also affected in the retina of npc <dig> mutant mice.
immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used to investigate pathologies of ganglion cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and optic nerves as well as altered activity of glial cells in npc <dig> mutant mice.
furthermore, abnormal arborisation and ectopic processes of horizontal and amacrine cells as well as defective bipolar cells are observed by immunohistochemistry for specific cellular markers.
electron microscopy reveals that electron-dense inclusions are generally accumulated in ganglion cells, bipolar cells, müller cells, and in the optic nerve.
furthermore, hyperactivity of glial cells, including astrocytes, microglial cells, and müller cells, is also revealed.
niemann-pick type c <dig>  disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease caused by mutation of the npc <dig> gene, resulting in a progressive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes of multiple tissues and leading to neurodegeneration and other disease.
in npc <dig> mutant mice, retinal degeneration including impaired visual function, lipofuscin accumulation in the pigment epithelium and ganglion cells as well as photoreceptor defects has been found.
