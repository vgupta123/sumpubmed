inactivating mutations in the rgmc gene cause juvenile hemochromatosis , a rapidly progressing iron storage disorder with severe systemic manifestations.
our results define a role for pcs in the maturation of rgmc that may have implications for the physiological actions of this critical iron-regulatory protein.
we now show that pro-protein convertases  are responsible for conversion of  <dig> kda rgmc to a  <dig> kda protein with a truncated cooh-terminus.
iron loading reduces release of rgmc from the cell membrane, and diminishes accumulation of the  <dig> kda species in cell culture medium.
unlike related molecules rgma and rgmb, rgmc encodes a conserved pc recognition and cleavage site, and jh-associated rgmc frame-shift mutants undergo cooh-terminal cleavage only if this site is present.
a cell-impermeable peptide pc inhibitor blocks the appearance of  <dig> kda rgmc in extra-cellular fluid, as does an engineered mutation in the conserved pc recognition sequence, while the pc furin cleaves  <dig> kda rgmc in vitro into a  <dig> kda molecule with an intact nh2-terminus.
