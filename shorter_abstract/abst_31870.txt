although there are several different ways of defining gene networks, the weighted co-expression network may be preferred because of its computational simplicity, satisfactory empirical performance, and because it does not demand additional biological experiments.
for cancer prognosis studies with gene expression measurements, we propose a new marker selection method that can properly incorporate the network connectivity of genes.
we find that the proposed approach can identify genes that are significantly different from those using alternatives.
we adopt the weighted co-expression network to describe the interplay among genes.
the development of high-throughput profiling technologies makes it possible to survey the whole genome and search for genomic markers with predictive power.
extensive biomedical studies have shown that clinical and environmental risk factors may not have sufficient predictive power for cancer prognosis.
we analyze six prognosis studies on breast cancer and lymphoma.
in addition, they have better prediction performance and reproducibility than genes identified using alternatives.
incorporating the network structure can improve cancer marker identification.
