applications of the boolean kinetic monte-carlo are demonstrated for three qualitative models: a toy model, a published model of p53/mdm <dig> interaction and a published model of the mammalian cell cycle.
mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set of ordinary differential equations on probability distributions.
in particular, transient effects are represented by time dependent probability distributions, interpretable in terms of cell populations.
quantitative modeling, on the other hand, can describe more accurately the dynamical behavior of biological processes as it follows the evolution of concentration or activities of chemical species as a function of time, but requires an important amount of information on the parameters difficult to find in the literature.
in order to describe the temporal evolution of the biological process we wish to model, we explicitly specify the transition rates for each node.
it is based on continuous time markov process applied on a boolean state space.
in this context, time is represented by discrete steps.
we developed a c++ software, maboss, that is able to simulate such a system by applying kinetic monte-carlo  on the boolean state space.
