when adp was used as the variable substrate at a fixed thdp concentration, a sigmoid curve was obtained, with a hill coefficient of  <dig>  and an s <dig>  value of  <dig>  mm.
we have recently identified a new thiamine derivative, adenosine thiamine triphosphate , in e. coli.
the existence of a mechanism for the enzymatic synthesis of this compound is in agreement with the hypothesis of a non-cofactor role for thiamine derivatives in living cells.
here we show that, in bacterial extracts, the biosynthesis of athtp is carried out from thiamine diphosphate  and adp or atp by a soluble high molecular mass nucleotidyl transferase.
this is the first demonstration of an enzyme activity transferring a nucleotidyl group on thiamine diphosphate to produce athtp.
the enzyme has a ph optimum of  <dig> â€“ <dig>  and a high km for thdp , suggesting that, in vivo, the rate of athtp synthesis is proportional to the free thdp concentration.
the enzyme activity had an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions, such as mn2+ or mg2+, as well as for a heat-stable soluble activator present in bacterial extracts.
thus, we hypothesized that athtp may be a signal produced in response to carbon starvation.
in intact bacteria, this nucleotide is synthesized only in the absence of a metabolizable carbon source and quickly disappears as soon as the cells receive a carbon source such as glucose.
