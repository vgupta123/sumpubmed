these analytical methods were limited in the detection of sequences with limited homology to previous annotations within ncbi databases, such as parvovirus.
the detection of pathogens in complex sample backgrounds has been revolutionized by wide access to next-generation sequencing  platforms.
by accurately detecting pathogens in a variety of samples, this work demonstrates the utility of pathosphere and provides a platform for utilizing, modifying and creating pipelines for a variety of ngs technologies developed to detect pathogens in complex sample backgrounds.
pathosphere analytical pipelines developed by edgewood chemical biological center  identified spiked pathogens within a common sample analyzed by  <dig>  ion torrent, and illumina sequencing platforms.
utilizing the pipeline-hosting adaptability of pathosphere, the analytical suite was supplemented by analytical pipelines designed by the united states army medical research insititute of infectious diseases and walter reed army institute of research .
these results serve as an exhibition for the existing pipelines and web-based interface of pathosphere as well as the plug-in adaptability that allows for integration of newer ngs analytical software as it becomes available.
the architecture allows for users to upload data and run available bioinformatics pipelines without the need for onsite processing hardware or technical support.
the pathogen detection capabilities hosted on pathosphere were tested by analyzing pathogen-containing samples sequenced by ngs with both spiked human samples as well as human and zoonotic host backgrounds.
ecbc pipelines also correctly identified pathogens in human samples containing arenavirus in addition to animal samples containing flavivirus and coronavirus.
