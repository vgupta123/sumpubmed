here, we have optimized an angiogenesis model based on es cell differentiation for screening experiments.
we have established conditions leading to angiogenic sprouting of embryoid bodies during es cell differentiation in type i three-dimensional collagen gels.
although numerous in vitro angiogenesis models have been developed in the past, they exhibit limitations since they do not recapitulate the entire angiogenic process or correspond to multi-step procedures that are not easy to use.
sprouting was specifically stimulated in the presence of vegf and fgf <dig>  alternatively, endothelial sprouting induced by angiogenic activators was inhibited by angiogenesis inhibitors such as angiostatin, tgfβ and pf <dig>  sprouting angiogenesis can be easily quantified by image analysis after immunostaining of endothelial cells with cd <dig> pan-endothelial marker.
moreover, this one-step model has been validated in response to activators and inhibitors of angiogenesis.
immunostaining experiments carried out during these cultures showed the formation of numerous buds comprising cd <dig> positive cells, after  <dig> days of culture of es cells.
taken together, these data clearly validate that this one-step es differentiation model constitutes a simple and versatile angiogenesis system that should facilitate, in future investigations, the screening of both activators and inhibitors of angiogenesis.
