memosys provides customizable data exchange mechanisms using the sbml format to enable analysis in external tools.
it supports the development of new models by providing a built-in version control system which offers access to the complete developmental history.
one way to leverage sequence data is to use genome-scale metabolic models.
memosys  is a versatile platform for the management, storage, and development of genome-scale metabolic models.
we have therefore designed and implemented a bioinformatics platform which supports the development of such metabolic models.
the challenge is how to integrate the large amount of data in order to gain novel biological insights.
it currently contains six annotated microbial metabolic models.
we have developed a web-based system designed to provide researchers a novel application facilitating the management and development of metabolic models.
research on existing models is facilitated by a search system, references to external databases, and a feature-rich comparison mechanism.
moreover, the integrated web board, the authorization system, and the definition of user roles allow collaborations across departments and institutions.
