the algorithm is an efficient minimal extension of the smith-waterman-gotoh algorithm that easily fits in into other tools.
experimental results evaluating homopolymer inaccuracy through alignments show a two to five-fold increase in matthews correlation coefficient over previous algorithms, for 454-derived data.
this increased accuracy provided by haxat does not only result in improved homologue estimations, but also provides un-interrupted reading-frames, which greatly facilitate further analysis of protein space, for example phylogenetic analysis.
haxat uses a novel dynamic programming algorithm for solving the optimal local alignment between a  <dig> nucleotide and a protein sequence by allowing frame-shifts, guided by  <dig> flowpeak values.
