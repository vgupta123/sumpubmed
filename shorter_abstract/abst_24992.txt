to increase the amount of useable data, several approaches have been proposed that incorporate multiple scans at different sensitivities to reduce the quantification error and to minimize effects of saturation.
in the present study we compared individual scans at low, medium and high sensitivity with three methods for combining data from multiple scans  using an actual dataset comprising  <dig> technical replicates of a reference rna standard.
most multiple scan approaches increased the range of probe intensities compared to the individual scans, but did not increase the dynamic range .
however, increased probe intensity range and improved signal-to-noise ratios did not necessarily correlate with improved reproducibility.
of the individual scans, the low scan exhibited the lowest background signal, the highest signal-to-noise ratio, and equivalent reproducibility to the medium and high scans.
importantly, for one multiple scan method that combined  <dig> scans, reproducibility was significantly improved relative to individual scans and all other multiple scan approaches.
approaches displayed striking differences in the background signal and signal-to-noise ratio.
