on the other hand, high genomic dissimilarity values for intraspecific analyses suggest that in some cases  different strains from the same species may actually represent different species.
one of these studies suggested good congruence between genome synteny, shared gene content, 16s ribosomal dna identity, codon usage and the genome signature in prokaryotes.
here we rigorously test the phylogenetic signal of the genome signature, which consists of the genome-specific relative frequencies of dinucleotides, on  <dig> sequenced prokaryotic genome sequences.
intrageneric comparisons show that in general the genomic dissimilarity scores are higher than in intraspecific comparisons, in accordance with the suggested phylogenetic signal of the genome signature.
the genome signature has a distinct phylogenetic signal, independent of individual genetic marker genes.
comparing 16s rdna identity with genomic dissimilarity values corroborates the previously suggested trend in phylogenetic signal, albeit that the dissimilarity values only provide low resolution.
a reliable phylogenetic clustering cannot be based on dissimilarity values alone, as bootstrapping is not possible for this parameter.
