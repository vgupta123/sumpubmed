in this work, mfa calculation is framed as a generalized least squares  problem, highlighting the applicability of the common t-test for model validation.
the estimation of intracellular flux through traditional metabolic flux analysis  using an overdetermined system of equations is a well established practice in metabolic engineering.
although the focus of this work is on t-test validation and traditional mfa, the presented framework is readily applicable to other regression analysis methods and mfa formulations.
the growing complexity of metabolic models, which are increasingly generated from genome-level data, has necessitated robust validation that can directly assess model fit.
