many well-known maternal effect proteins were included in this subset, including mater and npm <dig>  in addition, our mouse oocyte proteome was compared with a recently published mouse embryonic stem cell  proteome and  <dig> overlapping proteins were identified.
this is the largest catalog of mature mouse oocyte proteins compiled to date.
using this high-performance proteomic approach, we successfully identified  <dig> different proteins from  <dig> mature mouse oocytes lacking zona pellucidae.
the mature mouse oocyte contains the full complement of maternal proteins required for fertilization, reprogramming, zygotic gene activation , and the early stages of embryogenesis.
this proteomics analysis will be a valuable resource to aid in the characterization of important maternal proteins involved in oogenesis, fertilization, early embryonic development and in revealing their mechanisms of action.
according to their pattern of expression, we screened  <dig> maternal proteins with high levels of mrna expression both in oocytes and fertilized eggs.
