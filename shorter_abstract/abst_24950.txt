the channel catfish, ictalurus punctatus, is invested with a high density of cutaneous taste receptors, particularly on the barbel appendages.
further, both rhodamine-conjugated rca-i and polyclonal antibodies raised to the 82– <dig> kda electroeluted peptides labeled the apical region of catfish taste buds.
all fractions from each chromatography step were evaluated for l-arg-induced ion channel activity by reconstituting each fraction into a lipid bilayer.
active fractions demonstrated l-arg-induced channel activity that was inhibited by d-arginine  with kinetics nearly identical to those reported earlier for l-arg-stimulated ion channels of native barbel membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers.
many of these receptors are sensitive to selected amino acids, one of these being a receptor for l-arginine .
previous neurophysiological and biophysical studies suggested that this taste receptor is coupled directly to a cation channel and behaves as a ligand-gated ion channel receptor .
after the final enrichment step, sds-page of the active ion channel protein fraction revealed a single band at 82– <dig> kda which may be interpreted as a component of a multimeric receptor/channel complex.
this is the first report of enrichment of an active lgicr from the taste system of vertebrata.
earlier studies demonstrated that two lectins, ricinus communis agglutinin i  and phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin , inhibited the binding of l-arg to its presumed receptor sites, and that pha-e inhibited the l-arg-stimulated ion conductance of barbel membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers.
because of the specificity shown by rca-i, lectin affinity was chosen as the first of a three-step procedure designed to enrich the presumed lgicr for l-arg.
