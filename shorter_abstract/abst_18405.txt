big sagebrush  is one of the most widely distributed and ecologically important shrub species in western north america.
habitat loss due to a combination of disturbances followed by establishment of invasive plant species is a serious threat to big sagebrush ecosystem sustainability.
here, we report on the sequencing of expressed sequence tags  and detection of single nucleotide polymorphism  and simple sequence repeat  markers in subspecies of big sagebrush.
we have produced a large est dataset for artemisia tridentata, which contains a large sample of the big sagebrush leaf transcriptome.
a large number of snp and ssr markers provide the foundation for future research to address questions in big sagebrush evolution, ecological genetics, and conservation using genomic approaches.
lack of genomic data has limited our understanding of the evolutionary history and ecological adaptation in this species.
validation of snps in different individuals uncovered a high level of nucleotide variation in est sequences.
est sequences of a third, tetraploid subspecies  obtained by illumina sequencing were mapped to the consensus sequences of the combined  <dig> est assembly.
