more detailed, realistic modeling studies usually employ nonlinear dynamical models, which lead to computationally difficult parameter estimation problems.
we formulate a functional data analysis approach for estimating the parameters of nonlinear dynamical models and evaluate this approach on data from two real systems, the gap gene system of drosophila melanogaster and the synthetic irma network, which was created expressly as a test case for genetic network inference.
functional data analysis is a powerful approach for estimating detailed nonlinear models of gene expression dynamics, allowing efficient and accurate estimation of regulatory architecture.
a key problem in systems biology is estimating dynamical models of gene regulatory networks.
functional data analysis methods, however, offer a means to simplify fitting by transforming the problem from one of matching modeled and observed dynamics to one of matching modeled and observed time derivativesâ€“a regression problem, albeit a nonlinear one.
we also show that the computational efficiency of the functional data analysis approach, and the decomposability of the resulting regression problem, allow us to explicitly enumerate and evaluate all possible regulator combinations for every gene.
this gives deeper insight into the the relevance of different regulators or regulator combinations, and lets one check for alternative regulatory explanations.
