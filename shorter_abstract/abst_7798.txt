at both time points, we identified a specific set of induced genes belonging to the general phenylpropanoid metabolism, including stilbenes and hydroxycinnamates, and to defence proteins such as pr proteins and chitinases.
at  <dig> h we also observed a down-regulation of the genes involved in cell division and cell-wall loosening.
this molecule seems to mimic a defence elicitor which enhances the physical barriers of the cell, stops cell division and induces phytoalexin synthesis.
in response to pathogen attack, grapevine synthesizes phytoalexins belonging to the family of stilbenes.
