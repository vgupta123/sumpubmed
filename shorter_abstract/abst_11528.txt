finally, the possible role of cellular response to membrane stability alterations and of multi-drug resistance abc transporters as additional self-resistance mechanisms toward the lantibiotic was confirmed by proteomic and confocal microscopy experiments on a microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> lantibiotic-null producer strain which was exposed to an externally-added amount of nai- <dig> during growth.
regulatory, metabolic and unknown-function proteins, were identified and functionally clustered, revealing that nutritional signals, regulatory cascades and primary metabolism shift-down trigger the accumulation of protein components involved in nitrogen and phosphate metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis/maturation, lipid metabolism, osmotic stress response, multi-drug resistance, and nai- <dig> transport.
in actinomycetes, antibiotic production is often associated with a physiological differentiation program controlled by a complex regulatory and metabolic network that may be elucidated by the integration of genomic, proteomic and bioinformatic tools.
accordingly, an extensive evaluation of the proteomic changes associated with nai- <dig> production was performed on microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> by combining two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and gene ontology approaches.
to reveal patterns of differentially represented proteins associated with nai- <dig> production onset and maintenance, differential proteomic analyses were carried-out on biomass samples collected: i) before  and during  nai- <dig> production at a stage; ii) during three time-points  at d stage characterized by different profiles of nai- <dig> yield accumulation  and decrement .
this study provides a net contribution to the elucidation of the regulatory, metabolic and molecular patterns controlling physiological differentiation in microbispora atcc-pta- <dig>  supporting the relevance of proteomics in revealing protein players of antibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes.
the stimulating role on physiological differentiation of a tetr-like regulator, originally identified in this study, was confirmed by the construction of an over-expressing strain.
microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> cultivations in a complex medium were characterized by stages of biomass accumulation  followed by biomass yield decline .

the filamentous actinomycete microbispora atcc-pta- <dig> produces the lantibiotic nai- <dig>  which is an antibiotic peptide effective against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria.
