different statistical methods were tested including the lasso , pls , spls , bayes a, bayes b and gblup  methods and the structure of the collection was taken into account in the prediction.
this paper shows that the high-throughput snp arrays that are being developed will most probably allow for a more efficient selection in this species.
diversity studies conducted so far in pea used simple sequence repeat  and retrotransposon based insertion polymorphism  markers.
a collection of diverse pea accessions, including landraces and cultivars of garden, field or fodder peas as well as wild peas was characterised at the molecular level using newly developed snp markers, as well as ssr markers and rbip markers.
new breeding challenges imposed by global climate change and new regulations urge pea breeders to undertake more efficient methods of selection and better take advantage of the large genetic diversity present in the pisum sativum genepool.
recently, snp marker panels have been developed that will be useful for genetic diversity assessment and marker-assisted selection.
the three types of markers were used to describe the structure of the collection and revealed different pictures of the genetic diversity among the collection.
snp markers were then used to predict phenotypes -the date of flowering , the number of seeds per plant  and thousand seed weight - that were recorded for the collection.
pea , a major pulse crop grown for its protein-rich seeds, is an important component of agroecological cropping systems in diverse regions of the world.
