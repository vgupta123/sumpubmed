periodic proteins, characterized by the presence of multiple repeats of short motifs, form an interesting and seldom-studied group.
as a next step of console analysis, we show how detection of solenoid repeats in structures can be used to improve sequence recognition of these motifs and to detect subtle irregularities of repeat lengths in three solenoid protein families.
yet, few algorithms have been developed for the detection and analysis of structures of periodic proteins.
console recognizes modularity in protein contact maps, allowing for precise identification of repeats in solenoid protein structures, an important subgroup of periodic proteins.
the console algorithm provides a fast and accurate tool to recognize solenoid protein structures as a whole and to identify individual solenoid repeat units from a structure.
due to often extreme divergence in sequence, detection and analysis of such motifs is performed more reliably on the structural level.
