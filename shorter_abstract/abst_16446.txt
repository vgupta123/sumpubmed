functional connectivity resulted to be more impaired ipsilateral to the seizure focus in both patient groups when compared to control subjects.
verbal memory is mostly affected by left-sided hs, whereas visuo-spatial memory is more affected by right hs.
the findings presented here suggest that left hs causes more reduction of functional connectivity than right hs in subjects with left hemisphere dominance for language.
in this study, we investigated the functional connectivity patterns of  <dig> control subjects,  <dig> patients with right mtle and  <dig> patients with left mtle.
functional connectivity can play an important role to understand how the hippocampi interact with other brain areas.
we detected differences in functional connectivity within and between hippocampi in patients with unilateral mtle associated with ipsilateral hs by resting state fmri.
this effect was even more pronounced for the left mtle group.
patients with hs usually present memory dysfunction, which is material-specific according to the hemisphere involved and has been correlated to the degree of hs as measured by postoperative histopathology as well as by the degree of hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging .
mesial temporal lobe epilepsy , the most common type of focal epilepsy in adults, is often caused by hippocampal sclerosis .
