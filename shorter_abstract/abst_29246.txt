to generate a single-cell resolution notch signaling reporter, we used a cbf responsive element to direct the expression of a nuclear-localized fluorescent protein.
to do this, we linked  <dig> copies of a consensus cbf <dig> binding site to the basal simian virus  <dig>  promoter, placed this cassette in front of a fluorescent protein fusion comprising human histone h2b linked to the yellow fluorescent protein  venus, one of the brightest available yfps.
by using multiple cbf <dig> binding sites together with a subcellular-localized, genetically-encoded fluorescent protein, h2b-venus, we have generated a transgenic strain of mice that faithfully recapitulates notch signaling at single-cell resolution.
we used the cbf:h2b-venus construct to generate both transgenic embryonic mouse stem  cell lines and a strain of transgenic mice that would report notch signaling activity.
the notch signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved pathway operating in multiple developmental processes as well as being the basis for several congenital diseases.
such reporter strains can be engineered by placing cis-regulatory elements of interest to direct the expression of desired reporter genes.
if these cis-regulatory elements are downstream targets, and thus activated as a consequence of signaling pathway activation, such reporters can provide read-outs of the signaling status of a cell.
it binds the active form of the notch receptor  and subsequently binds to cis-regulatory regions  in the promoters of notch responsive genes.
the improved resolution of this reporter makes it ideal for live imaging developmental processes regulated by the notch signaling pathway as well as a short-term lineage tracer of notch expressing cells due to the perdurance of the fluorescent reporter.
this is the first mouse reporter strain in which individual cells transducing a notch signal can be visualized.
