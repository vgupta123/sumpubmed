hpcall uses a probabilistic framework to call the homopolymer lengths in the sequence by modeling well-known  <dig> noise predictors.
base-calling quality is assessed based on estimated probabilities for each homopolymer length, which are easily transformed to useful quality scores.
a well-known problem of this platform is its sensitivity to base-calling insertion and deletion errors, particularly in the presence of long homopolymers.
using a reference data set of the escherichia coli k- <dig> strain, we show that hpcall produces superior quality scores that are very informative towards possible insertion and deletion errors, while maintaining a base-calling accuracy that is better than the current one.
we present hpcall, a  <dig> base-calling method based on a weighted hurdle poisson model.
