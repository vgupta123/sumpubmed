coordinated through a complex network of kinases and phosphatases, protein phosphorylation regulates essentially all cellular processes in eukaryotes.
we show that metabolomics largely outperforms growth analysis and recovers  <dig> out of the  <dig> previously characterized phosphosites and suggests functionality for several novel sites, including s <dig> on the tor regulatory protein tip <dig>  we analyze metabolic profiles to identify consequences underlying regulatory phosphorylation events and detecting glycerol metabolism to have a so far unknown influence on arginine metabolism via phosphoregulation of the glycerol dehydrogenases.
we demonstrate that metabolic profiles can be exploited for gaining insight into regulatory consequences and biological roles of phosphosites.
however, functionality of the vast majority of these sites remains unclear and we lack suitable approaches to evaluate functional relevance at a pace that matches their detection.
recent advances in proteomics enable detection of thousands of phosphorylation sites  in single experiments.
