we observed substantially improved module properties, including:  few or zero misplaced genes;  increased counts of replicable clusters in alternate tissues ;  improved enrichment of gene ontology terms   improved cell type enrichment signals ; and  more accurate partitions in simulated data according to a range of similarity indices.
the results obtained from our investigations indicate that our k-means method, applied as an adjunct to standard wgcna, results in better network partitions.
we propose k-means clustering as an additional processing step to conventional wgcna, which we have implemented in the r package km2gcn .
wgcna generates both a gcn and a derived partitioning of clusters of genes .
these improved partitions enable more fruitful downstream analyses, as gene modules are more biologically meaningful.
