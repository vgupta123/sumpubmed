drosophila, the addition of melatonin has also been shown to increase the life span of this arthropod, probably by reducing age-related increasing oxidative stress.
until now, only a single study demonstrated melatonin effects on behavioral responses due to vertebrate kairomones, whereas we clearly show a more general effect of melatonin: i) on morphological predator defense induced by an invertebrate kairomone and ii) on life history characteristics transmitted by chemical cues from conspecifics.
i) female and male daphnids were exposed to melatonin in a longevity experiment, ii) daphnia were confronted with stress signals from the invertebrate predator chaoborus sp., and iii) daphnia were grown in high densities, i.e.
our results confirm the effect of melatonin on inhibition of stress-signal responses of daphnia.
therefore, age-related increasing oxidative stress was probably not compensated by added melatonin.
this high evolutionary age has led to the development of diverse functions of melatonin in different organisms, such as the detoxification of reactive oxygen species and anti-stress effects.
therefore, we challenged daphnia with three different stressors in order to investigate potential stress-response attenuating effects of melatonin.
therefore, we could generally confirm that melatonin plays a role in the attenuation of responses to different stressors in daphnia.
