the objective of this study is to analyze mirna profiling in the kidneys of rats gavaged with ota.
a total of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in the kidney and the levels of the novel mirnas were varied in response to different doses of ota.
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that have an impact on a wide range of biological processes by regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level or protein systhesis level.
expression of mir- <dig>  mir-130a, mir-130b, mir- <dig>  mir-218b and mir- <dig> were uniquely suppressed in mid dose but then elevated in high dose, with opposite expression to their target genes.
to profile mirnas in the kidneys of rats with ota nephrotoxicity, high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics approaches were applied to analyze the mirnas in the kidney of rats following ota treatment.
the expression pattern was closely related with the “mapk signaling pathway”.
the abrogation of mirna maturation process suggests a new target of ota toxicity.
