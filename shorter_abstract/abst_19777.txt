the software employs a brownian dynamics engine to simulate reaction-diffusion systems at the reactive particle level, based on compartment properties, complex structure, and hydro-dynamic radii.
the simulation volume can be split in subvolumes to speed up run-time.
zeroth-, first-, and second order reactions are supported.
