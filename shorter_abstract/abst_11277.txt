the optineurin level, rgc and axonal counts, and apoptosis in aav2-e50k-gfp-injected rat eyes were averted to closer to normal limits after treatment with rapamycin, an autophagic enhancer.
when optineurin is upregulated or mutated, the upp function is compromised as evidenced by a decreased proteasome Î² <dig> subunit  level and autophagy is induced for clearance of the optineurin protein.
the upp function was reduced and autophagy was induced when wild-type and e50k optineurin was overexpressed in rat eyes.
the upp impairment and autophagy induction evidently occurred in vivo as in vitro.
this study validates the in vitro findings, confirming that upp impairment and autophagy induction also occur in vivo.
adeno-associated type  <dig> viral  vectors for green fluorescence protein  only, gfp-tagged wild-type and glu50lys  mutated optineurin were intravitreally injected into rats for expression in retinal ganglion cells .
it has been reported previously that in cultured rgc <dig> cells, the turnover of endogenous optineurin involves mainly the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway .
in addition, rapamycin is demonstrated to clear the accumulated mutant optineurin.
