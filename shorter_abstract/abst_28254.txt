coalescent simulations have proven very useful in many population genetics studies.
in order to arrive to meaningful conclusions, it is important that these simulations resemble the process of molecular evolution as much as possible.
we introduce a new coalescent program, called recodon, which is able to simulate samples of coding dna sequences under complex scenarios in which several evolutionary forces can interact simultaneously .
recodon is a flexible tool for the simulation of coding dna sequences under realistic evolutionary models.
to date, no single coalescent program is able to simulate codon sequences sampled from populations with recombination, migration and growth.
