the oligonucleotide primer pairs based on conserved genes or regions, which include 16s rdna and the Î²-operon, have been widely employed in the detection of las by qrt-pcr.
furthermore, by designing the primer pair specific to the identified signatures, we showed that most of our primer sets are able to detect las from the infected plant and psyllid materials collected from the usa and china by qrt-pcr.
overall,  <dig> primer pairs of the  <dig> are found to be highly specific to las with no cross reactivity to the closely related species ca.
we took a complimentary approach by systematically screening the genes in a genome-wide fashion, to identify the unique signatures that are only present in las by an exhaustive sequence based similarity search against the nucleotide sequence database.
quantitative real-time pcr  based molecular diagnostic assays have been routinely used in the detection and diagnosis of las.
