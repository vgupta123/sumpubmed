the optimum temperature range for the three atpases was between 42°c and 50°c.
atpases were expressed as his-tag fusion proteins in e. coli and purified by affinity chromatography.
type four secretion systems  are bacterial macromolecular transport systems responsible for transfer of various substrates such as proteins, dna or protein-dna complexes.
here, we report the biochemical characterization of three atpases namely trae, traj and trak  from the transfer system of aeromonas veronii plasmid pac3249a.
this is the first biochemical characterization of conjugative transport atpases encoded by a conjugative plasmid from aeromonas.
atp binding and atp hydrolysis experiments were performed with the purified atpases.
highest atp hydrolysis activity for all the atpases was observed in the presence of mg2+ and mn2+.
our study demonstrated that the three atpases of a newly reported tfss of a. veronii plasmid pac3249a are functional in both atp hydrolysis and atp binding.
these enzymes exhibit highest sequence conservation among type four secretion components.
