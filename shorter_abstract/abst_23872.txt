amplification of r gene sequences was performed using template est data and information from orthologous candidate using a degenerate consensus pcr approach.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  predicted through resequencing of amplicons from the parental genotypes of a genetic mapping family were validated, and  <dig> distinct r gene loci were assigned to multiple genetic maps.
this study describes the large-scale isolation and characterisation of candidate r genes from perennial ryegrass.
this study is the most comprehensive analysis to date of qualitative disease resistance candidate genes in perennial ryegrass.
a comparative genomics analysis revealed the co-location of several candidate r genes with disease resistance quantitative trait loci .
snps identified within candidate genes provide a valuable resource for mapping in various ryegrass pair cross-derived populations and further germplasm analysis using association genetics.
clusters of largely non-related nbs-lrr genes were located at multiple distinct genomic locations and were commonly found in close proximity to previously mapped defence response  genes.
