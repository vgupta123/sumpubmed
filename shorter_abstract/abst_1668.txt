in families with higher average parasite load fewer individuals survived.
within families, individuals with an intermediate number of mhc class iib sequence variants survived best and had the lowest parasite load among survivors, suggesting a direct functional link between mhc diversity and fitness.
the correlation between parasite load and mortality that we found at both individual and family level might have appeared only in the extraordinary heatwave of  <dig>  due to global warming the frequency of extreme climatic events is predicted to increase, which might intensify costs of parasitism and enhance selection on immune genes.
multivariate analysis revealed that the composition of the infecting parasite fauna was family specific.
the within family mhc effects were, however, small compared to between family effects, suggesting that other genetic components or non-genetic effects were also important.
ecological interaction strength may increase under environmental stress including temperature.
