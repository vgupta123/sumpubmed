we study the effects of filtering in combination with the benjamini-hochberg method for false discovery rate control and q-value for false discovery rate estimation.
a simulation study was done to further examine the effect of filtering by variance.
the simulation study demonstrates that when paired with a false discovery rate method, filtering by variance can increase power while still controlling the false discovery rate.
on the other hand, filtering by variance on the log <dig> scale had a detrimental effect when paired with mas <dig> or plier preprocessing methods, even when the testing was done on the log <dig> scale.
due to the large number of hypothesis tests performed during the process of routine analysis of microarray data, a multiple testing adjustment is certainly warranted.
common filtering methods include filtering by variance, average signal or mas detection call .
three case studies are used to compare three different filtering methods in combination with the two false discovery rate methods and three different preprocessing methods.
for the case studies considered, filtering by detection call and variance  consistently led to an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes identified.
the case studies show that both detection call and variance filtering are viable methods of filtering which can increase the number of differentially expressed genes identified.
we find that filtering by variance leads to higher power, often with a decrease in false discovery rate, when paired with either of the false discovery rate methods considered.
