cmpt <dig> encodes a typical, root-expressed, high affinity phosphate transporter, plays an important role in coping pi deficiency of chrysanthemum plants.
real-time quantitative pcr analysis revealed that the gene was transcribed strongly in the root, weakly in the stem and below the level of detection in the leaf of chrysanthemum plants growing in either sufficient or deficient pi conditions.
under both pi sufficient and deficient conditions, transgenic plants constitutively expressing cmpt <dig> grew taller than the non-transformed wild type, produced a greater volume of roots, accumulated more biomass and took up more phosphate.
inorganic phosphate  is essential for plant growth, and phosphorus deficiency is a main limiting factor in plant development.
chrysanthemum is one of the most important ornamental plants, its productivity is usually compromised when grown in phosphate deficient soils, but the study of phosphate transporters in chrysanthemum is limited.
