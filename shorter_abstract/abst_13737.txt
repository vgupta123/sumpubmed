t2d-db  is a comprehensive web resource, which provides integrated and curated information on almost all known molecular components involved in the pathogenesis of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus in the three widely studied mammals namely human, mouse and rat.
type  <dig> diabetes mellitus  is a non insulin dependent, complex trait disease that develops due to genetic predisposition and environmental factors.
studies performed on the genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology of this disease to understand the pathophysiology of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus has led to the generation of a surfeit of data on candidate genes and related aspects.
information on candidate genes, snps  in candidate genes or candidate regions, genome wide association studies , tissue specific gene expression patterns, est  data, expression information from microarray data, pathways, protein-protein interactions and disease associated risk factors or complications have been structured in this on line resource.
importantly, the resource facilitates graphical presentation of the gene/genome wide map of snp markers and protein-protein interaction networks, besides providing the heat map diagram of the selected gene in an organism across microarray expression experiments from either single or multiple studies.
t2d-db is to our knowledge the first publicly available resource that can cater to the needs of researchers working on different aspects of type  <dig> diabetes mellitus.
