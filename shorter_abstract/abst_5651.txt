abscisic acid  regulates various developmental processes and stress responses over both short  and longer  time frames.
the protein amino acid phosphorylation process was significantly overrepresented in shoot tips and roots treated with aba.
the results indicated that these  <dig> genes were involved in several biological processes such as flavonoid metabolism, response to reactive oxygen species, response to light, and response to temperature stimulus.
transcriptomic analysis revealed  <dig> genes whose transcript abundances varied significantly in a specific organ in response to aba treatment.
no single gene exhibited the same changes in transcript abundance across all organs in response to aba.
to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of early responses of grapevine  responding to aba, different organs of grape  were treated with 10 μm --aba for 2 h. nimblegen whole genome microarrays of vitis vinifera were used to determine the effects of aba on organ-specific mrna expression patterns.
this study examined the short-term effects of aba on different organs of grapevine.
understanding the aba responses in an organ-specific manner is crucial to fully understand hormone action and plant responses to water deficit.
aba also significantly affected the expression of several transcription factors .
the greatest number of significantly differentially expressed genes was observed in the roots followed by cell cultures, leaves, berries, and shoot tips, respectively.
aba affected mrna abundance of genes  associated with aba degradation, conjugation, and the aba signaling pathway.
