potassium channels play a fundamental role in resetting the resting membrane potential of excitable cells.
determining the intracellular trafficking and localization mechanisms of potassium channels provides a platform to fully characterize their maturation and functionality.
previous investigations have discovered residues or motifs that exist in their primary structure, which directly promote anterograde trafficking of nascent potassium channels.
these results expand upon previous studies aimed at deciphering the kv <dig>  secretory trafficking mechanisms and further show in vitro evidence of the association between kv <dig>  and the copii cargo adaptor subunit isoform sec24a.
single point  and double point  mutations exhibited no significant changes in their endoplasmic reticulum  retention.
the triple point mutant e443a-e445a-e447a displayed a modest er retention while deletion of the c-terminus showed dramatic er retention.
first, three alternative c-terminal acidic residues, e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig> were probed for their involvement within the early secretory pathway of kv <dig> .
