in the present study, we used the partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i  gene, and the nuclear ribosomal its, 18s and 28s genes to investigate the haplotype diversity and phylogeny of seven bulinus species originating from three endemic countries in africa .
sequences clustered into two lineages;  groups bulinus truncatus, b. tropicus, b. globosus and b. umbilicatus; while  groups b. forskalii, b. senegalensis and b. camerunensis.
high levels of genetic diversity were detected at all loci in the seven studied species, with clear segregation between individuals and appearance of different haplotypes, even within same species from the same locality.
interesting patterns emerge regarding schistosome susceptibility: bulinus species with lower genetic diversity are predicted to have higher infection prevalence than those with greater diversity in host susceptibility.

snails species belonging to the genus bulinus  serve as intermediate host for flukes belonging to the genus schistosoma .
the results reported in this study are very important since a detailed understanding of the population genetic structure of bulinus is essential to understand the epidemiology of many schistosome parasites.
