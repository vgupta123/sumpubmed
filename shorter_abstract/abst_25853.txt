the geographic distribution, phylogenetic placement and molecular age of m <dig> suggest that the colonization of madagascar was more complex than previously thought.
here, we present the first comprehensive study of three such isolated populations from madagascar: the mikea hunter-gatherers, the neighbouring vezo fishermen, and the merina central highlanders .
current models propose that mitochondrial dna macrohaplogroups m and n evolved from haplogroup l <dig> soon after modern humans left africa.
