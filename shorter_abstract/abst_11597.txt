breast cancer incidence rates are increasing at an alarming rate among saudi arabian females.
we performed transcriptomic profiling of surgically-resected breast tumors from  <dig> patients based in the western region of saudi arabia using affymetrix gene  <dig>  st chip.

however, possibility of specific changes in molecular signature among cancer patients of diverse ethnic groups remains largely unexplored.
pathway analysis revealed canonical pathways that had not been previously implicated in breast cancer.
biological network analysis of differentially regulated genes revealed that fatty acid binding protein  <dig>  adipocyte , adiponectin , and retinol binding protein  <dig>  were most down regulated genes, sharing strong connection with the other molecules of lipid metabolism pathway.
this study describes, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide profiling of breast cancer from saudi ethnic females.
pathway and biological function-based clustering was apparent across the tissue samples.
most molecular genetic discoveries on breast cancer and other cancers have arisen from studies examining european and american patients.
we demonstrate the involvement of the lipid metabolism pathway in the pathogenesis of breast cancer from this region.
