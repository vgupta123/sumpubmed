in this paper i address the extent to which biochemistry is restricted to a small fraction of the chemical space of possible chemicals, a restricted subset that i call biochemical space.
chemicals that contain structures that our outside biochemical space  are more likely to be toxic to a wide range of organisms, even though they have no specifically toxic groups and no obvious mechanism of toxicity.
this may be because chemical structures outside the chemical space in which life operates are incompatible with biochemistry, or because mechanisms to make or utilize such excluded structures has not evolved.
the chemistry of life has to form a dense, self-consistent network of chemical structures, and cannot easily be arbitrarily extended.
i relate this to the observation that most chemicals interact with many biological structures at low millimolar toxicity.
