in the standard laboratory wild type strain n <dig> males disappear rapidly from populations.
we determined the kinetics of the loss of males over time for multiple population sizes and wild isolates and found significant differences.
in particular, cb <dig> males obtained a higher number of successful copulations than n <dig> males and sired correspondingly more cross-progeny.
in the androdioecious nematode caenorhabditis elegans virtually all progeny produced by hermaphrodite self-fertilization is hermaphrodite while 50% of the progeny that results from cross-fertilization by a male is male.
this is not the case in some other wild type isolates of c. elegans, among them the hawaiian strain cb <dig>
we performed systematic inter- and intra-strain crosses with n <dig> and cb <dig> and show that the males and the hermaphrodites contribute to the difference in male maintenance between these two strains.
these two differences have the potential to explain the observed variation in male persistence, since they should lead to a predominance of self-progeny  in n <dig> and, at the same time, a high proportion of cross-progeny  in cb <dig>
