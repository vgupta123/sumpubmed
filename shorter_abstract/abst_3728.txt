combined with computational analysis and experimental confirmation, the research contributes valuable information for further functional research of microrna in fruit development for pear and other species.
here, we investigated the mirna profiles of pear fruits from different time stages during development with illumina hiseq  <dig> platform and bioinformatics analysis.
total reads, ranging from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig>  were obtained from six small rna libraries constructed for different stages of fruit development after flowering.
comparative analysis of mirnaomes during pear fruit development is presented, and mirnas were proved to be widely involved in the regulation of fruit development and formation of fruit quality, for example through lignin synthesis, sugar and acid metabolism, and hormone signaling.

however, the role of mirnas in pear  fruit development is not clear.
kegg pathway analysis on  <dig>  target genes of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig>  target genes of  <dig> novel mirnas showed that mirnas are widely involved in the regulation of fruit development.
previous studies have reported mirna identification in various plants ranging from model plants to perennial fruit trees.
among these, a total of eleven mirnas putatively participate in the pathway of lignin biosynthesis, nine mirnas were identified to take part in sugar and acid metabolism, and mir <dig> was identified to regulate auxin response factor.
quantitative real-time pcr was used to validate the expression levels of mirnas.
