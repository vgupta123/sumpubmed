<dig> fresh-frozen human normal and tumor tissue samples from breast and colon were serially extracted in batches of  <dig> samples.
the technology described here enables the processing of many tissue samples simultaneously with a high quality product and a time and cost reduction for the user.
the extracted dna performed consistently well in processes including pcr-based str analysis, haloplex selection and deep sequencing on an illumina platform, and gene copy number analysis using microarrays.
with increasing biobanking of biological samples, methods for large scale extraction of nucleic acids are in demand.
a purpose developed magnetic bead based technology to serially extract both dna and rna from tissues was automated on a tecan freedom evo robotic workstation.
the lack of such techniques designed for extraction from tissues results in a bottleneck in downstream genetic analyses, particularly in the field of cancer research.
this reduces the sample preparation bottleneck in cancer research.
