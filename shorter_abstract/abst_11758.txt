we propose a new descriptor called “burial level” for characterizing residues, atoms and atomic contacts.
we identify different kinds of deeply buried atomic contacts  at different burial levels that are directly broken in alanine substitution.
this work also confirms the contribution of deeply buried interfacial atomic contacts to the energy of protein binding hot spot.
this indicates that a high burial level is not only a necessary but also a more sufficient condition than a low sasa for a residue to be a hot spot residue.
thus sasa is widely used as an outstanding feature in hot spot prediction by many computational methods.
this performance is better than other computational methods.
we achieve f measure of  <dig>  under the leave-one-out cross-validation on a data set containing  <dig> mutations.
identifying protein binding hot spots can give useful information to protein engineering and drug design, and can also deepen our understanding of protein-protein interaction.
however, sasa is not capable of distinguishing slightly buried residues, of which most are non hot spots, and deeply buried ones that are usually inside a hot spot.
our results show that hot spot residues tend to be deeply buried in the interface, not just having a low sasa value.
