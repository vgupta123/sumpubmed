our analyses with nuclear  and mitochondrial  data now robustly associate nucleariida and fungi as neighbors, an assemblage that we term 'holomycota'.
we further question the introduction of separate phyla for glomeromycota and blastocladiomycota, whose phylogenetic positions relative to other phyla remain unresolved even with genome-level datasets.
our results motivate broad sampling of additional genome sequences from these phyla.
resolving the evolutionary relationships among fungi remains challenging because of their highly variable evolutionary rates, and lack of a close phylogenetic outgroup.
our phylogenomic analysis provides significant support for the paraphyly of the traditional taxon zygomycota, and contradicts a recent proposal to include mortierella in a phylum mucoromycotina.
