ccaat/enhancer-binding protein delta  was the only up-regulated transcription factor in these two brain regions of all three models.
gene expression alterations in cerebrum and cerebellum were detectable at birth preceding the neuronal deficits.
these results show that: 1) regionally specific gene expression abnormalities precede the brain histological and neuronal function changes, 2) temporal gene expression profiles provide insights into the molecular mechanism during the gsl storage disease course, and 3) cebpd is a candidate regulator of brain disease in prosaposin deficiency to participate in modulating disease acceleration or progression.
network analyses revealed that cebpd has functional relationships with genes in transcription, pro-inflammation, cell death, binding, myelin and transport.
temporal transcriptome microarray analyses of brain tissues were conducted with mrna from three prosaposin deficient mouse models: ps-na, prosaposin null  and a v394l/v394l glucocerebrosidase mutation combined with ps-na .
differentially expressed genes encompassed a broad spectrum of cellular functions.
extensive gsl storage occurs in various central nervous system regions in mammalian prosaposin deficiencies.
our hypomorphic prosaposin deficient mouse, ps-na, exhibited 45% wt levels of brain saposins and showed neuropathology that included neuronal gsl storage and purkinje cell loss.
