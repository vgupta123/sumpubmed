we applied our method to the unknown connectivities in the chemotaxis pathway of the bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides.
often, however, the same experimental data can be represented by several competing network models.
we successfully applied our method to chemotaxis in r. sphaeroides and the results from the experiments designed using this methodology allowed us to invalidate all but one of the proposed network models.
the designed experiments were then performed on live cells and the resulting data used to invalidate all but one of the remaining candidate models.
parameters in these models were fitted so that they all represented wild type data equally well.
we first developed several models of r. sphaeroides chemotaxis corresponding to different signalling networks, all of which are biologically plausible.
developing methods for understanding the connectivity of signalling pathways is a major challenge in biological research.
for this purpose, mathematical models are routinely developed based on experimental observations, which also allow the prediction of the system behaviour under different experimental conditions.
to discriminate between the remaining models we used ideas from control systems theory to determine efficiently in silico an input profile that would result in the biggest difference in model outputs.
thus, to achieve better discrimination, we determined the best change in initial conditions  as well as the best change in the input profile.
