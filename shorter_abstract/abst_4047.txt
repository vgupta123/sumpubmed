we have developed and evaluated a high-throughput image analysis and processing approach to detect and characterize bacterial cells and chemotaxis proteins.
results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a fast and robust method for detection and analysis of spatial relationship between bacterial cells and their chemotaxis proteins.
its performance was evaluated using differential interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy images of rhodobacter sphaeroides.
for example in differential interference contrast microscopy which plays an important role in modern bacterial cell biology.
