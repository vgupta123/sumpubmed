we found that in all species that we studied the majority of antennal afferents target two separate neuropils, the olfactory lobe  and the corpus lamellosum .
the evolutionary implications of our findings, particularly the plasticity of glomerular shape, are discussed.
the numbers of olfactory glomeruli in the different chilopod taxa ranged from ca.
our study connects to a previous analysis of the brain and behavior of the chilopod  scutigera coleoptrata in which we demonstrated that these animals do respond to volatile substances and analyzed the structure of their central olfactory pathway.
originating from a marine ancestor, the myriapods most likely invaded land independently of the hexapods.
here, we examined the architecture of the deutocerebral brain areas  in seven additional representatives of the chilopoda, covering all major subtaxa, by histology, confocal laser-scan microscopy, and 3d reconstruction.
