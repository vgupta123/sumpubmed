immune-, stroma- and pathway-based ges showed a lower correlation relative to prognostic signatures .
the correlations of three clinically relevant bc genes, six molecular subtype classifiers, and a selection of  <dig> ges were evaluated.
all the subtype classifiers evaluated agreed well  and all the proliferation-based ges showed excellent spearman correlations between microarray and rna-seq .
we found excellent correlation between microarray and rna-seq for the estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , and human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig> , while a few discordances between er and pgr quantified by immunohistochemistry and rna-seq/microarray were observed.

according to our results, the vast majority of single gene biomarkers and well-established ges can be reliably evaluated using the rna-seq technology.
to date, no study has compared the ability of the two technologies to quantify clinically relevant individual genes and microarray-derived gene expression signatures  in a set of bc samples encompassing the known molecular bc’s subtypes.
gene-wise comparison of microarray and rna-seq data revealed that 52% had a spearman’s correlation coefficient greater than  <dig>  with highly correlated genes displaying significantly higher expression levels.
microarrays have revolutionized breast cancer  research by enabling studies of gene expression on a transcriptome-wide scale.
