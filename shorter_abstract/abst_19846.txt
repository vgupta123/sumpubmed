with reference to the c-c chemokine ligand-3-like- <dig>  gene, we performed analysis using real-time quantitative pcr , multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  and paralogue ratio test .

we find that the method of rounding real-time qpcr measurements can potentially lead to mis-scoring of copy number genotypes and suggest caution should be exercised in interpreting qpcr data.
therefore any technique prone to degrees of measurement error can produce ambiguous results that may lead to spurious associations with complex disease.
our results indicate that potential variability in the physicochemical properties of the dna samples cannot solely explain the poor performance exhibited by the real-time qpcr systems.
after controlling for potential outside variables on assay performance, including dna concentration, quality, preparation and storage conditions, we find that real-time qpcr produces data that does not cluster tightly around copy number integer values, with variation substantially greater than that of the mlpa or prt systems.
we conclude that real-time qpcr is inherently prone to measurement error, even under conditions that would seem favorable for association studies.
we recommend that more robust approaches such as prt or mlpa should be used to genotype multi-allelic copy number variation in disease association studies and suggest several approaches which can be implemented to ensure the quality of the copy number typing using quantitative methods.
intrachromosomal segmental duplications provide the substrate for non-allelic homologous recombination, facilitating extensive copy number variation in the human genome.
