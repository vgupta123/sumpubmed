the snp information obtained from an array allowed a first qtl screening of our ril population.
we generated plots for visualizing the recombination patterns of the population relating physical and genetic positions along the genome.
moneymaker and s. pimpinellifolium g <dig>  was genotyped with a custom made snp array.
this linkage map was used to identify two qtls for tylcv resistance which contained favourable alleles derived from s. pimpinellifolium.
with the combination of different ~ omics platforms we provide valuable insight into the genetics of s. pimpinellifolium-derived tylcv resistance.
furthermore, we explored the population using untargeted metabolic profiling, and the most significant differences between susceptible and resistant plants were mainly associated with sucrose and flavonoid glycosides.
a ril population between solanum lycopersicum cv.
a total of  <dig> polymorphic snps were selected to develop a linkage map of  <dig> unique genetic loci.
