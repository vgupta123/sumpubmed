if effective as claimed, these new sequence-based, universally applicable prediction methods would have far-reaching utilities in many areas of biology research.
computational prediction methods can nicely complement experimental approaches for identifying protein-protein interactions.
recently, a unique category of sequence-based prediction methods has been put forward - unique in the sense that it does not require homologous protein sequences.
second, data sets typically used for training prediction methods appear significantly biased, limiting the general applicability of prediction methods trained with them.
this enables it to be universally applicable to all protein sequences unlike many of previous sequence-based prediction methods.
in addition, my analysis illustrates the importance of complementary performance measures coupled with right-sized data sets for meaningful benchmark tests.
in this study, i have implemented and thoroughly tested  <dig> different methods on large-scale, non-redundant data sets.
in addition, newer methods were often published without performance comparison with previous ones.
third, there is still ample room for further developments.
first, significant performance differences are noted among different methods.
protein-protein interactions underlie many important biological processes.
thus, it is not clear how good they are and whether there are significant performance differences among them.
the current study reveals the potentials and limits of the new category of sequence-based protein-protein interaction prediction methods, which in turn provides a firm ground for future endeavours in this important area of contemporary bioinformatics.
