four linkage maps with  <dig>  molecular markers were used to improve the portion of mapped and oriented sequences  and enabled a more detailed identification of discernible misassemblies .
the availability of the peach genome sequence has fostered relevant research in peach and related prunus species enabling the identification of genes underlying important horticultural traits as well as the development of advanced tools for genetic and genomic analyses.
the first release of the peach genome  represented a high-quality wgs  chromosome-scale assembly with high contiguity , large portions of mapped sequences  and high base accuracy .
the improved high quality peach genome assembly  represents a valuable tool for the analysis of the genetic diversity, domestication, and as a vehicle for genetic improvement of peach and related prunus species.
the aim of this work was to improve the quality of the first assembly by increasing the portion of mapped and oriented sequences, correcting misassemblies and improving the contiguity and base accuracy using high-throughput linkage mapping and deep resequencing approaches.
moreover, the important phylogenetic position of peach and the absence of recent whole genome duplication  events make peach a pivotal species for comparative genomics studies aiming at elucidating plant speciation and diversification processes.
