in subchronic toxicity study, 2–8 g/kg of jinqing granules induced no evident adverse effects on clinical signs, body weight changes, food and water intake, death daily, indicators of urine, hematological assay, serum biochemistry, organ coefficient and histopathological examination.
the significance of these observations with respect to animal usage of jinqing granules deserves thorough investigation.
in safety pharmacology experiments, jinqing granules had no evident adverse effects on the central nervous, cardiovascular, or respiratory systems.
however, the 16 g/kg dose was associated with slightly slowed weight growth, decreased number of sperm in seminiferous tubules and increased values of serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin.
jinqing granules which are made of a mixture extract that contains radix tinosporae and canarii fructus in proportions according to a longstanding formula have a good effect on the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcer disease.
to provide basis for clinical application, we performed safety pharmacology and subchronic toxicity experiments in specific pathogen-free sprague-dawley rats.

during the 30-day feeding test,  <dig> rats that received the 16 g/kg dose died, but the deaths were most likely due to trauma of oral gavage, not to drug toxicity.
jinqing granules given to sprague-dawley rats orally for 30 days at a dose of 8 g/kg or less appears safe, but higher doses were not proven safe.
