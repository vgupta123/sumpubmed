povidone iodine at  <dig>  and 1% exhibited the lowest contamination and recovery rate for microbial contaminants and m. ulcerans.
in order to inhibit the growth of the microbial contaminants during culture of m. ulcerans, it is necessary to decontaminate bu samples with effective chemical agents.
this study aimed at investigating some selected chemicals as potential decontamination agents for the isolation of m. ulcerans from swabs.
two percent  cetylpyridinium chloride/4% sodium chloride can be conveniently used as an alternative decontamination method for the isolation of m. ulcerans from swabs.
the observed difference between the recovery rate of 2% cpc/4% nac and the other protocols was however not statistically significant .
