the particles could be recovered from the emulsion, and activity in aqueous and organic solvents was successfully demonstrated.
the immobilised enzymes also demonstrated superior activity in organic solvent compared to the original free enzyme.
through addition of protein cross-linking agents to a water-in-oil emulsion of an aqueous enzyme solution, structured self-immobilised spherical enzyme particles of pseudomonas fluorescens lipase were formed.
however, immobilisation onto solid supports greatly reduces the volumetric and specific activity of the biocatalysts.
the individual spherical particles had a diameter of between  <dig> – <dig> μm, but tended to form aggregates with an average particle volume distribution of  <dig> μm.
an alternative is to form self-immobilised enzyme particles.
moreover, higher activity for small ester molecules could be achieved by the immobilised enzyme particles than for free enzyme, presumably because the lipase conformation required for catalysis had been locked in place during immobilisation.
