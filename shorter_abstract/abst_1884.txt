the machine learning model was used to successfully predict active meganucleases for  <dig> new dna targets.
meganucleases are important tools for genome engineering, providing an efficient way to generate dna double-strand breaks at specific loci of interest.
we compared it with existing in silico physical models and high-throughput experimental screening.
this new method shows competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art in silico physical models, with up to a fourfold increase in terms of the design success rate.
here we present a novel in silico method for designing custom meganucleases that is based on the use of a machine learning approach.
