swarming by p. vortex was studied by real-time light microscopy, by in situ scanning electron microscopy and by tracking the spread of antibiotic-resistant cells within antibiotic-sensitive colonies.
when swarming, p. vortex was found to be peritrichously flagellated.
swarming by the curved cells of p. vortex occurred on an extremely wide range of media and agar concentrations .
p. vortex formed single petri dish-wide "supercolonies" with a colony-wide exchange of motile cells.
p. vortex creates complex macroscopic colonies within which there is considerable reflux and movement and interaction of cells.
this is the first detailed examination of the swarming behaviour of this bacterium at the cellular level.
mitomycin c was used to trigger filamentation without inhibiting growth or swarming; this facilitated dissection of the detail of swarming.
mitomycin c treatment resulted in malcoordinated swarming and abortive side branch formation and a strong tendency by a subpopulation of the cells to form minimal rotating aggregates of only a few cells.
on lower percentage agars, cells moved in an extended network composed of interconnected "snakes" with short-term collision avoidance and sensitivity to extracts from swarming cells.
at high agar concentrations  rotating colonies formed that could be detached from the main mass of cells by withdrawal of cells into the latter.
cell shape, flagellation, the aversion of cell masses to fuse and temporary connections between proximate cells to form rafts were all features of the swarming and rotation of cell aggregates.
