several studies have shown that dioxins extensively alter hepatic mrna levels.
our results suggest that a small core of genes is responsible for mediating the similar features of dioxin hepatotoxicity in rats and mice but non-overlapping pathways are simultaneously at play to result in distinctive histopathological outcomes.
dioxin-like polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons represent a major class of environmentally and economically relevant toxicants.
while no evidence for the involvement of copy-number variation was found, extensive inter-species variation in the transcriptional-regulatory network was identified; nr2f <dig> and fos emerged as candidates to explain species-specific and species-independent responses, respectively.
we employed oligonucleotide arrays to compare the response of  <dig>  rat and mouse orthologs.
we confirmed that there is limited inter-species overlap in dioxin-responsive genes.
rat-specific and mouse-specific genes are enriched for specific functional groups which differ between species, conceivably accounting for species-specificities in liver histopathology.
