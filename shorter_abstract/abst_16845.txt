due to the rapid data accumulation on pathogenesis and progression of chronic inflammation, there is an increasing demand for approaches to analyse the underlying regulatory networks.
we applied three methods to analyse ecm regulation: data discretisation to filter out noise and to reduce complexity, boolean network construction to implement logic relationships, and formal concept analysis  for the formation of minimal, but complete rule sets from the data.
the resulting temporal rules yielded new contributions to controversially discussed aspects of fibroblast biology  and corroborated previously known facts , but also revealed some discrepancies to literature knowledge .
the simulations were further analysed by the attribute exploration algorithm of fca, integrating the observed time series in a fine-tuned and automated manner.
for example, rheumatoid arthritis  is a chronic inflammatory disease, characterised by joint destruction and perpetuated by activated synovial fibroblasts .
the knowledge base containing all the temporal rules may be queried to predict the functional consequences of observed or hypothetical gene expression disturbances.
first, we extracted literature information to develop an interaction network containing  <dig> genes representing ecm formation and destruction.
the boolean functions of the initial network were improved iteratively by the comparison of the simulation runs to the experimental data and by exploitation of expert knowledge.
