hydrogen-dependent reduction of nbt was also catalysed by an oxygen-sensitive variant of hyd- <dig> that had a supernumerary cysteine residue at position  <dig> of the small subunit substituted for glycine.
high hydrogen concentrations facilitated visualization of hyd- <dig> activity.
furthermore, through the use of nitroblue tetrazolium  it was demonstrated that hyd- <dig> reduces this redox dye in a hydrogen-dependent manner, while neither hyd- <dig> nor hyd- <dig> could couple hydrogen oxidation to nbt reduction.
two of these hydrogenases are respiratory enzymes catalysing hydrogen oxidation, whereby hyd- <dig> is oxygen-tolerant and hyd- <dig> is considered a standard oxygen-sensitive hydrogenase.
hyd- <dig>  together with formate dehydrogenase h , forms the formate hydrogenlyase  complex, which is responsible for h <dig> evolution by intact cells.

hydrogen oxidation activity can be assayed for all three hydrogenases using benzyl viologen  as an artificial electron acceptor; however ascribing activities to specific isoenzymes is not trivial.
