highly effective shrnas targeting luciferase  or apolipoprotein b <dig>  were placed under the control of the pol ii cmv promoter and expressed at + <dig> or + <dig> nucleotides  with reference to the transcription start site .
our results demonstrate that artificial mirna have a better efficacy profile than shrna expressed either from h <dig> or cmv promoter and will be used in the future for rnai therapeutic development.
we investigated the optimal structural configuration of shrna molecules, namely: hairpin location, stem length and termination signal required for effective pol ii expression and compared it with an alternative strategy of avoiding toxicity by using artificial microrna  scaffolds.
different transcription termination signals , namely minimal polyadenylation , poly t  and u <dig> were also used.
all pol ii- expressed shrna variants induced mild inhibition of luciferase reporters carrying specific targets and none of them showed comparable efficacy to their polymerase iii-expressed h1-shrna controls, regardless of hairpin position and termination signal used.
when shluc, shapob <dig> and shapob <dig> were placed in an artificial mirna scaffold, two out of three were as potent as the h1-shrna controls.
extending hairpin stem length from  <dig> basepairs  to  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> bp yielded only slight improvement in the overall efficacy.
quantification of small interfering rna  molecules showed that the artificial mirna constructs expressed less molecules than h1-shrnas and that cmv-shrna expressed the lowest amount of sirna molecules suggesting that rnai processing in this case is least effective.
