argonaute  is the core component of rna-induced silencing complex.
full-length cdnas of all smagos were subsequently cloned and sequenced.
through a genome-wide analysis, we identified ten smago genes in s. miltiorrhiza.
phylogenetic relationships among ago proteins from s. miltiorrhiza, arabidopsis and rice were revealed.
the expression levels of smago genes in various tissues of s. miltiorrhiza were investigated.
using the modified 5â€²-race method, we confirmed that smago <dig> and smago <dig> were targeted by s. miltiorrhiza mir168a/b and mir <dig>  respectively.
it suggests the conservation of ago1-mir <dig> and ago2-mir <dig> regulatory modules in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis.
this is the first attempt to explore smagos and mirnas in s. miltiorrhiza.
the results provide useful information for further elucidation of gene silencing pathways in s. miltiorrhiza.
the results implied that some smagos, such as smago <dig>  smago <dig>  smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig>  probably played similar roles as their counterparts in arabidopsis; whereas the others could be more species-specialized.
sequence features, gene structures and conserved domains were analyzed by the comparison of smagos and atagos.
these smagos were characterized using a comprehensive approach.
additionally, we identified a total of  <dig> hairpin structures, representing six mirna gene families, to be mirna precursors.
the ago gene family has been analyzed in various plant species; however, there is no report about agos in the well-known traditional chinese medicine  plant, salvia miltiorrhiza.
