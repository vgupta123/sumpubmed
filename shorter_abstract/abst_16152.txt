the performed experiment shows that the application of jumping emerging patterns can be effective in the classification of high-dimensional data, including these from acgh experiments.
we present the comparison of our limjepclassifier to svm which is considered the most successful classifier in the case of high-throughput data.
in this paper we propose a new classification method of dna copy number data based on the concept of limited jumping emerging patterns.
our results revealed that the classification performance using limjepclassifier is significantly higher than other methods.
classification using acgh data is an important and insufficiently investigated problem in bioinformatics.
therefore, improving classification of acgh data can have a great impact on many medical issues such as the process of diagnosis and finding disease-related genes.
