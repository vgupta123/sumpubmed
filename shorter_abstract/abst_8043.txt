moreover, the proposed method can improve the prediction accuracy by introducing repetitive prediction process.
with the development of experimental methods such as the yeast two-hybrid method, the data of protein interaction have been increasing extremely.
then, interaction sites are predicted by extracting similar sites from the group of a protein cluster and the target protein.
however, few research on prediction interaction sites using both ppi networks and the 3d protein structures complementarily has explored.
we propose a method of predicting interaction sites in proteins with unknown function by using both of ppi networks and protein structures.
many databases dealing with these data comprehensively have been constructed and applied to analyzing ppi networks.
for a protein with unknown function as a target, several clusters are extracted from the neighboring proteins based on their structural similarity.
