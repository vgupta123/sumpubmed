median-joining network analysis, and bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses all recovered three lineages: one spanning middle america, the dominican republic, and north-western south america; one encompassing the dominican republic, roraima  and la paz  south to tierra del fuego, argentina; and a third, including eastern argentina and brazil.
its remarkable morphological and behavioral diversity probably represents recent responses to local conditions overlying deeper patterns of lineage diversity, which are themselves produced by isolation and the history of colonization of south america.
phylogenetic analyses suggest that the middle american/north-western south american clade is sister to the remaining two.
the pleistocene history of the rufous-collared sparrow involved extensive range expansion from a probable central american origin.
bayesian and maximum likelihood coalescent simulations used to study lineage demographic history, diversification times, migration rates and population expansion together suggested that diversification of the three lineages occurred rapidly during the pleistocene, with negligible gene flow, leaving genetic signatures of population expansions.
phylogeographic studies allow insights into how such events might have influenced evolutionary trajectories of species and ultimately contribute to a better understanding of speciation.
studies on continentally distributed species are of particular interest because different populations of such taxa may show genetic signatures of events that impacted the continent-wide biota.
