the system can be downloaded upon request, and an exemplary server has been constructed with which to build an asian biodiversity system http://www.asianbarcode.org.
we have built a general dna barcode data processing system, biobarcode, with open source software - which is a general purpose database and server.
dna barcoding provides a rapid, accurate, and standardized method for species-level identification using short dna sequences.

asia has a very high degree of biodiversity and the biobarcode database server system aims to provide an efficient bioinformatics protocol that can be freely used by asian researchers and research organizations interested in dna barcoding.
an exemplary database of biobarcode has around  <dig>  specimen entries  and registers the biological species to map their genetic relationships.
