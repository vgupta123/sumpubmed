our results are a proof of concept of the reliability of using de novo tools to annotate repeats in large animal genomes.
we have used an annotation strategy involving several complementary de novo tools to determine the repeat content of the model genome galgal <dig> , including identifying simple sequence repeats , tandem repeats and transposable elements .

these results have a major impact on the current understanding of repeats distributions throughout chromosomes in the red jungle fowl.
they have been used to show that avian genomes have a lower repeat content  than the sequenced genomes of many vertebrate species .
they have also revealed issues that will need to be resolved in order to develop gold-standard methodologies for annotating repeats in eukaryote genomes.
