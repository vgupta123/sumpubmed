in contrast to already available tools, web-tcga utilizes different methods for analysis and visualization of tcga data, allowing users to generate global molecular profiles across different cancer entities simultaneously.
the user can focus analyses on results from single genes and cancer entities or perform a global analysis .
in order to improve accessibility we created web-tcga, a web based, freely accessible online tool, which can also be run in a private instance, for integrated analysis of molecular cancer data sets provided by tcga.
as a supplement to other already available tools, such as cbioportal , web-tcga is offering an analysis service, which does not require any installation or configuration, for molecular data sets available at the tcga.
