oilseed germination is characterized by the degradation of storage lipids.
this study shows however that a complete degradation of oxygenated fatty acids is possible by isolated cucumber and sunflower glyoxysomes.
to our knowledge this metabolic pathway has not been described for the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids so far.
for the involvement of a lipoxygenase previous results suggested that the hydroxy- or oxo-group that is being introduced into the fatty acid backbone by this lipoxygenase forms a barrier to continuous Î²-oxidation.
interestingly, degradation is accompanied by the formation of saturated short chain acyl-coas with chain length between  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms lacking the hydroxy- or oxo-diene system of the oxygenated fatty acid substrate.
the presence of these coa esters suggests the involvement of a specific reduction of the diene system at a chain length of  <dig> carbon atoms including conversion of the hydroxy-group at c <dig>
