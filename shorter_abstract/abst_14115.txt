for methane mitigation strategies to be successful, it is important to establish which factors influence the rumen methanogen community and rumen volatile fatty acids .
in the present study, we used next-generation sequencing to determine if dairy breed and/or days in milk   affect the rumen environment and methanogen community of primiparous holstein, jersey, and holstein-jersey crossbreeds.
when the 16s rrna gene sequences were processed and assigned to operational taxonomic units , a core methanogen community was identified, consisting of methanobrevibacter  smithii, mbr.
the data from the present study suggest that a core methanogen community is present among dairy breeds, through out a lactation.
furthermore, the methanogen communities were more influenced by dim and the breed by dim interactions than breed differences.
the 16s rrna gene sequence reads clustered at  <dig> dim, but not by breed.
thaueri was lower in jerseys  and higher in holsteins  and holstein-jersey crossbreeds  .
the molar concentrations of total vfa were higher at  <dig> dim than at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dim, whereas the molar proportions of propionate were increased at  <dig> and  <dig> dim, relative to  <dig> and  <dig> dim.
at  <dig> dim, the mean % abundance of mbr.
enteric methane from rumen methanogens is responsible for  <dig> Â % of total methane emissions in the united states.
rumen methanogens also contribute to decreased animal feed efficiency.
