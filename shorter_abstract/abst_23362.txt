the association between jip <dig> and jip <dig> was dependent on the f <dig> residue in jip <dig>  and this association induced the formation of a stable ternary complex with kinesin- <dig>  on the other hand, the binding of jip <dig> and jip <dig> was independent of kinesin- <dig> binding.
we show here that jip1â€“kinesin- <dig> binding in neuro2a cells was dependent on conserved amino acid residues in the jip1-phosphotyrosine binding  domain, including f <dig>  in addition, mutation of f <dig> severely affected the neurite tip localization of jip <dig>  proteomic analysis revealed another kinesin- <dig> binding protein, jip <dig>  as a major jip <dig> binding protein.
this may imply a regulatory mechanism of kinesin-1-dependent intracellular transport.
