vertebrate skin appendages are constructed of keratins produced by multigene families.
we have studied the molecular evolution of these gene families in the genomes of  <dig> phylogenetically diverse birds and their expression in the scales and feathers of the chicken.
additionally, birds of prey have a larger proportion of claw β-keratins.
the β-keratins, however, demonstrate a dynamic evolution associated with avian lifestyle.
these results support the view that the number of α- and β-keratin genes expressed, the proportion of the β-keratin subfamily genes expressed and the diversification of the β-keratin genes have been important for the evolution of the feather and the adaptation of birds into multiple ecological niches.
the avian specific feather β-keratins comprise a large majority of the total number of β-keratins, but independently derived lineages of aquatic and predatory birds have smaller proportions of feather β-keratin genes and larger proportions of keratinocyte β-keratin genes.
analysis of α- and β-keratin expression during development of chicken scales and feathers demonstrates that while α-keratins are expressed in these tissues, the number and magnitude of expressed β-keratin genes far exceeds that of α-keratins.
we found that the total number of α-keratins is lower in birds than mammals and non-avian reptiles, yet two α-keratin genes  have expanded in birds.
