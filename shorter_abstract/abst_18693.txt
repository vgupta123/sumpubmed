typically, the datasets included several sequences containing multiple instances of a regulatory motif.
many dna regulatory elements occur as multiple instances within a target promoter.
the improvements to a-glam permitted it to predict the multiple instances.
gibbs sampling programs for finding dna regulatory elements de novo can be prohibitively slow in locating all instances of such an element in a sequence set.
we describe an improvement to the a-glam computer program, which predicts regulatory elements within dna sequences with gibbs sampling.
after convergence, a-glam reports predicted regulatory elements within each sequence in order of increasing e-values, so users have a statistical evaluation of the predicted elements in a convenient presentation.
first, it assigns an "individual score" to each subsequence of appropriate length within the input sequences using the initial pssm.
second, it computes an e-value from each individual score, to assess the agreement between the corresponding subsequence and the pssm.
thus, although the gibbs sampling step in a-glam finds at most one regulatory element per input sequence, the scanning step can now rapidly locate further instances of the element in each sequence.
datasets from experiments determining the binding sites of transcription factors were used to evaluate the improvement to a-glam.
