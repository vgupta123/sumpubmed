we used the human metabolic network reconstruction recon  <dig> and established constraint-based modelling tools to uncover novel functions associated with human metabolism.
these gaps were unevenly distributed within metabolic pathways but primarily found in the cytosol and often caused by compounds whose metabolic fate, rather than production, is unknown.
the results demonstrate how metabolic models can be utilised to direct hypotheses of novel metabolic functions in human metabolism; a process that we find is heavily reliant upon manual curation and biochemical insight.
importantly, we showed that automatically generated solutions could produce biologically realistic hypotheses of novel human metabolic reactions such as of the fate of iduronic acid following glycan degradation and of n-acetylglutamate in amino acid metabolism.
using a published algorithm, we computed gap-filling solutions comprised of non-organism specific metabolic reactions capable of bridging the identified gaps.
at the same time, a major challenge in the post genomic era involves characterisation of missing biological components to complete genome annotation.
