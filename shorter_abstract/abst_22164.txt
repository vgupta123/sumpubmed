here, we propose a formal definition of mapping on a de bruijn graph, analyse the problem complexity which turns out to be np-complete, and provide a practical solution.
although mapping reads on a de bruijn graph is complex task, our proposal offers a practical solution combining efficiency with an improved mapping capacity compared to assembly-based mapping even for complex eukaryotic data.
surprisingly, results show that up to  <dig> % more reads can be mapped on the graph but not on the contig set.
each contig describes the sequence found along some path of the assembly graph, however, the set of contigs does not record all the sequence information contained in that graph.
although many subsequent analyses can be performed with the set of contigs, one may ask whether mapping reads on the contigs is as informative as mapping them on the paths of the assembly graph.
its novelty is a procedure to map reads on branching paths of the graph, for which we designed a heuristic algorithm called bgreat .
in practice, many published genome sequences remain in the state of a large set of contigs.
ggmap can map millions of reads per cpu hour on a de bruijn graph built from a large set of human genomic reads.
