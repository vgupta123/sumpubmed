phylogenetic studies using chloroplast markers have generally supported a sister relationship between bambuseae and olyreae.
bambusoideae  comprise three distinct and well-supported lineages: tropical woody bamboos , temperate woody bamboos  and herbaceous bamboos .
additionally, this study presents the first published plastomes from neotropical woody bamboos and the first full plastome phylogenomic study performed within the herbaceous bamboos.
although the phylogenomic tree presented in this study is largely robust, additional studies using nuclear genes support monophyly in woody bamboos as well as hybridization among previous woody bamboo lineages.
in addition to these relationships, several unique plastome features are uncovered including the first mitogenome-to-plastome horizontal gene transfer observed in monocots.
this suggests either at least two origins of the woody bamboo syndrome in this subfamily or its loss in olyreae.
here a full chloroplast genome  phylogenomic study is presented using the coding and noncoding regions of  <dig> complete plastomes from the bambuseae, eight from olyreae and  <dig> from arundinarieae.
