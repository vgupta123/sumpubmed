overall, these findings indicate that rlx is a potent small molecule which triggers apoptosis, and promising potential candidate to be a chemotherapeutic agent.
additionally, morphological studies revealed membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and finally apoptosis in hct- <dig> cells.
rlx, a vasicinone analogue has been reported to possess potent bronchodilator, anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory properties.
here, we report for the first time that rlx has anti-cancer property against panel of human cancer cell lines and most potent activity was found against hct- <dig> cells with ic <dig> value of 12 μm and have further investigated the involvement of nfκb and caspase- <dig> in rlx action in crc apoptosis.
however, its anti-cancer activity is unknown.
