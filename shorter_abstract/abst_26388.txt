the algorithm was tested with a set of randomly generated patterns; the results were compared with seven other classification algorithms including support vector machines.
the algorithm was applied to the identification of secondary metabolite gene clusters of the antibiotic-producing eubacterium streptomyces coelicolor.
we present a single class classification method for the identification of genes of similar function from a gene expression time series.
through analysis of a time series of gene expression, the algorithm identifies pathways which are directly or indirectly associated with genes of interest, and which are active during the time course of the experiment.
the algorithm also identified pathways associated with transport of the secondary metabolites out of the cell.
