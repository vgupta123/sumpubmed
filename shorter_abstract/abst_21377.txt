as for all identified diapause genes, in future studies it will be critical to link various levels of rna expression with the functional roles of the coded products.
our study highlights the importance of using a combination of genome and transcriptome assemblies as references for ngs-based rna-seq analyses.
because the kmar genome is not publicly available, we built de novo genomic  and transcriptomic assemblies to serve as references for global genetic profiling of diapause in kmar, via rna-seq.
identification of diapause genes has been challenging due in part to the genetic heterogeneity of most vertebrate animals.
kmar offers a strong model for understanding patterns of gene expression during diapause.
many vertebrate species have the ability to undergo weeks or even months of diapause .
here we take the advantage of the mangrove rivulus fish —the only vertebrate that is extremely inbred due to consistent self-fertilization—to generate isogenic lineages for transcriptomic dissection.
