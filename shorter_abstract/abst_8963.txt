because of their highly polymorphic nature, msrs represent an extreme example of copy number variation, but their structure and function is largely understudied.
copy number variation, stability and genetic heterogeneity of the autosomal macrosatellite repeats rs <dig> , msr5p , flj <dig> , rnu <dig>  and d4z <dig>  and x chromosomal dxz <dig> and ct <dig> were investigated.

macrosatellite repeats , usually spanning hundreds of kilobases of genomic dna, comprise a significant proportion of the human genome.
this study represents the first comprehensive study of msrs in different human populations by applying novel statistical methods and identifies commonalities and differences in their organization and function in the human genome.
repeat array size distribution analysis shows that all of these msrs are highly polymorphic with the most genetic variation among africans and the least among asians.
the multimodal distributions with evidence for equidistant intervals, in combination with the observation of msr-specific constraints on minimum array size, suggest that msrs are limited in their configurations and that deviations thereof may cause disease, as is the case for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.
