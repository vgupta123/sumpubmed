we further observed fewer non-synonymous sites on the domains of hubs than on those of bottlenecks and different molecular functions between them.
the identification, description and understanding of protein-protein networks are important in cell biology and medicine, especially for the study of system biology where the focus concerns the interaction of biomolecules.
based on these results, we conclude that in recent human history, different variation patterns exist in hubs and bottlenecks in protein interaction networks.
by revealing the difference between hubs and bottlenecks, our results might provide further insights in the relationship between evolution and biological structure.
we found that the variation rate of hubs was significantly lower than that of bottlenecks.
