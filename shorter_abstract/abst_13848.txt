we interpret these findings as a neurophysiological substratum of the suprapontine nature of inspiratory load compensation in awake humans.
six healthy volunteers breathed room air without load  and then against inspiratory resistances .
transcranial magnetic stimulation  was performed during early inspiration  or late expiration , giving rise to motor evoked potentials  in the diaphragm  and abductor pollicis brevis .
the aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by examining the effects of inspiratory resistive loading on the response of the diaphragm to transcranial magnetic stimulation.
whereas the ventilatory response to chemical stimuli arises from the brainstem, the compensation of mechanical loads in awake humans is thought to involve suprapontine mechanisms.
breathing in humans is dually controlled for metabolic  and behavioral purposes  with reciprocal modulation through spinal integration.
inspiratory resistive breathing facilitates the diaphragm response to tms while it does not increase the automatic drive to breathe.
