the transcripts were annotated in terms of gene ontology related to muscle development.
we found that the genes cxcl <dig>  eif2b <dig>  psma <dig>  fbxo <dig>  and loc <dig> played vital roles in the muscle regulatory networks in the tc breed, whereas the genes sgcd, eng, thbd, aqp <dig>  and btg <dig> played dominant roles in the yk breed.
finally, the differentially expressed genes from our sequencing results were confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
muscle morphological changes indicate the importance of primary fiber formation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc , and secondary fiber formation from  <dig> to  <dig> dpc.
cluster analysis showed different gene expression patterns between tc and yk pigs.
this study detected many functional genes and showed differences in the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle development between tc and yk pigs.
tc pigs showed slower muscle growth and more complicated genetic regulation than yk pigs.
we present transcriptome profiles of  <dig> skeletal muscle samples from tongcheng  and yorkshire  pigs at  <dig> developmental periods  using digital gene expression on solexa/illumina’s genome analyzer platform to investigate the differences in prenatal and postnatal skeletal muscle between the two breeds.
our data provide a better understanding of skeletal muscle developmental differences and valuable information for improving pork quality.
the growth and development of skeletal muscle directly impacts the quantity and quality of pork production.
