by exploiting mutational paths towards the thermophiles, we could predict particular amino acid residues in individual proteins that contribute to thermostability and validated some of them experimentally.
studying the genomes and proteomes of these thermophilic fungi, we found common strategies of thermal adaptation across the different kingdoms of life, including amino acid biases and a reduced genome size.
proteomes of thermophilic prokaryotes have been instrumental in structural biology and successfully exploited in biotechnology, however many proteins required for eukaryotic cell function are absent from bacteria or archaea.
with chaetomium thermophilum, thielavia terrestris and thielavia heterothallica three genome sequences of thermophilic eukaryotes have been published.
a phylogenetics-guided comparison of thermophilic proteomes with those of other, mesophilic sordariomycetes revealed consistent amino acid substitutions associated to thermophily that were also present in an independent lineage of thermophilic fungi.
by determining the three-dimensional structure of an exemplar protein from c. thermophilum , we could also characterise the molecular consequences of some of these mutations.
