the presented evidence indicates that ucn downstream signaling does not involve the control of auxin or cytokinin homeostasis.
the results also reveal that ucn interacts with ats independently of an ats/ett complex required for integument initiation and they further emphasize the necessity to balance ucn and ats proteins during maintenance of planar growth in integuments.
finally ovules of ucn- <dig> ett- <dig> double mutants and ucn- <dig> ett- <dig> arf4- <dig> triple mutants displayed an additive phenotype.
we also show that ovules of ucn- <dig> plants carrying the dominant ats allele sk21-d exhibited more pronounced protrusion formation.
in the current model ucn controls this process during integument development by directly interacting with the aberrant testa shape  protein, a member of the kanadi  family of transcription factors, thereby repressing its activity.
these data deepen the molecular insight into the ucn-mediated control of planar growth during integument development.
little is known about the developmental control that regulates such planar growth in plants.
recent evidence suggested that the arabidopsis agc viii protein kinase unicorn  maintains planar growth by suppressing the formation of ectopic multicellular protrusions in several floral tissues including integuments.
