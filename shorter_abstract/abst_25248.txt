systems biologists work with many kinds of data, from many different sources, using a variety of software tools.
we highlight some capabilities of the gaggle with an exploration of helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery made possible by simultaneous data exploration using a wide range of publicly available data and a variety of popular bioinformatics software tools.
a solution to this problem should recognize that data types, formats and software in this high throughput age of biology are constantly changing.
we demonstrate that four simple data types  are sufficient to bring together diverse databases and software.
the gaggle uses java rmi and java web start technologies and can be found at .
we have integrated diverse databases  and software .
through this loose coupling of diverse software and databases the gaggle enables simultaneous exploration of experimental data , functional associations , metabolic pathways  and pubmed abstracts , creating an exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and spreadsheet biologists', to statistically savvy computational biologists, and those in between.
guided by the classic software engineering strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it integrates existing popular programs and web resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended environment.
a crucial challenge is to combine the capabilities of these  data resources and tools to create a data exploration and analysis environment that does justice to the variety and complexity of systems biology data sets.
