the predicted effect of the increase in pde1c products on the ot pathway may play an important role in stickleback behavior and ecology.
duplicate genes are considered to have evolved through the partitioning of ancestral functions among duplicates  and/or the acquisition of novel functions from a beneficial mutation .
on the other hand, gene expression analysis suggested that the derived isoforms acquired expression in new organs, implying their neofunctionalization in terms of expression patterns.
sequence evolution analysis did not provide strong evidence for neofunctionalization in the coding sequences of stickleback pde1c isoforms.
in silico simulations of ot implied that the increased pde1c dosage extends the longevity of the depolarization signals of the olfactory receptor neuron.
our analyses imply that an increase in gene product sometimes has a significant, yet unexpected, effect on the functions of subcellular networks.
our phylogenetic and synteny analyses suggested that the multiple pde1c genes in stickleback were generated by repeated duplications of >100-kbp chromosome segments.
currently, there is little understanding of the effect of increased gene dosage on subcellular networks like signal transduction pathways.
additionally, an increase in gene dosage resulting from duplication may also confer an advantageous effect, as has been suggested for histone, trna, and rrna genes.
stickleback has 8â€“ <dig> copies of this gene, whereas only one or two loci exist in other model vertebrates.
addressing this issue may provide further insights into the evolution by gene duplication.
in addition, at least seven isoforms of the stickleback pde1c were co-expressed with olfactory-type g-proteins in the nose, suggesting that pde1c dosage is increased in the stickleback olfactory transduction  pathway.
