here, we present evidence for mass molting events in two unrelated arthropods from the burgess shale walcott quarry, canadaspis perfecta and a megacheiran referred to as alalcomenaeus sp.
in addition, the finding of numerous juvenile alalcomenaeus sp.
the burgess shale is well known for its preservation of a diverse soft-bodied biota dating from the cambrian period .
while previous paleoecological studies have focused on particular species  or entire paleocommunities , studies on the ecology of populations  of burgess shale organisms have remained mainly anecdotal.
molts associated with the putative alga dictyophycus suggests a possible nursery habitat.
in this nursery habitat a population of this animal might have found a more protected environment in which to spend critical developmental phases, as do many modern species today.
