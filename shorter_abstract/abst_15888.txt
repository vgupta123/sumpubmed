we propose a model of a more flexible switch i region that contributes to faster adp release leading to high velocity movement of the algal myosin xi.
during this process, we have re-defined the gene boundaries for three sorghum myosin xi genes using fgenesh program.
sequences for et analysis were accumulated from six plant genomes, using literature based text search and sequence searches, followed by triple validation viz.
the current study identifies class-specific residues of myosin xi spread over the actin binding site, atp binding site and light chain binding neck region.
molecular modelling and subsequent analysis of putative interactions involving these class-specific residues suggest a structural basis for the molecular mechanism behind high velocity of plant myosin xi.
to provide sequence determinants and structural rationale for the molecular mechanism of this fast pace myosin, we have compared the sequences from myosin class v and xi through evolutionary trace  analysis.
we have identified nine myosin xi genes in sorghum and seven in grape by sequence searches.
