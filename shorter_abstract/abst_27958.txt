we present msavis, a new approach combining luminance and hue for simultaneous visualization of conserved motifs and sequence alignment.
input for the algorithm is a multiple sequence alignment in a standard format.
these visual cues are preattentive and separable so that the relationship between conservation strength and domain membership can be understood.
msavis utilizes two visual cues, luminance and hue, to facilitate at-a-glance summary of the conservation of a user-provided protein alignment while enabling multiple comparisons among functional domains.
by fusing this metadata visually, biologists can analyze sequence conservation and functional motifs simultaneously and efficiently.
multiple alignment of protein sequences can provide insight into sequence conservation across many species and thus allow identification of those sections of the sequence most critical to protein function.
the ncbi conserved domain database  is used for finding conserved domains along the alignment.
