a host of computational approaches have been developed to identify regulatory motifs, mainly based on the recognition of dna sequences for transcription factor binding sites.
we demonstrate that the ssm approach selects genes that are over-represented in specific biological categories  and are enriched in co-expressed genes.
the ssm approach is applied to a sample set of genes and validated using functional gene-set enrichment analyses.
here, we propose a different approach based on the compilation of simple shared motifs , groups of sequences defined by their length and similarity and present in conserved sequences of gene promoters.
finally we show that genes co-expressed in the same tissue or involved in the same biological pathway have increased ssm values.
regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in cellular functions.
an exceptional number of ssm is considered as a common regulatory pattern.
recent integration of additional data from genomic analyses or phylogenetic footprinting has significantly improved these methods.
