crop yields have to increase to provide food security for the world’s growing population.
this would increase the number of higher yielding varieties that are delivered to farmers and hence help to improve food security.
making more crosses reduced the overall probability of success of the breeding programme.
we then modelled optimum cross number using assumptions based on our experimental results.
based on these results, we modelled the optimum number of crosses by assuming there would be a decline in the reliability of the breeder’s prediction of the value of each cross as more crosses were made .
to achieve these yield increases there will have to be a significant contribution from genetic gains made by conventional plant breeding.
