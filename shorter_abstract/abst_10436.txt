altogether, our results indicate that rab27a plays an important role in hsv- <dig> infection of oligodendrocytic cells.
it is also accepted that hsv- <dig> acquires its final morphology through a secondary envelopment by budding into tgn-derived vesicles coated with viral glycoproteins and tegument proteins.
in fact, this small gtpase colocalized with viral glycoproteins gh and gd in that compartment.
however, despite the involvement of various rab gtpases in hsv- <dig> envelopment, there is, to date, no data reported on the role of rab27a in hsv- <dig> infection.
the small gtpase rab27a has been implicated in regulated exocytosis, and it seems to play a key role in certain membrane trafficking events.
functional analysis through rab27a depletion showed a significant decrease in the number of infected cells and viral production in rab27a-silenced cells.
it has been shown that hsv- <dig> glycoproteins accumulate in the trans-golgi network  and in tgn-derived vesicles.
