subjects had to perform a semantic judgment task , a rhyme judgment task  and a gender judgment task .
onset latencies of the n <dig> component were delayed in dyslexic readers in the rhyme judgment and in the gender judgment task, but not in the semantic judgment task.
the present study used event-related brain potentials to investigate semantic, phonological and syntactic processes in adult german dyslexic and normal readers in a word reading task.
normal readers responded faster compared to dyslexic readers in all three tasks.
however, the n <dig> persisted longer in the dyslexic group in the rhyme judgment and in the semantic judgment tasks.
specifically, semantic and syntactic integration seem to require more effort for dyslexic readers and take longer irrespective of the reading task that has to be performed.
these findings indicate that dyslexics are phonologically impaired  but that they also have difficulties in other, non-phonological aspects of reading .
