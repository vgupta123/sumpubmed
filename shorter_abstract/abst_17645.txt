these defects were readily identified by fluorometric analysis after sucrose density centrifugation in unprecedented resolution.
this strategy is useful to monitor and characterize subunit specific assembly defects caused by ribosome-targeting drugs that are currently used and to characterize new molecules that affect ribosome assembly and thereby constitute new classes of antibacterial agents.

we developed a system that allows visualization of intact ribosomal subunits and assembly intermediates  by convenient fluorescence-based analysis.
the reporter strain harbors fluorescently labeled ribosomal subunits that operate wild type-like, as shown by biochemical and growth assays.
