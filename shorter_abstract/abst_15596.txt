our results reveal that the transcription of a large fraction of b. cenocepacia j <dig> genes is altered upon exposure of sessile cells to ros.
in addition, multiple upregulated genes encode proteins that are necessary to repair ros-induced cellular damage.
a closer inspection of hybridisation signals obtained with probes targeting intergenic regions led to the identification of a putative 6s rna.
burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria are opportunistic pathogens, which can cause severe respiratory tract infections in patients with cystic fibrosis .
however, problems regarding the efficacy of several disinfection procedures for the removal and/or killing of b. cepacia complex bacteria have been reported.
in order to unravel the molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance of biofilm-grown burkholderia cenocepacia cells against high concentrations of reactive oxygen species , the present study focussed on the transcriptional response in sessile b. cenocepacia j <dig> cells following exposure to high levels of h2o <dig> or naocl.
as treatment of infected cf patients is problematic, multiple preventive measures are taken to reduce the infection risk.
these observations have highlighted that b. cenocepacia may alter several pathways in response to exposure to ros and they have led to the identification of many genes not previously implicated in the stress response of this pathogen.
many of the upregulated genes in the naocl- and h2o2-treated biofilms are involved in oxidative stress as well as general stress response, emphasizing the importance of the efficient neutralization and scavenging of ros.
