mature saturated brine  communities are largely dominated  by the square halophilic archaeon "haloquadratum walsbyi".
the metagenome of the microbial community of a crystallizer pond has been analyzed by end sequencing a  <dig> clone fosmid library and comparing the sequences obtained with the genome sequence of "haloquadratum walsbyi".
the genome of the sequenced strain was retrieved nearly complete within this environmental dna library.
many transposition and phage related genes were found within this pool which, together with the associated atypical gc content in these areas, supports lateral gene transfer mediated by these elements as the most probable genetic cause of this variability.
these results point to a large pan-genome  even in this highly specialized extremophile and at a single geographic location.
similar studies carried out in other extreme environments have revealed very little diversity in gene content among the cell lineages present.
