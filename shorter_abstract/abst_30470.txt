we show examples of how these improved interactomes can be used to analyze a genome-scale dataset  and to assign new function to proteins.
our website http://www.interologfinder.org provides research biologists intuitive access to this data.
the connectivity of the resultant networks was determined to have scale-free distribution, small-world properties, and increased local modularity, indicating that the added interactions do not disrupt our current understanding of protein network structures.
we therefore took a comparative biology approach to predict protein-protein interactions across five species  and developed interologfinder for research biologists to easily navigate this data.
