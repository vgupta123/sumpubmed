one of the major challenges in the analysis of such datasets is to discover local structures composed by sets of genes that show coherent expression patterns across subsets of experimental conditions.
the extended use of microarray technologies has enabled the generation and accumulation of gene expression datasets that contain expression levels of thousands of genes across tens or hundreds of different experimental conditions.
the proposed approach can be a useful tool to analyze large and heterogeneous gene expression datasets.
we assessed the potential of this methodology analyzing several synthetic datasets as well as two large and heterogeneous sets of gene expression profiles.
the uncovered structures showed a clear biological meaning in terms of relationships among functional annotations of genes and the phenotypes or physiological states of the associated conditions.
in this work we present a methodology able to cluster genes and conditions highly related in sub-portions of the data.
these patterns may provide clues about the main biological processes associated to different physiological states.
in all cases the method was able to identify localized features related to sets of genes that show consistent expression patterns across subsets of experimental conditions.
