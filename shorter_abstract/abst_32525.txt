twenty-six studies, including two conference proceedings, reporting clinical outcomes of aeds used for management of ie were identified.
heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures made meta-analysis inappropriate.
however, variations in baseline characteristics of the dogs involved, significant differences between study designs and several potential sources of bias preclude definitive recommendations.
for the remaining aeds, favorable results were reported regarding their efficacy, but there was insufficient evidence to support their use due to lack of brcts.
a good level of evidence supported the efficacy of oral phenobarbital and imepitoin and fair level of evidence supported the efficacy of oral potassium bromide and levetiracetam.
oral phenobarbital and imepitoin in particular, as well as potassium bromide and levetiracetam are likely to be effective for the treatment of ie.
