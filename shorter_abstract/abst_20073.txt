the aim of this study was to examine five feed ingredients for antiproliferative effects, as well as the interaction with toceranib phosphate and doxorubicin hydrochloride, when treating canine neoplastic cell lines in vitro.
turmeric extract  was the most potent and exhibited synergy with a rosemary extract  at concentrations from  <dig> to 25 μg ml− <dig>  this combination had an additive or synergistic effect with chemotherapeutic agents at selected concentrations within each cell line.
screening using mtt proliferation assays showed that green tea, turmeric, and rosemary extracts were the most effective.
no significant effects on cell viability were observed when the combination therapy was used with normal primary cells.
the use of turmeric and rosemary extracts in combination may be worthwhile to investigate in the pre-clinical and clinical neoplastic considering there are no negative effects on traditional chemotherapy treatment.
