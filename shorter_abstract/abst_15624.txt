bovine coronavirus  together with bovine torovirus , both members of the coronaviridae family, order nidovirales are the most common viral enteric pathogens.
a survey is carried out on  <dig> fecal samples from diarrheic young and adult cattle during the 3-year period from i) one large dairy herd, ii) four small herds and iii) three nasal and paired fecal samples from calves with symptoms of respiratory disease.
bcov was detected in  <dig>  % of fecal samples from symptomatic cattle and three nasal and paired fecal samples from calves with respiratory symptoms.
btov was detected in  <dig>  % of fecal samples from symptomatic cattle and a fecal sample from calves with respiratory symptoms.
molecular characterisation of those viruses revealed some nucleotide and aminoacid differences in relation to reference strains.
