accordingly, we have modified a previously reported vector to improve rna processing, minimise human immunodeficiency virus type- <dig>  sequence content and reduce repair of the self inactivating  deletion.
rna processing can be improved by mutation of the major and minor hiv- <dig> splice donor sites in the vector.
lentiviral gene therapy vectors are now finding clinical application.
hiv- <dig> sequence in the vector was reduced by substituting the polyadenylation signal with a heterologous signal.
in addition the rate of vector mobilisation and repair of sin vectors can be successfully reduced by careful vector design that reduces homology between the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats  to a minimum.
the combination of these modifications was able to significantly reduce the rates of both vector mobilisation and repair of the self inactivating deletion after two rounds of marker rescue.
mutation of splice donor sites was undertaken to prevent the majority of splicing within the vector genomic rna.
