we used a subset of validated snps for genetic diversity analysis of  <dig> tomato varieties and accessions.
patterns of sequence variation across five major tomato groups provided insight into to the effect of human selection on genetic variation.
array-based sfp discovery was an efficient method to identify a large number of molecular markers for genetics and breeding in elite tomato germplasm.
furthermore, the patterns of snp variation indicated that domestication and early breeding practices have led to progressive genetic bottlenecks while modern breeding practices have reintroduced genetic variation into the crop from wild species.
finally, we examined the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous substitutions  for  <dig> loci with multiple snps .
three varieties, fl <dig> , oh <dig> , and pi <dig>  were used as a source of genomic dna for hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays.
we explored array-based single feature polymorphism  discovery as a high-throughput approach for marker development in cultivated tomato.
cultivated tomato  has narrow genetic diversity that makes it difficult to identify polymorphisms between elite germplasm.
the fresh-market and processing groups displayed high genetic diversity relative to vintage and landrace groups.
