weak magnetic and electromagnetic fields can influence physiological processes in animals, plants and microorganisms, but the underlying way of perception is poorly understood.
the ion cyclotron resonance is one of the discussed mechanisms, predicting biological effects for definite frequencies and intensities of electromagnetic fields possibly by affecting the physiological availability of small ions.
we show that in arabidopsis thaliana, changes in ca2+-concentrations can be induced by combinations of magnetic and electromagnetic fields that match ca2+-ion cyclotron resonance conditions.
an aequorin expressing arabidopsis thaliana mutant  was subjected to a magnetic field around  <dig> microtesla  and an electromagnetic field with the corresponding ca2+ cyclotron frequency of  <dig> hz.
transient increases of cytosolic ca2+ were observed both after switching the electromagnetic field on and off, with the latter effect decreasing with increasing duration of the electromagnetic impact.
the resulting changes in free ca2+ were monitored by aequorin bioluminescence, using a high sensitive photomultiplier unit.
the magnetic field effect rapidly decreased if ion cyclotron resonance conditions were mismatched by varying the magnetic fieldstrength, also a dependence on the amplitude of the electromagnetic component was seen.
the applicability of recently hypothesized mechanisms for the ion cyclotron resonance effect in biological systems is discussed considering it's operating at magnetic field strengths weak enough, to occur occasionally in our all day environment.
the experiments were referenced by the additional use of wild type plants.
