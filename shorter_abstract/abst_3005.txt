neutrophils are non-dividing cells with poor survival after isolation.
we also show that rhob, but not the px domain of p47phox, is translocated to the membrane of mature phagosomes.
consequently, exogenous gene expression in neutrophils is challenging.
exogenous gene expression in human neutrophils was achieved  <dig> h post-transfection.
using this technique, we were able to show that the phox homology  domain of p47phox localizes to the plasma membrane in human neutrophils.
we demonstrated that cdna transfer and expression of exogenous protein in human neutrophils is compatible with cell viability and is no longer a limitation for the study of protein function in human neutrophils.
