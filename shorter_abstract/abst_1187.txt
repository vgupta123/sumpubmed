asymmetrical gene flow after divergence, from the eastern imperial eagle to the spanish imperial eagle, was detected for the nuclear genome but not the mitochondrial genome.
in this study we used a multilocus approach and the isolation-migration model based on coalescence theory to estimate the time of divergence of the spanish and eastern imperial eagle sister species.
spanish and eastern imperial eagles split from a common ancestor much more recently than previously thought, and asymmetrical gene flow occurred after divergence.
this model enables estimation of population sizes at split, and inference of gene flow after divergence.
male-mediated gene flow after divergence may explain this result, and the previously reported lower mitochondrial diversity but similar nuclear diversity in spanish imperial eagles compared to the eastern species.
our results indicate that divergence may have occurred during the holocene or the late pleistocene, much more recently than previously suspected.
