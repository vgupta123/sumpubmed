molecular electrostatic potentials calculated at the surface of 3d homology-modeling models show a correlation with inhibition of prothrombinase activity.
using surface plasmon resonance  protein-protein interaction measurements and an in vitro biological test of inhibition of prothrombinase activity, we identify a number of viperidae venom svpla2s that inhibit blood coagulation through direct binding to human blood coagulation factor xa  via a non-catalytic, pl-independent mechanism.
we have experimentally identified several strong fxa-binding svpla2s that disrupt the function of the coagulation cascade by interacting with fxa by the non-catalytic pl-independent mechanism.
this site is composed of the following regions: helices a and b, the ca2+ loop, the helix c-Î²-wing loop, and the c-terminal fragment.
the interface in fxa involves both, the light and heavy chains.
they exert their different functions by catalyzing the hydrolysis of phospholipids  at the membrane/water interface and by highly specific direct binding to:  presynaptic membrane-bound or intracellular receptors;  natural pla2-inhibitors from snake serum; and  coagulation factors present in human blood.
