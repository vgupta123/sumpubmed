gene set analysis based on gene ontology  can be a promising method for the analysis of differential expression patterns.
by applying ceago to both simulated and real microarray data, we showed that this approach could enhance the interpretation of microarray experiments.
however, current studies that focus on individual go terms have limited analytical power, because the complex structure of go introduces strong dependencies among the terms, and some genes that are annotated to a go term cannot be found by statistically significant enrichment.
we proposed a method for enriching clustered go terms based on semantic similarity, namely cluster enrichment analysis based on go , to extend the individual term analysis method.
when compared to parent-based individual term analysis methods, the results showed that ceago may provide more accurate differentiation of gene expression results.
