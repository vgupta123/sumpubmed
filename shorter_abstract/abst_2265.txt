our findings suggest a previously unrecognized functional role for the response regulator so <dig> in the activation of genes required for siderophore-mediated fe acquisition, fe storage, and other cation transport mechanisms.
knowledge of the molecular components and regulatory mechanisms dictating cellular responses to heavy metal stress, however, remains incomplete.
to delineate the cellular function of so <dig> and its contribution to metal stress response, we integrated genetic and physiological approaches with a genome-wide screen for target gene candidates comprising the so <dig> regulon.
so <dig> regulatory function is involved at a fundamental molecular level in the linkage between fe homeostasis and the cellular response to chromate-induced stress in s. oneidensis.
in a previous work, the s. oneidensis so <dig> gene, annotated as a dna-binding response regulator, was demonstrated to be specifically responsive at both the transcript and protein levels to acute chromate  challenge.
furthermore, the temporal expression profiles of four regulatory genes including a cpxr homolog were perturbed in the chromate-challenged mutant.
inactivation of so <dig> by an in-frame deletion resulted in enhanced chromate sensitivity and a reduced capacity to remove extracellular cr relative to the parental strain.
time-resolved microarray analysis was used to compare transcriptomic profiles of wild-type and so2426-deficient mutant s. oneidensis under conditions of chromate exposure.
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> exhibits diverse metal ion-reducing capabilities and thus is of potential utility as a bioremediation agent.
thirteen of these genes encoded proteins associated with transport and binding functions, particularly those involved in fe transport and homeostasis .
