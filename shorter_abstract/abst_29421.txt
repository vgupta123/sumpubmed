the aim of this study was to provide a foundation for gene expression analysis of disease response mechanisms in pinus patula through transcriptome assembly.

the assembled transcriptome will serve as a major genomic resource for future investigation of p. patula and represents the largest gene catalogue produced to date for this species.
this was partially alleviated through release of the  <dig> gbp pinus taeda v <dig>  genome sequence  in  <dig>  despite the fact that the fragmented state of the genome may hamper comprehensive transcriptome analysis, it is possible to leverage the inherent redundancy resulting from deep rna sequencing with illumina short reads to assemble transcripts in the absence of a completed reference sequence.
eighteen de novo and two reference based assemblies were produced for p. patula shoot tissue.
the resulting 52 mb p. patula v <dig>  shoot transcriptome consists of  <dig>  <dig> unigenes, 60 % of which could be functionally annotated.
furthermore, this assembly can help detect gene-based genetic markers for p. patula and the comparative assembly workflow could be applied to generate similar resources for other non-model species.
for this purpose three transcriptome assemblers, trinity, velvet/oases and soapdenovo-trans, were used to maximise diversity and completeness of assembled transcripts.
redundancy in the assembly was reduced using the evidentialgene pipeline.
