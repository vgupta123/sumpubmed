nov., preserves an axial, rod-like structure in the posterior body region that resembles a notochord in its morphology and taphonomy, with notable similarity to early decay stages of the notochord of extant cephalochordates and vertebrates.
characters of the common ancestor of vetulicolia + tunicata include distinct anterior and posterior body regions – the former being non-fusiform and used for filter feeding and the latter originally segmented – plus a terminal mouth, absence of pharyngeal bars, the notochord restricted to the posterior body region, and the gut extending to the end of the tail.

phylogenetic analyses resolve a monophyletic vetulicolia as sister-group to tunicates  within crown chordata, and this holds even if they are scored as unknown for all notochord characters.
some of its features are also consistent with other structures, such as a gut or a coelomic cavity.
the hypothesis that the free-swimming vetulicolians are the nearest relatives of tunicates suggests that a perpetual free-living life cycle was primitive for tunicates.
mounting evidence suggests that vetulicolians are deuterostomes, but affinities to crown-group phyla are unresolved.
