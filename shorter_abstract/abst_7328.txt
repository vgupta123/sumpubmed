manipulating ros amplitude through genetic interference of rbohs therefore may provide a practical way to generate male sterile plants.

hybrid vigor is highly valued in the agricultural industry.
pollen development is under strict control of both gametophytic and sporophytic factors, and defects in this process can result in male sterility.
both in the dicot arabidopsis and in the moncot rice, proper timing of programmed cell death  in the tapetum ensures pollen development.
dynamic ros levels have been reported to control tapetal pcd, and thus pollen development, in arabidopsis and rice.
we further showed that manipulating ros levels during anther development severely impaired pollen development, resulting in partial male sterility.
here, we performed histological analyses of anther development of two economically important dicot species, tobacco and tomato.
we identified the same ros amplitude during anther development in these two species and found that dynamic ros levels correlate with the initiation and progression of tapetal pcd.
this study demonstrated evolutionarily conserved ros amplitude during anther development by examining two commercially important crop species in the solanaceae.

male sterility is an important trait for crop breeding.
finally, real-time quantitative pcr showed that several tobacco and tomato rbohs, encoding nadph oxidases, are preferentially expressed in anthers.
