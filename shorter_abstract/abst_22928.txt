in such environments, reducing the time spent on creating user interfaces allows for a better deployment of resources for specialised tasks, such as data integration or analysis.
this paper proposes a model-driven approach for the partial generation of user interfaces for searching and browsing bioinformatics data repositories.
interfaces typically support repository access by means of web pages, but other means are also used, such as desktop applications and command line tools.
with pierre, four kinds of interfaces are generated: web, stand-alone application, text-menu, and command line.
interfaces often duplicate functionality amongst each other, and this implies that associated development activities are repeated in different laboratories.
interfaces developed by public laboratories are often created with limited developer resources.
the resulting system is known as pierre, and has been validated through its application to use cases in the life sciences, including the pedrodb proteomics database and the e-fungi data warehouse.
laboratories maintaining data resources are challenged to reconcile requirements for software that is reliable, functional and flexible with limitations on software development resources.
the proliferation of data repositories in bioinformatics has resulted in the development of numerous interfaces that allow scientists to browse, search and analyse the data that they contain.
inspired by the model driven architecture  of the object management group , we have developed a system that generates interfaces designed for use with bioinformatics resources.
this approach helps laboratory domain experts decrease the amount of time they have to spend dealing with the repetitive aspects of user interface development.
