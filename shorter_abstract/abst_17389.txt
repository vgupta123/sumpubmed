we demonstrate the efficiency of our new software by a comprehensive analysis of  <dig> rna-seq samples which we can finish in only a few minutes of hands-on time.
since multiple algorithmic approaches for the basic data analysis have been developed, there is now an increasing need to efficiently use these tools to obtain results in reasonable time.
while time and cost for the sequencing itself are decreasing, the analysis of the massive amounts of data remains challenging.
