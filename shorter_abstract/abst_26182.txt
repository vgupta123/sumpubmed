the expression level of these genes, however, may vary between tissues or cells and may change under certain circumstances.
our previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of vimentin, one cytoskeletal protein, was increased in ultraviolet b -irradiated fibroblasts.
the data herein provide evidence that actb and tubb <dig> are suitable reference genes in human skin fibroblasts irradiated by uvb, whereas vim and tuba1a are not and should therefore be excluded as reference genes in any gene expression studies involving uvb-irradiated human skin fibroblasts.
quantitative real-time pcr followed by analysis with the normfinder and genorm software programmes was performed.
by contrast, vim was found to be the least stable gene.
reference genes are frequently used to normalise mrna levels between different samples.
cytoskeleton genes have served as multifunctional tools for experimental studies as reference genes.
thus, we examined the expression of other cytoskeleton protein genes, actb , tuba1a , and tubb <dig> , in human dermal fibroblasts irradiated by uvb to determine which of these candidates were the most appropriate reference genes.
the analysis of the experimental data revealed actb to be the most stably expressed gene, followed by gapdh , under these experimental conditions.
the initial screening of the expression patterns demonstrated that the expression of vim was suppressed after uvb irradiation at doses ≥ <dig> mj/cm <dig> and that the expression of tuba1a was significantly reduced by uvb doses ≥ <dig> mj/cm <dig> in cultured human dermal fibroblasts.
