we present an extended simulation study to synthesize results.
conditional vims showed a decrease in vim values for correlated predictors versus the unconditional vims under ha and was unbiased under h <dig>  scaled vims were clearly biased under ha and h <dig>
unconditional unscaled vims are a computationally tractable choice for large datasets and are unbiased under the null hypothesis.
recent works on permutation-based variable importance measures  used in rf have come to apparently contradictory conclusions.
in the case when both predictor correlation was present and predictors were associated with the outcome , the unconditional rf vim attributed a higher share of importance to correlated predictors, while under the null hypothesis that no predictors are associated with the outcome  the unconditional rf vim was unbiased.
random forests  have been increasingly used in applications such as genome-wide association and microarray studies where predictor correlation is frequently observed.
