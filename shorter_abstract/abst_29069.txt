in addition, soda proposes a list of residue substitutions likely to improve the predicted preferences for the metal cofactor and oligomerization mode.
the method is based on residue fingerprints, consisting of residues conserved in sod sequences or typical of sod subgroups, and of interaction fingerprints, containing residue pairs that are in contact in sod structures.
superoxide dismutases  are ubiquitous metalloenzymes that play an important role in the defense of aerobic organisms against oxidative stress, by converting reactive oxygen species into nontoxic molecules.
if so, it predicts the metal ion specificity  and the oligomerization mode  of the target.
the soda webtool  predicts if a target sequence corresponds to an fe/mn sod.
