the automation of this information extraction requires high throughput management and analysis of genomic expression data, and integration of these data with other data types.
sbeams-microarray provides end-to-end support for genomic expression analyses for network-based systems biology research.
the biological information in genomic expression data can be understood, and computationally extracted, in the context of systems of interacting molecules.
sbeams-microarray, a module of the open-source systems biology experiment analysis management system , enables miame-compliant storage, management, analysis, and integration of high-throughput genomic expression data.
