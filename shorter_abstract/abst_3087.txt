in contrast to p. aeruginosa and other cyanogenic bacteria, cyanide was not detected during planktonic growth of bcc strains.
we have recently shown that hcn production by p. aeruginosa may have a role in cf pathogenesis.
b. cenocepacia and all  <dig> species of the bcc complex tested were able to make cyanide at comparable levels to p. aeruginosa, but only when grown surface attached as colonies or during biofilm growth on glass beads.
it is able to synthesise hydrogen cyanide , a potent inhibitor of cellular respiration.
over recent years the bcc have emerged as problematic pathogens of the cf lung.
the burkholderia cepacia complex  is a collection of nine genotypically distinct but phenotypically similar species.
they show wide ecological diversity and include species that are used for promoting plant growth and bio-control as well species that are opportunistic pathogens of vulnerable patients.
