moreover, it was predicted that modern breeding practices have generally decreased genetic diversity
we also found several genomic regions decreasing genetic diversity which might be caused by a recent human selection in rice breeding.
we could identify the ancestral origin of the pedigree haplotypes in  <dig> % of the koshihikari genome and  <dig> consensus haplotype blocks which are inherited from traditional landraces to current improved varieties.
the definition of pedigree haplotypes by means of genome-wide snps will facilitate next-generation breeding of rice and other crops.
then we designed a high-throughput typing array based on the snp information by comparison of the two sequences.
with the aid of their pedigree information, we clarified the dynamics of chromosome recombination during the historical rice breeding process.
the resultant koshihikari genome sequence corresponded to  <dig> % of the nipponbare sequence and led to the identification of  <dig>  <dig> snps.
detection of genome-wide snps by both high-throughput sequencer and typing array made it possible to evaluate genomic composition of genetically related rice varieties.
to create useful gene combinations in crop breeding, it is necessary to clarify the dynamics of the genome composition created by breeding practices.
finally, we applied this array to analyze historical representative rice cultivars to understand the dynamics of their genome composition.
here, we used a high-throughput sequencer to conduct whole-genome sequencing of an elite japanese rice cultivar, koshihikari, which is closely related to nipponbare, whose genome sequencing has been completed.
