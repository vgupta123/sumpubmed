the vectors are intented for agrobacterium tumefaciens and protoplast based transformation technologies.
efficient transformation methods to obtain site-directed gene replacement, targeted over-expression by promoter replacement, in-frame epitope tagging or fusion of coding sequences with fluorescent markers such as gfp are essential for this process.
the results show that four fragment vectors can be constructed in a single cloning step with an average efficiency of 84% for gene replacement and 80% for targeted overexpression.
the rapid increase in whole genome fungal sequence information allows large scale functional analyses of target genes.
the new vectors designed for user friendly cloning provided a fast reliable method to construct vectors for targeted gene manipulations in fungi.
here, we present a user friendly cloning based technique that allows single step cloning of the two required homologous recombination sequences into different sites of a recipient vector.
the system has been tested by the construction of vectors for targeted replacement of  <dig> genes and overexpression of  <dig> genes in fusarium graminearum.
construction of vectors for these experiments depends on the directional cloning of two homologous recombination sequences on each side of a selection marker gene.
