however, skeletal precursor cells in the proximal ribs were able to escape the noxious effect of functional loss of apc resulting in formation of highly active osteoblasts.
during skeletogenesis, protein levels of β-catenin in the canonical wnt signaling pathway determine lineage commitment of skeletal precursor cells to osteoblasts and chondrocytes.
to investigate whether apc is involved in lineage commitment of skeletal precursor cells, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking functional apc in col2a1-expressing cells.
the majority of the precursor cells lacking apc failed to differentiate into chondrocytes or osteoblasts.
our data indicate that a tight apc-mediated control of β-catenin levels is essential for differentiation of skeletal precursors as well as for the maintenance of a chondrocytic phenotype in a spatio-temporal regulated manner.
lack of functional apc resulted in a pleiotropic skeletal cell phenotype.
