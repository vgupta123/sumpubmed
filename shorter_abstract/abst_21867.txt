we investigated the genomic response at the level of mrna expression to the deletion of ssa1/ <dig> in comparison with the mild heat-shocked wild-type using cdna microarray.
yeast cdna microarray analysis revealed that genes involved in the stress response, including molecular chaperones, were up-regulated in a similar manner in both the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant and the mild heat-shocked wild-type.
genes involved in protein synthesis were up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, but were markedly suppressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type.
rt-pcr confirmed that the genes regulating protein synthesis and cytosolic protein degradation were up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant.
these results suggest that the mechanism for rescue of denatured proteins in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant is different from that in the mild heat-shocked wild-type: activated protein synthesis in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant supplies a deficiency of proteins by their degradation, whereas mild heat-shock induces upr.
at the translational level, more ubiquitinated proteins and proteasomes were detected in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, than in the wild-type, confirming that ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation was up-regulated by the deletion of ssa1/ <dig>
a yeast strain lacking the two genes ssa <dig> and ssa <dig>  which encode cytosolic molecular chaperones, acquires thermotolerance as well as the mild heat-shocked wild-type yeast strain.
the genes involved in ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation were also up-regulated in the ssa1/ <dig> deletion mutant, whereas the unfolded protein response  genes were highly expressed in the mild heat-shocked wild-type.
