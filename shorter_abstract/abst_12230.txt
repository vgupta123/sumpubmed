spp <dig> is a key regulatory factor that affects nerve degeneration and regeneration through c-fos, pkcα and p-erk/erk pathways after rat sciatic nerve injury.
here, we determined the effects of secreted phosphoprotein  <dig>  on wd after rat sciatic nerve injury.
in our previous studies, we reported some key factors that are differentially expressed to activate nerve degeneration and regeneration during wd.
altered expression of spp <dig> in schwann cells  resulted in altered mrna and protein expression levels for cytokines, c-fos, pkcα and phospho-erk/erk and affected sc apoptosis in vitro.

wallerian degeneration  in injured peripheral nerves is associated with a large number of up- or down-regulated genes, but the effects of these changes are poorly understood.
these results shed new light on the role of spp <dig> in nerve degeneration and regeneration during wd.
differential expression of spp <dig> after sciatic nerve injury in vivo altered the expression of cytokines, c-fos, pkcα, and the p-erk/erk pathway.
spp <dig> was upregulated from 6 h to 14 days after sciatic nerve injury.
