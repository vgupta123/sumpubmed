the majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins destined for translocation into the peroxisomal lumen are recognised via a c-terminal peroxisomal target signal type  <dig> by the cycling receptor pex5p.
our data therefore suggest that at least in the case of sterol carrier protein  <dig> the contribution of the second binding site is not essential for peroxisomal import.
to investigate the function of this secondary interface we have mutated two key residues from the ancillary binding site and analyzed the level of binding first by a yeast-two-hybrid assay, followed by quantitative measurement of the binding affinity and kinetics of purified protein components and finally, by in vivo measurements, to determine translocation capability.
at this stage, however, we cannot rule out that other cargo proteins may require this ancillary binding site.
