we also found that standard techniques for validating microrna-target interactions fail to differentiate between artifactual peaks and physiologically relevant peaks.
here, we present a modification to the hits-clip protocol that effectively eliminates this artifact and improves the sensitivity and complexity of resulting libraries.
we found that substantial mispriming during reverse transcription results in the overrepresentation of sequences complementary to the primer used for reverse transcription.
up to 45 % of peaks in publicly available hits-clip libraries are attributable to this mispriming artifact, and the majority of libraries have detectable levels of mispriming.
