glandular trichomes are production and storage organs of specialized metabolites such as terpenes, which play a role in the plant’s defense system.
our results identified new elements of the transcriptional regulation of tomato terpene biosynthesis in trichomes, a largely unexplored field.
the present study aimed to shed light on the regulation of terpene biosynthesis in solanum lycopersicum trichomes by identification of transcription factors  that control the expression of terpene synthases.
one tf of the myc bhlh class and one of the wrky class were able to transiently transactivate s. lycopersicum terpene synthase promoters in nicotiana benthamiana leaves.
high-throughput sequencing of tomato stem trichomes led to the discovery of two transcription factors that activated several terpene synthase promoters.
