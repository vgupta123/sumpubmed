in this work we integrate multiple information sources, including mirna-target binding information, mirna expression profiles, and go annotations.
the presented algorithm, which makes use of diverse biological data, is demonstrated to be an efficient approach for finding bi-targeting modules of viral and human mirnas.
numerous bioinformatics methods have been developed to identify the function of mirnas by predicting their target mrnas.
they play important roles in several biological processes .
we present a method to identify groups of viral and host mirnas that cooperate in post-transcriptional gene regulation, and their target genes that are involved in similar biological processes.
a need arises to understand the functional relationship between viral and host mirnas and their effect on viral and host genes.
our approach to meet this challenge is to identify modules where viral and host mirnas cooperatively regulate host gene expression.
micrornas  are an abundant class of small noncoding rnas  that can affect gene expression by post-transcriptional regulation of mrnas.
some viral organisms also encode mirnas, a fact that contributes to the complex interactions between viruses and their hosts.
our hypotheses and the methods have been tested on human and epstein barr virus  mirnas and human genes, for which we found  <dig> modules.
