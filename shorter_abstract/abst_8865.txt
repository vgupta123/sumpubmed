from this data we constructed a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree estimating the tiger shark lineage diverged from the placental carcharhinids approximately  <dig> million years ago.
this represents a dramatic shift in reproductive strategy, and is likely to have left a molecular footprint of positive selection within the genome.
along the tiger shark lineage, we identified five genes exhibiting a signature of positive selection.
our results indicate the loss of placenta in tiger sharks may be associated with subsequent adaptive changes in brain development and sperm production.
sharks belonging to the carcharhinidae family are all live-bearing, and with the exception of the tiger shark , develop placental connections after exhausting yolk reserves.
four of these genes have functions likely associated with brain development  and sexual reproduction .
phylogenetic relationships suggest the lack of placenta in tiger sharks is due to secondary loss.
we sequenced the transcriptome of the tiger shark and eight other live-bearing shark species.
