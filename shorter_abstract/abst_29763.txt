our study adds a novel role to vmp1's repertoire, namely the regulation of cytokinesis.
in addition, vmp <dig> has been implicated in organellar biogenesis; endo-, exo- and phagocytosis, and protein secretion; apoptosis; and cell adhesion.
in this study we analyzed a vmp <dig> homologue from the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
crvmp <dig> knockdown lines showed severe phenotypes, mainly affecting cell division as well as the morphology of cells and organelles.
