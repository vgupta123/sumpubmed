as such it is of interest to determine how these variants might be distributed in the biofilm environment.
these findings reveal that two variant colony morphotypes demonstrate a significant growth advantage over the wildtype morphotype in the biofilm environment.
the two variant morphotypes out-grew the wildtype across the entire biofilm and this occurred within  <dig> h and was maintained through to  <dig> h. this competitive advantage was not observed in homogeneous broth culture.
the emergence of colony morphology variants in structured environments is being recognized as important to both niche specialization and stress tolerance.
