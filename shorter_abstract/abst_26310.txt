our goal in biocreative has been to assess the state of the art in text mining, with emphasis on applications that reflect real biological applications, e.g., the curation process for model organism databases.
these results hold out promise that the technology can provide partial automation of the curation process in the near future.
the task was to produce the correct list of unique gene identifiers for the genes and gene products mentioned in sets of abstracts from three model organisms .
this paper summarizes the biocreative task 1b, the "normalized gene list" task, which was inspired by the gene list supplied for each curated paper in a model organism database.
