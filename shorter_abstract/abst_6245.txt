to rigorously define the role of dpp-iv in the immune system, we evaluated genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme on t-dependent immune responses in vivo.
the dpp-iv null animals mounted robust primary and secondary antibody responses to the t dependent antigens, 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-ovalbumin  and 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl-chicken gamma globulin , which were comparable to wild type mice.
dpp-iv null animals mounted an efficient germinal center reaction by day  <dig> after antigen stimulation that was comparable to wild type mice.
moreover, the antibodies produced by dpp-iv null animals after repeated antigenic challenge were affinity matured.
similar observations were made using wild type animals treated with a highly selective dpp-iv inhibitor during the entire course of the experiments.
t cell recall responses to ovalbumin and mog peptide, evaluated by measuring proliferation and il- <dig> release from cells isolated from draining lymph nodes, were equivalent in dpp-iv null and wild type animals.
in addition, female dpp-iv null and wild type mice treated with dpp-iv inhibitor exhibited normal and robust in vivo cytotoxic t cell responses after challenge with cells expressing the male h-y minor histocompatibility antigen.
furthermore, mice treated with dpp-iv inhibitor had intact t-cell recall responses to mog peptide.
these data indicate selective inhibition of dpp-iv does not impair t dependent immune responses to antigenic challenge.
