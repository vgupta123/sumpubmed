consistent with a regulatory interaction between the faf gene family and wus, our experiments indicate that the fafs can repress wus, which ultimately leads to an arrest of meristem activity in faf overexpressing lines.
faf <dig> and faf <dig> are expressed in the centre of the shoot meristem, overlapping with the site of wus expression.
the finding that meristematic expression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> is under negative control by clv <dig> further supports the hypothesis that the fafs are modulators of the genetic circuit that regulates the meristem.
our data indicate that the faf genes form a plant specific gene family, the members of which have the potential to regulate the size of the shoot meristem by modulating the clv3-wus feedback loop.
this study reports the initial characterization of the arabidopsis thaliana faf gene family.
throughout their lives plants produce new organs from groups of pluripotent cells called meristems, located at the tips of the shoot and the root.
here we show that a family of four plant-specific proteins, encoded by the fantastic four  genes, has the potential to regulate shoot meristem size in arabidopsis thaliana.
the size of the shoot meristem is tightly controlled by a feedback loop, which involves the homeodomain transcription factor wuschel  and the clavata  proteins.
