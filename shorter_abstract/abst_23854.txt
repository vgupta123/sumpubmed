the following concentrations combined with pre-amplification cycles were optimal for good quality samples: 20 ng of total rna with 15 cycles of pre-amplification, 20x and 40x diluted; and 5 ng and 20 ng of total rna with 18 cycles of pre-amplification, both 20x and 40x diluted.
here, we focused our attention on the limits of the specific target pre-amplification reaction and propose the optimal, general setup for gene expression experiment using biomark instrument .
this necessity can be solved by pre-amplification, which became a part of the high-throughput experimental workflow.
we also showed that variability of the pre-amplification, introduced into the experimental workflow of reverse transcription-qpcr, is lower than variability caused by the reverse transcription step.
factors identified as critical for a success of cdna pre-amplification were cycle of pre-amplification, total rna concentration, and type of gene.
we set up upper limits for the bulk gene expression experiment using gene expression dynamic array and provided an easy-to-obtain tool for measuring of pre-amplification success.
for evaluating different pre-amplification factors following conditions were combined: four human blood samples from healthy donors and five transcripts having high to low expression levels; each cdna sample was pre-amplified at four cycles  and five concentrations .
the selected pre-amplification reactions were further tested for optimal cq distribution in a biomark array.
