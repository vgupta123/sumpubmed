while algorithms are available that are specifically designed for performing transcriptome assembly from high-throughput sequencing data, they are very memory-intensive, limiting their applications to small data sets with few libraries.
we develop a transcriptome assembly algorithm that recovers alternatively spliced isoforms and expression levels while utilizing as many rna-seq libraries as possible that contain hundreds of gigabases of data.

with increased availability of de novo assembly algorithms, it is feasible to study entire transcriptomes of non-model organisms.
new techniques are developed so that computations can be performed on a computing cluster with moderate amount of physical memory.
it provides support for incremental updates of assemblies when new libraries become available.
