this approach is not fully satisfactory because genetic relationships between neighbouring sequences are a function of genetic distances, which are only poorly replaced by physical distances.
the genome coordinates for each gene are provided to maintain a simple use of the new definitions.
the definition based in genetic distance was more concordant with the results of these studies than the based in physical distance.
a gene definition based on genetic distance led to results more concordant with expert detailed analyses than the commonly used based in physical distance.
in the analysis of  <dig> top disease associated loci form the first study, the srr ≥ <dig> genes led to a fully concordant interpretation in  <dig> loci; the ±  <dig> kb genes only in  <dig>  interpretation of the  <dig> putative functional genes of the second study based in the srr ≥ <dig> definition only missed  <dig> of the genes, whereas the based in the ±  <dig> kb definition missed  <dig> genes.
some association studies, as the implemented in vegas, aligator, i-gsea4gwas, gsa-snp and other software tools, use genes as the unit of analysis.
the impact of these differences was illustrated with the interpretation of top association signals from two large studies including many hits and their detailed analysis based in different criteria.
we searched for a srr producing flanking sequences near the ±  <dig> kb offset that has been common in previous studies.
gene extensions have customarily been defined as ±  <dig> kb.
a srr ≥  <dig> was selected because it led to gene extensions with median length =  <dig>  kb and the simplicity of an integer value.
standardized recombination rates  from the decode recombination map were used as units of genetic distances.
