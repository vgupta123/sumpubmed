the identity of the isolates was confirmed by nested pcr and restriction enzyme assay .
a virus neutralization test showed a total of  <dig>  % animals were sero-positive for ehv- <dig>  an increase in antibodies titre with age as well as infection at earlier ages were observed.
the purpose of the present study was to analyse the incidence of ehv- <dig> in an argentinean horse population and correlate it with age and clinical status of the animals.
although ehv- <dig> has been implicated in immunosuppression in foals, upper respiratory tract disease, conjunctivitis, general malaise and poor performance, its precise role as a pathogen remains uncertain.
though ehv- <dig> was isolated from foals showing respiratory symptoms, further studies are needed to unequivocally associate this virus with clinical symptoms.
this is the first report on the presence of ehv- <dig> in argentina and adds new data to the virus distribution map.
ehv- <dig> was isolated from  <dig> out of  <dig> nasal swabs from horses showing respiratory symptoms.
