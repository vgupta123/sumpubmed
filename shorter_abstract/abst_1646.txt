here, we investigate if transcriptional changes caused by developmental malnutrition reveal an early response that can be linked to metabolism and metabolic diseases.
it induces subtle expression changes of metabolic genes: lipid transport, oxidative signaling, and glycolysis are affected during earlier stages, and hormonal signaling at  <dig> hpf.
notably, deregulated methionine cycle genes indicate altered methyl donor availability.
nutrient depletion during embryogenesis does not affect viability, but induces a bias towards female development.
co-citation analysis indicates association of deregulated genes to the metabolic syndrome, a known outcome of early-life nutrient depletion.
the systemic response to reduced nutrient availability in zebrafish embryos affects metabolic pathways and can be linked to metabolic diseases.
we assessed the functional impact of deregulated genes by enrichment analysis of gene ontologies, pathways and cpg sites around the transcription start sites.
we find that the regulation of deregulated genes may be less dependent on methyl donor availability.
limited nutrient availability during development is associated with metabolic diseases in adulthood.
we limited nutrient availability by removing yolk from zebrafish  embryos.
further exploration of the reported zebrafish model system may elucidate the consequences of reduced nutrient availability during embryogenesis.
