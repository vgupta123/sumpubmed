here we compare predicted toxins from the translated genome of the coral acropora digitifera to putative toxins revealed by proteomic analysis of soluble proteins discharged from nematocysts, to determine the extent to which gene duplications contribute to venom innovation in this reef-building coral species.
surprisingly, only 22Â %  of the potential toxin repertoire could be detected following rigorous proteomic analysis, for which only half  of the toxin proteome could be accounted for as peptides encoded by the gene duplicates.
a total of  <dig> potential toxin encoding genes could be predicted from the a. digitifera genome, of which  <dig>  had likely arisen by gene duplication as evinced using the hhcompare tool and verified using two standard phylogeny methods.
a new bioinformatics tool called hhcompare was developed to detect potential gene duplications in the genomic data, which is made freely available .
biological activities of these toxins are dominatedby putative phospholipases and toxic peptidases.
gene duplication followed by adaptive selection is a well-accepted process leading to toxin diversification in venoms.
gene expansions in a. digitifera venom are the most extensive yet described in any venomous animal, and gene duplication plays a significant role leading to toxin diversification in this coral species.
