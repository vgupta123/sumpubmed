this was achieved by examining the phylogeographic patterns in a widely distributed tasmanian endemic reptile, niveoscincus ocellatus.
the aim of this research was to identify the effects of pleistocene climate change on the distribution of fauna in tasmania, and contrast this with biotic responses in other temperate regions in the northern and southern hemisphere that experienced glacial activity during this epoch.
only the southeastern group had a signature of demographic expansion, occurring during the pleistocene but post-dating the last glacial maximum.
the phylogeographic patterns of n. ocellatus indicate pleistocene range and demographic expansion in n. ocellatus, particularly in the southeast and central areas of tasmania.
<dig> individuals from  <dig> populations across the distributional range of n. ocellatus were surveyed for variation at two mitochondrial genes , and two nuclear genes .
there was a high degree of mitochondrial haplotype diversity  and phylogeographic structure, where spatially distinct groups were associated with tasmaniaâ€™s northeast and a large area covering southeast and central tasmania.
phylogeographic structure was also present within each major group, but the degree varied regionally, being highest in the northeast.
in contrast, nuclear dna had low levels of variation and a lack of phylogeographic structure, and further loci should be surveyed to corroborate the mitochondrial inferences.
these phylogeographic patterns indicate contrasting demographic histories of populations in close proximity to areas directly affected by glaciers in the southern hemisphere during the lgm.
phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using a range of methods , and the demographic histories of populations were assessed .
