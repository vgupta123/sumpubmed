several ncrnas that are expected to exist in the s. mansoni genome were not found, among them the telomerase rna, vault rnas, and y rnas.
this data set provides an important reference for further analysis of the genomes of schistosomes and indeed eukaryotic genomes at large.
a homology search for structured ncrna in the genome of s. mansoni resulted in  <dig> types of ncrnas with conserved primary and secondary structure.
in addition, we confirmed five mirnas that have recently been reported in s. japonicum and found two additional homologs of known mirnas.
on the other hand, the number of trnas in the genome of s. japonicum is reduced by more than a factor of four.
draft genome sequences are now available for schistosoma mansoni and schistosoma japonicum.
non-coding rna  plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation, cellular function and defense, homeostasis, and pathogenesis.
the trna complement of s. mansoni is comparable to that of the free-living planarian schmidtea mediterranea, although for some amino acids differences of more than a factor of two are observed: leu, ser, and his are overrepresented, while cys, meth, and ile are underrepresented in s. mansoni.
among these, we identified rrna, snrna, sl rna, srp, trnas and rnase p, and also possibly mrp and 7sk rnas.
both schistosomes have a complete set of minor spliceosomal snrnas.
