the complexity of the data structure needed to describe the results and the graphic tools necessary to visualize them require a software deployment distributed between a client and a server application.
in order to implement the proposed system, we propose a metadata format known as reverse phase protein array markup language .
this data service backbone is available to multiple client side applications that can also access other server side deployments.
rppaml would enable researchers to describe, document and disseminate rppa data.
the proposed rppaml data format hopes to standardize rppa data.
reverse phase protein arrays  are convenient assay platforms to investigate the presence of biomarkers in tissue lysates.
in this report an rppa information management system  is described and made available with open source software.
