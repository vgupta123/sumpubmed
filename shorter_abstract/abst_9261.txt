precipitation in july-september, dystric cambisol, dystric regosol, and p and cu concentrations in soil were other negative predictors.
beef cattle herd density, dystric leptosol and fe concentration were positive predictors.
interestingly, absence of coniferous forest, herd density, specific soil type and concentration of some soil minerals are more important predictors than climate factors.
this study examined the geographical distribution of f. hepatica and identified high-risk areas for beef cattle in sweden and sought to characterise potential predictors.
spatial scan analysis  was performed to determine high-risk areas.
using datasets on animal density, temperature, precipitation and corine land cover data, including soil type and soil mineral concentrations in sweden, bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were carried out in r software to reveal potential predictors of f. hepatica infection.
absence of coniferous forest was the variable with the highest predictive value.
beef cattle serum samples were collected during winter 2006- <dig> from  <dig> herds which were examined for f. hepatica antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
overall herd seroprevalence of f. hepatica in beef cattle was  <dig>  % .
the spatial distribution of f. hepatica in swedish beef cattle herds is influenced by multi-factorial effects.
an irregular spatial distribution of f. hepatica, with two main clusters, was observed in south-west sweden.
the most northerly occurrence of f. hepatica in the world was documented.
the final model explained  <dig>  % of the variation in f. hepatica distribution in study herds.
previous studies in north-west europe have described its geographical distribution and determined potential predictors of fasciolosis using geographical information system  and regression modelling.
fasciola hepatica is a parasite with a significant impact on ruminant livestock production.
