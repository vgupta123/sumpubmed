when compared to the control group, the renal diet was associated with significantly lower urine phosphate concentrations and loss of body weight.
lenziaren® had similar effects on urine phosphate concentrations compared to the renal diet, but was not associated with loss of body weight.
lenziaren® was well tolerated and was associated with higher food consumption and serum iron concentrations versus the control.
significant effects versus the control group were observed at the  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/day dosages.
when compared to the control group, lenziaren® produced significant dose-related reductions in urine phosphate concentrations, urine phosphate excretion and fractional urinary phosphate excretion.
the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of the new oral phosphate binder lenziaren®  were evaluated in a randomized parallel-group design study in  <dig> healthy cats .
lenziaren® was effective as an oral phosphate binder in cats fed with a standard diet containing  <dig> % phosphorus.
dosages of  <dig> - <dig>  g/cat per day are recommended for clinical testing in cats fed with a standard diet.
