the exceptional similarity of the n. salina and n. gaditana organellar genomes suggests that n. gaditana be reclassified as a strain of n. salina.
microalgae in the genus nannochloropsis are photosynthetic marine eustigmatophytes of significant interest to the bioenergy and aquaculture sectors due to their ability to efficiently accumulate biomass and lipids for utilization in renewable transportation fuels, aquaculture feed, and other useful bioproducts.
comparison of the nannochloropsis pangenome to other algae within and outside of the same phyla revealed regions of significant genetic divergence in key genes that encode proteins needed for regulation of branched chain amino synthesis , carbon fixation , energy conservation , protein synthesis and homeostasis .
implementation of secondary and tertiary structure prediction was crucial to functionally characterize many proteins and therefore should be implemented in automated annotation pipelines.
to better understand the genetic complement that drives the metabolic processes of these organisms, we present the assembly and comparative pangenomic analysis of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes from nannochloropsis salina ccmp <dig>
the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of n. salina are  <dig> % and 97% identical to their counterparts in nannochloropsis gaditana.
