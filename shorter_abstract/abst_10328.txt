in this present study, an attempt has been made to describe the toxin profile of a. labialis from kangaroo island using the cdna library of its venom glands.
however, cellular trancripts from the same venom glands are not affected.
interestingly, the cdna library reveals that most of the toxin families  have truncated transcripts due to insertion or deletion of nucleotides.
they include  putative long-chain and short-chain neurotoxins,  phospholipase a <dig>   kunitz-type protease inhibitor,  crisps,  c-type lectins and  metalloproteases.
we sequenced  <dig> clones which represent the common families of toxin genes present in snake venom.
this unusual higher rate of deletion and insertion of nucleotide in toxin genes may be responsible for the lower toxicity of a. labialis venom of kangroo island and have significant effect on evolution of toxin genes.
the pygmy copperhead  is one of the less studied species.
