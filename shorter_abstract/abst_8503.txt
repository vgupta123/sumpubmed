molecular recognition is all pervasive in biology.
the interface residues are shown segregated into spatial patches  and/or core and rim regions.
results can be used to infer if a particular interface belongs to a homodimeric molecule.
a number of physicochemical parameters defining the interface is tabulated.
a web-server, proface  has been developed for dissecting protein-protein interfaces and deriving various physicochemical parameters.
