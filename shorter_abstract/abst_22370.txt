there are  <dig> zebrafish survivin genes  with overlapping expression patterns during early development, prominently in neural and vascular structures.
to gain further insights into the properties of survivin, we used the zebrafish model.
overall, with the zebrafish model, we identify survivin as a key regulator of neurogenesis, vasculo-angiogenesis, hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis.
these properties of survivin, which are consistent with those identified in mice, indicate that its functions are highly conserved across species, and point to the value of the zebrafish model in understanding the role of this iap in the pathogenesis of human disease, and for exploring its potential as a therapeutic target.
survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein  family, that uniquely also promotes mitosis and cell proliferation.
fully delineating the properties of survivin in vivo in mice has been confounded by early lethal phenotypes following survivin gene inactivation.
postnatally, survivin is hardly detected in most tissues, but is upregulated in all cancers, and as such, is a potential therapeutic target.
normal growth and development of organisms requires maintenance of a dynamic balance between systems that promote cell survival and those that induce apoptosis.
the phenotypes induced by morpholino knockdown of one survivin gene, were rescued by overexpression of the other, indicating that the birc <dig> paralogs may compensate for each.
