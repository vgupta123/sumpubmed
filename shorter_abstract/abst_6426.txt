members of this toxin family are potently haemolytic and cause pain, inflammation, dermonecrosis, cardiovascular collapse and death in experimental animals, suggesting that these toxins are responsible for many of the symptoms of c. fleckeri envenomation.
potential toxins identified using ms/ms included metalloproteinases, an alpha-macroglobulin domain containing protein, two crisp proteins and a turripeptide-like protease inhibitor.
the box jellyfish, chironex fleckeri, is the largest and most dangerous cubozoan jellyfish to humans.
the generated data represent a useful resource to guide future comparative studies, novel protein/peptide discovery and the development of more effective treatments for jellyfish stings in humans.
this study provides the first overview of a box jellyfish transcriptome which, coupled with venom proteomics data, enhances our current understanding of box jellyfish venom composition and the molecular structure and function of cnidarian toxins.
ms/ms analysis of c. fleckeri venom identified over  <dig> proteins, including a subset of the toxins predicted from analysis of the transcriptome.
