there are evidences that cxs also play channel-independent role in cell adhesion, migration, division, differentiation, formation of neuronal networks and tumorigenicity.
tts have been identified in the brain and share similarities with neuronal processes.
therefore, we examined the impact of cxs expressed in the nervous system  on: 1) cell mobility; 2) formation and properties of tts; and 3) transfer of sirna between remote cells through tts.

membranous tunneling tubes  are a recently discovered new form of communication between remote cells allowing their electrical synchronization, migration, and transfer of cellular materials.
tts can be open-ended, close-ended or contain functional gap junctions at the membrane interface.
we have identified two types of tts between hela cells: f-actin rich only and containing f-actin and α-tubulin.
also, cx36-egfp and cx40-cfp-expressing hela cells were more mobile compared with wt and other cxs-expressing cells.
in addition, we show that cx43-egfp-expressing hela cells and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells can couple to the mesenchymal stem cells through tts.
different cxs may modulate the mobility of cells and formation of tts in an opposite manner; sirna transfer through the gj-containing tts is cx isoform-dependent.
