pathogen populations may adapt to host genotypes through increased infection efficiency while their plant hosts may adapt by limiting the later stages of pathogen growth and spore production within the host.
our results illustrate mechanisms by which variation in host populations will affect the evolution of pathogen life history.
results show that different pathogen life-history stages have the potential to respond differently to selection by host or pathogen genotype and suggest mechanisms of antagonistic coevolution.
while pathogen reproduction is the end result of an intricate interaction between host and pathogen, the relative contributions of host and pathogen genotype to variation in pathogen life history within the host are not well understood.
we show that both pathogen and host genotype significantly affect total spore production but do so through their effects on different life-history stages.
in addition, host genotype affected the relationship between pathogen density and the later life-history traits of latent period and sporulation capacity.
adaptation of pathogens to their hosts depends critically on factors affecting pathogen reproductive rate.

we investigated the effects of pathogen and host genotype on three life-history components of pathogen fitness; infection efficiency, latent period, and sporulation capacity, in the oat crown rust fungus, puccinia coronata f.sp.
pathogen genotype has the strongest effect on the early stage of infection efficiency, while host genotype most strongly affects the later life-history stages of latent period and sporulation capacity.
