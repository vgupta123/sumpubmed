given the importance of metabolic crosstalk between hosts and pathogens, a metabolic network-based reverse ecology method was proposed to infer these interactions.
we re-evaluated the importance of the reverse ecology method for evaluating host–pathogen interactions while statistically controlling for confounding effects using oxygen requirement, genome, metabolic network, and phylogeny data.
rather, we highlight the need for developing more suitable methods for inferring host–pathogen interactions and conducting more careful examinations of the relationships between metabolic networks and host–pathogen interactions.

these results indicate the limitations of the reverse ecology method; however, they do not discount the importance of adopting reverse ecology approaches altogether.
our data analyses showed that host–pathogen interactions were more strongly influenced by genome size, primary network parameters , oxygen requirement, and phylogeny than the reserve ecology-based measures.

host–pathogen interactions are important in a wide range of research fields.
