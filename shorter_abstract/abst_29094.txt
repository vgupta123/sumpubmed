staphylococcus epidermidis is a commensal bacterium but can colonize the hospital environment due to its ability to form biofilms favouring adhesion to host tissues, medical devices and increasing resistance to antibiotics.
the complete genomes of two staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages, vb_sepis-phiipla <dig> and vb_sepis-phiipla <dig>  have been analyzed.
staphylococcus epidermidis bacteriophages, vb_sepis-phiipla <dig> and vb_sepis-phiipla <dig>  have a mosaic structure similar to other widespread s. epidermidis prophages.
using these genes, high prevalence  of phage dna in a representative s. epidermidis strain collection consisting of  <dig> isolates from women with mastitis and healthy women was determined.
putative pectin lyase-like domains detected in virion-associated proteins of both phages could be involved in exopolysaccharide  depolymerization, as evidenced by both the presence of a clear halo surrounding the phage lysis zone and the phage-mediated biofilm degradation.
a mosaic structure of s. epidermidis prophage genomes was revealed by pcr analysis of three marker genes .
