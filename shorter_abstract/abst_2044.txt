and its host ant camponotus leonardi in a thai rainforest, where infected ants descend from their canopy nests down to understory vegetation to bite into abaxial leaf veins before dying.
we show that the mandibles of ants penetrate deeply into vein tissue and that this is accompanied by extensive atrophy of the mandibular muscles.
here we focus on one of the most dramatic examples of behavioral manipulation, the death grip of ants infected by ophiocordyceps fungi.
extended phenotypes in ants induced by fungal infections are a complex example of behavioral manipulation requiring coordinated changes of host behavior and morphology.
here we address whether the sequence of ant behaviors leading to the final death grip can also be interpreted as parasite adaptations and describe some of the morphological changes inside the heads of infected workers that mediate the expression of the death grip phenotype.
transitions from erratic wandering to death grips on a leaf vein were abrupt and synchronized around solar noon.
we further present histological data to show that a high density of single celled stages of the parasite within the head capsule of dying ants are likely to be responsible for this muscular atrophy.
we studied the interaction between o. unilateralis s.l.
parasites that manipulate host behavior can provide prominent examples of extended phenotypes: parasite genomes controlling host behavior.
