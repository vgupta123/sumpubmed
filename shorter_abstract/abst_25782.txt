expression of vertebrate aanats is limited primarily to the pineal gland and retina, where it plays a role in controlling the circadian rhythm in melatonin synthesis.
non-vertebrate aanats, which occur in fungi and protists, are thought to play a role in detoxification and are not known to be associated with a specific tissue.
bfaanatα and bfaanatδ' have unusually alkaline  optimal ph, more than two ph units higher than that of vertebrate aanats.
analysis of the expression pattern of the two most structurally divergent aanats in branchiostoma lanceolatum  revealed that they are expressed early in development and also in the adult at low levels throughout the body, possibly associated with the neural tube.
the substrate selectivity profiles of bfaanatα and δ' are relatively broad, including alkylamines, arylalkylamines and diamines, in contrast to vertebrate forms, which selectively acetylate serotonin and other arylalkylamines.
based on the role melatonin plays in biological timing, aanat has been given the moniker "the timezyme".
based on these features, it appears that amphioxus aanats could play several roles, including detoxification and biogenic amine inactivation.
blaanat activity is influenced by environmental lighting, but light/dark differences do not persist under constant light or constant dark conditions, indicating they are not circadian in nature.
we have found that the amphioxus genome contains seven aanats, all having non-vertebrate type features.
expression is clearly not exclusively associated with the proposed analogs of the pineal gland and retina.
