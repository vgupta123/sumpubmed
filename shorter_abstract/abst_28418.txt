the activator p14k is necessary for the activation of nitrile hydratase .
our results are not only useful for the nhase activator expression and the understanding of the role of ser <dig> during nhase activation, but also helpful for other proteins with difficulty in heterologous expression.
in addition, the ser <dig> in the characteristic motif cxlc-ser115-c of the active center of nhase was found to be unnecessary for nhase maturation.
p14k was successfully expressed through fusing a his tag , and was over-expressed through fusing a gst tag  at its n-terminus in the nhase of bordetella petrii dsm  <dig>  the stability of gst-p14k was demonstrated to be higher than that of the his-p14k.
