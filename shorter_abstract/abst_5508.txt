the stability of proteins is governed by the heat capacity, enthalpy and entropy changes of folding, which are strongly correlated to the change in solvent accessible surface area experienced by the polypeptide.
the sequence specific atom accessibilities provided by protsa will allow obtaining better estimates of the contribution of the hydrophobic effect to the free energy of folding, will help to refine existing parameterizations of protein folding energetics, and will be useful to understand the influence of point mutations on protein stability.
protsa, a web application that calculates sequence-specific solvent accessibilities of the unfolded state ensembles of proteins has been developed and made freely available to the scientific community.
a web application providing realistic accessibilities of the unfolded ensemble of a given protein at the atomic level will prove useful.
protsa is a novel tool for the researcher investigating protein folding energetics.
