using entropy reduction as an objective criterion gives a natural way to tackle both issues of detection and localization simultaneously and to integrate intermediate phenotypic data.
unlike previous methods, spare can integrate the information of previously phenotyped individuals, thereby enabling an efficient incremental strategy.
with the advance of genome sequencing technologies, phenotyping, rather than genotyping, is becoming the most expensive task when mapping genetic traits.
