the dominant pufas, 18:2n- <dig>  and 18:3n- <dig> , accounted for about 50% of total fas obtained, while the n- <dig> pufas, 18:3n- <dig>  and 18:4n- <dig> , represented approximately 5% of the total.
the novel results presented here show the utility and high potential of e. acanthocarpum hairy roots.
eicosapentaenoic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid  are well known.
the fas were chiefly stored in the hairy roots with very minute amounts being released into the liquid nutrient medium.
they are capable of biosynthesizing and accumulating a large range of polyunsaturated fas, including the target gla and sda fatty acids in appreciable quantities.
assuming a compromise between fa production and hairy root biomass, it was determined that sampling times  <dig> and  <dig> gave the most useful fa yields.
production of fas did not parallel hairy root growth, and the optimal productivity was always associated with the highest biomass density during the culture period.
in order to obtain alternative sources for the large-scale production of pufas, new searches are being conducted focusing on higher plants oils which can contain these n- <dig> and n- <dig> c <dig> precursors, i.e.
total lipid amounts were in general comparable between the different hairy root lines , with the major lipid classes being triacylglycerols.
furthermore, this study constitutes the first example of a boraginaceae species hairy root induction and establishment for fa studies and production.
the therapeutic and health promoting role of highly unsaturated fatty acids  from fish, i.e.
these same benefits may however be shared by some of their precursors, the polyunsaturated fatty acids , such as stearidonic acid .
the establishment of the novel echium acanthocarpum hairy root cultures represents a powerful tool in order to research the accumulation and metabolism of fatty acids  in a plant particularly rich in gla and sda.
