we and others reported that pc- <dig> regulates the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration.
notably, we uncovered that pc- <dig> regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton impacts on the turnover rates of focal adhesions in migrating cells and we link all these properties to the capability of pc- <dig> to regulate the activation state of focal adhesion kinase .
the two cytoskeletal components are acting in a coordinated fashion.
polycystin- <dig>  is a large plasma membrane receptor, encoded by the pkd <dig> gene, which is mutated in most cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease .
in search for the mechanism responsible for this new property of pc- <dig> we found that this receptor is able to regulate the stability of the microtubules, in addition to its capability to regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
