fveps are used clinically in human medicine and also experimentally in a number of animal species, but the method has not yet been evaluated in the horse.
the potentials recorded were shown to be of post-retinal origin.
reproducible results were obtained when the active electrode was placed in the midline rostral to the nuchal crest.
recording at lateral positions gave more variable results, possibly due to ear muscle artifacts.
we describe the waveform of the equine fvep and our results show that it is possible to record fveps in sedated horses in a clinical setting.
retrobulbar nerve block caused a transient loss of the vep whereas transection of the optic nerve caused an irreversible loss.
the aim was to establish a method for recording of fveps in horses in a clinical setting and to evaluate the waveform morphology in the normal horse.
the method would potentially allow the ophthalmologist and equine clinician to evaluate visual impairment caused by disorders affecting post-retinal visual pathways.
electrical potentials generated in the central nervous system in response to brief visual stimuli, flash visual evoked potentials , can be recorded non-invasively over the occipital cortex.
to evaluate potential contamination of the fvep from retinal potentials, a retrobulbar nerve block was performed in two horses and transection of the optic nerve was performed in one horse as a terminal procedure.
