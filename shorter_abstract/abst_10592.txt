particularly, vrbaâ€™s turnover pulse hypothesis and resource-use hypothesis revolve around the importance of biome inhabitation.
the pattern of faunal turnover is correlated with the development of the modern glaciations in the northern hemisphere around  <dig>  ma, and represents a reorganization of the rodent communities, as suggested by the turnover pulse hypothesis.
our data also support the resource-use hypothesis, which presumes the role of the degree of specialization in resources specifically related to particular biomes as a driver of differential speciation and extinction rates.
several macroevolutionary hypotheses propose a synchrony between climatic changes and variations in the structure of faunal communities.
our results indicate that there was a decrease in the specialization degree of rodent faunas during the pliocene due to the global cooling that triggered the onset of the glacial events of the cenozoic .
these results stress the intimate connection between ecological and evolutionary changes.
in order to test these hypotheses, we used the biomic specialization index, which is based on the number of biomes occupied by each species, and evaluated the changes in the relative importance of generalist and specialist rodents in more than forty fossil sites from the iberian plio-pleistocene.
