our results indicate that our adaptive approach is superior to the previous analysis in terms of nucleotide sensitivity and transfrag specificity.
the prediction is accompanied by an expression probability curve for visual inspection of the supporting evidence.
we present a probabilistic procedure, expresshmm, that adaptively models tiling data prior to predicting expression on genomic sequence.
subsequently, prediction of transcribed fragments is made on tiled genomic sequence.
genomic tiling micro arrays have great potential for identifying previously undiscovered coding as well as non-coding transcription.
tiling array experiments on ten human chromosomes  <cit> .
a hidden markov model  is used to model the distributions of tiling array probe scores in expressed and non-expressed regions.
