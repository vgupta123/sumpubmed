how then can we use rearrangement algorithms to compare genomes available in scaffold form only?
we model the relationship between the ratio of missing genes actually absent from the genome versus merely unsequenced ones, on one hand, and the increase of genomic distance after scaffold filling, on the other.
this is accomplished by an exact, polynomial-time algorithm.
we estimate the parameters of this model through simulations and by comparing the angiosperm genomes ricinus communis and vitis vinifera.
can the comparative evidence predict the location of unsequenced genes?
rearrangement algorithms, however, including gene order-based phylogenetic tools, require whole genome data on gene order or syntenic block order.
increasing numbers of genomes are being published in scaffold or contig form.
