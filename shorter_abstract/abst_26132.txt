using these and the additional  <dig>  existing bac end sequences as a resource along with linkage mapping and existing physical map, conserved syntenic regions were identified between the catfish and zebrafish genomes.
we reported the generation of  <dig>  bac end sequences and their applications for comparative genome analysis in catfish.
bac end sequences and their associated polymorphic markers are great resources for comparative genome analysis in catfish.
however, it appears that the level of conservation at local genomic regions are high while a high level of chromosomal shuffling and rearrangements exist between catfish and zebrafish genomes.
comparative mapping is a powerful tool to transfer genomic information from sequenced genomes to closely related species for which whole genome sequence data are not yet available.
genetic linkage mapping of microsatellites associated with contigs allowed identification of large conserved genomic segments and construction of super scaffolds.
highly conserved chromosomal regions were identified to exist between catfish and zebrafish.
a total of  <dig>  catfish bac end sequences  had significant blast hits to the zebrafish genome , of which  <dig>  were unique gene hits, providing a platform for comparative mapping based on locations of these genes in catfish and zebrafish.
