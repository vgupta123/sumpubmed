a relation extraction system achieving high performance is expensive to develop because of the substantial time and effort required for its design and implementation.
here, we report a novel framework to facilitate the development of a pattern-based biomedical relation extraction system.
a relation extraction system derived using the proposed framework achieved overall f-scores of  <dig> % for the simple events and  <dig> % for the binding events on the bionlp-st  <dig> ge test set, comparing favorably with the top performing systems that participated in the bionlp-st  <dig> ge task.
in this paper, we present a novel framework for fast development of relation extraction systems.
this analysis indicates that without increasing the number of patterns, simplification and referential relation linking play a key role in the effective extraction of biomedical relations.
one important task in biomedical text mining is relation extraction, which aims to identify designated relations among biological entities reported in literature.
it has several unique design features:  leveraging syntactic variations possible in a language and automatically generating extraction patterns in a systematic manner,  applying sentence simplification to improve the coverage of extraction patterns, and  identifying referential relations between a syntactic argument of a predicate and the actual target expected in the relation extraction task.
thus, we reduce the involvement of domain experts, who would otherwise have to provide manual annotations and help with the design of hand crafted patterns.
we obtained similar results on the bionlp-st  <dig> ge test set .
text mining is increasingly used in the biomedical domain because of its ability to automatically gather information from large amount of scientific articles.
