these include approaches that rely on evolutionary conservation, structural constraints, or physicochemical attributes of amino acid substitutions.
single nucleotide polymorphisms with high minor allele frequencies were used as a negative  set for testing, and recurrent mutations from the cosmic database as well as novel recurrent somatic mutations identified in very recent cancer studies were used as positive  sets.
various computational methods have been developed to predict the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function and classify mutations as deleterious or benign.
however, it remains a significant challenge to identify cancer-driving mutations, since most observed missense changes are neutral passenger mutations.
conservation-based methods generally had moderately high accuracy in distinguishing neutral from deleterious mutations, whereas the performance of machine learning based predictors with comprehensive feature spaces varied between assessments using different positive sets.
for certain combinations metapredictors slightly improved the performance of included individual methods, but did not outperform mutationassessor as stand-alone tool.
our independent assessment of existing tools reveals various performance disparities.
