we describe a method for flux analysis of chemical reaction networks, where flux is given by the flow of species between reactions in stochastic simulations of the network.
we provide a fully stochastic treatment of flux analysis.
as in deterministic analysis, our method delivers the network behavior in terms of species transformations.
extending discrete event simulation algorithms, our method constructs several data structures, and thereby reveals a variety of statistics about resource creation and consumption during the simulation.
however, the discrete stochastic simulations, which provide advantages in some cases, lack a quantitative treatment of network fluxes.
we use these structures to quantify the causal interdependence and relative importance of the reactions at arbitrary time intervals with respect to the network fluxes.
moreover, our stochastic analysis can be applied, not only at steady state, but at arbitrary time intervals, and used to identify the flow of specific species between specific reactions.
the traditional deterministic approach, based on differential equations, enjoys a rich set of analysis techniques, including a treatment of reaction fluxes.
we demonstrate our approach on an extended example based on a published ode model of the same network, that is, rho gtp-binding proteins, and on other models from biology and ecology.
the two common means for simulating these networks are the deterministic and the stochastic approaches.
this allows us to construct reduced networks that have the same flux-behavior, and compare these networks, also with respect to their time series.
chemical reaction networks provide an abstraction scheme for a broad range of models in biology and ecology.
