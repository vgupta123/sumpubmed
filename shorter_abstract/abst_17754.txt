the gt allele, which contains the consensus intronic dinucleotides at the 5' splice site of intron 1b, favors exon 1b inclusion, while the gc allele, having a weaker 5' splice site sequence, promotes exon 1b skipping.
in addition to identifying novel transcription start sites, we demonstrated that the expression ratio of the gli <dig> splice variants in the 5' utr is regulated by the genotype of the mouse strain analyzed.
we investigated 5' utr mrna variants of the mouse gli <dig> oncogene, which is the terminal transcriptional effector of the hedgehog  signaling pathway.
moreover, the alternative gli <dig> 5' utrs had an impact on translational capacity, with the shorter and the exon 1b-skipped mrna variants being most effective.
alternative splicing is one of the key mechanisms that generate biological diversity.
