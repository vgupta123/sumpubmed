solubility of recombinant proteins expressed in e.coli can be predicted by tango, an algorithm developed to determine the aggregation propensity of peptides.
targeted mutations representing corresponding amino acids in similar protein domains may increase solubility of recombinant proteins.
signalling proteins often contain several well defined and conserved protein domains.
high beta-aggregation values predicted by tango correlated with low solubility of recombinant sh <dig> domains as reported in the literature.
however, there is no particular way to predict whether a protein will be soluble when expressed in e.coli.
structural analyses of such domains by nuclear magnetic spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography may greatly inform the function of proteins.
alteration of the flanking sequences, or growth temperature influenced expression and solubility of tsad-sh <dig>  however overall yield of soluble protein remained low.
a limiting step is often the production of sufficient amounts of the recombinant protein.
