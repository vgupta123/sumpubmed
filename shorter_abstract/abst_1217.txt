currently, it is recommended to determine the ae with high precision as this plug-in approach does not account for the ae uncertainty, implicitly assuming an infinitely precise ae estimate.
the methods and impact of the ae uncertainty are illustrated in three qpcr applications and a simulation study.
our suggestions show that it is possible to easily perform statistical inference of ΔΔcq, whilst properly accounting for the ae uncertainty and better controlling the false positive rate.
we suggest and benchmark different methods to obtain the standard error of the efficiency adjusted ΔΔcq using the statistical delta method, monte carlo integration, or bootstrapping.
violation of the assumption leads to overly optimistic standard errors of the ΔΔcq, confidence intervals, and p-values which ultimately increase the type i error rate beyond the expected significance level.
as qpcr is often used for validation it should be a high priority to account for the uncertainty of the ae estimate and thereby properly bounding the type i error rate and achieve the desired significance level.
we conclude, that the commonly used efficiency corrected quantities disregard the uncertainty of the ae, which can drastically impact the standard error and lead to increased false positive rates.
in addition, we validate findings suggesting that mgst <dig> is differentially expressed between high and low abundance culture initiating cells in multiple myeloma and that microrna- <dig> is differentially expressed between testicular and nodal lymphomas.
the most commonly used correction strategy is to estimate the ae by dilution experiments and use this as a plug-in when efficiency correcting the ΔΔcq.
our suggested methods are founded in a linear mixed effects model  framework, but the problem and ideas apply in all qpcr experiments.
