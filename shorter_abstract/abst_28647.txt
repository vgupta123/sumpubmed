nearly all a. pleuropneumoniae transcripts could be detected on our microarrays, and  <dig> genes were deemed differentially expressed in vivo during the acute phase of the infection.
an rna extraction protocol combining beadbeating and hot-acid-phenol was developed in order to maximize bacterial mrna yields and quality following total rna extraction from lung lesions.
in order to identify genes that are expressed in vivo during a natural infection, we undertook transcript profiling experiments with an a. pleuropneumoniae dna microarray, after recovery of bacterial mrnas from serotype 5b-infected porcine lungs.
our results indicate that, for example, gene apxiva from an operon coding for rtx toxin apxiv is highly up-regulated in vivo, and that two genes from the operon coding for type iv fimbriae  were also up-regulated.
many virulence factors are involved in the pathogenesis, namely capsular polysaccharides, rtx toxins, lps and many iron acquisition systems.
transcriptional profiling of a. pleuropneumoniae recovered from the lung of a pig suffering from a natural infection or following growth of the bacterial isolate in bhi medium was performed.
these transcriptional profiling data, combined with previous comparative genomic hybridizations performed by our group, revealed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> up-regulated genes are conserved amongst all serotypes and that  <dig> of them code for products that are predicted outer membrane proteins  or lipoproteins .
these genes that we have identified as up-regulated in vivo, conserved across serotypes and coding for potential outer membrane proteins represent potential candidates for the development of a cross-protective vaccine against porcine pleuropneumonia.
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a respiratory disease which causes great economic losses worldwide.
