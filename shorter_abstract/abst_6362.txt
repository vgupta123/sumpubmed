antibodies against fmdv non-structural proteins were found in  <dig> of  <dig>  sera from buffalo with 44/ <dig> and 53/ <dig> also having neutralising antibodies directed against fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig>  respectively.
comprehensive studies incorporating additional buffalo viruses are recommended.
the african buffalo  is a reservoir for the sat serotypes of fmd virus .

this study analysed  <dig> epithelia collected from fmd outbreaks in kenyan cattle between  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> probang and serum samples collected from buffalo in three different kenyan ecosystems; maasai-mara  , tsavo  , and meru  .
fmdv rna was detected in 42% of the buffalo probang samples by rt-qpcr  ≤32).
two buffalo probang samples were positive by vi and were identified as fmdv sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> by ag-elisa, while the latter assay detected serotypes o , a , sat  <dig>  and sat  <dig>  in the  <dig> cattle epithelia.
we found that fmdv serotypes o, a, sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> were circulating among cattle in kenya and cause disease, but only sat  <dig> and sat  <dig> viruses were successfully isolated from clinically normal buffalo.
control efforts should focus primarily on reducing fmdv circulation among livestock and limiting interaction with buffalo.
