with this software, we were able to i) label raw data with attributes related to the experimental design of the samples, ii) determine a baseline threshold for identification of true peaks over noise, iii) align terminal restriction fragments  in all samples , iv) construct a two-way data matrix from labeled data and process the matrix in a variety of ways, v) produce several measures of data matrix complexity, including the distribution of variance between main and interaction effects and sample heterogeneity, and vi) analyze a data matrix with the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction  model.
accordingly, we developed t-rex, free, online software for the processing and analysis of t-rflp data.
analysis of t-rflp data generated from a multiple-factorial study was performed with t-rex.
t-rex provides a free, platform-independent tool to the research community that allows for an integrated, rapid, and more robust analysis of t-rflp data.
many steps are required to process raw data into a format ready for analysis and interpretation.
despite increasing popularity and improvements in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism  and other microbial community fingerprinting techniques, there are still numerous obstacles that hamper the analysis of these datasets.
