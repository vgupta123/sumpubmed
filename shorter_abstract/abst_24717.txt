we propose a compound poisson process model that can accurately predict the gene capture in a future est sample based on an initial est sample.
the superior performance of the new prediction method over an existing approach is established by a simulation study.
it also allows estimation of the number of expressed genes in one cdna library or co-expressed in two cdna libraries.
the proposed method provides a convenient tool for gene capture prediction and cdna library property diagnosis in est sequencing.
our analysis of four arabidopsis thaliana est sets suggests that the number of expressed genes present in four different cdna libraries of arabidopsis thaliana varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> .
in expressed sequence tag  sequencing, we are often interested in how many genes we can capture in an est sample of a targeted size.
