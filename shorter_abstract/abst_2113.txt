mining novel biomarkers from gene expression profiles for accurate disease classification is challenging due to small sample size and high noise in gene expression measurements.
our results suggest that egonet, which is based on the ego network concept, allows the identification of novel biomarkers and provides a deeper understanding of their roles in complex diseases.
however, the neighborhood relationship among network member genes has not been fully considered by those methods, leaving many potential gene markers unidentified.
we present egonet, a novel method based on egocentric network-analysis techniques, to exhaustively search and prioritize disease subnetworks and gene markers from a large-scale biological network.
when applied to a triple-negative breast cancer  microarray dataset, the top selected modules contain both known gene markers in tnbc and novel candidates, such as rad <dig> and dok <dig>  which play a central role in their respective ego-networks by connecting many differentially expressed genes.
