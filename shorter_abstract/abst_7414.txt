coeliac disease is a multifactorial inflammatory disorder of the intestine caused by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals.
epithelial cells were isolated from duodenal biopsies taken from five coeliac patients with active disease and five non-coeliac control subjects.
this study provides a profile of the molecular changes that occur in the intestinal epithelium of coeliac patients with active disease.
analysis of these altered genes revealed a number of biological processes that are potentially modified in active coeliac disease.
since enterocytes are considered to play a central role in coeliac pathology, the aim of this study was to examine gene expression in a highly purified isolate of these cells taken from patients with active disease.
enterocyte suspensions of high purity  were isolated from intestinal biopsies.
the gene expression profile of the cells was examined using microarray analysis.
of the  <dig>  genes investigated,  <dig> genes were found to have significantly altered expression between coeliac disease patients and controls .
novel candidate genes were revealed which highlight the contribution of the epithelial cell to the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.
validation of significantly altered genes was performed by real-time rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry.
these processes include events likely to contibute to coeliac pathology, such as altered cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, structure and transport.
