also we discovered the characteristics that represent these two epitope groups including their similarities and differences with random peptides and their respective amino acid sequence.
this hypothesis led us to analyze physico-chemical  and predicted secondary structure  features of a curated dataset of epitope sequences available in the literature belonging to two different groups of antigens .
the interaction between these proteins occurs at specific positions known as antigenic determinants or b-cell epitopes.
further research could increase our understanding of the biochemical and structural properties that characterize a b-cell epitope.
we discovered statistically significant parameters with data mining techniques which allow us to distinguish neurotoxin from metalloproteinase and these two from random sequences.
we investigated the possibility of linear epitopes from the same protein family to share common properties.
these findings open new perspectives to improve epitope prediction by considering the specific antigen's protein family.

after a five cross fold validation we found that pcp based models obtained area under the curve values  and accuracy above  <dig>  for regression, decision tree and support vector machine.
we expect that these findings will help to improve current computational mapping methods based on physico-chemical due it's potential application during epitope discovery.
we demonstrated that antigen's family can be inferred from properties within a single group of linear epitopes .
