the level of mir-130a inhibition correlated with the impact on protein levels.
in the 32dcl <dig> clone, putative targets were more up-regulated than the remaining quantified proteins following mir-130a inhibition, and three significantly derepressed proteins  are putative mir-130a targets with good rain scores.
we also created a network including inferred, putative neutrophil mir-130a targets and identified the transcription factors myb and cbf-β as putative mir-130a targets, which may regulate the primary granule proteins mpo and prtn <dig> and other proteins differentially expressed following mir-130a inhibition in the 32dcl <dig> clone.
using pulsed stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture and mass spectrometry for protein identification and quantitation, we found  <dig> and  <dig> proteins that were significantly regulated following inhibition of mir-130a in a mir-130a-overexpressing 32dcl <dig> clone and kasumi- <dig> cells, respectively.
we used rain, a novel database for mirna–protein and protein–protein interactions, to identify putative mir-130a targets.
linking these to putative mir-130a targets, we provide an association network of potential direct and indirect mir-130a targets that expands our knowledge on the role of mir-130a in neutrophil development and is a valuable platform for further experimental studies.
we have experimentally identified mir-130a-regulated proteins within the neutrophil proteome.
mir-130a is highly expressed during early neutrophil development and regulates target proteins important for this process.
mirna targets are often identified by validating putative targets found by in silico prediction algorithms one at a time.
