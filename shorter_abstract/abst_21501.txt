when marc- <dig> cells or pam were infected with prrsv followed by transfection with as-ons, four as-on sequences targeting 5′-utr, orf <dig> or nsp <dig> were found to be the most effective oligonucleotides in decreasing the cytopathic effect  induced by prrsv infection.
the objective of this study was to screen for effective antisense oligonucleotides  which could inhibit prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells and in pulmonary alveolar macrophages .
the results presented here indicate that dna-based antisense oligonucleotides can effectively inhibit prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells and in pam.
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  and is an economically important disease in swine-producing areas.

quantitative pcr and indirect immunofluorescence staining confirmed that orf <dig> levels were significantly reduced both at rna and protein levels.
nine short as-on sequences against the well-conserved regions of prrsv  were selected.
