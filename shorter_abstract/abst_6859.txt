in this study, the nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  gene was used as a genetic marker to examine the genetic diversity, population structure, and gene flow of b. dorsalis s.s. throughout its range in china and southeast asia.
demographic analysis revealed rapid expansion of b. dorsalis s.s. populations in china and southeast asia in the recent years.
the data collected here further show that b. dorsalis s.s. in yunnan, guangdong, and fujian provinces, and in taiwan might have different origins within southeast asia.
using the mitochondrial nd <dig> gene, the results of the present study showed b. dorsalis s.s. from different parts of china to have different genetic structures and origins.
b. dorsalis s.s. in china and southeast asia was found to have experienced rapid expansion in recent years.
data further support the existence of two distinguishable lineages of b. dorsalis s.s. in china and indicate genetic diversity and gene flow from multiple origins.
haplotype networks and phylogenetic analysis indicated two distinguishable lineages of the fly population but provided no strong support for geographical subdivision in b. philippinensis.
the greatest amount of genetic diversity was observed in manila, pattaya, and bangkok, and asymmetric migration patterns were observed in different parts of china.
although the oriental fruit fly has been investigated extensively, its origins and genetic structure remain disputed.
