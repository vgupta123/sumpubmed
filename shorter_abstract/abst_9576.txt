the comparison is demonstrated in the golden spike experiment as well as with simulation data using the roc curves and compression rates.
normalization, either before or after expression summary for probesets, improves performance to a similar degree.
the key concept is to provide various importance scores to data points on the ma plot according to their proximity to the cluster of the null genes under the assumption that null genes are more densely distributed than those that are differentially regulated.
however, the well-known golden spike experiment presents a unique situation in which differentially regulated genes are biased toward one direction, thereby challenging the conclusions of previous bench mark studies.
this study proposes two novel approaches, kdl and kdq, based on kernel density estimation to improve upon the basic idea of invariant set selection.
