however, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus have a different development pattern, and their myofiber number still increases in the first postnatal week and then remains stable afterwards.
it is still ambiguous that whether animals are born with the full set of skeletal muscle fibers or if the number of myofibers continues to increase postnatally.
our results highlight different development time frames of anatomically distinct skeletal muscles.
here, an inducible lineage-tracing system was employed to monitor the changes of myofiber number in various skeletal muscles during development.
we confirm that the total myofiber number of longissimus dorsi, gastrocnemius and rectus femoris is determined prenatally.
