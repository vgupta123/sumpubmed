however, conventional relative and absolute quantification methodologies often give erroneous results or are laborious to perform.
by providing absolute quantification of all genes of interest, accucal exposes, and circumvents, the well-known biases of qpcr, thus allowing objective experimental conclusions to be drawn.

herein, we show that accucal quantification can be used with either dye- or probe-based detection methods and is accurate over a dynamic range of ≥ <dig> copies, for amplicons up to  <dig> base pairs .
accurate quantification is essential for correct interpretation of qpcr data.
to overcome these failings, we developed an accurate, simple to use, universal calibrator, accucal.
research into gene expression enables scientists to decipher the complex regulatory networks that control fundamental biological processes.
quantitative real-time pcr  is a powerful and ubiquitous method for interrogation of gene expression.
we propose that accucal supersedes the traditional quantification methods of pcr.
