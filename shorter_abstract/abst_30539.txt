these four amino acids may play a role in binding of sex pheromone, but this study does not address questions regarding specific response between males of o. furnacalis and o. nubilalis.
directional selection was previously predicted between pbp <dig> orthologs of ostrinia furnacalis and ostrinia nubilalis were interpreted as being involved in sexual isolation.
in vitro assays show that recombinant male ofurpbp <dig> bound o. furnacalis sex pheromones, z-12-tetradecenyl acetate  and e-12-tetradecenyl acetate , as well as to ecb pheromones z11- and e11-14:oac.
five pbps of o. furnacalis play important functions in ostrinia pheromones binding.
additional studies are required determine the role, if any, pbps play in the evolution of sex pheromone communication.
