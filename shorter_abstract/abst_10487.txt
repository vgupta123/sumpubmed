the results suggest that the patterns of dna methylation in the brain are in general similar between humans and non-human primates, and only a few dmrs were identified.
to test if dna methylation has contributed to the evolution of human brain, with the use of medip-chip and sequenom massarray, we conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify differentially methylated regions  in the brain between humans and rhesus macaques.
our study provides a new angle of studying human brain evolution and understanding the evolutionary role of dna methylation in the central nervous system.
recently, several large-scale studies reported the evolutionary roles of dna methylation; however, the role of dna methylation on brain evolution is largely unknown.
we first identified a total of  <dig> candidate dmrs by the medip-chip method, among which  <dig> dmrs were confirmed by the massarray analysis.
all  <dig> dmrs are within or close to the cpg islands, and a mir <dig> repeat element was identified in one dmr, but no repeat sequence was observed in the other  <dig> dmrs.
bisulfite sequencing and phylogenetic comparison among human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque and rat suggested several regions of lineage specific dna methylation, including a human specific hypomethylated region in the promoter of k6irs <dig> gene.
