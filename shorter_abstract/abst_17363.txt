bovine congenital pseudomyotonia  is an impairment of muscle relaxation induced by exercise preventing animals from performing rapid movements.
forms of recessively inherited pmt have been described in different cattle breeds caused by two independent mutations in atp2a <dig> encoding a skeletal-muscle ca2+-atpase .
we obtained four pmt affected romagnola cattle and noted striking clinical similarities to the previously described pmt cases in other cattle breeds.
pedigree analysis showed that the exon  <dig> double mutation event dates back to at least  <dig>  both nucleotide substitutions are predicted to alter the serca <dig> amino acid sequence ]), affect highly conserved residues, in particular the actuator domain of serca <dig>
selection against these mutations can now be used to eliminate the mutant alleles from the romagnola breed.
we provide functional and genetic evidence that one novel and one previously described atp2a <dig> mutation lead to a reduced serca <dig> activity in skeletal muscles and pseudomyotonia in affected romagnola cattle.
three out of four cases were compound heterozygous for the newly identified exon  <dig> variant and the exon  <dig> variant c. <dig> g>a, which has previously been shown to cause pmt in chianina cattle.
the affected animals had a reduced serca <dig> activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
