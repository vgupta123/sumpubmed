metoclopramide is a dopamine d2-receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic and gastroprokinetic agent in man and animals.
lower doses of metoclopramide  significantly decreased the open-field activity of the chicks and increased the durations of their tonic immobility.
such a sedative action of metoclopramide has not been documented in the chicken as the drug is not used clinically in this species.
injection of metoclopramide at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, subcutaneously  induced sedation in the chicks in a dose dependent manner.
the median effective doses of metoclopramide for induction of sedation and sleep in the chicks were  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, s.c., respectively.
the drug causes sedation as a side effect in man.
the data suggest that metoclopramide induces central nervous system depression in chicks, and the drug could have potential clinical applications as a sedative-hypnotic agent in avian species not intended for human consumptions.
the present study examines the central nervous system depressant effects of metoclopramide in 7â€“ <dig> days old broiler chicks.
