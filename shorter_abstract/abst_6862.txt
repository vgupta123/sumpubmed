annotated blast matches reveal that differentially expressed genes correspond to critical metabolic pathways previously shown to be important for temperature tolerance in other fish species.
with the advent of next generation sequencing , genomes and transcriptomes of virtually any species are now available for studies of adaptive evolution.
using next generation rna-seq technologies on an illumina hiseq <dig> platform, we assembled a de novo transcriptome and tested for differential expression across the treatment groups.
our results indicate that rainbowfish exhibit predictable plastic regulatory responses to temperature stress and the genes we identified provide excellent candidates for further investigations of population adaptation to increasing temperatures.
identifying genes of adaptive significance in a changing environment is a major focus of ecological genomics.
this non-migratory species is found across a latitudinal thermal gradient in eastern australia and is predicted to be negatively impacted by ongoing environmental and climatic change.
