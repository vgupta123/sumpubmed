quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr  is a useful tool for assessing gene expression in different tissues, but the choice of adequate controls is critical to normalise the results, thereby avoiding differences and maximizing sensitivity and accuracy.
here, we identified an appropriate set of genes to be used as an endogenous reference for quantifying gene expression in human heart tissue.
we propose the use of ppia, rplp and gadph as reference genes for the accurate normalisation of qrt-pcr performed on heart tissue.
this practice can lead to incorrect conclusions and recent evidence indicates a need to use the geometric mean of data from several control genes.
our findings indicate that out of ten commonly used reference genes , ppia, rplp and gadph show the most stable gene transcription levels in left ventricle specimens obtained from organ donors, as assessed using genorm and normfinder software.
so far, many genes have been used as a single reference gene, without having previously verified their value as controls.
