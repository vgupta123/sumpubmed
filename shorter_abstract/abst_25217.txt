we have implemented scaled venn and euler diagrams, which increase graphical accuracy and visual appeal.
to fill this gap we introduce venndiagram, an r package that enables the automated generation of highly-customizable, high-resolution venn diagrams with up to four sets and euler diagrams with up to three sets.
few tools exist to automate the generation of extensively-customizable, high-resolution venn and euler diagrams in the r statistical environment.
the venndiagram package allows the creation of high quality venn and euler diagrams in the r statistical environment.
the venndiagram package offers the user the ability to customize essentially all aspects of the generated diagrams, including font sizes, label styles and locations, and the overall rotation of the diagram.
