the mobility of nucleosomes plays important roles in many dna-related processes by regulating the accessibility of regulatory elements to biological machineries.
although it has been known that various factors, such as dna sequences, histone modifications, and chromatin remodelling complexes, could affect nucleosome stability, the mechanisms of how they regulate this stability are still unclear.
notably, these dna motifs are strong determinants for nucleosome forming and inhibiting potential; and these histone modifications have strong relation with transcriptional activities, i.e.
this suggests additional insights into mechanisms by which cells control important biological processes, such as transcription, replication, and dna repair.
in this paper, we propose a novel computational method based on rule induction learning to characterize nucleosome dynamics using both genomic and histone modification information.
when applied on s. cerevisiae data, our method produced totally  <dig> rules characterizing nucleosome dynamics on chromosome iii and promoter regions.
analyzing these rules we discovered that, some dna motifs and post-translational modifications of histone proteins play significant roles in regulating nucleosome stability.
dna motifs and histone modifications can individually and, in some cases, cooperatively regulate nucleosome stability.
eukaryotic genomes are packaged into chromatin, a compact structure containing fundamental repeating units, the nucleosomes.
