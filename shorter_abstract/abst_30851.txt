the objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the evolution of the profile currently recommended by the international renal interest society   with a panel of other different kidney biomarkers during treatment for canine leishmaniosis.
however all biomarkers of glomerular damage showed a significant decrease after treatment, with uigg/cr and ucrp/cr showing the greater decreases.
further studies involving a larger number of animals and histological analysis of the kidney would be recommended to confirm these findings and evaluate the routine practical use of these urine biomarkers in canine leishmaniosis.
in dogs with leishmaniosis at iris stage i that reduced upc after treatment, there were no significant changes in serum creatinine and ssdma.
these decreases were more evident in those markers related with glomerular function, being uigg/cr the biomarker more associated with upc.
these biomarkers were measured in two groups of dogs with canine leishmaniosis at iris stage i. group 1: dogs showing proteinuria  before treatment which did not decrease after treatment; group 2: dogs showing proteinuria before treatment which decreased after treatment.
however, all the urine biomarkers evaluated with exception of uggt showed a significant decrease.
this panel included three urinary glomerular biomarkers  and three urinary tubular biomarkers .
group  <dig> showed no significant changes in any biomarker after treatment.
