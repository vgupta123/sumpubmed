20-hydroxyecdysone  tended to stimulate mirna expression, whereas juvenile hormone  inhibited the 20e stimulatory effect.
twelve of these  <dig> mirnas were then investigated further by qrt-pcr and results indicated that mir-252-3p was well expressed in n <dig> but not in n <dig>  whereas let-7-5p, mir-100-5p and mir-125-5p showed the reverse pattern.
the comparative analysis of mirna libraries from pre-metamorphic  and metamorphic stages  of b. germanica proved to be a useful tool to identify mirnas with roles in hemimetabolan metamorphosis.
high throughput sequencing gave  <dig> canonical mirnas present in the n <dig> and n <dig> libraries, although at different proportions in each.
depletion of mir-252-3p caused growth and developmental delays, which suggests that this mirna is involved in regulating these processes prior to metamorphosis.
expression of let- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was increased by 20e, which has also been observed in d. melanogaster.
three mirnas emerged as important factors in the metamorphic stage : let-7-5p, mir-100-5p and mir-125-5p, whereas mir-252-3p appears to be important in the pre-metamorphic stage .
to gain insight about which mirnas might be important, we have constructed two mirna libraries, one of the penultimate, pre-metamorphic nymphal instar  and the other of the last, metamorphic nymphal instar .
