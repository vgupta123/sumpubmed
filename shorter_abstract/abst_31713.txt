in this work, we have addressed the question “what is the nature, extent, location and functional significance of structural changes which are associated with formation of protein-protein complexes?”
a database of  <dig> non-redundant sets of high resolution 3-d structures of protein-protein complexes, representing diverse functions, and corresponding unbound forms, has been used in this analysis.
the enrichment of allosteric sites in signalling proteins, whose mutations commonly lead to diseases such as cancer, provides support for the usage of allosteric modulators in combating these diseases.
normal mode analysis and available information on functions on some of these complexes suggests that many of these changes are allosteric.
structural changes associated with protein-protein complexation have been investigated using structural measures and protein blocks description.
they usually serve as key regulators of various cellular processes and are often stable in both protein-bound and unbound forms.
