understanding the role of genetic modifiers of grmd may identify genes and pathways that also modify phenotypes in dmd and reveal novel therapies.
such modifiers are likely to be useful for dmd treatment development based on their relationships to grmd phenotypes.
the results of this study enhance our understanding of grmd pathology and represent a first step toward the characterization of grmd modifiers that may be relevant to dmd pathology.

gene expression profiles of  <dig> possible candidate genes were generated for two muscle types: the cranial tibialis and medial head of the gastrocnemius.
snps significantly associated with grmd biomarkers were identified on multiple chromosomes .
gene expression levels for candidate genes located near these snps correlated with biomarker values, suggesting possible roles as grmd modifiers.
duchenne muscular dystrophy  causes progressive muscle degeneration, cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure in approximately 1/ <dig>  boys.
golden retriever muscular dystrophy  resembles dmd both clinically and pathologically.
therefore, our objective in this study was to identify genetic modifiers that affect discrete grmd phenotypes.
we performed a linear mixed-model  analysis using  <dig> variably-affected dogs from our grmd colony .
