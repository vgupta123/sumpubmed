using a conservative phylogenomic approach, we analyzed genomic data from the fungal pathogen magnaporthiopsis incrustans in the order magnaporthales and identified two instances of exclusive sharing of hgt-derived gene markers between magnaporthales and another lineage of plant-pathogenic fungi in the genus colletotrichum.
these results challenge the notion that recognized hgt plays a minor role in the evolution of fungal lineages, and in the case we describe, is likely implicated in the evolution of plant pathogenesis.
these gene transfers are often physically linked in the genome and show more than two-fold functional enrichment in carbohydrate activating enzymes associated with plant cell wall degradation.
