these four genes are potential markers of fibroblast-like synoviocytes of the synovial membrane.
equine synovial membrane research is hampered by a lack of markers of fibroblast-like synoviocytes  to distinguish fls from other fibroblast-like cells in musculoskeletal connective tissues.
of these,  <dig> genes were selected for further confirmation as genes potentially expressed by fibroblast-like synoviocytes.

pathway analysis resulted in  <dig> candidate genes.
the aim of this study is to identify potential fls markers of the equine synovial membrane using microarray to compare between gene expression in equine synovial membrane and the joint capsule in metacarpophalangeal joints.
as these genes are overexpressed in synovial membrane compared to joint capsule, these genes could shed light on synovial membrane physiology and its role in joint disease.
the synovial membrane lines the luminal side of the joint capsule in synovial joints.
microarray analysis of tissues from  <dig> horses resulted in  <dig> up-regulated genes in synovial membrane compared with joint capsule.
four genes: foxo <dig>  pxk, pycard and samd9l were confirmed in  <dig> horses by qpcr as differentially expressed in synovial membrane compared to joint capsule.
in conclusion, foxo <dig>  pxk, pycard and samd9l were confirmed as differentially expressed in synovial membrane compared to joint capsule.
when trauma or inflammation is induced in a joint, the synovial membrane influences progression of joint damage.
