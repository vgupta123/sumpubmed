here, we focus on ucrs that cluster around genes involved in early vertebrate development; genes conserved over  <dig> million years of vertebrate evolution.
the high-resolution ucr collection presented here provides a wealth of target sequences for future experimental studies to determine the nature of the biochemical mechanisms involved in the preservation of arrays of nearly identical non-coding sequences over the course of vertebrate evolution.
recent studies have identified long, non-coding genomic regions that are perfectly conserved between human and mouse, termed ultra-conserved regions .
of particular importance is the observation that most ucrs are clustered into arrays that span hundreds of kilobases around their presumptive target genes.
the exceptional sequence conservation and clustered structure suggests that ucr-mediated molecular events involve greater complexity than traditional dna binding by transcription factors.
the genomic organization of ucrs, combined with previous findings, suggests that ucrs act as essential long-range modulators of gene expression.
