our objective is to analyze tumor gene expression data from microarrays in the context of such pathways.
this approach defines a projection of high-dimensional gene expression data onto low-dimensional pathway activity scores.
this study shows that it is feasible to infer signal transduction pathway activity, in individual samples, from gene expression data.
for each dataset and many pathways we find a much larger number of significant samples than expected by chance.
moreover, we devise a score for pathway activity in individual samples, based on the average expression value of the downstream targets.
hence, for individual samples, the status of a pathway is given as a sign, + or -, and a p-value.
two correlation scores are applied; one considers all pairs of downstream targets, and the other considers only pairs without common transcription factors.
finally, we find that several sample-wise pathway activities are significantly associated with clinical classifications of the samples.
signal transduction pathways convey information from the outside of the cell to transcription factors, which in turn regulate gene expression.
variation in pathway activity, across the samples, is gauged by the degree of correlation between downstream targets of a pathway.
