in this setting, high-dimensional vectors of features corresponding to genes are converted into lower-dimensional vectors of features corresponding to biologically interpretable gene sets.
here we hypothesize that the reported unfavorable classification results in the set-level framework were due to the adoption of unsuitable gene sets defined typically on the basis of the gene ontology and the kegg database of metabolic networks.
set-level classification of gene expression data has received significant attention recently.
we define two families of gene sets using information on regulatory interactions, and evaluate them on phenotype-classification tasks using public prokaryotic gene expression data sets.
novel gene sets defined on the basis of regulatory interactions improve set-level classification of gene expression data.
the novel gene sets are indeed more correlated than the conventional ones, and lead to significantly more accurate classifiers.
we hypothesize that such more correlated gene sets will enable to learn more accurate classifiers.
the two selected subtypes are then evaluated on independent  data sets against state-of-the-art gene sets and against the conventional gene-level approach.
