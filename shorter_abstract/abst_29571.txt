all client-owned dogs underwent physical examination at the veterinary teaching hospital, faculty of veterinary medicine, khon kaen university to determine the health status with the ownerâ€™s consent.
oxidative stress, an excess of reactive oxygen species , causes lipid peroxidation resulting in cell and tissue damages.
malondialdehyde , the end product of lipid peroxidation, is commonly used as a marker of oxidative stress.
blood samples of cancer-bearing dogs  and clinically normal dogs  were obtained and subjected for determination of mda levels.
serum mda was significantly higher in cancer-bearing dogs than in clinically normal dogs .
packed cell volume , hemoglobin  and red blood cells ,  <dig>   vs  <dig>  ) were all significantly lower in cancer-bearing dogs than in clinically normal dogs.
this study supports the conclusion that oxidative stress is associated with many types of cancers in dogs, as serum mda levels were significantly higher in cancer-bearing dogs compared to clinically normal dogs.
the objective of this study was to assess oxidative stress in cancer-bearing dogs by measuring serum mda levels.
in addition, complete blood count, creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase were measured.
neither creatinine nor alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly different between groups.
however, the reverse was true for white blood cells ,  <dig>   vs  <dig>  ).
