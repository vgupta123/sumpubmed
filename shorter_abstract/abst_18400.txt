progressive accumulation of α-synuclein  protein in different brain regions is a hallmark of synucleinopathic diseases, such as parkinson’s disease, dementia with lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy.
α-syn transgenic mouse models have been developed to investigate the effects of α-syn accumulation on behavioral deficits and neuropathology.
we also found human α-syn expression in immature neurons of both the ventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream, but not in the dentate gyrus.
the present study demonstrates that the pdgf-β α-syn transgenic mouse model presents with early and progressive accumulation of human α-syn that is accompanied by motor deficits.
these mice showed progressive impairment of motor coordination of the limbs that resulted in significant differences compared to non-transgenic littermates at  <dig> and  <dig> months of age.
analyses of the phenotype of α-syn expressing cells revealed strong expression in dopaminergic olfactory bulb neurons, subsets of gabaergic interneurons and glutamatergic principal cells throughout the telencephalon.
for this purpose we investigated the time course of behavioral deficits and neuropathology in pdgf-β human wild type α-syn transgenic mice  between  <dig> and  <dig> months of age.
