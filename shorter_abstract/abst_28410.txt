our study provides a diverse set of mirnas related to cymbidium floral development and serves as a useful resource for investigating mirna-mediated regulatory mechanisms of floral development.
the results were confirmed by rna-seq and qrt-pcr.
moreover, we built a c. ensifolium transctriptome database to identify genes targeted by mirna, which resulted in  <dig> transcriptomic target unigenes.
the target unigenes were annotated with information from the non-redundant , gene ontology database , eukaryotic orthologous groups  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database.
in this study, we employed solexa technology to sequence four small rna libraries from two flowering phases to identify mirnas related to floral development.
cymbidium ensifolium is one of the most important ornamental flowers in china, with an elegant shape, beautiful appearance, and a fragrant aroma.
the unigenes included mads-box transcription factors targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and various hormone responding factors targeted by mir <dig>  the mads-box transcription factors are well known to determine the identity of flower organs and hormone responding factors involved in floral development.
two trans-acting small interfering rnas  were identified, one of which was homologous to tas3a <dig>  tas3a <dig> belongs to the tas <dig> family, which has been previously reported to target auxin response factors  and be involved in plant growth and floral development.
however, most of these small rna were clustered in the uncharacterized group, which suggests there may be many novel small non-coding rnas yet to be discovered.
we also identified  <dig> novel mirna which includes  <dig> putative novel mirnas*, and  <dig> hairpin forming precursors.
in expression analysis, three novel and four conserved mirna were differentially expressed between two phases of flowering.
however, to date, few studies have examined mirnas in c. ensifolium.
micrornas  are critical regulators in plant development and physiology, including floral development.
the differential expression of two mirna, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  targeted arfs and growth regulating factor , respectively.
