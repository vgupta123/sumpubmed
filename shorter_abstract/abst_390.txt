n. ovalis generates its macronuclear chromosomes by forming polytene chromosomes that subsequently develop into macronuclear chromosomes by dna elimination and rearrangement.
we examined the structure of these gene-sized macronuclear chromosomes in n. ovalis.
as has been observed in p. tetraurelia, the n. ovalis introns tend to contain in-frame stop codons or have a length that is not dividable by three.
the combination of short leaders, tiny introns and single genes leads to very minimal macronuclear chromosomes.
the introns are short , and a significant fraction  of the tiny introns is conserved in the distantly related ciliate paramecium tetraurelia.
the telomeres consist of repeats cccn, similar to those in spirotrichous ciliates such as euplotes, sterkiella  and stylonychia.
we determined the telomeres, subtelomeric regions, utrs, coding regions and introns by sequencing a large set of macronuclear dna sequences  and cdnas  and comparing them with each other.
in the short subtelomeric regions we identified a few overrepresented motifs that could be involved in gene regulation, but there is no consensus polyadenylation site.
nyctotherus ovalis is a single-celled eukaryote that has hydrogen-producing mitochondria and lives in the hindgut of cockroaches.
