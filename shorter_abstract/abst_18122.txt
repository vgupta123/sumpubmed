a ku70-deficient mutant  generated with the hygromycin selection cassette removed by the cre-loxp recombination system showed a dramatically improved targeted gene deletion frequency, with over 90% of the transformants being true knockouts when homology sequence length of at least 1 kb was used.
the ku70-deficient mutant generated herein was effective in improving gene deletion frequency and allowed shorter homology sequences to be used for gene targeting.
rhodosporidium toruloides is a β-carotenoid accumulating, oleaginous yeast that has great biotechnological potential.

compared to the other well-known oleaginous yeast, yarrowia lipolytica, r. toruloides ku70/ku <dig> genes contain much higher density of introns and are the most gc-rich ku70/ku <dig> genes reported.
the strain should facilitate both fundamental and applied studies in this important yeast, with the approaches taken here likely to be applicable in other species in subphylum pucciniomycotina.
we report for the first time the development of a highly efficient targeted gene deletion method in r. toruloides atcc  <dig> via agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation.
to further improve targeting frequency, the ku <dig> and ku <dig> homologs in r. toruloides were isolated and characterized in detail.
it retained the key oleaginous and fast growing features of r. toruloides.
successful gene targeting could be made with homologous flanking sequences as short as 100 bp in the ∆ku70e strain.
