in this study we investigated the effects of nbo started simultaneously with intravenous tpa, in spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery  stroke.
infarct volume, brain swelling and hemorrhagic transformation were quantified at  <dig> hours.
nbo had no significant effect on hemorrhagic conversion, brain swelling, or mortality.
these experimental results require clinical confirmation.
the efficacy of tpa thrombolysis is not affected and there is no induction of brain hemorrhage or edema.
upon clot injection, cerebral perfusion in the mca territory dropped below 20% of pre-ischemic baselines.
both tpa-treated groups showed effective thrombolysis  and smaller infarct volumes , showing that tpa-induced reperfusion salvages ischemic tissue and that nbo does not significantly alter this neuroprotective effect.
after homologous clot injection, animals were randomized into different treatment groups: saline injected at  <dig> hour; tpa at  <dig> hour; saline at  <dig> hour plus nbo; tpa at  <dig> hour plus nbo.
the widespread use of tissue plasminogen activator , the only fda-approved acute stroke treatment, remains limited by its narrow therapeutic time window and related risks of brain hemorrhage.
