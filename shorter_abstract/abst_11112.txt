we also derive the analytic formulation of vrtp in the fully mixed model, the configuration model, and the degree-based model respectively in the mathematical function form for the insights on the relationship between experimental simulation and theoretical consideration.
we also induced the vrtp formula for three of the network mathematical models.
pandemic is a typical spreading phenomenon that can be observed in the human society and is dependent on the structure of the social network.
some network models are trying to reflect the social network, but the real structure is difficult to uncover.

we have developed a spreading phenomenon simulator that can input the epidemic parameters and network parameters and performed the experiment of disease propagation.
we suggest new marker vrtp  to describe the coupling between the sir spreading and the scale-free  network and observe the aspects of the coupling effects with the various of spreading and network parameters.
we discover the coupling effect between sir spreading and sf network through devising novel marker vrtp which reflects the shifting effect and relates to entropy.
the simulation result was analyzed to construct a new marker vrtp distribution.
