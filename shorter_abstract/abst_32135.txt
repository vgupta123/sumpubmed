the result is a better clustering of the biological samples on graphical representations.
it uses ica as a denoising process of the loading vectors produced by pca to better highlight the important biological entities and reveal insightful patterns in the data.
pca is particularly powerful if the biological question is related to the highest variance.
on simulation studies and real data sets, we showed that ipca offers a better visualization of the data than ica and with a smaller number of components than pca.
independent component analysis  has been proposed as an alternative to pca as it optimizes an independence condition to give more meaningful components.
we propose independent principal component analysis  that combines the advantages of both pca and ica.
however, neither pca nor ica can overcome both the high dimensionality and noisy characteristics of biological data.
a key question when analyzing high throughput data is whether the information provided by the measured biological entities  is related to the experimental conditions, or, rather, to some interfering signals, such as experimental bias or artefacts.
ipca and sipca are both implemented in the r package mixomics dedicated to the analysis and exploration of high dimensional biological data sets, and on mixomics' web-interface.
