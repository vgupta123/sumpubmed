we ran computer simulations to test whether enrichment for specific vdjh combinations could be detected in "antigen-exposed" populations, and found that enrichment is detectable with moderate-to-high sensitivity and high specificity, even when some vdjh combinations are not represented at all in some test sets.
here we analyze the properties of all sequenced repertoires in order to better understand the specificity of antibody responses.
we find that repertoire overlap in vh-, d-, and jh-segment use is least for vh segments and greatest for jh segments, consistent with there being more vh than jh segments in the human genome.
we find that for any two antigens chosen at random, chances are  <dig> percent that their repertoires' vh segments will overlap by less than half, and  <dig> percent that their vdjh combinations will overlap by â‰¤ <dig> percent.
specifically, we ask whether the large-scale sequencing of antibody repertoires might provide a diagnostic tool for detecting antigen exposure.
