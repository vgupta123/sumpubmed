in both women and female dogs, the most prevalent type of malignant neoplasm is the spontaneous mammary tumor.
that has become the aim of our study, to assess the expression of pgp, bcrp, mrp <dig> and mrp <dig> in canine mammary cancer cell lines and to investigate their role in cancer resistance to vinblastine, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide with using rnai approach.
moreover, there are neither large studies conducting to prove of the benefit from the chemotherapy in dogs nor established chemotherapy treatment protocols available.
the treatment of choice for the canine patients is surgical mastectomy.
the results suggested that in canine mammary cancer, the vinblastine efflux was mediated by pgp and mrp <dig> proteins, cisplatin efflux was mediated by all four examined efflux pumps , whereas cyclophosphamide resistance was related to bcrp activity.
our results have indicated the treatment of cells involving use of the sirna targeting efflux pumps could be a beneficial approach in the future.
additionally, the effectiveness of each individual chemotherapeutic agent and drug resistance of canine mammary cancer have not yet been characterized.
rnai silencing of these efflux pumps significantly decreased ic <dig> doses of the examined drugs in canine mammary carcinoma cells.
