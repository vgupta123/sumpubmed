our work demostrates the basic principles of computational genes and particularly, their potential to detect mutations, and as a response thereafter administer an output that suppresses the aberrant disease phenotype and/or restores the lost physiological function.
the aberrant mutations trigger a cascade reaction: specific molecular markers as input are released and induce a spontaneous self-assembly of a wild type protein or peptide, while the mutational disease phenotype is silenced.
a finite state machine manipulating information-carrying dna strands can be used to perform autonomous molecular-scale computations at the cellular level.
we propose a new finite state machine able to detect and correct aberrant molecular phenotype given by mutated genetic transcripts.
we experimentally demostrated in in vitro translation system that a viable protein can be autonomously assembled.
