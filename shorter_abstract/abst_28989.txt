the two species with melanic plumage, c. atratus and c. melanocoryphus , both have amino acid changes at important functional sites in mc1r that are consistent with increased mc1r activity and melanism.
however, interpretation is complicated by the fact that one of the outgroup genera, coscoroba, also has a putative melanizing mutation at mc1r that has arisen independently but has nearly pure white plumage.
unexpectedly, the phylogeny shows that the genus cygnus may not be monophyletic, with c. melanocoryphus placed as a sister group to true geese , but further data will be needed to confirm this.
epistasis at other loci seems the most likely explanation for this discrepancy.
our study highlights the difficulty of extrapolating from intraspecific studies to understand the genetic basis of interspecific adaptive phenotypic evolution, even with a gene whose structure-function relationships are as well understood as mc1r as confounding variation make clear genotype/phenotype associations difficult at the macroevolutionary scale.
we investigated the relationship between mc1r variation and plumage coloration in swans , which show extreme variation in melanic plumage phenotypes among species .
reconstruction of mc1r evolution over a newly generated independent molecular phylogeny of cygnus and related genera shows that these putative melanizing mutations were independently derived in the two melanic lineages.
the mc1r  locus underlies intraspecific variation in melanin-based dark plumage coloration in several unrelated birds with plumage polymorphisms.
