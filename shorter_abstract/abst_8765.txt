however, cats that carry it on their skin mount in most instances no antibody response.
surprisingly, the quantities of viral dna detected in some samples from the healthy cats exceeded the amounts detected in control samples from feline bisc lesions.
the aim of this study was to describe the genoprevalence and seroprevalence of fdpv <dig> in healthy cats.
for this purpose an fdpv2-specific quantitative pcr assay was developed and used to analyse cytobrush samples collected from  <dig> dermatologically healthy cats.
the concentrations of antibodies against fdpv <dig> were relatively low in healthy cats, whereas they were very high in control cats with bisc.
these observations suggest that fdpv <dig> is highly prevalent, even among healthy cats.
several groups have detected felis domesticus papillomavirus type  <dig>  dna in association with feline bowenoid in situ carcinoma .
it might be hypothesized that fdpv <dig> is only rarely productively replicating or its replication is only rarely exposed to the immune system.
