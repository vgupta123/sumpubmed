the exact mechanism of ligand-induced receptor activation is still unclear.
applying mm/pbsa methodology to different stoichiometric complexes of human lt-n= <dig> , <dig> the free energy of binding in these complexes has been estimated by single-trajectory and separate-trajectory methods.
simulation studies rationalized the favorable binding energy in the lt- <dig> complex, as evaluated from single-trajectory analysis to be an outcome of the interaction of cysteine-rich domain  <dig>  and the ligand.
we used molecular dynamics simulations, elastic network models, as well as mm/pbsa to analyze this question.
recent evidence, though, has raised doubts if the ligand:receptor stoichiometry should indeed be 3: <dig> for ligand-induced cellular response.
it is generally assumed that three receptors bind to the homotrimeric ligand to trigger a signaling event.
the high affinity associated with lt- <dig> is due to the interaction between the crd <dig> domain with lt. the global dynamics ascertained from enms have highlighted the differential dynamics of the receptor in different states.
mm/pbsa predicts complexes with a ligand-receptor molar ratio of 3: <dig> and 3: <dig> to be energetically favorable.
