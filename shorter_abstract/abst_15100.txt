further analysis highlighted  <dig> nodes present in multiple pathways, and revealed the connections between different pathways in the network.
the described network biology workflow uses state-of-the-art pathway and network analysis methods to study the rewiring of the diabetic liver.
the integration of experimental data and knowledge on disease-affected biological pathways, including regulatory elements like transcription factors or drugs, leads to improved insights and a clearer illustration of the overall process.
pathway analysis revealed seven significantly altered pathways in the wikipathways human pathway collection.

nowadays a broad collection of transcriptomics data is publicly available in online repositories.
methods for analyzing these data often aim at deciphering the influence of gene expression at the process level.
the present study describes a comprehensive network biology workflow that integrates differential gene expression in the human diabetic liver with pathway information by building a network of interconnected pathways.
biological pathway diagrams depict known processes and capture the interactions of gene products and metabolites, information that is essential for the computational analysis and interpretation of transcriptomics data.
these pathways were then merged into one combined network with  <dig> gene products,  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> pathway nodes.
the liver is a key player in metabolic diseases and diabetic patients often develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
the extension of the network with known drug-target interactions from drugbank allows for a more complete study of drug actions and helps with the identification of other drugs that target proteins up- or downstream which might interfere with the action or efficiency of a drug.
