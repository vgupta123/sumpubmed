in the exocrine pancreas lpl was found in capillaries, and was mostly co-localized with gpihbp <dig>  lpl was releasable by heparin, indicating localization on cell surfaces.
our aim was to study the localization of lpl and its endothelial anchoring protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein  <dig>  in mouse pancreas, and effects of diet and leptin deficiency on their expression patterns.
neither a high fat diet nor fasting/re-feeding markedly altered the distribution pattern of lpl or gpihbp <dig> in mouse pancreas.
we conclude that both lpl and gpihbp <dig> are present in mouse pancreas, and that lpl expression in beta cells is dependent on leptin.
islets from ob/ob mice appeared completely deficient of lpl in the beta cells, while lpl-staining was normal in alpha cells and in the exocrine pancreas.
leptin treatment of ob/ob mice for  <dig> days reversed this pattern, so that most of the islets expressed lpl in beta cells.

lipoprotein lipase  hydrolyzes triglycerides in plasma lipoproteins and enables uptake of lipolysis products for energy production or storage in tissues.
within the islets, most of the lpl was associated with beta cells and could not be released by heparin, indicating that the enzyme remained mostly within cells.
staining for lpl was found also in the glucagon-producing alpha cells, both in embryos  and in adult mice.
for this, immunofluorescence microscopy was used on pancreatic tissue from c57bl/ <dig> mouse embryos , adult mice on normal or high-fat diet, and adult ob/ob-mice treated or not with leptin.
