our findings indicate a pco <dig> dependent threshold beyond which compensation by acclimation fails progressively.
the likely enhanced energy demand might be met by the upregulation of the electron transport system , but may lead to increased oxidative stress reflected in upregulated antioxidant defense transcripts.
at 5°c acid–base, energy metabolism and stress response related genes were upregulated at intermediate pco <dig>  whereas high pco <dig> induced a relative reduction in expression to levels closer to controls.
hypercapnia and elevated temperatures resulting from climate change may have adverse consequences for many marine organisms.
here, we use global gene expression profiling through rna-sequencing to study the transcriptional responses to ocean acidification and warming in gills of the boreal spider crab hyas araneus exposed medium-term  to intermediate  and high  pco <dig> at different temperatures .
they also indicate a limited ability of this stenoecious crustacean to compensate for the effects of ocean acidification with and without concomitant warming.
