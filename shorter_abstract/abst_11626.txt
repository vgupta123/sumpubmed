generally, it was found that ef1a <dig> and rpl <dig> were the genes that showed least variation, with hprt <dig> and ubce as intermediate genes, and actb <dig> and tubb2c as the least stable ones.
in this study, Î²-actin <dig> , elongation factor  <dig> alpha , hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  <dig> , ribosomal protein l <dig> , tubulin beta 2c , and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  were evaluated as reference genes for normalization of real time rt-pcr data during atlantic halibut development, in tissue of healthy and nnv-infected fish, and in in vivo and in vitro stimulated anterior kidney leucocytes.
none of the reference genes were found optimal for normalization of real time rt-pcr data from in vitro stimulated anterior kidney leucocytes.
real time rt-pcr has become an important tool for analyzing gene expression in fish.
the excel-based software programs bestkeeper, genorm, and normfinder ranked ef1a <dig> and ubce as the best candidate reference genes before activation of zygotic transcription, and rpl <dig> and ef1a <dig> as the best candidates after hatching.
the mrna levels of the six genes increased from  <dig> ddpf, when zygotic transcription is likely to be activated, and stabilized at different time points.
none of the six reference genes can be recommended as reference gene candidates in cona-pma stimulated leucocytes.
however, ubce can be a good candidate in other experimental setups.
no attempts have been reported to identify suitable reference genes in halibut infected with nnv or in stimulated halibut leucocytes.
although several housekeeping genes have been evaluated in atlantic halibut , appropriate reference genes for low copy mrna transcripts at the earliest developmental stages have not been identified.
ef1a <dig> and rpl <dig> were also listed as the best reference genes when exploring the expression levels of the six genes in various halibut organs, both in non-injected fish and in mock- and nnv-injected fish.
this study emphasizes the need for reference gene evaluation, as universal reference genes have not been identified.
however, none of the selected genes were found to be stably expressed throughout halibut development.
