leukotriene b <dig>  is a potent inflammatory mediator that also stimulates the immune response.
ltb4-loaded ms preserve the biological activity of the encapsulated mediator indicating their use as a new strategy to modulate cell activation, especially in the innate immune response.
in the mice cremasteric microcirculation, intraescrotal injection of  <dig>  ml of ltb4-loaded ms provoked significant increases in leukocyte rolling flux, adhesion and emigration besides significant decreases in the leukocyte rolling velocity.
monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig>  and nitric oxide  productions were also increased when human umbilical vein and artery endothelial cells  were stimulated with ltb4-loaded ms.
ltb4-loaded ms also increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î±  expression by murine peritoneal macrophages and stimulate them to generate nitrite levels.
