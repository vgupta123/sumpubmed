to produce more selective and specific anti-idiotypic scfv-antibodies from a cdna library, constructed from hm- <dig> killer toxin -neutralizing monoclonal antibodies , the method was modified by using an elution buffer supplemented with hm- <dig> that shares structural and functional similarities with the active site of the scfv antibody.
the major populations  of these clones  were genotypically same and had strong cytocidal activity against saccharomyces and candida species.
the scfv k <dig>  had strong reactivity toward nmab-kt, like hm- <dig>  as judged by spr analysis.
regular panning methods are sometimes complicated by inefficient detachment of the captured phages from the antigen-coated solid supports, which prompted us to modify.
competitive binding of hm- <dig> to nmab-kt allowed easy and quick dissociation of scfv-displayed phages from immobilized nmab-kt to select specific anti-idiotypic scfv antibodies of hm- <dig>  after modified panning, 80% clones  showed several times higher binding affinity to nmab-kt than regular panning.
a simple modification of the elution condition in the phage-display panning protocol makes a large difference in determining success.
the scfv antibodies generated after modified subtractive panning appear to have superior binding properties and cytocidal activity than regular panning.
