in this regard, computational approaches might represent a promising method to direct experimental identification of sumoylation sites and shed light on the understanding of the reaction mechanism.
here we presented a statistical method for sumoylation site prediction.
by using a statistical method, we have developed a new sumo site prediction method – sumopre, which has shown its great accuracy with correlation coefficient, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy.
currently, the complexities of sumoylation mechanism can not be perfectly solved by experimental approaches.
a 5-fold cross validation test over the experimentally identified sumoylation sites yielded excellent prediction performance with correlation coefficient, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy equal to  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.
protein sumoylation is an essential dynamic, reversible post translational modification that plays a role in dozens of cellular activities, especially the regulation of gene expression and the maintenance of genomic stability.
additionally, the predictor performance is maintained when high level homologs are removed.
