in this study, we combined orthology-based approach with expression association data to screen rice hsps for the expression patterns of which strongly correlated with that of heat responsive probe-sets.
heat shock proteins  perform a fundamental role in protecting plants against abiotic stresses.
twenty-four go terms of biological processes and five go terms of molecular functions were enriched in the positive interactors, whose expression levels were positively associated with hsp70s.
furthermore, two databases named rice heat shock proteins  and rice gene expression profile , and one online tool named protein-protein interaction predictor , were constructed and could be accessed at http://bioinformatics.fafu.edu.cn/.

subsequent analysis showed  <dig> interacting domains and  <dig> target motifs were over-represented in hsp70s interactors.
hsp70s interaction network implied that hsp70s were involved in macromolecular translocation, carbohydrate metabolism, innate immunity, photosystem ii repair and regulation of kinase activities.
although researchers have made great efforts on the functional analysis of individual family members, hsps have not been fully characterized in rice  and little is known about their interactors.
twenty-seven hsp candidates were identified, including  <dig> small hsps, six hsp70s, three hsp60s, three hsp90s, and three clpb/hsp100s.
