yersinia enterocolitica strains responsible for mild gastroenteritis in humans are very diverse with respect to their metabolic and virulence properties.
strain w <dig>  was recently identified to possess nematocidal and insecticidal activity.
its composition underlines the prominent variability of this genome region and demonstrates its contribution to the higher pathogenicity of biotype 1b strains with respect to w <dig>  a novel type three secretion system of mosaic structure was found in the genome of w <dig> that is absent in the sequenced strains of the human pathogenic yersinia species, but conserved in the genomes of the apathogenic species.
the plasticity zone  of  <dig> kb in the w <dig> genome carries an ancient flagellar cluster flg- <dig> of ~ <dig> kb, but it lacks the pathogenicity island yapiye, the secretion system ysa and yts <dig>  and other virulence determinants of the  <dig> pz.
we identified several regions of differences in w <dig> that mainly code for transporters, regulators, metabolic pathways, and defence factors.
to better understand the relationship between pathogenicity towards insects and humans, we compared the w <dig> genome with that of the highly pathogenic strain  <dig> , the only y. enterocolitica strain sequenced so far.
