viral dna was cleaved with bsteii which allows the differentiation among subtypes a, b and non a, non b. according to the rea with bsteii, only one field strain showed a pattern similar to the argentinean a <dig> strain .
seventeen field strains of bohv- <dig> isolated from  <dig> to now were confirmed by differential pcr and subjected to restriction endonuclease analysis .
the mutation in the gb gene is associated with the difference in the restriction patterns between subtypes "a" and "b".
the genomic region of subtype b responsible for the distinct pattern was determined and amplified by pcr; specifically a point mutation was identified in glycoprotein b gene, on the bsteii restriction site, which generates the profile specific of bohv-5b.
