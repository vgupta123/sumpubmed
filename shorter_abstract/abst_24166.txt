pre-treatment with mtros inhibitor acetyl-l-carnitine  significantly inhibited tgf-β1-induced mtros production and sa-gal activity.
tgf-β <dig> can induce senescence of bmmscs, which at least partially depends on mtros production.
previous studies have shown that tgf-β induces senescence in several cell types.
bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells  are multipotent cells that can differentiate into diverse cell types, including cardiomyocytes.
we found that tgf-β <dig> increased activity of senescence-associated-galactosidase  and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species  in bmmscs in a dose-dependent manner.

prior to the transplantation, mscs are usually induced in vitro by biological reagents and chemicals for directional differentiation.
transforming growth factor beta  is one of the most commonly used biological reagents for induction of cardiomyocyte differentiation of bmmscs.
however, whether tgf-β affects senescence of bmmscs has not been elucidated.
tgf-β <dig> also significantly decreased expression of superoxide dismutase  <dig>  and id <dig>  and increased expression of 4-hydroxynonenal  subunits and p <dig> in bmmscs in a dose-dependent manner.
