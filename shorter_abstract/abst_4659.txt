gene ontology analysis revealed that the  <dig> pk genes with no or low expression level in arabidopsis roots are mainly involved in pollen recognition, pollen tube growth or other processes not relevant for root hair formation.
the current study extends these findings by focusing on the analysis of genes that encode protein kinases  and phosphatases  by mining pk and pp genes that were differentially expressed in response to pi deficiency.
subsets of  <dig>  and  <dig> annotated pk and pp genes were mined on the basis of the tair <dig> release of the arabidopsis genome.
analysis of rna-seq data showed that  <dig> pk and  <dig> pp genes were not detected in roots ;  <dig> pk and  <dig> pp showed low abundance .
among the  <dig> pp genes with no or low expression level, purple acid phosphatases, haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolases, and pp2c genes with functions in the dephosphorylation of rna polymerase ii c-terminal domain and mrna capping were enriched.
subsets of  <dig> pk and  <dig> pp genes were differentially expressed under pi-deficient conditions.
putative functional modules  of these pk and pp genes were constructed based on co-expression analysis using the maccu toolbox.
a co-expression network comprising  <dig> known or annotated pk and pp genes  was subdivided into several highly co-expressed gene sub-clusters.
we here provide comprehensive ‘digital’ transcriptional information on pk and pp genes in arabidopsis roots.
the co-expression network derived from our data mining approach sets the stage for follow-up experimentation that helps to complete our understanding of the post-translational regulation of pi deficiency-induced changes in root hair morphogenesis.

based on transcriptional profiling we reported previously that more than  <dig>  genes are differentially expressed between phosphate -deficient and pi-sufficient arabidopsis roots :1156– <dig>  2012).
more than 50% of the cysteine-rich rlk  subfamily genes belong to this group.
