as a consequence, the accurate and tedious screening of many docking models is usually required in the analysis step.
the development of accurate protein-protein docking programs is making this kind of simulations an effective tool to predict the 3d structure and the surface of interaction between the molecular partners in macromolecular complexes.
the application of cons-cocomaps to test-cases taken from recent capri rounds has shown that it is very efficient in highlighting even a very weak consensus that often is biologically meaningful.
to visualize the conservation, cons-cocomaps uses intermolecular contact maps.

all the programs under cons-cocomaps have been written in python, taking advantage of python libraries such as scipy and matplotlib.
cons-cocomaps is freely available as a web tool at the url:
cons-cocomaps uses the conservation of inter-residue contacts as an estimate of the similarity between different docking solutions.
here we presented cons-cocomaps, a novel tool to easily measure and visualize the consensus in multiple docking solutions.
