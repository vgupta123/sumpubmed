pairs of intact femurs from  <dig> calves that had died for reasons unrelated to the study were tested.
to compare the biomechanical in-vitro characteristics of limited-contact dynamic compression plate  and locking compression plate  constructs in an osteotomy gap model of femoral fracture in neonatal calves.
only  <dig> corresponding intact pairs of constructs could be statistically compared for relative structural stiffness, actuator excursion and width of the osteotomy gap.
relative structural stiffness was significantly greater, actuator excursion and width of the osteotomy gap were significantly smaller in the lcp constructs.
an insertion torque sufficient to provide adequate stability in femurs of newborn calves could not be achieved reliably with  <dig>  mm cortical screws.
a 7-hole lc-dcp with six  <dig>  mm cortical screws was used in one femur and a 7-hole lcp with four  <dig>  mm locking and two  <dig>  mm cortical screws was used in the corresponding femur.
another limiting factor for both constructs was the weak cancellous bone of the distal fracture fragment.
lcp constructs were significantly more resistant to compression than lc-dcp constructs.
while failure occurred by loosening of the screws in the lc-dcp constructs, locking constructs failed by cutting large holes in the soft distal metaphyseal bone.
the bone-thread interface was stripped in  <dig> of  <dig> cortical screws  before a pre-set insertion torque of  <dig> nm was achieved.
