in this work we studied the karyotypes of pithecia irrorata  and cacajao calvus rubicundus  by g- and c-banding, nor staining and chromosome painting using human and saguinus oedipus whole chromosome probes.
our results show that members of the pitheciinae have conserved several chromosome forms found in the inferred ancestral platyrrhini karyotype .
the karyotypes of both species were compared with each other and with chiropotes utahicki  from the literature.
in our chromosomal phylogeny, the genus pithecia occurred in a more basal position close to the inferred ancestor of platyrrhini, while c. c. rubicundus and c. utahicki are closely related and are linked by exclusive synapomorphies.
