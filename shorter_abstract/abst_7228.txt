foot-and-mouth disease  is an economically important and highly contagious viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed domestic and wild animals.
however, it is noteworthy that lack of infrastructure in certain areas with high risk of fmd may be a limiting factor for using real-time rt-pcr as a routine diagnostic tool.
a previously described real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  assay with high sensitivity and specificity under laboratorial and experimental conditions was used in the current study.
three samples from areas with outbreaks of fmd were positive by real-time rt-pcr, and  <dig> of those samples were positive by virus isolation and elisa.
four other samples were considered inconclusive by real-time rt-pcr ; whereas all  <dig> samples from an area free of fmd were real-time rt-pcr negative.
real-time rt-pcr is a powerful technique for reliable detection of fmdv in a fraction of the time required for virus isolation and elisa.
to verify the applicability of this assay under field conditions in brazil,  <dig> oral swabs from cattle were collected in areas free of fmd  and from areas with outbreaks of fmd .
virus isolation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  are the gold standard tests for diagnosis of fmd.
