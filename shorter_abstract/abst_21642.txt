stress responses to salinity and temperature shifts were monitored in time series experiments.
chemostat cultures grown in mineral medium at 28Â°c were compared to cultures that were shifted to either elevated  or reduced  temperatures as well as high salinity  and observed over  <dig> min.
high salinity resulted in the modulation of genes coding for compatible solutes, ion transporters and morphology.
cold shock altered the expression of genes in lipid metabolism and stress proteins.
transcriptional profiling confirmed that r. baltica is highly responsive to its environment.
heat shock showed the induction of several known chaperone genes.
our transcriptome study and previous proteome data suggest a set of genes of unknown functions that are most probably involved in the global stress response.
