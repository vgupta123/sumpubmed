such conventions provide guidance to ontology creators, help developers avoid flaws and inaccuracies when editing, and especially when interlinking, ontologies.
we also present the results of a survey carried out to establish which naming conventions are currently employed by obo foundry ontologies and to determine what their special requirements regarding the naming of entities might be.
lastly, we propose an initial set of typographic, syntactic and semantic conventions for labelling classes in obo foundry ontologies.
integration of these ontologies, while requiring considerable effort, is extremely desirable.
a wide variety of ontologies relevant to the biological and medical domains are available through the obo foundry portal, and their number is growing rapidly.
in particular, inconsistencies in naming conventions can impair the readability and navigability of ontology class hierarchies, and hinder their alignment and integration.
while other sources of diversity are tremendously complex and challenging, agreeing a set of common naming conventions is an achievable goal, particularly if those conventions are based on lessons drawn from pooled practical experience and surveys of community opinion.
