in bacillus subtilis, the enzymes yvmc and cypx are known to be involved in pulcherriminic acid biosynthesis.
yvmb appears as an additional regulatory element into the cellâ€™s decision to grow or sporulate.
however, the mechanisms controlling the transcription of the yvmc-cypx operon are still unknown.
in combination with genetic approaches, gel mobility shift assays indicated that a 14-bp palindromic motif constitutes the yvmb binding site.
yvmb was renamed as pchr controlling the pulcherriminic acid biosynthetic pathway of b. subtilis.
cyclodipeptides and their derivatives constitute a large class of peptide natural products with noteworthy biological activities.
a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis revealed a wide and prominent effect of yvmb deletion on proteins involved in cellular processes depending on iron availability.
in this work, we demonstrated that the b. subtilis yvmb marr-like regulator is the major transcription factor controlling yvmc-cypx expression.
our findings reveal a possible role of the b. subtilis yvmb regulator in the regulatory networks connected to iron metabolism and to the control of proper timing of sporulation.
further analysis with real-time in vivo transcriptional profiling allowed us to define the yvmb regulon.
it was unexpected that yvmb controls expression of yisi, whose encoding protein plays a negative role in the regulation of the sporulation initiation pathway.
in some yeasts and bacterial species, pulcherriminic acid derived from cyclo-l-leucyl-l-leucyl is excreted and chelates free ferric ions to form the pulcherrimin.
