it controls substrate ubiquitination by cullin-ring ub ligases , a process that determines substrate specificity of the ups.
there exists a coordinated downregulation of csn subunits in the csn <dig> and csn <dig> knockdowns.
in addition, downregulation of csn subunits influences the stability of important cellular regulators such as c-jun and p <dig>
permanent knockdowns of csn <dig> and csn <dig> led to a reduction of the subunits to approximately 40%, which is accompanied by a proportional decrease of the csn holocomplex.
in this study we knocked down csn <dig> , csn <dig>  and csn <dig>  by specific sirna oligos permanently expressed in hela cells.
the analysis and comparison of sirna cells revealed differential impact of individual subunits on csn structure and function.
in contrast, downregulation of csn <dig> in hela cells reduced the csn <dig> protein below 20% without significant effects on the remaining complex.
csn <dig> seems to possess a specific status in hela cells.
