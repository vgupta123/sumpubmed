here, we provide comparative staging of ray and disc flower development and microarray screening for differentially expressed genes, accomplished via microdissection of hundreds of coordinately developing flower primordia.
intrestingly, several of these encode homologs of mads-box transcription factors otherwise known to regulate flower organ development.
our rna expression results suggest that flower-type specific mads protein complexes may play a central role in differential development of ray and disc flowers across the gerbera capitulum, and that some commonality is shared with known protein functions in floral organ determination.
using a 9k gerbera cdna microarray we identified a number of genes with putative specificity to individual flower types.
despite great interest in plant morphological evolution and the tractability of the gerbera system, very little is known regarding genetic mechanisms involved in flower type specification.
