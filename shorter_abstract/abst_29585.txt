the consensus map spans  <dig> cm across the  <dig> melon linkage groups and is composed of  <dig> markers  with a mean marker density of  <dig>  cm/marker.
for example, independently identified qtl controlling fruit shape were mapped on similar genomic positions, suggesting that such qtl are possibly responsible for the phenotypic variability observed for this trait in a broad array of melon germplasm.
some qtl associated with economically important traits detected in separate studies mapped to similar genomic positions.
even though relatively unsaturated genetic maps in a diverse set of melon market types have been published, the integrated saturated map presented herein should be considered the initial reference map for melon.
