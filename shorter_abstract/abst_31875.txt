structural alignments and functional residues of a known protein set  are used to build special hidden markov models  called hmm descriptors.
sddb uses previously calculated and stored hmm descriptors for predicting active sites, binding residues, and protein function.
it accepts queries in fasta format and predicts functional residue positions, protein-ligand interactions, and protein function, based on the scop database.
the structural descriptor database  is a web-based tool that predicts the function of proteins and functional site positions based on the structural properties of related protein families.
to assess the sddb performance, we used different data sets.
the trypsion-like serine protease data set assessed how well sddb predicts functional sites when curated data is available.
nevertheless, by using our prediction method we obtained results with precision above 70%.
sddb worked better in predicting active sites rather than binding sites because the former are more conserved than the latter.
