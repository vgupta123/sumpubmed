ecological and evolutionary model organisms have provided extensive insight into the ecological triggers, adaptive benefits, and evolution of life-history driven developmental plasticity.
the goal of this study is to determine whether we can identify underlying gene expression patterns that can describe the different life-history trajectories individuals follow in response to social cues of competition.
to do this, we use the australian black field cricket , a species with sex-specific developmental trajectories moderated by the density and quality of calls heard during immaturity.

our results provide interesting insight into the genomic underpinnings of developmental plasticity and highlight the potential of a genomic exploration of other evolutionary theories such as condition dependence and sex-specific developmental strategies.
we demonstrate that increased investment towards traits such as growth and reproductive effort were often associated with the expression of a greater number of genes with similar effect, thus providing a suite of candidate genes for future research in this and other invertebrate organisms.
we next used rna-seq to develop a reference transcriptome to study changes in brain gene expression at two points prior to sexual maturation.
despite this, we still have a poor understanding of the underlying genetic changes that occur during shifts towards different developmental trajectories.
