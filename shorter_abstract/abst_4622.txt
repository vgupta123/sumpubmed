all hesc lines expressed the established markers of pluripotent cells as well as several primordial germ cell  marker genes in a uniform manner.
here, we describe the derivation of five hesc lines  from frozen-thawed human embryos and compare their individual differentiation characteristic.
hesc lines may differ substantially in their differentiation properties although they appear similar in the undifferentiated state.
the cells grew significantly faster and could be passaged enzymatically only on mouse feeders.
however, this was found to lead to chromosomal instability after prolonged culture.
the cell lines were cultured either on human or mouse feeder cells.
however, the cell lines showed distinct features in their spontaneous differentiation patterns.
