together, these results suggest coordinated control of different mrna subsets at the post-transcriptional level by specific rbps.
insertion of the correctly folded rna elements to a non-specific mrna rendered it into a target transcript, whereas substitution of the rna elements abolished rbp interaction.
co-immunoprecipitated rbp-associated rnas were extracted from mrnp complexes and binding of rbps to several targets was confirmed by independent experimental assays.
in this study, we report the identification of mrna targets for trypanosoma cruzi u-rich rbp  <dig>  and t. cruzi rbp  <dig> , two phylogenetically conserved proteins among kinetoplastids.
cis-elements for rbp binding have a stem-loop structure of 30â€“ <dig> bases and are more frequently represented in the 3'-untranslated region  of mrnas.
