as a result, the maximum iturin a concentration reached  <dig>  g/l, which was two-fold higher than that of batch culture.
this approach may also enhance the production of other useful secondary metabolites by bacillus subtilis.

using this strategy, the ratio of spores to total cells could be maintained at a desirable/stable level of  <dig> – <dig> , and the reducing sugar concentration could be controlled at a low level of 2–3 g/l so that optimal substrate balance could be maintained throughout the feeding phase.
this study aims to enhance iturin a production by performing a novel fermentation process with effective glucose feeding control using rapeseed meal as a low-cost nitrogen source.
however, its industrial fermentation has not been realized due to the high production costs and low product concentrations.
this is the first report which uses control of the glucose supply to improve iturin a production by fed-batch fermentation and identifies some important factors necessary to realize industrial iturin a production.
