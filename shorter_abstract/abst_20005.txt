we show that sgt detects only live bacteria and is sensitive enough to differentiate between  <dig> and  <dig> cells/ml.
we combined the methodology of quantitative polymerase chain reaction  calculations with a previously described qualitative method of bacterial growth determination to develop an improved quantitative method.
the most common method is bacterial plating, which has the advantage of allowing live cell assessment through colony forming unit  counts but is not well suited for high throughput screening .
here, we report a bacterial cell counting method termed start growth time  that allows rapid and serial quantification of the absolute or relative number of live cells in a bacterial culture in a high throughput manner.
sgt results do not differ significantly from results obtained by cfu counts.
sgt is based on the re-growth time required by a growing cell culture to reach a threshold, and the notion that this time is proportional to the number of cells in the initial inoculum.
sgt is a relatively quick, highly sensitive, reproducible and non-laborious method that can be used in hts settings to longitudinally assess live cells in bacterial cell cultures.
