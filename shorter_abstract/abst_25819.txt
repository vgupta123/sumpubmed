with the completion of the human genome sequence the functional analysis and characterization of the encoded proteins has become the next urging challenge in the post-genome era.
the german cdna consortium orfeome resource currently consists of more than  <dig>  sequence-verified entry clones representing orfs, cloned with and without stop codon, for about  <dig>  different gene loci.
in addition, a robust cloning strategy was established, permitting the simultaneous generation of two clone variants that contain a particular orf with as well as without a stop codon by the implementation of only one additional working step into the cloning procedure.
a pipeline for efficient cloning and sequencing was developed and a sample tracking database was implemented to streamline the clone production process targeting more than  <dig>  different orfs.
here we describe the generation of a full-orf clone resource of human genes applying the gateway cloning technology .
the entry clones have been used to generate over  <dig>  different expression constructs, providing the basis for functional profiling applications.
