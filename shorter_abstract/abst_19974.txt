ongoing technological advances in genome sequencing are allowing bacterial genomes to be sequenced at ever-lower cost.
overall, increased genome fragmentation correlated with increased false-negative pfam and cog annotation rates and increased false-positive kegg annotation rates.
whereas this strategy successfully linked up to 46% of the total orf fragments in some genomes, its sensitivity appeared to depend heavily on the depth of sampling of a particular taxon's variable genome.
in a more thorough analysis of  <dig> streptomyces genomes, fragmentation was especially enriched in some protein classes with repeating, multi-modular structures such as polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and serine/threonine kinases.
draft microbial genomes contain many orf fragments.
in this study we quantify orf fragmentation in draft microbial genomes and its effect on annotation efficacy, and we propose a solution to ameliorate this problem.
a survey of draft-quality genomes in genbank revealed that fragmented orfs comprised > 80% of the predicted orfs in some genomes, and that increased fragmentation correlated with decreased genome assembly quality.
however, nearly all of these new techniques concomitantly decrease genome quality, primarily due to the inability of their relatively short read lengths to bridge certain genomic regions, e.g., those containing repeats.
