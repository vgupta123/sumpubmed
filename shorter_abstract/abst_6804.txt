we find that such direct, specific interactions only partially contribute to protein-dna recognition, indicating an important role of shape complementarity and sequence-dependent dna internal energy, in line with the concept of indirect protein-dna readout mechanism.
protein-dna interactions are important for many cellular processes, however structural knowledge for a large fraction of known and putative complexes is still lacking.
we present a new coarse-grained force field suitable for protein-dna docking.
the force field is an extension of previously developed parameter sets for protein-rna and protein-protein interactions.
we find that the force field gives very good results for bound docking.
we analyze the role of specific protein-dna interactions on force field performance, both with respect to complex structure prediction, and the reproduction of experimental binding affinities.
the docking is based on potential energy minimization in translational and orientational degrees of freedom of the binding partners.
the quality of predictions in the case of unbound docking varies, depending on the level of structural deviation from bound geometries.
