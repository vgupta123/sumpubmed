however, as microarray experiments have become more routine, large scale experiments have become more common, which investigate multiple time points or sets of mutants or transgenics.
pageman provides a fast overview of single treatments, allows genome-level responses to be compared across several microarray experiments covering, for example, stress responses at multiple time points.
pageman allows multiple microarray experiments to be efficiently condensed into a single page graphical display.
it includes a gui tool to transform different ontologies into a suitable format, enabling the user to compare and choose between different ontologies.
results are exported in a graphical format for direct use, or for further editing in graphics programs.
in a case study, we analyze the results of publicly available microarrays of multiple cold stress experiments using pageman, and compare the results to a previously published meta-analysis.
it is equipped with several statistical modules for data analysis, including over-representation analysis and wilcoxon statistical testing.
pageman offers a complete user's guide, a web-based over-representation analysis as well as a tutorial, and is freely available at .
