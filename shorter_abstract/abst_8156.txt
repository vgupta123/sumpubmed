we present a mathematical model to describe the csrnai system based on both cs theory and biological concerns.
this model constructs a multi-to-multi correspondence between sirnas and their targets, with sirnas much fewer than mrna targets, compared with the conventional scheme.
numerical simulations show that we can reduce the sirna library to one third of that in the conventional scheme.
then we propose a machine learning based method to find the effective sirnas with novel features, such as image features and speech features to describe an sirna sequence.
rna interference  becomes an increasingly important and effective genetic tool to study the function of target genes by suppressing specific genes of interest.
in this paper, we propose a conceptual model, called compressed sensing rnai , which employs a unique combination of group of small interfering rnas  to knockdown a much larger size of genes.
this csrnai system is very promising in saving both time and cost for large-scale rnai screening experiments which may benefit the biological research with respect to cellular processes and pathways.
to build this model, we first search nucleotide motifs in a target gene set.
