failure in signaling via alk <dig> leads to severe cardiovascular and pharyngeal defects, including inappropriate remodeling of pharyngeal arch arteries, abnormal aortic sac development, failure in pharyngeal organ migration and persistent truncus arteriosus.
while alk <dig> is not required for neural crest cell migration, our results demonstrate that it plays an important role in the survival of post-migratory cardiac neural crest cells.
our results demonstrate that alk5-mediated signaling in neural crest cells plays an essential cell-autonomous role in the pharyngeal and cardiac outflow tract development.
we deleted the tgf-Î² type i receptor alk <dig> specifically in the mouse neural crest cell lineage.
