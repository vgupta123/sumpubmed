we have characterized the expression patterns of both sap <dig> and sin3a genes during chick embryo development, using in situ hybridization experiments.
we found that both sap <dig> and sin3a expression patterns co-localize in vivo with hairy <dig> expression domains in chick rostral presomitic mesoderm and caudal region of somites.
moreover, since sap <dig> and sin3a are not expressed in the psm territory where hairy <dig> presents cyclic expression, our study strongly points to different roles for hairy <dig> throughout the psm and in the prospective somite and caudal region of already formed somites.
our results indicate that during chick somitogenesis hairy <dig> may mediate gene transcriptional repression by recruiting the sin3/hdac complex, through a direct interaction with the sap <dig> adaptor molecule.
aiming at understanding the molecular events triggered by the somitogenesis clock hairy <dig> protein, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify hairy <dig> interaction partners.
sap <dig>  an adaptor molecule of the sin3/hdac transcriptional repressor complex, was found to interact with the c-terminal portion of the hairy <dig> protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay and the hairy1/sap <dig> interaction was independently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
somites are symmetrically positioned flanking the embryo axial structures  and are periodically formed in a anterior-posterior direction from the presomitic mesoderm.
this extraordinary periodicity is proposed to depend on an underlying somitogenesis molecular clock, firstly evidenced by the cyclic expression of the chick hairy <dig> gene in the unsegmented presomitic mesoderm with a  <dig> min periodicity, corresponding to the time required to form a somite pair in the chick embryo.
the number of hairy <dig> oscillations at any given moment is proposed to provide the cell with both temporal and positional information along the embryo's anterior-posterior axis.
the time required to form a somite pair is constant and species-specific.
