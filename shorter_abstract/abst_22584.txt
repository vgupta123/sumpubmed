campylobacter jejuni, the commonest cause of bacterial diarrhoea worldwide, can also induce colonic inflammation.
to understand how a previously identified heat stable component contributes to pro-inflammatory responses we used microarray and real-time quantitative pcr to investigate the transcriptional response to a boiled cell extract of campylobacter jejuni nctc  <dig>
rna was extracted from the human colonocyte line hca- <dig>  after incubation for  <dig> hours with campylobacter jejuni boiled cell extract and was used to probe the affymetrix human genome u133a array.
genes differentially affected by campylobacter jejuni boiled cell extract were identified using the significance score algorithm of the bioconductor software suite and further analyzed using the ingenuity pathway analysis program.
a boiled cell extract of campylobacter jejuni has components that can directly switch the phenotype of colonic epithelial cells from one of resting metabolism to a pro-inflammatory one, particularly characterized by increased expression of genes for leukocyte chemoattractant molecules.
ingenuity pathway analysis also identified the most affected functional gene networks such as cell movement, gene expression and cell death.
