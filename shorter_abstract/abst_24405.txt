phytohormones play critical regulatory roles in plants in the response to external and internal cues to regulate growth and development.
understanding the mechanisms underlying plant responses to external abiotic stresses is important for breeding stress-tolerant crops and herbages.
we identified nod factor signalling pathways during early symbiotic nodulation that are modified by abiotic stresses.
this global gene expression analysis provides new insights into the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the acclimation to abiotic stresses.
we present an abiotic stress-responsive m. falcata transcriptome using next-generation sequencing data from samples grown under standard, dehydration, high salinity, and cold conditions.
the entire world is facing a deteriorating environment.
we combined reads from all samples and de novo assembled  <dig>  transcripts to build the m. falcata gene index.
a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome revealed abiotic stress-responsive mechanisms underlying the metabolism and core signalling components of major phytohormones.
we performed illumina sequencing of cdna prepared from abiotic stress treated m. falcata.
acomparison among the three abiotic stress treated samples was carried out.
m. falcata is shown to be a model candidate for studying abiotic stress-responsive mechanisms in legumes.
medicago falcata is one of the stress-tolerant candidate leguminous species and is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen.
additionally, a global comparison of homology between the m. falcata and m. truncatula transcriptomes, along with five other leguminous species, revealed a high level of global sequence conservation within the family.
this ability allows leguminous plants to grow in nitrogen deficient soils.
