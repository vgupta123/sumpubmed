it is presumed that arbutin could alleviate oxidative stress derived from the melanogenic pathway in the skin in addition to its function as a whitening agent in cosmetics.
the aim of the present study was to examine if arbutin could suppress the hydroxyl radical generation via tyrosinase reaction with its substrates, l-tyrosine and l-dopa.
the hydroxyl radical, which was determined by an electron spin resonance-spin trapping technique, was generated by the addition of not only l-tyrosine but l-dopa to tyrosinase in a concentration dependent manner.
hydroxyl radical that has the highest reactivity among reactive oxygen species  is generated through l-tyrosine-tyrosinase reaction.
arbutin could inhibit the hydroxyl radical generation in the both reactions.
arbutin , a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor has been widely used for the purpose of skin whitening.
thus, the melanogenesis might induce oxidative stress in the skin.
