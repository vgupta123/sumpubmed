first, dna-based species delimitation analyses were conducted to assess species boundaries within neotropical troidini using an enlarged fragment of the standard barcode gene.
this study demonstrates that:  current neotropical biodiversity may have originated ex situ;  the gaarlandia bridge was important in facilitating invasions of south america;  colonization of amazonia initiated the crown diversification of these swallowtails; and  amazonia is not only a species-rich region but also acted as a sanctuary for the dynamics of this diversity.
to better understand extant patterns in neotropical biodiversity, we investigated the evolutionary history of three neotropical swallowtail troidini genera .
the temporal and geographical diversification of neotropical insects remains poorly understood because of the complex changes in geological and climatic conditions that occurred during the cenozoic.
two independent lineages  reached south america via the gaarlandia temporary connection, and later became extinct in north america.
the phylogeny for neotropical troidini was well resolved and strongly supported.
molecular dating and biogeographic analyses indicate that the extant lineages of neotropical troidini have a late eocene  origin in north america.
molecularly delineated species were then used to infer a time-calibrated species-level phylogeny based on a three-gene dataset and bayesian dating analyses.
