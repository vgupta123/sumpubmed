to illustrate use of the union-intersection test with real data, we analyzed a publically available data set of  <dig>  autosomal snps genotyped for  <dig> cases of parkinson disease and  <dig> neurologically normal controls for which no genome-wide significant results were found by traditional single marker analysis.
within the framework, we developed a union-intersection test suitable for genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms , candidate gene data, as well as medical sequencing data.
the union-intersection test is a composite test of association of genotype frequencies and differential correlation among markers.
we also demonstrated scenarios in which the multi-locus test was more powerful than traditional single marker analysis.
we also found suggestive evidence that directionally inconsistent marginal effects from single marker analysis appeared to result from risk being driven by different haplotypes in the two samples for the genes syn <dig> and ngly <dig>  which are involved in neurotransmitter release and proteasomal degradation, respectively.
these results illustrate the utility of our unified framework for genome-wide association analysis of common, complex diseases.
we identified a single risk haplotype with a directionally consistent effect in both samples in the gene gak, which is involved in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking.
common, complex diseases are hypothesized to result from a combination of common and rare genetic variants.
