to gain insight into the metabolic pathways and virulence factors expressed by the bacterium at the blood stage of pseudotuberculosis, we compared the overall gene transcription patterns  of bacterial cells cultured in either human plasma or luria-bertani medium.
the most marked plasma-triggered metabolic consequence in y. pseudotuberculosis was the switch to high glucose consumption, which is reminiscent of the acetogenic pathway  in escherichia coli.
however, upregulation of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes suggests that  acetate may be further metabolized in y. pseudotuberculosis.
our results suggest that plasma growth of y. pseudotuberculosis is responsible for major transcriptional regulatory events and prompts key metabolic reorientations within the bacterium, which may in turn have an impact on virulence.
