b. malayi, d. immitis, o. volvulus and w. bancrofti are wolbachia-dependent while a. viteae, c. quiscali, l. loa, o. flexuosa and s. digitata are wolbachia-free.
comparisons between the mitochondrial genome sequences of wolbachia-dependent and independent filarial worms may reveal differences indicative of altered mitochondrial function.
the mitochondrial genomes of  <dig> species of filarial nematodes, acanthocheilonema viteae, chandlerella quiscali, loa loa, onchocerca flexuosa, and wuchereria bancrofti, were sequenced, annotated and compared with available mitochondrial genome sequences from brugia malayi, dirofilaria immitis, onchocerca volvulus and setaria digitata.
thus far, no discernable differences were detected between the mitochondrial genome sequences of wolbachia-dependent and independent species.
if wolbachia can supplement host energy metabolism, reduced mitochondrial function in infected filarial species may account for wolbachia-dependence.
the  <dig> mitochondrial genomes were similar in size and at content and encoded the same  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas.
additional research will be needed to determine whether mitochondria from wolbachia-dependent filarial species show reduced function in comparison to the mitochondria of wolbachia-independent species despite their sequence-level similarities.
previous studies have indicated that wolbachia have an impact on mitochondrial gene expression, which may suggest a role in energy metabolism.
protein-coding genes were expressed at the rna level in all examined species.
many species of filarial nematodes depend on wolbachia endobacteria to carry out their life cycle.
synteny was perfectly preserved in all species except c. quiscali, which had a different order for  <dig> trna genes.
the biological mechanisms underpinning wolbachia-dependence and independence in filarial nematodes are not known.
