neisseria meningitidis is an obligate human nasopharyngeal commensal which can cause life-threatening infections including septicaemia and meningitis.
flow cytometry confirmed that gapa- <dig> could be detected on the cell surface, but only in a siad-knockout  background, suggesting that gapa- <dig> is inaccessible to antibody in in vitro-grown encapsulated meningococci.
however, a gapa- <dig> deficient mutant showed a significant reduction in adhesion to human epithelial and endothelial cells compared to the wild-type and complemented mutant.
mutation of gapa- <dig> does not affect the in vitro growth rate of n. meningitidis, but significantly affects the ability of the organism to adhere to human epithelial and endothelial cells in a capsule-independent process suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of meningococcal infection.
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases  are cytoplasmic glycolytic enzymes, which although lacking identifiable secretion signals, have also been found localized to the surface of several bacteria ; where in some cases they have been shown to contribute to the colonization and invasion of host tissues.
n. meningitidis has two genes, gapa- <dig> and gapa- <dig>  encoding gapdh enzymes.
the aims of this study were: 1) to determine whether gapa- <dig> was expressed across different strains of n. meningitidis; 2) to determine whether gapa- <dig> surface accessibility to antibodies was dependant on the presence of capsule; 3) to determine whether gapa- <dig> can influence the interaction of meningococci and host cells, particularly in the key stages of adhesion and invasion.
