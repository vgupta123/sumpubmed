an analysis of the ciona repertoire of gpcrs from a comparative genomic perspective provides insight into the evolutionary origins of the gpcr signalling system in vertebrates.
this is evident at the subfamily level comparisons since ciona gpcr sequences are significantly analogous to vertebrate gpcr subfamilies even while exhibiting ciona specific genes.
phylogenetic analyses reveal that ciona gpcrs have homologous representatives from the five major grafs  families concomitant with other vertebrate gpcr repertoires.
comparison of gpcrs in ciona to that in human reveals a high level of orthology of a protochordate repertoire with that of vertebrate gpcrs.
g protein-coupled receptors  constitute a large family of integral transmembrane receptor proteins that play a central role in signal transduction in eukaryotes.
we have identified  <dig> gene products in the ciona genome that code for putative gpcrs.
nearly 39% of ciona gpcrs have unambiguous orthologs of vertebrate gpcr families, as defined for the human, mouse, puffer fish and chicken genomes.
