we present a scheme to survey recombination in the haploid stage genomes of two sibling parasite clones, using whole genome pyrosequencing that includes a sliding window approach to predict recombination breakpoints.
more than  <dig>  of the  <dig>  snp markers identified between parents were genotyped in the progeny, resulting in a marker density of approximately  <dig> marker/ <dig>  kb and allowing for the detection of previously unrecognized crossovers  and many non crossover  gene conversions throughout the genome.
by sequencing the  <dig> mb genomes of two haploid progeny clones derived from a genetic cross at more than 30× coverage, we captured high resolution information on cos, ncos and genetic variation within the progeny genomes.
whole genome shotgun  sequencing generated approximately  <dig> million reads, with an average read length of approximately  <dig> bp.
de novo assembly using a combination of wgs and  <dig> kb paired end libraries resulted in contigs ≤  <dig> kb.
