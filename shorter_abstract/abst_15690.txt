the species specific product size for e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively, which was clearly different for all the three entamoeba species.
we have developed a nested multiplex pcr targeting a 16s-like rrna gene for differential detection of all the three morphologically similar forms of e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar simultaneously in stool samples.
the nested multiplex pcr showed a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100% for the demonstration of e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar dna in stool samples.
moshkovskii by microscopy and culture were also found negative by the nested multiplex pcr .
moshkovskii by examination of stool by microscopy and/or culture, were actually positive for pathogenic e. histolytica and the remaining majority of the stool samples were positive for non-pathogenic e. dispar or e. moshkovskii as demonstrated by the use of nested multiplex pcr.
the present study reports a new nested multiplex pcr strategy for species specific detection and differentiation of e. histolytica, e. dispar and e. moshkovskii dna in stool specimens.
e. histolytica, a pathogenic amoeba, is indistinguishable in its cyst and trophozoite stages from those of non-pathogenic e. moshkovskii and e. dispar by light microscopy.
the pcr was positive for e. histolytica, e. moshkovskii and e. dispar in a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> stool specimens  that were positive for e. histolytica/e.
the test is highly specific, sensitive and also rapid, providing the results within  <dig> hours of receiving stool specimens.
all the  <dig> negative control stool samples that were negative for e. histolytica/e.
the result from the study shows that only  <dig> % of the patient stool samples that were positive for e. histolytica/e.
moshkovskii by examination of stool by microscopy and/or culture.
