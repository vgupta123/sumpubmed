as transcriptome studies have been widely used for gene fusion discoveries, the current non-standard mode of data representation could potentially impede data accessibility, critical analyses, and further discoveries in the near future.
the gene fusion markup language  presented here could facilitate the development of a standard format for organizing, integrating and representing the significant features of gene fusion data in an inter-operable and query-able fashion that will enable biologically intuitive access to gene fusion findings and expedite functional characterization.
here we propose a prototype, gene fusion markup language  as an initiative to provide a standard format for organizing and representing the significant features of gene fusion data.
the gfml prototype is made available at
