a common response independent of the type of aneuploidy might be exploited as a novel target for cancer therapy.
to uncover the triggers of the response, we compared the profiles with transcription changes in human cells subjected to stress conditions.
here we evaluate the transcription profiles of eleven trisomic and tetrasomic cell lines and two cell lines with complex aneuploid karyotypes.
we identify a characteristic aneuploidy response pattern defined by upregulation of genes linked to endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus and lysosomes, and downregulation of dna replication, transcription as well as ribosomes.
there are many different types and origins of aneuploidy, but whether there is a uniform cellular response to aneuploidy in human cells has not been addressed so far.
moreover, the potential aneuploidy markers identified in our analysis might represent novel biomarkers to assess the malignant potential of a tumor.
our analysis shows that despite the variability in chromosome content, aneuploidy triggers uniform transcriptional response in human cells.
strikingly, complex aneuploidy elicits the same transcriptional changes as trisomy.
