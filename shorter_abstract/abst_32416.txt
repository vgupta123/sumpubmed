under in vivo conditions the increased gaba release modulates the power of gamma range oscillation in the ca <dig> region, suggesting that the glu/gaba exchange mechanism is also functioning in the intact hippocampus under physiological conditions.
the released gaba significantly contributes to the tonic inhibition of neurons in a network activity-dependent manner.
the results suggest the existence of a novel molecular mechanism by which astrocytes transform glutamatergic excitation into gabaergic inhibition providing an adjustable, in situ negative feedback on the excitability of neurons.
blockade of the glu/gaba exchange mechanism increases the duration of seizure-like events in the low- in vitro model of epilepsy.
we demonstrate that gaba, synthesized from the polyamine putrescine, is released from astrocytes by the reverse action of glial gaba transporter  subtypes gat- <dig> or gat- <dig>  gaba release can be prevented by blocking glutamate uptake with the non-transportable inhibitor dhk, confirming that it is the glutamate transporter activity that triggers the reversal of gaba transporters, conceivably by elevating the intracellular na+ concentration in astrocytes.
