however, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread.
we present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics.
we test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population.
recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections.
such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here.
phylogenetic analysis is now an important tool in the study of viral outbreaks.
this study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.
a randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data.
next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement.
we apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in north american raccoons.

the inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a “weight” using environmental data .
