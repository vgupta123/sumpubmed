invertases are ubiquitous enzymes that irreversibly cleave sucrose into fructose and glucose.
very high natural allelic variation was uncovered in a set of five potato invertase genes.
linkage and association studies have identified quantitative trait loci  for tuber sugar content and chip quality that colocalize with three independent potato invertase loci, which together encode five invertase genes.
cdna alleles associated with chip quality, tuber starch content and starch yield were identified.
the associations found between specific invertase alleles and chip quality, tuber starch content and starch yield will facilitate the selection of superior potato genotypes in breeding programs.
for functional studies on natural variants of five potato invertase genes we cloned and sequenced  <dig> full-length cdnas from six heterozygous individuals .
in potato , invertases are involved in 'cold-induced sweetening' of tubers, an adaptive response to cold stress, which negatively affects the quality of potato chips and french fries.
eleven, thirteen, ten, twelve and nine different cdna alleles were obtained for the genes pain- <dig>  invge, invgf, invcd <dig> and invcd <dig>  respectively.
the role of natural allelic variation of these genes in controlling the variation of tuber sugar content in different genotypes is unknown.
some of the structural variation found might underlie functional variation that influences important agronomic traits such as tuber sugar content.
plant invertases play important roles in carbohydrate metabolism, plant development, and biotic and abiotic stress responses.
