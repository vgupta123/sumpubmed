it is also well known that pax <dig>  ttf- <dig>  foxe <dig> and hhex are the thyroid-enriched transcription factors responsible for the expression of the above genes, thus are responsible for the differentiated thyroid phenotype.
however, to date the bases for the thyroid-enriched expression of this transcription factor have not been unraveled yet.
in addition, the data here reported indicate that the thyroid-enriched transcription factor ttf- <dig> is able to bind in vitro and in vivo the pax <dig> far upstream element, and is capable to activate transcription from it.
interestingly, the identified far upstream element manifested a very high transcriptional activity in the thyroid cell line pc cl <dig>  but showed no activity in hela cells.
results of this study reveal the presence of a thyroid-specific regulatory element in the 5' upstream region of the pax <dig> gene.
in particular, the role of pax <dig> in the fully developed thyroid gland was studied in depth and it was established that it plays a key role in thyroid development and differentiation.
the in silico data were verified by promoter-reporter assays in thyroid and non-thyroid cells.
using this approach we identified one putative thyroid-specific regulatory element located  <dig>  kb upstream of the pax <dig> transcription start site.
the identification of this regulatory element represents the first step in the investigation of upstream regulatory mechanisms that control pax <dig> transcription during thyroid differentiation and are relevant to further studies on pax <dig> as a candidate gene for thyroid dysgenesis.
