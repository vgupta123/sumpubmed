expressions of nf-κb in lung cells and tnf-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  were determined by western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  respectively.
lps administration reduced the rectal temperature and white blood cell counts at 1 h, increased lung wet/dry weight ratios, caused evident lung histopathological injury, and increased the detectable transcript and cytokine levels of tnf-α in lung tissue in balf.
to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of specific small interfering rna targeting nf-κb on lipopolysaccharide -induced acute lung injury  in rats.
acute lung injury was induced in sprague-dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection with lps , followed by immediate intratracheal instillation of sirna targeting nf-κb p <dig> .

sirna targeting of nf-κb p <dig> effectively abrogated the expression of nf-κb p <dig> in lung cells and, aside from rectal temperatures, ameliorated all changes induced by lps.
nf-κb knockdown exerts anti-inflammatory effects on lps-induced ali especially in the initial phase, which may be due in part to reduced levels of the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-α.
