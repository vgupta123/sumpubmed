our data reveals the highly dynamic nature of bmp-smad mediated transcriptional regulation in time and space throughout the vascular tree, supporting that bmp-smad signalling can be a source of phenotypic diversity in some, but not all, healthy endothelium.
to better understand the in vivo context-dependency of bmp-smad signalling, we investigated differences in bmp-smad transcriptional activity in different vascular beds during mouse embryonic and postnatal stages.
postnatal lymphatic vessels showed however only discrete micro-domains of transcriptional activity.
dynamic shifts in transcriptional activity were also observed in the endocardium of the developing heart, with a general decrease in activity over time.
patches of transcriptional activity seemed to correlate with vasculature undergoing hemodynamic alterations.
bone morphogenetic protein  signalling has emerged as a fundamental pathway in endothelial cell biology and deregulation of this pathway is implicated in several vascular disorders.
this knowledge can provide insight in vascular bed or organ-specific diseases and phenotypic heterogeneity within an endothelial cell population.
a mosaic pattern of gfp was present in various angiogenic sprouting plexuses and in endocardium of cardiac cushions and trabeculae in the heart.
the bre::gfp mouse allows to investigate selective context-dependent aspects of bmp-smad signalling.
