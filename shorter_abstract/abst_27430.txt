to investigate whether collapse in range and loss of diversity might be correlated, we collected mitochondrial sequence data  from muskox fossil material recovered from localities in northeastern asia and the arctic archipelago of northern north america, dating from late pleistocene to late holocene, and compared our results to existing databases for modern muskoxen.
"surviving haplotypes" , closely similar or identical to haplotypes found in modern muskoxen and ranging in age from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig> yrbp, were found in all new world samples as well as some samples from northeastern asia.
"extinct haplotypes" , dating between ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  yrbp, were found only in material from the taimyr peninsula and new siberian islands in northeastern asia.
the modern wildherd of the tundra muskox  is native only to the new world , and its genetic diversity is notably low.
we provisionally interpret this evidence as showing that genetic variability was reduced in muskoxen after the last glacial maximum but before the mid-holocene, or roughly within the interval  <dig> - <dig>  yrbp.
however, like several other megafaunal mammals, muskoxen enjoyed a holarctic distribution during the late pleistocene.
