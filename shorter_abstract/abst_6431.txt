we propose a new alignment-free algorithm, mbkm, based on a new distance measure, dmk, for clustering gene sequences.
the proposed distance measure and clustering method are evaluated by clustering functionally related genes and by phylogenetic analysis.
we introduced a novel clustering algorithm which is based on a new sequence similarity measure.
clustering dna sequences into functional groups is an important problem in bioinformatics.
this method transforms dna sequences into the feature vectors which contain the occurrence, location and order relation of k-tuples in dna sequence.
afterwards, a hierarchical procedure is applied to clustering dna sequences based on the feature vectors.
the experimental results show our method is effective in classifying dna sequences with similar biological characteristics and in discovering the underlying relationship among the sequences.
