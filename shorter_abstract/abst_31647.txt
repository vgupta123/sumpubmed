the major seroreactive proteins were fabricated in a small microarray and further analyzed with the sera of patients with rickettsial spotted fever, legionella pneumonia or streptococcal pneumonia.
an immunoproteomic study of c. burnetii xinqiao strain isolated in china was conducted with the sera from experimentally infected balb/c mice and q fever patients.
coxiella burnetii is the etiological agent of q fever.
the clinical diagnosis of q fever is mainly based on several serological tests.
nineteen of the  <dig> proteins were successfully expressed in escherichia coli and used to fabricate a microarray which was probed with q fever patient sera.
our results demonstrate that these  <dig> coxiella proteins gave a modest sensitivity and specificity for recognizing of q fever patient sera, suggesting that they are potential serodiagnostic markers for q fever.
as a result, groel, ybgf, rpll, mip, omph, com <dig>  and dnak were recognized as major seroreactive antigens.
