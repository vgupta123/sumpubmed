while s. coelicolor is the model streptomycete for studying antibiotic synthesis and differentiation, s. lividans is almost exclusively considered as the preferred host, among actinomycetes, for cloning and expression of exogenous dna.
in particular, a pair of methylmalonyl coa mutase  genes involved in polyketide precursor biosynthesis, an acyl-coa dehydrogenase implicated in timing of actinorhodin synthesis and bldb, a developmentally significant regulator whose mutation causes complete abrogation of antibiotic synthesis belong to this category.
embedded within these segments are at least four dna methylases and two probable methyl-sensing restriction endonucleases.
we identified five large s. coelicolor genomic islands  and  <dig> smaller islets absent in s. lividans chromosome.
six of them are in close vicinity of trna genes while nine are flanked with near perfect repeat sequences indicating that these are probable recent evolutionary acquisitions into s. coelicolor.
comparison with s. coelicolor transcriptome and proteome data revealed that some of the missing genes are active during the course of growth and differentiation in s. coelicolor.
importantly, absence of certain genes in s. lividans identified here could potentially explain the relative ease of dna transformations and the conditional lack of actinorhodin synthesis in s. lividans.
many of these regions show anomalous gc bias and codon usage patterns.
our findings provide tangible hints for elucidating the genetic basis of important phenotypic differences between these two streptomycetes.
