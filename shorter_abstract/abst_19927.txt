in contrast, genes involved in various metabolic pathways, particularly in producing carboxylic acids, aromatic amino acids, nitrogen compounds, and polyamines, showed dramatic down-regulation at the early time point.
using a 3â€²-tiling microarray covering all known f. graminearum genes, we carried out genome-wide expression analyses of f. graminearum at two different time points.
moreover, genes associated with transport systems localizing to transmembranes were down-regulated at both time points.
this is the first report of global change in the prominent cellular pathways in the fusarium host containing fgv1-dk <dig>  the significant increase in transcripts for transcription and translation machinery in fungal host cells seems to be related to virus replication.
at the early point of growth of an infected strain as compared to an uninfected strain, genes associated with protein synthesis, including ribosome assembly, nucleolus, and ribosomal rna processing, were significantly up-regulated.
in addition, significant down-regulation of genes required for metabolism and transporting systems in a fungal host containing the virus appears to be related to the host defense mechanism and fungal virulence.
fusarium graminearum virus  <dig> strain-dk <dig>  is a mycovirus that confers hypovirulence to f. graminearum, which is the primary phytopathogenic fungus that causes fusarium head blight  disease in many cereals.
understanding the interaction between mycoviruses and plant pathogenic fungi is necessary for preventing damage caused by f. graminearum.
taken together, our data aid in the understanding of how fgv1-dk <dig> regulates the transcriptional reprogramming of f. graminearum.
in addition, genes required for transcription and signal transduction, including fungal-specific transcription factors and camp signaling, respectively, were actively up-regulated.
