this integrated genomic map describes the first pair of homoeologous chromosomes of an allotetraploid genome in which bac contigs were identified and partially separated through the use of chromosome-specific probes and locus-specific genetic markers.
upland cotton  is the leading fiber crop worldwide.
the approach used in this study should prove useful in the construction of genome-wide physical maps for polyploid plant genomes including upland cotton.
however, developing integrated genomic tools for complex allotetraploid genomes, like that of cotton, is highly experimental.
an integrated genetic and physical map is needed to better characterize quantitative trait loci and to allow for the positional cloning of valuable genes.
a physical map has been developed with  <dig> and  <dig> bac contigs for homeologous chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, covering  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb in physical length.
genetic improvement of fiber quality and yield is facilitated by a variety of genomics tools.
the identification of gene-rich islands in the integrated map provides a platform for positional cloning of important genes and the targeted sequencing of specific genomic regions.
