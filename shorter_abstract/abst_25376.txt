the server implementation takes full advantage of data center's high-performance hardware, where it can be co-localized with centrally-located, 3d dataset repositories, extending access to the researcher community throughout the internet.
the java client components  support arbitrary-angle viewing and run on readily available desktop computers running mac os x, windows xp, or linux as a downloadable java application.
in this article, we describe a network-capable, client-server framework to slice and visualize 3d atlases at off-axis angles, along with an open client architecture and development kit to support integration into complex data analysis environments.
here we describe the basic architecture of a client-server 3d visualization system, consisting of a thin java client built on a development kit, and a computationally robust, high-performance server written in ansi c++.
using the neuroterrain software development kit , sophisticated atlas browsing can be added to any java-compatible application requiring as little as  <dig> lines of java glue code, thus making it eminently re-useable and much more accessible to programmers building more complex, biomedical data analysis tools.
the combination of an optimized server and modular, platform-independent client provides an ideal environment for viewing complex 3d biomedical datasets, taking full advantage of high-performance servers to prepare images and subsets of associated meta-data for viewing, as well as the graphical capabilities in java to actually display the data.
