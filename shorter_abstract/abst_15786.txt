the accurate localization of the qcrs.cpi-3b locus and the development of the markers co-segregating with it should facilitate the incorporation of this large-effect qtl conferring fcr resistance into breeding programs as well as the cloning of the gene underlying the qtl.
this is the first report on fine mapping a qtl conferring fcr resistance in wheat.
fusarium crown rot  is a major cereal disease in semi-arid areas worldwide.

to identify markers that could be reliably used in tagging the qcrs.cpi-3b locus, a nil-derived population consisting of 774 f <dig> lines were generated and exploited to assess markers selected from the existing linkage map and generated from sequences of the 3b pseudomolecule.
this interval contains a total of  <dig> gene-coding sequences based on the 3b pseudomolecule, and six of them were known to encode disease resistance proteins.
several of the genes in this interval were among those responsive to fcr infection detected in an earlier study.
by three rounds of linkage mapping using the nils and the nil-derived population, the qcrs.cpi-3b locus was mapped to an interval of  <dig>  cm covering a physical distance of about  <dig>  mb.
of the various qtl reported, the one on chromosome arm 3bl  has the largest effect that can be consistently detected in different genetic backgrounds.
