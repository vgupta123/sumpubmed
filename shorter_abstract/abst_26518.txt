novel non-mobilizable derivatives of rsf <dig> lacking all known dna sequences involved in the mobilization process and stably maintained at least in e. coli and p. ananatis have been constructed.
design of rsfmob allows easy substitution of placuv <dig> by any desirable promoter for construction of novel derivatives with changed copy number or host range.
mobilization of the obtained rsfmob plasmid was not detected in standard tests.
rsf1010-derived plasmid vectors are widely used in both basic research and industrial applications.
the derivative of rsfmob with increased copy number has been obtained after laci elimination.
high stability of both constructed plasmids has been demonstrated in escherichia coli and pantoea ananatis.
in the latter case, exploiting of mobilizable plasmids or even the plasmids possessing negligible mobilization frequency, but containing dna fragments that could promote conjugal transfer, is undesirable because of biosafety considerations.
novel non-mobilizable derivatives of rsf <dig> lacking all known dna sequences involved in the mobilization process have been obtained due to the exploiting of λred-driven recombination between the plasmid and a constructed in vitro linear dna fragment.
to provide auto-regulated transcription of the essential replication gene, repb, the plasmid loci orit, mobc and moba were substituted by the dna fragment containing placuv5→laci.
