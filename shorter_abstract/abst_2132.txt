these observations support a role for p53-mediated transcriptional program in mammalian aging and suggest that mechanisms other than reactive oxygen species are involved in the age-related transcriptional activation of p <dig> targets.
age-related induction of p53-related genes was observed in multiple tissues, but was not observed in young sod2+/- and gpx4+/- mice, suggesting that oxidative stress does not induce the expression of these genes.
western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels for both p <dig> and gadd45a, two established transcriptional targets of p <dig>  were higher in the older muscle tissue.
expression levels for these proapoptotic genes increased significantly with age , while cr significantly lowered expression levels for these genes as compared to control fed old mice .
caloric restriction  completely or partially reversed 87% of the changes in expression.
