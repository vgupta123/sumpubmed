the transcriptome of arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated organ-specific changes in response to spaceflight, with  <dig> genes showing significant changes in expression in spaceflight plants compared with ground controls by at least  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> by more than 7-fold.
particularly represented across the dataset were genes associated with cell architecture and growth hormone signaling; processes that would not be anticipated to be altered in microgravity yet may correlate with morphological changes observed in spaceflight plants.
the opportunity to examine the strategies of environmental sensing in spaceflight, which includes the absence of unit gravity, provides a unique insight into the balance of influence among abiotic cues directing plant growth and development: including gravity, light, and touch.
as examples, differential expression of genes involved with touch, cell wall remodeling, root hairs, and cell expansion may correlate with spaceflight-associated root skewing, while differential expression of auxin-related and other gravity-signaling genes seemingly correlates with the microgravity of spaceflight.
rather, each organ employed its own response tactics within a shared strategy, largely involving cell wall architecture.
full activation of the international space station as a science platform complete with sophisticated plant growth chambers, laboratory benches, and procedures for effective sample return, has enabled a new level of research capability and hypothesis testing in this unique environment.
leaves, hypocotyls, and roots each displayed unique patterns of response, yet many gene functions within the responses are related.
