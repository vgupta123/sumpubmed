genephony is an online tool for the manipulation of large datasets of genomic information.
researchers increasingly need to handle very large volumes of heterogeneous data, including both the data generated by their own experiments and the data retrieved from publicly available repositories of genomic knowledge.
we describe how genephony can be used to manage large datesets of genomic information, integrating them with existing knowledge repositories.
we show how, thanks to the modular architecture of genephony and its user-friendly interface, this task can be performed in a few simple steps.
its knowledge management engine provides fine-grained control over individual data elements, as well as efficient operations on large datasets.
