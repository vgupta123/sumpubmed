microtubule co-sedimentation assays of truncated versions of mfp revealed that multiple microtubule-binding domains are present on the mfp polypeptide.
real-time imaging of a transiently expressed green fluorescent protein-mfp chimera in living plant cells illustrated that a dynamic, spatial interaction exits between peroxisomes and cortical microtubules as peroxisomes move along actin filaments or oscillate at fixed locations.
the plant peroxisomal multifunctional protein  possesses up to four enzymatic activities that are involved in catalyzing different reactions of fatty acid Î²-oxidation in the peroxisome matrix.
this observation, coupled with apparent interactions that frequently occur between microtubules and peroxisomes in the cell cortex, supports the hypothesis that mfp is concentrated on microtubules in order to facilitate the regulated import of mfp into peroxisomes.
we demonstrate that mfp is an authentic microtubule-binding protein, as it localized to the cortical microtubule array in vivo, in addition to its expected targeting to the peroxisome matrix.
