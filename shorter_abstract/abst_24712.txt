to better understand effects of iron restriction on actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and to identify new potential vaccine targets, we conducted transcript profiling studies using a dna microarray containing all  <dig> orfs of the genome of a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5b strain l <dig>  this is the first study involving the use of microarray technology to monitor the transcriptome of a. pleuropneumoniae grown under iron restriction.
transcript profiling also led to identification of some new iron acquisition systems of a. pleuropneumoniae.
many new potential iron acquisition systems were identified, and further studies will have to be conducted to establish their role during iron restriction.
this strategy enabled us to gain a better understanding of the metabolic changes occurring in response to this stress.
down-regulated genes included many that encode proteins containing fe-s clusters or that use heme as a cofactor.
we have used transcriptional profiling to generate a list of genes showing differential expression during iron restriction.
