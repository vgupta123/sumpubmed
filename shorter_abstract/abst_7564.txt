for  <dig> topics in the testing data set, the overall validity of clusters from the system summary was 10% better than the baseline .
in this paper, we present a clique-clustering method to automatically summarize graphs of semantic predications produced from pubmed citations .
semrep is used to extract semantic predications from the citations returned by a pubmed search.
while compared to the reference standard from mesh headings, the results for recall, precision and f-score were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively.
cliques were identified from frequently occurring predications with highly connected arguments filtered by degree centrality.
the theme labels were also compared to a reference standard produced with major mesh headings.
graph-based notions are increasingly used in biomedical data mining and knowledge discovery tasks.
the validity of the clusters in the summaries produced was compared to the silhouette-generated baseline for cohesion, separation and overall validity.
