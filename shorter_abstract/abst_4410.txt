we estimated the structuring impact of pollination syndromes  on yeast diversity.
the observed total yeast diversity was consistent with former studies, however, the present survey yielded additional basidiomycetous yeasts in unexpectedly high numbers.
there are two conclusions from this study:  a shift of floral visitors towards ornithophily alters the likelihood of yeast inoculation in flowers, and  low concentrated hexose-dominant nectar promotes colonization of flowers by basidiomycetes.
in this study, we linked the frequencies of yeast species in floral nectars from various host plants on the canary islands to nectar traits and flower visitors.
studies on the diversity of yeasts in floral nectar were first carried out in the late 19th century.
our results show these basidiomycetes are significantly associated with ornithophilous flowers.
this challenges the current understanding that nectar is an ecological niche solely occupied by ascomycetous yeasts.
more recently, it became apparent that microorganisms might play an important role in the process of plant pollination.
