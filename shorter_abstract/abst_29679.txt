future experiments will prove whether these structures can serve as "vehicles" for the transport of virulence factors into the host membrane.
furthermore, a comparison of the omv proteomes from two different culture media indicated that the culture conditions have an impact on the protein composition.
outer membrane vesicles  are released from the outer membrane of many gram-negative bacteria.
a comparison with the most abundant outer membrane  proteins revealed that some proteins are enriched in the omv fraction.
outer membrane vesicles released from the om of xcc contain membrane- and virulence-associated proteins.
we have demonstrated that xanthomonas campestris pv.
interestingly, the proteins that are common to both culture conditions are mainly involved in virulence.
the cytolysine from enterotoxic e. coli.
campestris  releases omvs into the culture supernatant during growth.
a proteome study identified  <dig> different proteins that associate with the omv fraction of which half are virulence-associated.
this may be connected to differences in the lps composition between the omvs and the om.
