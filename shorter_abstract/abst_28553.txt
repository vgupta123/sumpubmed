ihi was studied in the motor dominant to non-dominant direction and vice versa while the right or left hand was at rest, performing isometric contraction of the first dorsal interosseous  muscle, and isometric contraction of the fdi muscle in the context of holding a pen.
ihi was reduced bi-directionally without evidence of hemispheric dominance.
the interaction between homologous muscle representations in the right and left primary motor cortex was studied using a paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation  protocol known to evoke interhemispheric inhibition .
further, contraction of the hand contralateral to the conditioning and test pulse yielded similar reductions in ihi.
these data provide evidence for bi-directional reduction of ihi during unimanual contractions.
the timecourse and magnitude of ihi was studied in fifteen healthy right-handed adults at several interstimulus intervals between the conditioning stimulus and test stimulus .
the data suggest that unimanual movement decreases inhibition bi-directionally across motor hemispheres and offer one explanation for the observation of ipsilateral m <dig> activity during hand movements.
