we construct a bipartite graph from the gene ontology  and gene expression data.
the gene-function bigraph integrates molecular function annotations into gene expression data.
the graph describes the relationship between genes and their associated molecular functions.
most selection procedures, however, are not sufficient for accurate inference of underlying biology, because biological significance does not necessarily have to be statistically significant.
selecting a subset of important genes is inevitable to address the challenge.
the proposed method provides an exploratory framework for gene data analysis.
consequently, the importance of gene and molecular function can be simultaneously ranked by a real-valued measure, ksd, which incorporates the global and local structure of the graph.
however, the large number of genes greatly increases the challenges of analyzing, comprehending and interpreting the resulting mass of data.
microarray technology has made it possible to simultaneously monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single experiment.
additional biological knowledge needs to be integrated into the gene selection procedure.
gene selection has been investigated extensively over the last decade.
