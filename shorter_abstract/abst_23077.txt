a novel scoring metric having firm mathematical underpinnings is also proposed that, unlike other recent methods, can score both interactions concurrently and takes into account the reality that multiple regulators can regulate a gene jointly, rather than in an isolated pair-wise manner.
the results show the effectiveness of our approach.
currently, modeling of gene regulations using the bayesian network  formalism assumes that genes interact either instantaneously or with a certain amount of time delay.
experiments are carried out using three different synthetic networks  as well as real life networks of saccharomyces cerevisiae, e. coli and cyanobacteria gene expression data.
understanding gene interactions is a fundamental question in systems biology.
