paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that causes the most prevalent systemic mycosis in latin america.
the data confirm that the pbhsp <dig> gene encodes a morphologically regulated and stress-responsive protein whose function is essential to cell viability of this pathogen.
hsp <dig> is a molecular chaperone that helps in the folding and stabilization of selected polypeptides.
hsp <dig> family members have been shown to present important roles in fungi, especially in the pathogenic species, as an immunodominant antigen and also as a potential antifungal therapeutic target.
the response to heat shock is involved in pathogenesis, as this pathogen switches from mycelium to yeast forms in a temperature dependent fashion that is essential to establish infection.
we have also confirmed its preferential expression in the yeast phase and its overexpression during dimorphic transition and oxidative stress.
this work also enforces the potential of hsp <dig> as a target for antifungal therapies, since the use of hsp <dig> inhibitors is lethal to the p. brasiliensis yeast cells in a dose-responsive manner.
in this work, we decided to further study the pbhsp <dig> gene, its expression and role in cell viability because it plays important roles in fungal physiology and pathogenesis.
