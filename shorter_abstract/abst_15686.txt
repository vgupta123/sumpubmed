we demonstrate that combining these algorithms and adaptively tuning parameters on the training sets makes these algorithms more consistent in their performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive parameter tuner by comparing accuracy across diverse datasets.
the unified interface and the adaptive parameter tuning of aurea provide an effective framework in which to investigate the massive amounts of publically available data by both ‘in silico’ and ‘bench’ scientists.
public databases such as the ncbi gene expression omnibus contain extensive and exponentially increasing amounts of high-throughput data that can be applied to molecular phenotype characterization.
we have integrated several relative expression analysis algorithms and provided a unified interface for their implementation while making data acquisition, parameter fixing, data merging, and results analysis ‘point-and-click’ simple.
these relative expression analysis algorithms hold significant advantages for identifying interpretable molecular signatures for disease classification, and have been implemented previously on a variety of computational platforms with varying degrees of usability.
one family of algorithms that has proven useful for disease classification is based on relative expression analysis and includes the top-scoring pair , k-top-scoring pairs , top-scoring triplet  and differential rank conservation  algorithms.
herein, we describe aurea, an efficient, cohesive, and user-friendly open-source software system that comprises a suite of methods for relative expression analysis.
