monitoring midgut ago <dig>  dcr <dig>  and tsn transcript levels during infection revealed that only tsn transcripts were significantly increased in midguts over blood-fed controls.
aegypti results in transient increases in sinv replication.
we show virus-dependent effects on rnai component transcript and protein levels during infection.
ago <dig> protein levels were depleted immediately following a non-infectious bloodmeal and varied during sinv infection in a virus-dependent manner.
detection of sinv rna-derived small rnas at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection in non-silenced mosquitoes provided important confirmation of rnai pathway activity.
these data define important features of rnai anti-viral defense in ae.
lastly, the rnai response varies in a virus-dependent manner.
aegypti rnai is active during sinv infection as indicated by production of virus-specific sirnas.
sinv   strand rna, infectious virus titers and infection rates transiently increased in mosquitoes following dsrna injection to cognate ago <dig>  dcr <dig>  or tsn mrnas.
we show that silencing rnai components in ae.
aegypti as a model system to determine how the mosquito's anti-viral rnai pathway interacts with recombinant sindbis virus .
rna interference  is an important anti-viral defense mechanism.
