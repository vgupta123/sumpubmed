here we examine the interplay of plasticity and direct genetic control by investigating temperature-size relationships in populations of drosophila pseudoobscura from north america.

however, it is rarely known whether these differences are associated with genetic variation and evolved differences between populations, or are instead simply a plastic response to environmental differences experienced by the populations.
we conclude that local selection on body size appears to be acting counter to the environmental effect of temperature.
we find no evidence that local adaptation in phenotypic plasticity can explain this result, and suggest indirect selection on traits closely linked with body size, or patterns of chromosome inversion may instead be driving this relationship.
we used  <dig> isolines from three populations and exposed them to four temperature regimes  to examine environmental, genetic and genotype-by-environment sources of variance in wing size.
by far the largest contribution to variation in wing size came from rearing temperature, with the largest flies emerging from the coolest temperatures.
