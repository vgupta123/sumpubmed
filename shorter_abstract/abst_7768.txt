the synthetase assays produce only a single reaction product allowing for very precise kinetic assessment of the enzymes.
the nuclease reactions make use of the isolated 2′-5′ oligoadenylates in producing a mixture of shorter reaction products, which are resolved by ion-exchange chromatography to determine the enzyme activities.
the 2-5as bind and activate the rnase l, an endornase degrading viral and cellular rna leading to inhibition of viral replication.
a procedure is described for the production of 2′-5′ oligoadenylates, which are then used as substrates for development and demonstration of enzyme assays measuring synthetase and nuclease activities, respectively.
this paper comprises an assay toolbox for identification and characterization of the synthetases and nucleases regulating cellular 2-5a levels.
we present an assay using datp and the a <dig> tetramer core as substrates, which requires prior isolation of a <dig>  a synthetase assay using either of the dntps individually together with nad+ as substrates is also presented.
the 5′-triphosphorylated, 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylate polyribonucleotides  are central to the interferon-induced antiviral 2-5a system.
the 2-5a system is tightly controlled by synthesis and degradation of 2-5as.

here we present assay tools for identification and characterization of the enzymes regulating cellular 2-5a levels.
the assays can also be used to address a broader cellular role of the oas enzymes, based on the multiple substrate specificity intrinsic to these proteins.
a purified human 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase and a purified human phosphodiesterase  <dig> along with crude extracts expressing those proteins, are used to demonstrate the assays.
