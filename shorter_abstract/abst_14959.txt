using gbs mapping data and phenotypic measurements we show that ari-e.gp maps to a small genetic interval on chromosome 5h and that alternative alleles at a region encompassing vrs <dig> on 2h along with a region on chromosome 3h also influence plant height.
barley cultivars in north-western europe largely contain either of two dwarfing genes; denso on chromosome 3h, a presumed ortholog of the rice green revolution gene ossd <dig>  or breviaristatum-e  on chromosome 5h.
gbs was an effective and relatively low-cost approach to rapidly construct a genetic map of the gpmx population that was suitable for genetic analysis of row type and height traits, allowing us to precisely position ari-e.gp on chromosome 5h.
we found the gbs data more complex to analyse than other data types but it did directly provide linked snp markers for subsequent higher resolution genetic analysis.
we explored use of the gbs to populate the region with sequence contigs from the recently released physically and genetically integrated barley genome sequence assembly as a step towards ari-e gene identification.
