crisprdetect enables more accurate detection of arrays and spacers and its gff output is suitable for inclusion in genome annotation pipelines and visualisation.
the crisprdetect output is integrated with other analysis tools.
crispr arrays consist of repeat sequences separated by specific spacer sequences.
crispr arrays have previously been identified in a large proportion of prokaryotic genomes.
we have developed a new approach to automatically detect, predict and interactively refine crispr arrays.
crisprdetect discovers putative arrays, extends the array by detecting additional variant repeats, corrects the direction of arrays, refines the repeat/spacer boundaries, and annotates different types of sequence variations  in near identical repeats.
it has been used to analyse all complete bacterial and archaeal reference genomes.
however, currently available detection algorithms do not utilise recently discovered features regarding crispr loci.
