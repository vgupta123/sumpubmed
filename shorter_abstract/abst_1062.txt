in which a denatured protein was found to refold to its native state, it has been frequently stated by the protein fold prediction community that all the information required for protein folding lies in the amino acid sequence.
a single main result emerged: in 94% of proteins analyzed, following the sense of translation, from n-terminus to c-terminus, produced better predictions than following the reverse sense of translation, from the c-terminus to n-terminus.
