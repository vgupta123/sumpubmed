xanthophylls are oxygenated carotenoids playing an essential role as structural components of the photosynthetic apparatus.
moreover, by analyzing a series of single, double, triple and quadruple arabidopsis mutants in xanthophyll biosynthesis, we show a hitherto undescribed correlation between xanthophyll levels and the psi-psii ratio.
mutant plants show an even stronger photosensitivity than chy1chy2lut <dig>  a complete lack of qe, the rapidly reversible component of non-photochemical quenching, and a peculiar organization of the pigment binding complexes into thylakoids.
the first step in xanthophyll biosynthesis from α- and β-carotene is the hydroxylation of ε- and β-rings, performed by both non-heme iron oxygenases  and p <dig> cytochromes .
biochemical analysis reveals that the chy1chy2lut2lut <dig> mutant is depleted in lhcb subunits and is specifically affected in photosystem i function, showing a deficiency in psi-lhci supercomplexes.
the physiological and biochemical phenotype of the chy1chy2lut2lut <dig> mutant shows that  lut1/cyp97c <dig> protein reveals a major β-carotene hydroxylase activity in vivo when depleted in its preferred substrate α-carotene;  xanthophylls are needed for normal level of photosystem i and lhcii accumulation.
