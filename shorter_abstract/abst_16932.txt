finally, we demonstrate the clinical/translational utility of the model for building predictors capable of differentiating biological phenotypes as well as for validating those findings in the context of three novel cohorts of patients with hepatitis c.
our proposed model represents an advance in the ability of statistical models of proteomic data to identify and utilize correlation between features.
label-free quantitative proteomics holds a great deal of promise for the future study of both medicine and biology.
we describe a hierarchical model for analyzing unbiased, label-free proteomics data which utilizes the covariance of peptide expression across samples as well as ms/ms-based identifications to group peptidesâ€”a strategy we call metaprotein expression modeling.
there are high levels of correlation between many, but not all, of the peptides derived from the same protein.
however, the data generated is extremely intricate in its correlation structure, and its proper analysis is complex.
our metaprotein model acknowledges the possibility of misidentifications, post-translational modifications and systematic differences between samples due to changes in instrument sensitivity or differences in total protein concentration.
