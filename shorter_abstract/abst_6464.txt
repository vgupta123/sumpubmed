herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of hiv- <dig> gp <dig> proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against hiv- <dig>  we compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of hiv- <dig> vaccines containing either gp <dig> protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary hiv- <dig> isolates in immunized hamsters.
although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine  resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.
the polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to hiv- <dig> subtype b isolates mn and sf <dig> compared to the groups that received one or four gp <dig> proteins.
however, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against hiv- <dig> primary isolates.
interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype cd <dig> reactivity to hiv- <dig> subtypes b, c, and a/e
purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters.
