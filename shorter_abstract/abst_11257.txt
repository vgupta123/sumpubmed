different methods have been used to map species and habitat distributions.
separate predictive sets of site features  and exemplar weights were calibrated for spatial partitions of the study area .
coverage prediction errors were smaller in the unclear partition—where the species was mostly absent—than in the probable presence partition, where coverage ranged from  <dig> to 90%.
in this paper, similarity-based reasoning—a methodological approach that has received less attention—was applied to estimate the distribution and coverage of dasiphora fruticosa for the region in the baltic states where grows the most abundant population of this species.
species coverage for the 750 km <dig> of directly unobserved area was calculated using machine learning in the similarity-based prediction system constud.
the resulting maps depicted the predicted coverage, the certainty of decision when predicting presence or absence, and the mean similarity to the exemplar locations used while predicting.
