the circadian expression of the myogenic regulatory factors , mstn and pnca showed either a positive or a negative correlation with the transcription pattern of the clock genes in both types of muscles.

in the present study, the molecular clock components  and their daily transcription levels were characterized in slow and fast muscles of chinese perch .
to date, there is no report on the characterization of the circadian clock system components of slow muscles in fish.
the expressional pattern differences of the clock genes between the two types of muscle fibers suggest that the clock system may play key roles on muscle type-specific tissue maintenance and function.
among the  <dig> clock genes, nrld <dig> and per <dig> had no daily rhythmicity in slow muscles, and cry2/ <dig> and tim displayed no daily rhythmicity in fast muscles of the adult fish.
with the exception of nr1d <dig> and tim, the other clock genes had an acrophase at the light period in fast muscles.
it was the first report to unravel the molecular clock components of the slow and fast muscles in vertebrates.
clock genes are considered to be the molecular core of biological clock in vertebrates and they are directly involved in the regulation of daily rhythms in vertebrate tissues such as skeletal muscles.
in the slow muscles, the highest expression of the most clock paralogs occurred at the dark period except arntl <dig>  nr1d <dig>  nr1d <dig> and tim.
