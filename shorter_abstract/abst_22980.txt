in the current study, we found that the expression of a myocardin/mkl family member, mkl <dig>  was significantly upregulated during cell cycle arrest induced by a temperature switch in murine podocyte clone  <dig>  cells.
in contrast, mkl <dig> knockdown by rna interference had the opposite effect, highlighting a potential role of mkl <dig> in blocking g1/s transition of the cell cycle in mpc <dig> cells.
additionally, using an rt <dig> profiler pcr array, p <dig> was identified as a direct target of mkl <dig>  we further revealed that mkl <dig> activated p <dig> transcription by recruitment to the carg element in its promoter, thus resulting in cell cycle arrest.
further investigation demonstrated that overexpression of mkl <dig> led to inhibition of cell proliferation by decreasing the number of cells in s phase of the cell cycle.
in addition, the expression of mkl <dig> is positively correlated with that of p <dig> in podocytes in postnatal mouse kidney and significantly upregulated during the morphological switch of podocytes from proliferation to differentiation.
