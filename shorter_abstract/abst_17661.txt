the effects of aging were, to a considerable degree, similar among groups of co-expressed genes.
with respect to gene subsets associated with certain biological processes , cr opposed age-associated expression patterns.
previous analyses of microarray data have identified gene expression responses to cr that are shared among multiple mouse tissues, including the activation of anti-oxidant, tumor suppressor and anti-inflammatory pathways.
age-related gene expression patterns characteristic of most mouse tissues were identified, including up regulation of granulin  and secreted phosphoprotein  <dig> .
expression patterns identified in this analysis characterize a generalized response of mammalian cells to cr and/or aging.
the transcriptional association between cr and aging varied at different levels of analysis.
furthermore, cr is thought to oppose age-associated gene expression patterns, but detailed statistical investigations of this hypothesis have not been carried out.
the association between cr and aging warrants further study, but most evidence indicates that cr does not induce a genome-wide "reversal" of age-associated gene expression patterns.
systemic effects of cr and aging were identified by examining transcriptional responses to cr in  <dig> mouse tissue types, as well as responses to aging in  <dig> tissues.
these analyses have provided useful research directions, but have been restricted to a limited number of tissues, and have focused on individual genes, rather than whole-genome transcriptional networks.
