to ensure adequate vitamin supplementation in pets, vitamin blood concentrations are measured.
the objective of the present study was to collect information about vitamin supplementation in bottlenose dolphins and on vitamin blood concentrations of healthy animals in european facilities.
initially, fish-handling techniques and vitamin supplementation were evaluated by questionnaire, which was sent to  <dig> european facilities that house bottlenose dolphins.
no reference concentrations for free-ranging tursiops truncatus were found.

in addition, these results were compared with blood levels of wild animals.
the blood concentrations were then correlated with vitamin supplementation, fish handling techniques and pre-existing blood concentrations of free-ranging dolphins.
further, the 95 % confidence interval for retinol blood concentrations was  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l and for tocopherol  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg/l.
conclusions on how to provide bottlenose dolphins in human care with an effective vitamin supplementation will then be drawn.
they were analysed for retinol, thiamine pyrophosphate, cobalamin, calcidiol and tocopherol.
regarding thiamine pyrophosphate and cobalamin, concentrations ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/l and  <dig>  and  <dig>  pg/ml respectively.
as fish eaters bottlenose dolphins  in human care need to receive daily vitamin supplementation, because whole thawed fish lacks certain vitamins.
these findings suggest an over-supplementation of retinol  and tocopherol  in bottlenose dolphins  housed in human care.
finally, the data was subjected to a standard analysis of variance techniques  and a linear model analysis.
secondly, blood samples from  <dig> dolphins living in  <dig> facilities were taken and sent by mail to a reference laboratory.
in contrast, calcidiol concentrations  of the dolphins in human care were lower than in blood found for free-ranging animals.
therefore, vitamin a supplementation should not exceed  <dig>  iu per animal per day and vitamin e supplementation should be around 100 iu per kg fed fish per day.
