expression of one of variants bestowed cancer cells with a growth advantage in the presence of tgfβ.
tumors expressing a transforming growth factor-beta type i receptor  mutant with sequence deletions in a nine-alanine  stretch of the signal peptide are reported to be highly associated with disease progression.
experiments using cycloheximde and mg <dig> further confirmed its indispensable role for the protein stability of tβri.
we identified four new transcript variants of tβri in malignant effusion tumor cells and characterized two key elements controlling its protein stability and transcriptional activation.
these results highlight the potential roles of some naturally occurring tβri variants on the promotion of tumor malignancy.
however, little is known about the importance of the remaining part of the signal peptide on the cellular function of tβri.
using serial deletion mutagenesis, we characterized a region encoded by nucleotides 16– <dig> as a key element controlling tβri protein expression.
the effect of dm <dig> was to ablate the apoptotic event induced by tgfβ.
however, variants lacking a region c-terminal to the stretch completely lost their capability to conduct tgfβ-induced transcriptional activation.
intriguingly, dm <dig> and dm <dig>  with a small region truncated in the putative signal peptide of tβri, had a serious defect in their protein expression compared with that of the wild-type receptor.
in contrast, truncation of the 9a-stretch itself or a region downstream to the stretch barely affected tβri expression.
we cloned and identified four new in-frame deletion variants of tβri, designated dm <dig> to dm <dig>  in pleural effusion-derived tumor cells.
intriguingly, expression of dm <dig> in a cell sensitive to tgfβ made it significantly refractory to tgfβ-mediated growth inhibition.
