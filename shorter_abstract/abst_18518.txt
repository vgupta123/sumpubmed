cytokines have essential roles on intercellular communications and are effective in using a variety of intracellular pathways.
the present investigation aimed at developing a flow cytometry technique to study transcription factors in various cellular types such as mixtures of b-cells, t-lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages stimulated in steady state conditions .
in contrast, b-cells and monocytes/macrophages – but, interestingly, not t-lymphocytes  – responded significantly to scd40l by increasing phosphorylated nf-κb.
