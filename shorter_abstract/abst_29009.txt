moreover, a survey across five different hominoid species revealed that all adaptive changes of psmd4-derived regions occurred on branches leading to human and chimp rather than other hominoid lineages.
finally, computational analysis suggests testis-specific transcription of pipsl is regulated by tissue-dependent methylation rather than some transcriptional leakage.
we tackled these problems by analyzing the evolutionary signature in both within-species variation and between species divergence in the sequence and structure of the gene.
usually, this process copies a single parental gene and inserts it into a distant genomic location.
however, retroposition of two adjacent parental genes, i.e.
new genes generated by retroposition are widespread in humans and other mammalian species.
we revealed a significant evolutionary signature: the coding region has significantly lower sequence variation, especially insertions and deletions, suggesting that the human copy may encode a protein.
