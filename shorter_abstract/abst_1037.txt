overexpression of three proteins predicted to be o-glycosylated in various degrees allowed to confirm the presence of mannose α1- <dig> and/or α1- <dig> bonds, but no mannose α1- <dig> bonds, and resulted in an enhanced activity of the culture medium to elicit plant defenses.
o-glycosylated proteins play a role in the elicitation of plant defenses.
botrytis cinerea secretes a high number of proteins that are predicted to have numerous o-glycosylation sites, frequently grouped in highly o-glycosylated regions, and analysis of mutants affected in o-glycosylation has shown, in b. cinerea and in other phytopathogenic fungi, that this process is important for fungal biology and virulence.
overall,  <dig> proteins were identified belonging to a wide diversity of protein families, which possess ser/thr-rich regions  twice as frequently as the whole secretome.
surprisingly, proteins predicted to be highly o-glycosylated tend to be more abundant in the secretomes of the mutants affected in o-glycosylation than in the wild type, possibly because a correct glycosylation of these proteins helps keep them in the cell wall or extracellular matrix.
we report here the purification of glycoproteins from the culture medium, for a wild-type strain of b. cinerea and for three mutants affected in the first step of o-glycosylation, and the identification of components in the purified protein samples.
glycosylation of secretory proteins is very prevalent in b. cinerea and affects members of diverse protein families.
