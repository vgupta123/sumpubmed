near the known binding sites for tata-binding protein  in human gene promoters, we found aggressiveness-related candidate snp markers, including rs <dig> , rs <dig> , and rs <dig> .
among them, genetic factors are believed to be the main parameters that are well-studied at the factual level, but in actuality, genome-wide studies of aggressive behavior appeared relatively recently.
after validation of these candidate markers by clinical protocols, these snps may become useful for physicians  and for the general population .
snps can be associated with hereditary diseases, their complications, comorbidities, and responses to stress or a drug.
clinical comparisons between cohorts of patients and healthy volunteers  allow for identifying snps whose allele frequencies significantly separate them from one another as markers of the above conditions.
computer-based preliminary analysis of millions of snps detected by the  <dig> genomes project can accelerate clinical search for snp markers due to preliminary whole-genome search for the most meaningful candidate snp markers and discarding of neutral and poorly substantiated snps.
aggressive behavior depends on many parameters such as age, gender, diseases and treatment, diet, and environmental conditions.
