our linear regression analyses on the nucleotide compositions of the non-coding regions and the synonymous third codon position of coding regions, between pairs of replication origins, reveal the existence of significant adenine to guanine deamination gradients in portions overlapping the small single copy  and the large single copy  regions between inverted repeats.
single-stranded regions of the genome and gradients in time that these regions are left single-stranded, as revealed by our nucleotide composition analyses, appear to converge with the original bi-directional dual displacement loop model and restore evidence for its existence as the primary mechanism.
other proposed faster modes such as homologous recombination and rolling circle initiation could exist in addition to this primary mechanism to facilitate homoplasmy among the intra-cellular chloroplast population
electron microscopy analyses of replicating chloroplast molecules earlier predicted bidirectional cairns replication as the prevalent mechanism, perhaps followed by rounds of a rolling circle mechanism.
we address this issue in our current study by analyzing nucleotide composition in genome regions between known replication origins, with an aim to reveal any adenine to guanine deamination gradients.
this standard model is being challenged by the recent proposition of homologous recombination-mediated replication in chloroplasts.
