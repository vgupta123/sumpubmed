many measures and methods have been proposed and implemented to evaluate segmentation methods.
further, the se and 95% confidence interval  of ter are computed based on the se of mer that is calculated using the bootstrap method.

the ter is fully supported by the pairwise comparisons of mers using  <dig> manually segmented ground-truth cells with different sizes and seven cis algorithms taken from imagej.
cell image segmentation  is an essential part of quantitative imaging of biological cells.
however, computing the standard errors  of the measures and their correlation coefficient is not described, and thus the statistical significance of performance differences between cis algorithms cannot be assessed.
the ses of ters and their correlation coefficient can be employed to conduct the hypothesis testing, while the cis overlap, to determine the statistical significance of the performance differences between cis algorithms.
an algorithm for computing the correlation coefficient of ters between two cis algorithms is also provided.
the ter’s ses and correlation coefficient are computed.
designing a performance measure and conducting significance testing are critical for evaluating and comparing the cis algorithms for image-based cell assays in cytometry.
hence, the 95% ci error bars can be used to classify cis algorithms.
we propose the total error rate , a novel performance measure for segmenting all cells in the supervised evaluation.
the ter statistically aggregates all misclassification error rates  by taking cell sizes as weights.
thereafter, cis algorithms can be evaluated and compared statistically by conducting the significance testing.
