in this study, dna sequences of four plastid loci  were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of dryopteris.
the disagreement between the previous taxonomy and molecular results in dryopteris may be due partly to interspecific hybridization and polyplodization.
most species of these genera share a short rhizome and catadromic arrangement of frond segments, unlike the sister genus of dryopteris s.l., arachniodes, which has anadromic arrangement of frond segments.
the  <dig> well-supported clades identified based on our data represent  <dig> major evolutionary lineages in dryopteris that are also supported by morphological synapomophies.
the infrageneric phylogeny has largely remained unclear, and the placement of the majority of the supraspecific taxa of dryopteris has never been tested using molecular data.
more morphological studies and molecular data, especially from the nuclear genome, are needed to thoroughly elucidate the evolutionary history of dryopteris.
in contrast, monophyly of the four subgenera and  <dig> out of  <dig> sections currently recognized in dryopteris s.s is not supported by plastid data.
the non-monophyly of the  <dig> out of the  <dig> supraspecific taxa  in dryopteris strongly suggests that the current taxonomy of this genus is in need of revision.
each of the  <dig> clades is additionally supported by morphological synapomophies and is inferred to represent a major evolutionary lineage in dryopteris.
all four subgenera and  <dig> sections currently recognized in dryopteris s.s. are included.
our study confirms the paraphyly of dryopteris and provides the first strong molecular evidence on the monophyly of acrophorus, diacalpe, dryopsis, nothoperanema, and peranema.
