idiopathic epilepsy is a common neurological disease in human and domestic dogs but relatively few risk genes have been identified to date.
we have recently identified a risk locus for idiopathic epilepsy in the belgian shepherd breed on a  <dig>  megabase region on cfa <dig>
these results implicate adam <dig> in common canine idiopathic epilepsy, although the causative variant remains yet to be identified.
the seizure characteristics, including focal and generalised seizures, are similar between the two species, with gene discovery facilitated by the reduced genetic heterogeneity of purebred dogs.
we have expanded a previous study replicating the association with a combined analysis of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls in three additional breeds: schipperke, finnish spitz and beagle .
risk haplotype was present in frequencies of  <dig> – <dig>  in the breeds, suggesting that adam <dig> is a low penetrance risk gene for canine epilepsy.
twenty-seven variants were validated in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls from four breeds, resulting in a strong replication of the adam <dig> locus  and the identification of a common 28 kb-risk haplotype in all four breeds.
