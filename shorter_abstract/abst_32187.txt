furthermore, all current methods require bioinformatic skills.
in the latter case the original publication involved extensive filtering of snps, which could not be repeated using snptree.

the server was evaluated using four published bacterial wgs data sets .
in epidemiological studies, outbreak isolates have very little diversity and require extensive genomic analysis to differentiate and classify isolates.
currently, there are different tools and methods to identify snps including various options and cut-off values.
wgs data in fastq format are aligned to reference genomes by bwa while contigs in fasta format are processed by nucmer.
the evalution results for the first three cases was consistent and concordant for both raw reads and assembled genomes.
snps are concatenated based on position on reference genome and a tree is constructed from concatenated snps using fasttree and a perl script.
here we introduce snptree, a server for online-automatic snps analysis.
the snptree server is an easy to use option for rapid standardised and automatic snp analysis in epidemiological studies also for users with limited bioinformatic experience.
the advances and decreasing economical cost of whole genome sequencing , will soon make this technology available for routine infectious disease epidemiology.
thus, we lack a standard and simple automatic tool to determine snps and construct phylogenetic tree from wgs data.
