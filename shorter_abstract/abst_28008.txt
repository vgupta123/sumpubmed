in retrospect, the results show that, unlike a single drug, a properly chosen combination of drugs can lead to a significant difference in the responses of different cell types, increasing the differential targeting of certain combinations.
this approach can facilitate development of systems biology and optimal drug combination therapies for cancer and other diseases and for understanding key interactions within the cellular network upon treatment with multiple signals.
our results demonstrate how mathematical learning algorithms can enable systematic characterization of multi-signal induced biological activities.
many of the signaling interactions identified were consistent with the literature, and other unknown interactions emerged.
moreover, the approach enables examining the efficacy of all lower order mixtures of the tested signals.
