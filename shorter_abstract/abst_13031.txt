however, little is known about as patterns in wood-forming tissues and how much as variation exists within plant populations.
differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that 7% and 13% of as events showed significant differences between individuals within geographically separated southern and northern populations, a level that is in general agreement with as variation in human populations.
here we used high-throughput rna sequencing to analyze the populus trichocarpa  xylem transcriptome in  <dig> individuals from different populations across much of its range in western north america.
deep transcriptome sequencing and mapping of reads to the p. trichocarpa reference genome identified a suite of xylem-expressed genes common to all accessions.
our analysis suggests that at least 36% of the xylem-expressed genes in p. trichocarpa are alternatively spliced.
this genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing reveals high levels of as in p. trichocarpa and extensive inter-individual as variation.
we provide the most comprehensive analysis of as in p. trichocarpa to date, which will serve as a valuable resource for the plant community to study transcriptome complexity and as regulation during wood formation.
extensive as was observed in cell-wall biosynthesis related genes such as glycosyl transferases and c2h <dig> transcription factors.
