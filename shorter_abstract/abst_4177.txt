on a large data set comprising  <dig> sequences of tm proteins with known topologies and  <dig> globular protein sequences it correctly predicts  <dig> % of all topologies.
transmembrane  proteins are proteins that span a biological membrane one or more times.
a novel tm consensus method, named metatm, is proposed in this work.
the prediction quality can be improved by applying a consensus approach, which combines results of several predictors to yield a more reliable result.
metatm is based on support vector machine models and combines the results of six tm topology predictors and two signal peptide predictors.
as their 3-d structures are hard to determine, experiments focus on identifying their topology , but only a few topologies are known.
consequently, various computational tm topology predictors have been developed, but their accuracies are far from perfect.
