by including differentially weighted amino acids, evolutionary information and by calibrating the scoring, an accuracy of  <dig> % was achieved, with 91% sensitivity and  <dig> % positive predictive value , using a rigorous cross-validation procedure.
despite recent publications describing reasonable levels of accuracy for discriminating between bbtm proteins and other proteins, screening of entire genomes remains troublesome as these molecules only constitute a small fraction of the sequences screened.
therefore, novel methods are still required capable of detecting new families of bbtm protein in diverse genomes.
we present tmb-hunt, a program that uses a k-nearest neighbour  algorithm to discriminate between bbtm and non-bbtm proteins on the basis of their amino acid composition.
because the program uses a distinct approach to that of other discriminators and thus suffers different liabilities, we believe it will make a significant contribution to the development of a consensus approach for bbtm protein detection.
results were significantly enhanced by use of evolutionary information and a system for calibrating k-nn scoring.
beta-barrel transmembrane  proteins are a functionally important and diverse group of proteins expressed in the outer membranes of bacteria , mitochondria and chloroplasts.
a major advantage of this approach is that because it does not rely on beta-strand detection, it does not require resolved structures and thus larger, more representative, training sets could be used.
