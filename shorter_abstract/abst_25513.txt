the software provides expandable functionality as platform software supporting module development using popular script languages such as vbscript and jscript in the software programming environment.
the software is available for free download at http://www.visualgenedeveloper.net.
in order to facilitate gene optimization, we have developed a stand-alone software called visual gene developer.
visual gene developer is useful for both researchers who want to quickly analyze and optimize genes, and those who are interested in developing and testing new algorithms in bioinformatics.
the software allows a user to analyze and optimize a sequence using main menu functions or specialized module windows.
the software not only provides general functions for gene analysis and optimization along with an interactive user-friendly interface, but also includes unique features such as programming capability, dedicated mrna secondary structure prediction, artificial neural network modeling, network & multi-threaded computing, and user-accessible programming modules.
alternatively, gene optimization can be initiated by designing a gene construct and configuring an optimization strategy.
