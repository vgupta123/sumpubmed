the web-based integration of clinical, ngs, and imaging data represents a valuable resource for clinical researchers and future application in medical oncology.
it features a genome browser as well as access to several instances of the bioimage management application bisque.
moreover, technological advances in next-generation sequencing  as well as the development of devices for scanning whole-slide bioimages from tissue sections and image analysis software for quantitation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes  allow, for the first time, the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies that target patient specific mutations.
the underlying database is based on a data warehouse schema, which is used to integrate information from different sources.
cancer treatment platforms have demonstrated profound tumor regressions including complete cure in patients with metastatic cancer.
pos stores clinical data, genomic data , and scanned whole-slide images.
cancer immunotherapy has recently entered a remarkable renaissance phase with the approval of several agents for treatment.
we have developed a bioinformatics platform – personalized oncology suite  – that integrates clinical data, ngs data and whole-slide bioimages from tissue sections.
pos can be used not only in the context of cancer immunology but also in other studies in which ngs data and images of tissue sections are generated.
