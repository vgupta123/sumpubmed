the model was calibrated and validated using experimental data collected from ovcar <dig>  an immortalized ovarian cancer cell line.
in contrast, igfbps can likely reach these levels, suggesting that igfbps are the more critical regulator of igf1r network activity.
the igf system is complex, with two ligands , two receptors , and at least six high affinity igf-binding proteins  that regulate igf ligand bioavailability.
while the individual components of the igf system are well studied, the question of how these different components integrate as a system to regulate cell behavior is less clear.
this analysis suggested that igf2r levels would need to be 320-fold greater than igf1r in order to decrease pigf1r by 25Â %, while igfbp levels would need to be 390-fold greater.
to analyze the relative importance of different mechanisms that control igf network activity, we developed a mass-action kinetic model incorporating cell surface binding, phosphorylation, and intracellular trafficking events.
using a mass-action kinetic model, we determined that igf2r plays a minor role in regulating the activity of igf1r under a variety of conditions and that due to their high expression levels, igfbps are the dominant mechanism to regulating igf network activation.
we then performed model analysis to examine the ability of igf2r or igfbps to counteract phosphorylation of igf1r, a critical step for igf network activation.
analysis of the cancer genome atlas  data set suggested that this level of overexpression is unlikely for igf2r in ovarian, breast, and colon cancer.
