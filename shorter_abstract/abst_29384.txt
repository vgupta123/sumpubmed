our results suggest that the phylogeographic pattern of p. marmoratus is shaped by the geological history of mediterranean and adjacent seas, restricted current gene flow among different marginal seas, and incomplete lineage sorting.
here, we perform the so far broadest phylogeographic analysis of the crab pachygrapsus marmoratus, common across the north-eastern atlantic ocean, mediterranean and black seas.
the extent of genetic structure of a species is determined by the amount of current gene flow and the impact of historical and demographic factors.
surprisingly, hierarchical amova and principal coordinates analysis agree that our canary islands population is closer to western mediterranean populations than to mainland portugal and azores populations.
most marine invertebrates have planktonic larvae and consequently wide potential dispersal, so that genetic uniformity should be common.
in the mediterranean sea and adjoining areas, the best known barriers are the atlantic-mediterranean transition, the siculo-tunisian strait and the boundary between aegean and black seas.
previous studies revealed no or weak genetic structuring at meso-geographic scale based on mtdna, while genetic heterogeneity at local scale was recorded with microsatellites, even if without clear geographic patterns.
this enlarged dataset provides new evidence of three genetically separable groups, corresponding to the portuguese atlantic ocean, mediterranean sea plus canary islands, and black sea.
within the mediterranean sea, we record genetic homogeneity, suggesting that population connectivity is unaffected by the transition between the western and eastern mediterranean.

phylogeographic patterns commonly coincide with geographic transitions acting as barriers to gene flow.
however, they also caution from exclusively testing well-known biogeographic barriers, thereby neglecting other possible phylogeographic patterns.
the mediterranean metapopulation seems to have experienced a relatively recent expansion around  <dig>  years ago.
