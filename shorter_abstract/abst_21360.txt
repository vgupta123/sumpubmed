genes in an operon are often alternatively and dynamically transcribed under different conditions, and a large portion of genes and intergenic regions have antisense rna  and non-coding rna  transcripts, respectively.
we found that  <dig>  ~  <dig> % of expressed operons were utilized in their putative alternative forms,  <dig>  ~  <dig> % genes had putative asrna transcripts and  <dig>  ~  <dig> % intergenic regions had putative ncrna transcripts under different culture conditions and growth phases.
to fill these gaps, we have profiled the transcriptomes of e. coli k <dig> under different culture conditions and growth phases using a highly specific directional rna-seq technique that can capture various types of transcripts in the bacterial cells, combined with a highly accurate and robust algorithm and tool truhmm  for assembling full length transcripts.
truhmm is a highly accurate and robust algorithm for assembling full-length transcripts in prokaryotes using directional rna-seq short reads.
as has been demonstrated in many other prokaryotes, e. coli k <dig> also has a highly complex and dynamic transcriptomes under different culture conditions and growth phases.
such complex and dynamic transcriptomes might play important roles in the physiology of the bacterium.
furthermore, although rna-seq becomes the major method for analyzing the complexity of prokaryotic transcriptome, it is still a challenging task to accurately assemble full length transcripts using short rna-seq reads.
