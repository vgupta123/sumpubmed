the airsr mutant exhibited reduced autolysis rates and reduced viability in the presence of vancomycin.
vancomycin has been the medication of last resort to cure infections caused by staphylococcus aureus since the increase in the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus .
the results indicated that more than  <dig> genes that are related to cell wall metabolism were down-regulated in the airsr mutant.
airsr acts as a positive regulator in cell wall biosynthesis and turnover in staphylococcus aureus nctc <dig>
real-time reverse transcription pcr and dna mobility shift assays verified that airr can directly bind to and regulate genes that function in cell wall metabolism  and autolysis .
we deleted the airsr tcs in s. aureus nctc <dig> and compared the resultant transcript levels with those of its parent strain using microarray analysis.
