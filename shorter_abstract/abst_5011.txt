mass spectrometry  coupled with online separation methods is commonly applied for differential and quantitative profiling of biological samples in metabolomic as well as proteomic research.
an ongoing challenge of these molecular profiling approaches, however, is the development of better data processing methods.
newly introduced functionality includes the identification of peaks using online databases, msn data support, improved isotope pattern support, scatter plot visualization, and a new method for peak list alignment based on the random sample consensus  algorithm.
such approaches are used for systems biology, functional genomics, and biomarker discovery, among others.
the performance of the ransac alignment was evaluated using synthetic datasets as well as actual experimental data, and the results were compared to those obtained using other alignment algorithms.
the current version of mzmine  <dig> is suitable for processing large batches of data and has been applied to both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses.
a key concept of the mzmine  <dig> software design is the strict separation of core functionality and data processing modules, with emphasis on easy usability and support for high-resolution spectra processing.
