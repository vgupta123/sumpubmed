in the three-chamber social interaction test, the 5-ht2b/2c agonist mcpp decreased sociability and sniffing in sert wildtype  mice, both indicative of the well-documented anxiogenic effect of mcpp.
this 5-ht2c-mediated response was absent in sert -/- mice.
likewise, in the open field test, the selective 5-ht2c agonist ro 60- <dig> induced an anxiogenic response in sert +/+ mice, but not in sert -/- mice.
since 5-ht2cr pre-mrna is adenosine-to-inosine  edited, we also evaluated the 5-ht2cr rna editing profiles of sert +/+ and sert -/- mice in amygdala.
these results indicate that the 5-ht2cr in the amygdala of sert -/- mice has increased rna editing, which could explain, at least in part, the decreased behavioral responses to 5-ht2c agonists in sert -/- mice.
compared to sert +/+ mice, sert-/- mice showed a decrease in less edited, highly functional 5-ht2c isoforms, and an increase in more edited isoforms with reduced signaling efficiency.
these alterations in 5-ht2cr in amygdala may be relevant to humans with sert polymorphisms that alter sert expression, function, and emotional behaviors.
