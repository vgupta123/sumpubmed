in polarized cells, they show distinct localizations: hcp <dig> and dmt1a-i are located in the apical membrane, whereas hrg- <dig> is located in the basolateral membrane and lysosome.
hcp <dig> and dmt1a-i are localized to the apical membrane, and hrg- <dig> to the basolateral membrane and lysosome.
these localization studies support a model in which cytosolic heme can be degraded by hos, and the resulting iron is exported into tissue fluids via the iron transporter ferroportin  <dig>  which is expressed in the basolateral membrane in enterocytes or in the plasma membrane in macrophages.
heme incorporated into cells is degraded by heme oxygenases , and the iron product is reutilized by the body.
to specify the processes of heme uptake and degradation, and the reutilization of iron, we determined the subcellular localizations of these transporters and hos.
in this study, we analyzed the subcellular localizations of  <dig> isoenzymes of hos,  <dig> isoforms of divalent metal transporter  <dig> , and  <dig> candidate heme transporters--heme carrier protein  <dig>  and heme responsive gene- <dig> --in non-polarized and polarized cells.
in non-polarized cells, hcp <dig>  hrg- <dig>  and dmt1a-i are located in the plasma membrane.
16leu at dmt1a-i n-terminal cytosolic domain was found to be crucial for plasma membrane localization.
