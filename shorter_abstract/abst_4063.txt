demonstrating practical applicability, we employed the software in a real-time experiment, performing segmentation of glomeruli - the functional units of the honeybee antennal lobe - and visualisation of glomerular activity patterns.
previously, extraction of odour response patterns from calcium imaging movies was performed offline, after the experiment.
we developed software to extract and to visualise odour response patterns in real time.
real-time visualisation of odour response patterns expands the experimental repertoire targeted at understanding information processing in the honeybee antennal lobe.
evaluation on reference data showed results comparable to those obtained by previous offline methods while computation time was significantly lower.
calcium imaging in insects reveals the neural response to odours, both at the receptor level on the antenna and in the antennal lobe, the first stage of olfactory information processing in the brain.
we applied our software to calcium imaging data recorded from the antennal lobe of the honeybee apis mellifera and from the antenna of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster.
apart from supporting neurobiology, the software allows for utilising the insect antenna as a chemosensor, e.g.
