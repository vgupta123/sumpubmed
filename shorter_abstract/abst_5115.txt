we show that kissplice enables to identify more correct events than general purpose transcriptome assemblers.
based on the fundamental idea that each polymorphism corresponds to a recognisable pattern in a de bruijn graph constructed from the rna-seq reads, we propose a general model for all polymorphisms in such graphs.
in this paper, we address the problem of identifying and quantifying polymorphisms in rna-seq data when no reference genome is available, without assembling the full transcripts.
additionally, on a  <dig> m reads dataset from human brain and liver tissues, kissplice identified  <dig> alternative splicing events, out of which 56% are not present in the annotations, which confirms recent estimates showing that the complexity of alternative splicing has been largely underestimated so far.
this opens the way to a new kind of studies on large hts rna-seq datasets, where the focus is not the global reconstruction of full-length transcripts, but local assembly of polymorphic regions.
we propose new models and algorithms for the detection of polymorphism in rna-seq data.
