tomato dc <dig>  complementation with the wild type cara gene was able to restore growth to wild-type levels in minimal medium.
our data show that cara plays an important role in providing arginine and uracil for growth of the bacteria and also influences other factors that are potentially important for growth and survival during infection.
Δcara also exhibited reduced motility and increased biofilm formation, whereas disruption of p <dig> had no impact on motility or biofilm formation.

when tested for pathogenicity, Δcara showed reduced fitness in tomato as well as arabidopsis when compared to the wild-type strain.
additionally, our data suggests that pyrimidines may be limited in the apoplastic space of the plant host tomato.
the aim of this study was to investigate the function of the cara gene and the small rna p <dig>  and characterize the regulation of these transcripts.
disruption of the cara gene  which encodes the predicted small chain of carbamoylphosphate synthetase, resulted in arginine and pyrimidine auxotrophy in pseudomonas syringae pv.
