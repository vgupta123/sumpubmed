courtship tactics were conditional on body size, local mate density and habitat, likely associated with changing trade-offs between potential mating opportunities and intra-sexual competition.
here, we document a previously unreported school-courtship tactic; where territorial males court multiple females in mid-water schools, which appears to culminate in a unique ‘school-spawning’ tactic.

as previously reported for this species, territorial males engage in pair-courtship, which is associated with a pair-spawning tactic.
counter-intuitively, the aggregation showed a habitat-specific inverse size-assortment: large males courted small females on the reef slope while small males courted equal-sized or larger females on the shelf.
at high densities, terrestrial and marine species often employ alternate reproductive tactics  to maximize reproductive benefits.
we describe arts in a high-density and unfished spawning aggregation of the squaretail grouper  in lakshadweep, india.
