the differential expression of these genes in base challenged animals at  <dig>  and 24 months following challenge, vs unchallenged controls, was investigated by real time pcr.
the present work examined the effects of base on gene expression in circulating immune cells.
within the immune function pathway, the most affected genes were related to the t cell receptor-mediated t cell activation pathways.
the results of this study show that the effects of prion diseases are not limited to the cns, but involve the immune system and particularly t cell signalling during the early stage following challenge, before the appearance of clinical signs.
