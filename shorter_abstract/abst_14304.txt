we established the evolutionary history of the plant prc <dig> subunits , enabled by sensitive phylogenetic methods and newly sequenced plant genomes from previously unsampled taxonomic groups.
polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  is an essential protein complex for plant development.
prc <dig> existed in the last common ancestor of seed plants where it likely played an important regulatory role, aiding their radiation.
it catalyzes ubiquitination of histone h2a that is an important part of the transcription repression machinery.
moreover, we showed that most prc <dig> subunits underwent a complex, duplication-rich history that differs significantly between brassicaceae and other eudicots.
many aspects of the plant prc <dig> are elusive, including its origin and phylogenetic distribution.
