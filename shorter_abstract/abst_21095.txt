the dominance theorem, conceived and proven in this paper, provides support for the concepts of niche succession and monoclonal conversion in intestinal crypts as bottom-up relations, while crypt fission is postulated to be a top-down principle.
multilevelness is a defining characteristic of complex systems.
to this end we provide a definition for stemness, which is the propensity of a cell lineage to contribute to a tissue fate.
what we are seeking here is a conceptual framework to demonstrate how the "fate" of intestinal crypts is an emergent property that inherently arises from the complex yet robust underlying biology of stem cells.
for example, in the intestinal tissue the epithelial lining is organized into crypts that are maintained by a niche of stem cells.
we furthermore show that the only logically feasible relationship between the stemness of cell lineages and the emergent fate of their tissue, which satisfies the given criteria, is one of dominance from a particular lineage.
we establish a conceptual framework in which to formalize cross-level principles in the context of tissue organization.
we do not consider stemness a property of a cell but link it to the process in which a cell lineage contributes towards tissue function.
