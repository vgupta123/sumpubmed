experiments on two bacteria and four human datasets shows the advantage of base in both contig quality and speed in dealing with longer reads.
regarding speed, base is consistently a few times faster than spades and sga, but still slower than soapdenovo <dig>  base and soapdenov <dig> are further compared using human datasets with read length 100 bp, 150 bp and 250 bp.
in the experiment on bacteria, two datasets with read length of 100 bp and 250 bp were used.. especially for the 250 bp dataset, base gives much better quality than soapdenovo <dig> and sga and is simlilar to spades.
de novo genome assembly using ngs data remains a computation-intensive task especially for large genomes.
it enhances the classic seed-extension approach by indexing the reads efficiently to generate adaptive seeds that have high probability to appear uniquely in the genome.
in practice, efficiency is often a primary concern and favors using a more efficient assembler like soapdenovo <dig>  yet soapdenovo <dig>  based on de bruijn graph, fails to take full advantage of longer ngs reads .
such seeds form the basis for base to build extension trees and then to use reverse validation to remove the branches based on read coverage and paired-end information, resulting in high-quality consensus sequences of reads sharing the seeds.
