the recombinant proteins sbm and rgd-sbm were cloned, expressed, purified and tested in in vitro assays.
the evaluation of cell attachment, spreading and proliferation on the dextrin-based hydrogel surface activated with recombinant proteins were performed using mouse embryo fibroblasts 3t <dig>  a polystyrene cell culture plate was used as control.
the rgd sequence, present in several proteins from the extra-cellular matrix , is a ligand for integrin-mediated cell adhesion; this sequence was recognized as a major functional group responsible for cellular adhesion.
in this work a bi-functional recombinant protein, containing a starch binding module  and rgd sequence was used to functionalize a dextrin-based hydrogel.
ts- <dig>  has starch  affinity, acting as a binding molecule to adsorb the rgd sequence to the hydrogel surface.
many proteins in nature that hold a rgd sequence are not cell adhesive, probably due to the conformation/accessibility of the peptide.
the results showed that the rgd-sbm recombinant protein improved, by more than 30%, the adhesion of fibroblasts to dextrin-based hydrogel.
the sbm, which belongs to an Î±-amylase from bacillus sp.
in fact, cell spreading on the hydrogel surface was observed only in the presence of the rgd-sbm.
several approaches can be used to functionalize biomaterials, such as hydrogels, for biomedical applications.
