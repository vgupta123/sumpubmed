b. napus  is an important source of edible vegetable oil, and its nutritional and economic value is determined by its fatty acid composition and content.
using the brassica 60Â k snp array, we performed a genome-wide association study of fatty acid composition in a population of  <dig> genetically diverse oilseed accessions.
<dig>  we identified  <dig> genomic regions that were significantly associated with the composition of seven fatty acids, and five consensus regions that mapped to the a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> chromosomes, respectively, of the brassica napus darmor-bzh genome.
we then identified  <dig> orthologs of the functional candidate genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, excluding bnaa.fae <dig> and bnac.fae <dig> on the a <dig> and c <dig> homologous genome blocks, which are known to have critical roles in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, and potential orthologs of these genes .
our results demonstrate the power of association mapping in identifying genes of interest in b. napus and provide insight into the genetic basis of fatty acid biosynthesis in b. napus.
furthermore, our findings may facilitate marker-based breeding efforts aimed at improving fatty acid composition and quality in b. napus.
