immature neurons expressing doublecortin  exist around cortical layer ii in various mammals, including adult guinea pigs and humans.
the density of dcx + neurons was significantly reduced around cortical layer ii, svz and sgz in pb-treated animals surviving  <dig> and 6 months relative to controls.
bromodeoxyuridine  pulse-chasing studies failed to find cellular colocalization of this dna synthesis indicator in dcx + cells around layer ii in pb-treated and control animals.
chronic pb exposure can lead to significant reduction in the number of the immature neurons around cortical layer ii and in the conventional neurogenic sites in young adult guinea pigs.
no direct evidence could be identified to link the reduced cortical dcx expression with alteration in local neurogenesis or neuronal death.
using young adult guinea pigs as an experimental model, the present study explored if chronic pb exposure affects cortical dcx + immature neurons and those around the subventricular and subgranular zones .
chronic lead  poisoning remains an environmental risk especially for the pediatric population, and it may affect brain development.
these cortical immature neurons were not found to coexist with active caspase- <dig> or fluoro-jade c labeling.
blood pb levels in these animals reached  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/dl at the above time points, respectively, relative to ~3 μg/dl in vehicle controls.
