apart from the innate immune response, many physiological mechanisms and pathways are reported to be involved in the chicken host response to salmonella infection.
diverse chicken lines differing in susceptibility to salmonella infection were challenged with different salmonella serovars at several time points.
functional biological analysis of these differentially expressed gene lists revealed several common mechanisms for the chicken host response to salmonella infection.
various tissues were sampled at different time points post-infection, and resulting host transcriptional differences investigated using different microarray platforms.
chicken meat and eggs can be a source of human zoonotic pathogens, especially salmonella species.
these food items contain a potential hazard for humans.
chickens lines differ in susceptibility for salmonella and can harbor salmonella pathogens without showing clinical signs of illness.
the meta-analysis combination of heterogeneous expression profiling data provided useful insights into the common metabolic pathways and functions of different chicken lines infected with different salmonella serovars.
these gene lists showed many similarities for different chicken breeds and tissues, and also for different salmonella serovars measured at different times post infection.
the objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of diverse experiments to identify general and host specific mechanisms to the salmonella challenge.
