we first constructed a dual input circuit converting different light intensities into varying of the sensitivity of the promoter to a chemical inducer .
this circuit allowed us to use different combinations of blue light and the two chemical inducers to generate gradual output values over two orders of magnitude.
overall, in this study, we devise genetic circuits sensing and processing light and chemical inducers.
here, in hek  <dig> cells, we present combinatory genetic circuits responding to light and chemical signals, simultaneously.
next, we generated a ternary input circuit, which responded to light, doxycycline and cumate.
multi-signal processing circuits are essential for rational design of sophisticated synthetic systems with good controllability and modularity, therefore, enable construction of high-level networks.
moreover, light-inducible systems provide fast and reversible means for spatiotemporal control of gene expression.
