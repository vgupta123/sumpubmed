the genome sequences of o. niloticus, p. nyererei, h. burtoni, n. brichardi and m. zebra were analyzed by exhaustive tblastn searches with a set of published taar gene sequences used as positive bait.
the resulting cichlid repertoire contained  <dig> complete taar genes from o. niloticus,  <dig> from p. nyererei,  <dig> from h. burtoni,  <dig> from n. brichardi and  <dig> from m. zebra, plus a number of pseudogenes, edge genes and fragments.
like all other taars identified to date, cichlid taars have a characteristic two-dimensional structure and contain a number of amino-acid motifs or amino acids, such cysteine, in particular conserved positions.
a large proportion of these sequences  consisted of two coding exons, separated in all but two cases by an intron in the interloop  <dig> coding sequence.
we used the recent broad institute release of the genome sequences of five representative fishes of the cichlid family to establish the complete taar repertoires of these species and to compare them with five other fish taar repertoires.
taars  are among the principal receptors expressed by the olfactory epithelium.
