these procedures also work for multiclass classification.
selection of influential genes with microarray data often faces the difficulties of a large number of genes and a relatively small group of subjects.
we demonstrate this algorithm on acute leukemia, colon cancer, small, round blue cell tumors of childhood, breast cancer, and lung cancer studies, using kernel fisher discriminant analysis and support vector machines as classifiers.
a novel approach to gene selection is proposed based on kernel similarities and kernel weights.
we do not assume uniformity for subject contribution.
weights are calculated via regularized least squares support vector regression  of class levels on kernel similarities and are used to weight subject contribution.
the cumulative sum of weighted expression levels are next ranked to select responsible genes.
this equal-contribution assumption cannot account for the possible dependence among subjects who associate similarly to the disease, and may restrict the selection of influential genes.
this approach is easy to implement and fast in computation for both binary and multiclass problems.
in addition to the curse of dimensionality, many gene selection methods weight the contribution from each individual subject equally.
