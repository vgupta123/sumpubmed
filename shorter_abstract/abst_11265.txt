using an fpga accelerator, an overall speedup of up to  <dig> has been demonstrated on a large data set when compared to a  <dig>  ghz core <dig> processor.
prior msa acceleration attempts with reconfigurable computing have only addressed the first stage of progressive alignment and consequently exhibit performance limitations according to amdahl's law.
this work is the first known to accelerate the third stage of progressive alignment on reconfigurable hardware.
we reduce subgroups of aligned sequences into discrete profiles before they are pairwise aligned on the accelerator.
multiple sequence alignment  is a fundamental analysis method used in bioinformatics and many comparative genomic applications.
