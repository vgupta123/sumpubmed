although spen mutants affect only a small subset of morphological structures in embryos, it has been difficult to find a common theme in spen mutant structural alterations, or in the interactions of spen with known signaling pathways.
by generating clones of spen mutant cells in wing imaginal discs, we show that spen function is required for the correct formation and positioning of veins and mechanosensory bristles both on the anterior wing margin and on the notum, and for the maintenance of planar polarity.
its requirement for epithelial planar polarity, its interaction with ck, and the abnormal e-cadherin expression associated with spen mutations suggest that spen exerts its function by interacting with basic cellular mechanisms required to maintain multicellular organization in metazoans.
wing vein phenotypic alterations are enhanced by mutations in the crinkled  gene, encoding a non-conventional myosin, and correlate with an abnormal spatial expression of delta, an early marker of vein formation in third instar wing imaginal discs.
genetic analyses indicate that spen interacts with pathways that regulate the function of hox proteins, the response to various signaling cascades and cell cycle control.
