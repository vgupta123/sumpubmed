we have developed a custom microarray platform that tiles roughly  <dig>  alternative putative promoters from nearly  <dig>  genes in the human genome.
the usage of alternative promoters greatly multiplies the transcriptional complexity available within the human genome.
independent lines of evidence suggested that a large fraction of human genes possess multiple promoters driving gene expression from distinct transcription start sites.
to demonstrate the utility of this array platform, we have analyzed the patterns of promoter usage in 17Î²-estradiol -treated and untreated mcf <dig> cells and show widespread usage of alternative promoters.
