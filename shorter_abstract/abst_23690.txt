with regard to the identification of disease-susceptibility genes, genclip allows one to quickly acquire a primary pathogenesis profile and identify pathways involving abnormally expressed genes not previously associated with the disease.
four features were added to this previously described method: the ability to 1) manually curate keywords extracted from the literature, 2) search genes and gene co-occurrence networks related to custom keywords, 3) compare analyzed gene results with negative and positive controls generated by genclip, and 4) calculate probabilities that the resulting genes and gene networks are randomly related.
literature mining is an important way to assist in this task.
we present our software program, genclip , which is based on the methods presented by chaussabel and sher :research0055) that search gene lists to identify functional clusters of genes based on up-to-date literature profiling.
biomedical researchers often want to explore pathogenesis and pathways regulated by abnormally expressed genes, such as those identified by microarray analyses.
