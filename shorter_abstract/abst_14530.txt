xenbase is a model organism database that provides centralized access to this information, including gene function data from high-throughput screens and the scientific literature.
we have classified many anatomical features in a common framework that has been adopted by several model organism database communities.
the frogs xenopus laevis and xenopus  tropicalis are model systems that have produced a wealth of genetic, genomic, and developmental information.
its robust developmental map will enable powerful database searches and data analyses.
a controlled, structured vocabulary for xenopus anatomy and development is essential for organizing these data.
we have constructed a xenopus anatomical ontology that represents the lineage of tissues and the timing of their development.
the xenopus anatomical ontology will be used to annotate xenopus gene expression patterns and mutant and morphant phenotypes.
