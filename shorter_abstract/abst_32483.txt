we have in addition analyzed the cell-type specific differential abundance of a large section of proteins quantified in both newly formed and steady-state diazotrophic cultures in n. punctiforme.
the results describe a wide distribution of members of the putative redox regulated cys-proteome in the central metabolism of both vegetative cells and heterocysts of n. punctiforme.
the data set broadens our understanding of heterocysts and describes novel proteins involved in heterocyst physiology, including signaling and regulatory proteins as well as a large number of proteins with unknown function.
the aim of the study was to expand the coverage of the cell-type specific proteome and metabolic landscape of heterocysts.
here we report the first cell-type specific proteome of newly formed heterocysts, compared to n2-fixing filaments, using the cysteine-specific selective icat methodology.
significant differences in cell-type specific abundance levels were present in the cell-type specific proteomes of newly formed diazotrophic filaments as compared to steady-state cultures.
the relative abundance levels of  <dig> proteins were determined and 74% showed a cell-type specific differential abundance.
the data set defined a good quantitative accuracy of the icat reagent in complex protein samples.
we have here employed a thiol targeting strategy to relatively quantify the putative redox proteome in heterocysts as compared to n2-fixing filaments, 24Â hours after combined nitrogen depletion.
the majority of the identified proteins have not previously been quantified at the cell-type specific level.
