conversely, the comparison between the light + hkb and light + depleted hkb treatments revealed that the presence of hkb led to differential expression of 59% of genes, including the majority of genes involved in major carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways.
however, light led to the upregulation of a number of phototrophy- and phagotrophy-related genes, while the availability of bacterial prey led to prominent changes in major carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways.
the availability of light led to a differential expression of only 8% of genes in the transcriptome.
transcriptomic results agreed with previous observations that light had minimal effect on the population growth of ochromonas sp.
we studied the effect of light and bacteria on growth and gene expression of a predominantly phagotrophic ochromonas species.
our study demonstrated the potential of transcriptomic approaches to improve our understanding of the trophic physiologies of complex mixotrophs, and revealed responses in ochromonas sp.
ochromonas is a genus of mixotrophic chrysophytes that is found ubiquitously in many aquatic environments.
genes coding for unidirectional enzymes for the utilization of glucose were upregulated in the presence of hkb, implying increased glycolytic activities during phagotrophy.
a number of genes associated with photosynthesis, phagotrophy, and tetrapyrrole synthesis was upregulated in the light + hkb treatment compared to dark + hkb.

there were no significant differences in the growth or bacterial ingestion rates between algae grown in light or dark conditions.
species in this genus can be important consumers of bacteria but vary in their ability to perform photosynthesis.
