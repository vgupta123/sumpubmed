it has been shown that when more than one type of experiment is used in the network inference process the accuracy is higher.
this data typically include gene expression measurements of wild type and mutant cells in response to a given stimulus.
therefore the development of generally applicable and effective methodologies that embed multiple sources of information in a single computational framework is a worthwhile objective.
this paper presents a new method for network inference, which uses multi-objective optimisation  to integrate multiple inference methods and experiments.
we illustrate the potential of the methodology by combining ode and correlation-based network inference procedures as well as time course and gene inactivation experiments.
reverse engineering in systems biology entails inference of gene regulatory networks from observational data.
the approach we present in this paper is flexible and can be used in any scenario that benefits from integration of multiple sources of information and modelling procedures in the inference process.
