some loss-of-function mutations of the twist <dig> gene have been shown to cause an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis, known as the saethre-chotzen syndrome .

in a previous study, we highlighted the predictive value of in silico molecular dynamics  simulations in deciphering the molecular function of twist <dig> residues.
our study demonstrates that md simulations provide a structural explanation for the loss-of-function associated with the scs twist <dig> mutation and provides a proof of concept of the predictive value of these md simulations.
the bhlh transcription factor twist <dig> plays a key role in the embryonic development and in tumorigenesis.
here, since the substitution of the arginine  <dig> amino acid by a glycine residue  is responsible for the scs phenotype and the substitution of arginine  <dig> by a proline experimentally decreases the dimerizing ability of twist <dig>  we investigated the molecular impact of this point mutation using md approaches.
although the functional impacts of many twist <dig> mutations have been experimentally reported, little is known on the molecular mechanisms underlying their loss-of-function.
consistently, md simulations highlighted a clear decrease in the stability of the Î±-helix during the dimerization of the mutated r154p twist1/e <dig> dimer compared to the wild-type te complex, which was further confirmed in vitro using immunoassays.
