collectively, our results suggest that ag-dependent as well as -independent activation induces an inflammatory mc phenotype which is distinguished by neoexpression of a functional c5ar as a novel effector mechanism in mc-mediated pathogenesis.
since anaphylatoxins are attractive candidates as mc chemoattractants, we investigated expression and function of anaphylatoxin receptors in murine mc.
primary peritoneal mc did not express detectable amounts of anaphylatoxin receptors, however, similar to precursor cell-derived mc, stimulation with ag or ionomycin for  <dig> h induced a prominent surface expression of c5ar whereas c3ar remained undetectable.
the signals controlling mc mobilization during inflammation are not fully understood.
likewise, c5a induced intracellular calcium fluxes solely in activated mc.
mast cells  are key effector cells of allergic diseases and resistance to helminthic parasites and induce or amplify diverse innate and adaptive immune responses.
in contrast, c3a proved to be a weak mc chemotaxin and unable to increase intracellular calcium.
