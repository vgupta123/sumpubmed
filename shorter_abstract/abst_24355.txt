overall, we demonstrate the validity of virtual screening as a method for identifying new leads from a pool of ligands with similar physicochemical properties and we believe that the outcome of this study provides useful insight into the setting up of a suitable docking and scoring protocol, resulting in enrichment of 'target active' compounds.
in most cases, gold was marginally the best performing individual function; the consensus score usually performed similarly to the best single scoring function.
our best results were obtained using the thr <dig> tether in combination with the bestscorerank protocol and normalisation for molecular weight.
for that particular combination, dock was the best individual function; dock recovered 90% of the actives in the top 10% of the ranked list; consensus similarly recovered 89% of the actives in its top 10%.
bestscorerank uses multiple poses for each ligand and independently chooses the best ranked pose of the ligand according to each different scoring function.
all the scoring functions gave fairly similar enrichments, with the exception of pmf which was consistently the poorest performer.
