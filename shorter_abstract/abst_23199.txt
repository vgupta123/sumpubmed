p. aeruginosa and e. faecium together generated a current of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ma while alone they produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ma respectively.
microbial fuel cells  rely on electrochemically active bacteria to capture the chemical energy contained in organics and convert it to electrical energy.
closed circuit anode pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were considerably thinner compared to the open circuit anode , which is likely due to the higher energetic gain of soluble electron acceptors used.
bacteria develop biofilms on the mfc electrodes, allowing considerable conversion capacity and opportunities for extracellular electron transfer .
to understand how bacteria form biofilms within mfcs and how their development, structure and viability affects electron transfer, we performed pure and co-culture experiments.
the two gram-positive bacteria used only provided a fraction of current produced by the gram-negative organisms.
we postulate that this segregation may be an essential difference in strategy for electron transfer and substrate capture between the gram-negative and the gram-positive bacteria used here.
