these data suggest that production and secretion of the flp proteins contributes to microcolony formation and attachment to hff cells in vitro.
future studies will focus on how flp proteins contribute to microcolony formation and attachment in vivo.
h. ducreyi mutants that lack expression of flp <dig> and flp <dig> or tada, which has homology to ntpases of type iv secretion systems, have decreased abilities to attach to and form microcolonies on human foreskin fibroblasts .
the overall papule formation rate for the parent was 80%  and for the mutant was  <dig> %  .
a tada mutant is attenuated in its ability to cause disease in human volunteers and in the temperature dependent rabbit model, but a flp1flp <dig> mutant is virulent in rabbits.
we constructed 35000hpÎ”flp1- <dig>  a deletion mutant that lacks expression of all three flp proteins but has an intact tad secretion system.
the overall pustule formation rates were  <dig> %  at  <dig> parent sites and  <dig> %  at  <dig> mutant sites .
expression of flp1- <dig> is also necessary for h. ducreyi to initiate disease and progress to pustule formation in humans.
complementation of the mutant with flp1- <dig> in trans restored the parental phenotype.
mutant papules were significantly smaller  than were parent papules   <dig> h after inoculation .
haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, contains a flp  operon that encodes proteins predicted to contribute to adherence and pathogenesis.
whether a flp deletion mutant would cause disease in humans is not clear.
