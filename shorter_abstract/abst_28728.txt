these results demonstrate the utility of the ubda array as a diagnostic tool in pathogen forensics.
hybridization patterns are unique to a specific genome and these can be used to decipher the identity of a mixed pathogen sample and can separate hosts and pathogens into their respective phylogenomic relationships.
given the enormous spectrum of genetic possibilities, a field deployable, robust technology, such as a universal  microarray has near-term potential to address these needs.
each genome hybridized on this array has a unique pattern of signal intensities corresponding to each of these probes.
these signal intensities were used to generate an un-biased cluster analysis of signal intensity hybridization patterns that can easily distinguish species into accepted and known phylogenomic relationships.
examples of unique hybridization signal intensity patterns are presented for different brucella species as well as relevant host species and other pathogens.
