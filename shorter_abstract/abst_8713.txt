<dig>  unigenes were found to be differentially expressed between ros-treated and un-treated rudimentary leaves, and genes encoding signaling components of plant hormones such as aba and ethylene were significantly enriched.
to understand the molecular function of the ros-induced abortion of rudimentary leaves in litchi, we sequenced and de novo assembled the litchi transcriptome.
previous studies have shown that high temperature conditions encourage the growth of rudimentary leaves in panicles and suppress litchi flowering, while reactive oxygen species  generated by methyl viologen dichloride hydrate  promote flowering and abortion of rudimentary leaves.

the identified differentially expressed genes also provided potential candidates for functional analysis of genes involved in litchi flowering underlying the control of rudimentary leaves in the panicles.
