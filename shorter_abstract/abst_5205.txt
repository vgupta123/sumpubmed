we found evidence for the alternative splicing of parent genes.
retrotransposition events are associated with line/ltr and genomic integration is random.
we conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of glycolytic enzymes in the human and mouse genomes and identified several intronless copies for all enzymes in the pathway, except pfk.
the central metabolic pathway of glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate, with the net production of  <dig> atp and  <dig> nadh per glucose molecule.
several isozymes in this pathway are expressed only during spermatogenesis, and gene targeting studies indicate that they are essential for sperm function and male fertility in mouse.
our analysis detected frequent, recent, and lineage-specific retrotransposition of orthologous glycolytic enzymes in the human and mouse genomes.
their restricted expression profile suggests that retrotransposition may play a significant role in the evolution of sperm glycolytic enzymes.
we analyzed expression of sequences with orfs and <99% sequence identity in the coding region and obtained evidence for the expression of an alternative gpi <dig> transcript in mouse spermatogenic cells.
within each gene family, a single orthologous gene was typically retrotransposed frequently and independently in both species.
each of the ten reactions in this pathway is typically catalyzed by multiple isozymes encoded by a multigene family.
