the method accommodates various evolutionary models and options such as the sliding window size.
this paper reports the development of a web-based tool, wspmaker , for calculating selection pressures  in the sub-regions of two protein-coding dna sequences .
this enables the investigation of adaptive protein evolution and shows selective constraints of the overall/specific region of two orthologous gene-coding dna sequences.
wspmaker is a web tool for scanning and calculating selection pressures  in sub-regions of two protein-coding dna sequences .
in general, the ratio of the rate of non-synonymous substitutions  to the rate of synonymous substitutions  is used to estimate either negative or positive selection for an entire gene region of interest.
in the study of adaptive evolution, it is important to detect the protein coding sites where natural selection is acting.
however, since each amino acid in a region has a different function and structure, the type and strength of natural selection may be different for each amino acid.
