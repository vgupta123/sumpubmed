the american cranberry  is one of only three widely-cultivated fruit crops native to north america- the other two are blueberry  and native grape .
the candidate genes identified represent a useful collection to further study important biochemical pathways and cellular processes and to use for marker development for breeding and the study of horticultural characteristics, such as disease resistance.
in addition, cranberries produce a host of important polyphenolic secondary compounds, some of which are beneficial to human health.
shotgun sequencing of the cranberry genome, with an average sequencing coverage of 20x, allowed efficient assembly and gene calling.
of the predicted genes,  <dig>  were assigned to candidate genes based on homology.
the genome size of v. macrocarpon has been estimated to be about  <dig> mb.
genes supported by transcriptome data totaled  <dig>  .
