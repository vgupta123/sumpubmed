the qtl  for breakdown , detected in the whole panel and japonica panel, and one qtl  for bd and setback , detected in the whole panel and indica panel, may be specific gene alleles in japonica or indica panels.
in the present study, genome-wide association study with high-quality re-sequencing data was performed for  <dig> ecqs in a panel of  <dig> non-glutinous rice accessions and four derived panels.
starch and protein are two major components of polished rice, and the amylose and protein contents affect eating and cooking qualities .
one previously detected qtl  for protein content and one new qtl  for many ecq traits detected in more than two panels, may represent valuable targets for future cloning of the underlying genes.
two quantitative trait loci   for several starch paste viscosity properties detected in four panels were close to the isoamylase  <dig> gene, one qtl  for consistency detected in three panels was close to the starch synthase iv- <dig> gene.
population structure accounted for high phenotypic variation in three routine panels and had minor effects on subspecies-based panels.
