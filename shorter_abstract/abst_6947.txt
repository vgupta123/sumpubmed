with the use of ae, the hypoxia gene set was the most important at a highly significant level.
this finding gives us insights not only into the underlying biology, but also into clinical interventions that could be designed to mimic within wounded tissue the effects of forces without all the negative effects that forces themselves create.
a co-expression network analysis showed that important co-regulated members of the hypoxia pathway include a glucose transporter , heme oxygenase, and nitric oxide synthase <dig> among others.
it appears that the hypoxia pathway may be an important modulator of response of soft tissue to forces.
