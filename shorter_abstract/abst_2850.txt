is elements on the flanking regions of nif and nif-like genes imply that these genes might have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer.
most biological nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the molybdenum nitrogenase.
of the  <dig> nif genes, eight nif genes  and two non-nif genes  form a complete nif gene cluster.
in addition to the nif genes, there are nitrogenase-like genes, including two nifh-like genes and five pairs of nifdk-like genes.
also, here for the first time we demonstrated that unlike nif genes, the transcriptions of nifhdk-like genes were not regulated by ammonium and oxygen, and nifh-like or nifd-like gene could not restore the nitrogenase activity of klebsiella pneumonia nifh− and nifd− mutant strains, respectively, suggesting that nifhdk-like genes were not involved in nitrogen fixation.
our data and analysis reveal the contents and distribution of nif and nif-like genes and contribute to the study of evolutionary history of nitrogen fixation in paenibacillus.
in addition to nifhdk, nifhdk-like genes were found in some archaea and firmicutes, but their function is unclear.
for the first time we demonstrated that the transcriptions of nifhdk-like genes were not regulated by ammonium and oxygen and nifhdk-like genes were not involved in nitrogen fixation.
rt-pcr analysis showed that the complete nif gene cluster is organized as an operon.
we demonstrated that the complete nif gene cluster under the control of σ70-dependent promoter enabled escherichia coli jm <dig> to fix nitrogen.
the genome of p. sabinae t <dig> contains fifteen nitrogen fixation  genes, including three nifh, one nifd, one nifk, four nifb, two nife, two nifn, one nifx and one nifv.
this enzyme is a complex which contains the mofe protein encoded by nifdk and the fe protein encoded by nifh.
