we conducted bayesian and multispecies coalescent analyses to infer relationships and estimate divergence times of the taxa.
we present the most comprehensive dated triticeae chloroplast phylogeny and review previous hypotheses in the framework of our results.
the comparison of the chloroplast phylogeny with available nuclear data in several cases revealed incongruences indicating past hybridizations.
monophyly of triticeae chloroplasts could not be confirmed, as either bromus or psathyrostachys captured a chloroplast from a lineage closely related to a bromus-triticeae ancestor.

we analysed the phylogeny of chloroplast lineages among nearly all monogenomic triticeae taxa and polyploid wheat species aiming at a deeper understanding of the tribeâ€™s evolution.
recent events of chloroplast capture were detected as individuals grouped apart from con-specific accessions in otherwise monopyhletic groups.
the most recent common ancestor of triticeae occurred approximately between ten and  <dig> million years ago.
