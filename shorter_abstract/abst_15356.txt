we use the minimum recombinant model for haplotype inference in pedigrees.
this research also demonstrates another practical use of the minimum recombinant model for haplotype inference in pedigrees.
several local optimization algorithms are used to infer the haplotype of each individual and determine the linked regions based on the inferred haplotype data.
in particular, the new package can handle many cases where the genotype data of one of the two parents is missing for the entire chromosome.
the running time of the program is o, where m is the number of members in the family and n is the number of snp sites in the chromosome.
with the rapid development of high-throughput genotyping technologies, efficient methods for identifying linked regions using high-density snp genotype data have become more and more important.
in particular, the results  will be poor when the genotype data for the whole chromosome of one of the parents in a nuclear family is missing.
we have developed a software package  for identifying linked regions using high-density snp genotype data.
we focus on handling the case where the genotype data for the whole chromosome of one of the parents in a nuclear family is missing.
our new package  is efficient software for linked region detection using high-density snp genotype data.
however, that program can only work on a limited number of family structures.
recently, a deterministic method that works very well on snp genotyping data has been developed : 86â€“93).
we have developed a more flexible method to combine nuclear families to further refine  the linked regions.
the software package can be downloaded at .
liden can handle some important cases where the existing programs do not work well.
