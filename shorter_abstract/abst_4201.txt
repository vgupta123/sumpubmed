a model for how a ligand binding pocket of srp <dig> can accommodate a new rna k-turn in the 5e region of the eukaryotic srp rna is proposed.
the 11-nucleotide 5e motif contained within the srp rna fragment was shown by comparative electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels to conform to an rna kink-turn.
the srp is a ribonucleoprotein complex which binds to signal sequences of secretory polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome.
in agreement with biochemical data and results from chymotryptic digestion experiments, molecular modeling of srp <dig> implied that the invariant w <dig> was located inside the predicted structure of an rna binding domain.
the results from the presented experiments provided insights into the molecular details of a functionally important and structurally interesting rna-protein interaction.
the region encompassed residues  <dig> to  <dig> of the full-length human srp <dig> and contained a lysine-rich cluster  at postions  <dig> to  <dig> as well as a conserved pfam motif with the sequence pdpxrwlpxxer at positions  <dig> to  <dig>  we demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that both regions participated in the formation of a complex with the rna.
