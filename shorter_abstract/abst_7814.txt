with only a small number of kinetic parameters, the model is able to describe a broad range of experimental steady-state and dynamical conditions.
based mathematical model is presented that maps a physiological parameter – the specific growth rate – to the sensor of the signal transduction unit, here a component of the bacterial phosphotransferase system , namely eiiacrr.
the model describes the relation between the growth rate and the degree of phosphorylation of eiia crr for a number of carbohydrates by a distinctive response curve, that differentiates between pts transported carbohydrates and non-pts carbohydrates.
a prominent example is the control of carbohydrate uptake systems by the transcription factor crp in escherichia coli.
the steady-state characteristic presented shows a relationship between the growth rate and the output of the sensor system pts.
