site-directed mutagenesis studies further revealed that the degree of n-glycosylation also plays an important role in heterologous cellulase activity in s. cerevisiae.
this systematic gene-knockout screening approach may serve as a convenient means for increasing the extracellular activities of recombinant proteins expressed in s. cerevisiae.
twelve of the screened mutants were found to have a more than 2-fold increase in extracellular pcx activity in comparison with the wild type.
thus, there is a need to genetically engineer the yeast to reduce its glycosylation strength and to increase its secretion ability.
knockout mutants of  <dig> glycosylation-related genes and  <dig> protein-trafficking-related genes were transformed with a pcx expression construct and screened for extracellular cellulase activity.
systematic screening of knockout mutants of glycosylation- and protein trafficking-associated genes in s. cerevisiae revealed that:  blocking golgi-to-endosome transport may force s. cerevisiae to export cellulases; and  both over- and under-glycosylation may alter the enzyme activity of cellulases.
the extracellular pcx activities in the glycosylation-related mnn <dig> and pmt <dig> null mutants were, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> times higher than that of the wild type; and the extracellular pcx activities in  <dig> protein-trafficking-related mutants, especially in the chc <dig>  clc <dig> and vps <dig> null mutants, were at least  <dig>  times higher than the parental strains.
saccharomyces cerevisiae gene-knockout strains were screened for improved extracellular activity of a recombinant exocellulase  from the cellulose digesting fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium.
however, heterologous protein expression in s. cerevisiae often suffers from hyper-glycosylation and/or poor secretion.
as a strong fermentator, saccharomyces cerevisiae has the potential to be an excellent host for ethanol production by consolidated bioprocessing.
