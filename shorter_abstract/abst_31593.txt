also the genotyping of putative transformants is challenging since the isolation of dna for southern analysis is difficult due to the high amount of phenolic compounds and polysaccharides that complicate efficient extraction of digestable dna.
these techniques combined clearly facilitate the generation of transgenic strawberries but should be applicable to other plants as well.
for certain traits, genetic engineering offers a potential alternative to traditional breeding.
small amount of dna required by tail-pcr is easily recovered even from a small transformant, which allows rapid verification of t-dna integration and detection of separate gene transfer events.
putative transformants were screened by tail-pcr to verify t-dna integration and to distinguish between the individual transformation events.
