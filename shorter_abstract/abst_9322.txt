we propose computational methods to rank insertion-deletion mutations in the coding as well as non-coding regions and nonsense mutations.
this demonstrates that the evolutionary conservation context of the sequences that harbour insertions, deletions and nonsense mutations can be used to predict and rank the effects of the mutations.
given the large number of variations now being discovered, computational methods to prioritize the functional importance of genetic variations are of growing interest.
using sequence data from budding yeast and human, we show that variations which that we predict to have larger effects segregate at significantly lower allele frequencies, and occur less frequently than expected by chance, indicating stronger purifying selection.
interestingly, the large-effect mutations associated with disease show a similar distribution of predicted effects to that expected for completely random mutations.
genetic variations contribute to normal phenotypic differences as well as diseases, and new sequencing technologies are greatly increasing the capacity to identify these variations.
