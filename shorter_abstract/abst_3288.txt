recent advances in genome sequencing and genomic technologies provide new opportunities to understand the ovine host response to gastrointestinal nematodes at the molecular level, and to identify polymorphisms conferring nematode resistance.
results from this study support the hypothesis that host resistance to internal nematode parasites is likely to be controlled by a number of loci of moderate to small effects.
through selection of resistant animals, rapid genetic progress has been demonstrated in both research and commercial flocks.
population differentiation using fst and peddrift revealed sixteen regions, which included candidate genes involved in chitinase activity and the cytokine response.
divergent lines of romney and perendale sheep, selectively bred for high and low faecal nematode egg count, were genotyped using the illuminaÂ® ovine snp <dig> beadchip.
the resulting genome-wide snp data were analysed for selective sweeps on loci associated with resistance or susceptibility to gastrointestinal nematode infection.
gastrointestinal nematodes are one of the most serious causes of disease in domestic ruminants worldwide.
there is considerable variation in resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes within and between sheep breeds, which appears to be due to underlying genetic diversity.
in this study we identified fourteen novel regions associated with resistance or susceptibility to gastrointestinal nematodes.
