the reasonable accuracy of prediction calculated by leave-one-out cross validation procedure was observed in the majority of kinase-specificity classes.
using the previously developed explain™ system for the reconstruction of signal transduction pathways, we showed that addition of the newly predicted interactions enabled us to find the possible path between signal trigger, tnf-alpha, and its target genes in the cell.
the previously published in silico method paas was applied for prediction of interactions between protein kinases and their substrates.
<dig> protein kinase substrates classified by  <dig> kinases were extracted from the phospho.elm database and used as a training set.
the on-line version of paas for prediction of protein kinase substrates is freely available at http://www.ibmc.msk.ru/paas/.
the kinase substrate specificity for  <dig> proteins extracted from transpath® database was predicted by paas method.
the random multiple splitting of the studied set onto the test and training set had also led to satisfactory results.
we used the method for recognition of the protein classes defined by the interaction with the same protein partners.
it was shown that the predictions of protein kinase substrates by paas were suitable for the enrichment of signaling pathway networks and identification of the novel signaling pathways.
several kinase-substrate interactions described in this database were correctly predicted.
this problem can be solved by the network enrichment with predicted protein interactions.
