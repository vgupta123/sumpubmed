in the present study, we established an experimental in vitro ie cell culture model using ea.hy <dig> and huvec cells to investigate the adhesion and invasion characteristics of  <dig> streptococcus gallolyticus subsp.
the adherence to and invasion characteristics of the examined s. gallolyticus subsp.
in contrast, the usage of three different in vitro models , mechanical stretched cells) revealed no differences regarding the adherence to and invasion characteristics of different strains.
gallolyticus adhesion and invasion of human endothelial cells, revealing important initial information of strain variability, behaviour and characteristics of this as yet barely analyzed pathogen.
adhesion to eight components of the extracellular matrix  and the ability to form biofilms in vitro was examined in order to reveal features of s. gallolyticus subsp.
moreover, a strong correlation was observed in binding to these proteins by the analyzed strains.
gallolyticus is an important causative agent of infective endocarditis  but the knowledge on virulence factors is limited and the pathogenesis of the infection is poorly understood.
in addition, the strains were analyzed for the presence of the three virulence factors gtf, pilb, and fimb by pcr.
we further confirmed the presence of the genes of two known virulence factors  and demonstrated the presence of the gene of one new putative virulence factor  by pcr.
our study provides the first description of s. gallolyticus subsp.
