using cd spectroscopy we show that the a-domains of two arabidopsis toc <dig> family members  are disordered at physiological ph and temperature and undergo conformational changes at temperature and ph extremes that are characteristic of idps.
they directly bind to transit peptides, and exhibit preprotein substrate selectivity conferred by an unknown mechanism.
