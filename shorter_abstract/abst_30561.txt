doubled haploid production is a key technology in triticale research and breeding.
our results show a pronounced increase in the proportion of doubled haploid triticale plants compared to the spontaneous doubling rate, but also compared to the doubling obtained by the standard in vivo approach.
our results suggest that for triticale, in vitro chromosome doubling is a promising alternative to the in vivo approach.
in this study we investigated the applicability of an in vitro approach for chromosome doubling based on microspore culture.
in addition, the frequency of plants surviving from culture medium to maturity is also much higher for the in vitro approach.
colchicine concentrations of 1 mm for 24 h or  <dig>  mm applied for  <dig> or 72 h during the first hours of microspore culture performed best.
