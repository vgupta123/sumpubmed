transposable elements  are mobile sequences found in nearly all eukaryotic genomes.
the implementation, teseeker, is available for download as a virtual appliance, while the library of representative tes is available as a separate download.
our approach is able to generate high-quality consensus te sequences automatically, requiring the user to only provide a few basic parameters.
in this work, we describe a homology-based approach for the automatic identification of high-quality consensus tes, aimed for use in the analysis of newly sequenced genomes.
our modular approach is dependent on a thorough and high-quality library of representative tes.
our approach is most effective for tes with intact reading frames.
we describe a homology-based approach for the automatic identification of tes in genomes.
while tes are known to be a major force in the evolution of genomes, the automatic identification of tes in genomes is far from mature.
they have the ability to move and replicate within a genome, often influencing genome evolution and gene expression.
