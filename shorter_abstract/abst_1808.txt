a total of  <dig> novel genes were differentially expressed in black versus white sheep skin, consisting of  <dig> genes which were up-regulated  and  <dig> genes that were down-regulated.
there was also a total of  <dig> known coat color genes expressed in sheep skin, from which  <dig> genes showed higher expression in black sheep skin.
a total of  <dig>  known genes were differentially expressed in black versus white sheep skin, with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig>  genes down-regulated.
previous molecular genetic studies of physiology and pigmentation of sheep skin have focused primarily on a limited number of genes and proteins.
there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes assembled from the reads obtained from white and black sheep skin, respectively.
the white and black sheep skin transcriptome profiles obtained provide a valuable resource for future research to understand the network of gene expression controlling skin physiology and melanogenesis in sheep.
to identify additional genes that may play important roles in coat color regulation, illumina sequencing technology was used to catalog global gene expression profiles in skin of sheep with white versus black coat color.
genes encoding for the ribosomal proteins and keratin associated proteins were most highly expressed.
