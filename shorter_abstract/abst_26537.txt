in contrast, mice and zebrafish studies indicate distinct roles for both erks in cellular proliferation, oncogenic transformation and development.
for instance, the upstream activation pathways for erk <dig> and erk <dig> are highly similar, and also many of their known downstream targets are common.
however, specific functions of most of these proteins in vertebrate development remain elusive because of potential redundancies.
for erk <dig> we identified specific genes involved in dorsal-ventral patterning and subsequent embryonic cell migration.
microarray based gene expression profiling of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown zebrafish embryos at various stages of early embryogenesis resulted in specific gene expression signature sets that showed pronounced differences in gene ontology analyses.
the gene ontology analyses showed that erk <dig> and erk <dig> target common and distinct gene sets, confirming the difference in knockdown phenotypes and diverse roles for these kinases during embryogenesis.
predicted downstream effects of erk <dig> and erk <dig> knockdown treatments on key pathways responsible for mesendoderm development were confirmed by whole mount in situ hybridization experiments.
the mapk signaling proteins are involved in many eukaryotic cellular processes and signaling networks.
a major bottleneck for further studies is that relatively little is known of in vivo downstream signaling specific for these kinases.
in order to predict functions of these genes, zebrafish specific in silico signaling pathways involved in early embryogenesis were constructed using the genmapp program.
