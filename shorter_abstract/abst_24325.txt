this study demonstrates how rh mapping, which offered high and uniform resolution across the length of the chromosome, can facilitate the complete sequence assembly of the large and complex plant genomes.
radiation hybrid  mapping has proven to be an excellent tool for the development of such maps for it offers much higher and more uniform marker resolution across the length of the chromosome compared to genetic mapping and does not require marker polymorphism per se, as it is based on presence  vs. absence  marker assay.
tauschii accession al8/ <dig>  to confirm map order accuracy, the al8/78-rh maps were compared with:1) a dart consensus genetic map constructed using more than  <dig> bi-parental populations, 2) a rh map of the d-genome of reference hexaploid wheat ’chinese spring’, and 3) two snp-based genetic maps, one with anchored d-genome bac contigs and another with anchored d-genome sequence scaffolds.
with  <dig> mapped markers, a total of  <dig> deletions for the whole d-genome were detected with an average deletion size of  <dig>  mb.
in this study, a  <dig> line rh panel was genotyped with ssrs and dart markers to develop the first high resolution rh maps of the entire d-genome of ae.
using marker sequences, the rh maps were also anchored with a bac contig based physical map and draft sequence of the d-genome of ae.
the rh maps showed almost perfect agreement with several published maps with regard to chromosome assignments of markers.
this study reports the development of first high resolution rh maps for the d-genome of ae.
the average distance between any two marker loci was  <dig>  cr which corresponds to  <dig>  cm or  <dig>  mb.
the large and complex genome of bread wheat  requires high resolution genome maps with saturated marker scaffolds to anchor and orient bac contigs/ sequence scaffolds for whole genome assembly.

a total of  <dig> markers were mapped to  <dig> unique positions on the seven d-genome chromosomes, with a total map length of  <dig> .
tauschii sequence scaffolds,  <dig> of which were not anchored earlier to the d-genome.
tauschii accession al8/ <dig>  which were then used for the anchoring of unassigned sequence scaffolds.
the mean rank correlations between the position of markers on al8/ <dig> maps and the four published maps, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , suggesting a good agreement in marker order.
