large scale and reliable proteins' functional annotation is a major challenge in modern biology.
coupling phylogenetic reconstruction and expression data is a promising way of analysis that could be applied to all multigenic families to investigate the relationship between molecular and transcriptional evolution and to improve functional annotation.
we then extracted all corresponding expression data contained in est database this analysis allowed us 1/to extend the spectrum of homologs-containing species and to improve the reconstruction of genes' evolutionary history.
3/to show a correlation between paralogous sequences' evolution rate and pattern of tissular expression.
to illustrate our method, we used an example protein family, the peptidyl arginine deiminases , probably implied in rheumatoid arthritis.
however, up to now, phylogenetic annotation did not take into account expression data .
we developed an approach enabling the combination of expression data and phylogenetic analysis.
we completed the phylogenetic reconstruction of pads using an enlarged sequence database containing translations of ests contigs.
2/to deduce an accurate gene expression pattern for each member of this protein family.
