mactinin is a novel inducer of hsp <dig> activity on monocytes and may serve to perpetuate and augment monocytic activation, thereby functioning as a "matrikine."
we previously showed that mactinin, a degradative fragment of the cytoskeletal protein α-actinin, is present at sites of monocytic activation in vivo, has chemotactic activity for monocytes and promotes monocyte/macrophage maturation.
monocytes, their progeny such as dendritic cells and osteoclasts and products including tumor necrosis factor -α, interleukin -1α and il-1β play important roles in cancer, inflammation, immune response and atherosclerosis.
affinity purification, mass spectroscopy and western immunoblotting identified heat shock protein - <dig> as the  <dig> kd component of this complex.
hsp <dig> was responsible for mediating the functional effects of mactinin on monocytes, since hsp <dig> inhibitors -17-demethoxygeldanamycin ) almost completely abrogated the stimulatory activity of mactinin on monocytes .
