a prolonged event related desynchronization  of alpha and beta power occurred at ~100- <dig> ms post-stimulus.
time-frequency responses demonstrated early onset, event related synchronization , within the gamma band at ~70- <dig> ms and the theta band at ~50- <dig> ms post-stimulus.
the purpose of this study was to assess changes in primary somatosensory  activity over the course of different types of acupuncture stimulation.
both ea and ap demonstrated significantly decreased response amplitudes following five minutes of stimulation.
evoked brain response to ea differed from ap in its temporal dynamics by showing clear contralateral m20/m <dig> peaks while the latter demonstrated temporal dispersion.
there was decreased beta erd at ~100- <dig> ms over the course of ea, but not ap.
in conjunction with their subcortical effects on endogenous pain regulation, these therapies show potential for affecting s <dig> processing and possibly altering maladaptive neuroplasticity.
we used whole head magnetoencephalography  to map s <dig> brain response during  <dig> minutes of electroacupuncture  and acupressure .
we further assessed how brain response changed during the course of stimulation.
