therefore, it is of great importance to improve the catalytic performance of free lipase in non-aqueous medium.
however, its free form usually exhibits low stability, bad resistance and no reusability, which restrict its further industrial applications.
in comparison with other immobilized lipases, the immobilized bcl also exhibits better catalytic efficiency, which indicates a significant potential in industrial applications.
the improvement of enzyme activity and ees for the immobilized lipase was closely correlated with the alteration of its secondary structure.
compared with its free form, the enzyme activity and enantioselectivity  of the immobilized lipase have been significantly enhanced.
the results of this study have proved that mpr-nka was an excellent support for immobilization of lipase via the methods of n <dig> adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy , energy dispersive spectroscopy  and fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy .
racemic transesterification of 1-phenylethanol with vinyl acetate was chosen as model reaction.
the immobilized bcl exhibited a satisfactory thermostability over a wide range of temperature  and an excellent catalytic efficiency.
burkholderia cepacia lipase  has been proved to be capable of resolution reactions.
in this work, macroporous resin nka  was utilized as support for lipase immobilization.
this information may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of immobilization and enzymatic biotransformation in non-aqueous medium.
