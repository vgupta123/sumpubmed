location of hts at the 5' end is not driven by a preferential placement of aminoacids encoded by the aaa and ttt codons at the n-terminal of proteins.
as frameshift mutations in hts can occur at high frequencies and enable efficient gene inactivation, hypermutable hts appear to represent a universal system for regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes.
combined with other studies indicating that hts also enable rapid diversification of both coding and regulatory genetic sequences in eukaryotes, our data suggest that hypermutable hts represent a general and rapid evolutionary mechanism facilitating adaptation and gene regulation across diverse organisms.
while, traditionally, regulation of gene expression can be grouped into transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms, some mechanisms of rapid genetic variation can also contribute to regulation of gene expression, e.g., phase variation.
the inla gene of the pathogen l. monocytogenes was used as a model to further study the role of hts in reversible gene inactivation.
we show here that prokaryotes evolved to include homopolymeric tracts  within coding genes as a system that allows for efficient gene inactivation.
translational fusions of the inla 5' end allowed us to estimate that the frequency of variation in this ht is about  <dig>  fold higher than the estimated average point mutation frequency.
