in many locations genotypes were observed that were either homozygous for the reference sequence or heterozygous, but the variant homozygous genotype was not observed.
enzymatic activity of telomerase reverse transcriptase  is important in maintaining the telomere length and has been implicated in cancer and aging related pathology.
since cancer susceptibility as well as longevity of dogs vary between breeds, this study involved sequencing the entire tert gene of canis familiaris from dna samples obtained from forty dogs, with ten dogs each of four breeds: shih tzu, dachshund, irish wolfhound, and newfoundland, each with different life expectancies and susceptibility to cancer.
because the four breeds chosen come from geographically and physiologically distinct backgrounds, it can be inferred that the polymorphic diversification of tert preceded breed derivation.
we propose that these homozygous variants are likely to have adverse effects in dogs.
we compared the sequences of all forty individuals amongst one another and with the published sequence of canine tert, and analyzed relationships between members of the same or different breeds.
