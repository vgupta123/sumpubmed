inhibition of plasma dpp activity is used as a biomarker in animal models and clinical trials.
we show that unlike a rapidly dissociating dpp <dig> inhibitor, inhibition of plasma dpp activity by saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin in an ex vivo assay was not dependent on substrate concentration when substrate was added rapidly because saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin dissociate slowly from dpp <dig>  once bound.
saxagliptin and its active metabolite  are potent inhibitors of human dpp <dig> with prolonged dissociation from its active site .
saxagliptin and its active metabolite are potent, selective inhibitors of dpp <dig>  with prolonged dissociation from its active site.
we also show that substrate concentration was important for rapidly dissociating dpp <dig> inhibitors.
saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin are selective for inhibition of dpp <dig> versus other dpp family members and a large panel of other proteases, and have similar potency and efficacy across multiple species.
dipeptidylpeptidase  <dig>  inhibitors have clinical benefit in patients with type  <dig> diabetes mellitus by increasing levels of glucose-lowering incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide - <dig> , a peptide with a short half life that is secreted for approximately  <dig> hour following a meal.
they also demonstrate prolonged inhibition of plasma dpp <dig> ex vivo in animal models, which implies that saxagliptin and 5-hydroxysaxagliptin would continue to inhibit dpp <dig> during rapid increases in substrates in vivo.
since drugs with prolonged binding to their target have been shown to maximize pharmacodynamic effects while minimizing drug levels, we developed a time-dependent inhibitor that has a half-life for dissociation from dpp <dig> close to the duration of the first phase of glp- <dig> release.
