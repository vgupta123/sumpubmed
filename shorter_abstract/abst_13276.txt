islands are enriched in open chromatin, transcription related elements, and alu repetitive elements, with an underrepresentation of line elements.
the replication of mammalian genomic dna during the s phase is a highly coordinated process that occurs in a programmed manner.
this was accomplished by first creating a cosmid library containing dna enriched in sequences that replicate early in the s phase of normal human fibroblasts.
recent studies have begun to elucidate the pattern of replication timing on a genomic scale.
an analysis of genes associated with islands revealed that nearly half of all genes in the wnt family, and a number of genes in the base excision repair pathway, including four of ten dna glycosylases, were associated with island sequences.
also, we found an overrepresentation of members of apoptosis-associated genes in very early replicating sequences from both fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cells.
in addition, we found a paucity of ltr retroposons, dna transposon sequences, and an enrichment in all classes of tandem repeats, except for dinucleotides.
