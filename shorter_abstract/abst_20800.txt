mummergpu uses the new compute unified device architecture  from nvidia to align multiple query sequences against a single reference sequence stored as a suffix tree.
the recent availability of new, less expensive high-throughput dna sequencing technologies has yielded a dramatic increase in the volume of sequence data that must be analyzed.
by processing the queries in parallel on the highly parallel graphics card, mummergpu achieves more than a 10-fold speedup over a serial cpu version of the sequence alignment kernel, and outperforms the exact alignment component of mummer on a high end cpu by  <dig> -fold in total application time when aligning reads from recent sequencing projects using solexa/illumina,  <dig>  and sanger sequencing technologies.
