selection analysis, relative rate tests and expression divergence were finally used to interpret the evolutionary relationships and divergence of sbp-box genes in land plants.
interestingly, subgroup ii- <dig> genes have similar sequence and structural features to group i genes, whereas subgroup ii- <dig> genes exhibit intrinsic differences on these features, including high copy numbers and the presence of mir156/mir <dig> regulation.
further analyses indicate that subgroup ii- <dig> genes are constrained by stronger purifying selection and evolve at a lower substitution rate than ii- <dig> genes, just as group i genes do when compared to ii genes.
our results indicate that different evolutionary rates and selection strengths lead to differing evolutionary patterns in sbp-box genes in land plants, providing a guide for future functional diversity analyses of these genes.
by contrast, subgroup ii- <dig> genes evolve under relaxed purifying selection and have diversified through gene copy duplications and changes in mir156/ <dig> regulation, which might contribute to morphological diversifications of land plants.
these results suggest that group i and subgroup ii- <dig> genes under strong selective constraint are conserved.
nevertheless, the evolutionary patterns of sbp-box genes and evolutionary forces driving them are still not well understood.
we investigated  <dig> sbp-box genes from moss, arabidopsis, poplar, rice, and maize.
squamosa promoter binding protein -box family genes encode plant-specific transcription factors that control many important biological functions, including phase transition, inflorescence branching, fruit ripening, and copper homeostasis.
gene copy number and the sequence and structure features were then compared among these different sbp-box lineages.
phylogenetic combined with gene structure analyses were used to identify sbp-box gene lineages in land plants.
these genes are divided into group i and ii, and the latter is further divided into two subgroups  based on phylogenetic analysis.
among subgroup ii- <dig> genes, mir <dig> targets evolve more rapidly than mir <dig> targets and experience comparatively relaxed purifying selection.
<dig> sbp-box gene candidates of five representative land plants were obtained from phytozome database .
