recently, some alignment editors are proposed that are able to include and model both kinds of information.
for rna sequences often the primary sequence as well as a secondary structure consensus is well known, e.g., the cloverleaf structure of the t-rna.
however, with the advent of a large amount of reliable rna sequences together with their solved secondary structures , we are faced with the problem to handle sequences and their associated secondary structures synchronously.
4sale builds an optimal and unique starting point for every rna sequence and structure analysis.
4sale, which provides an user-friendly and intuitive interface, is a comprehensive toolbox for rna analysis based on sequence and secondary structure information.
the application allows a fast sequence and synchronous secondary structure alignment for large data sets and for the first time synchronous manual editing of aligned sequences and their secondary structures.
this study describes an algorithm for the synchronous alignment of sequences and their associated secondary structures as well as the main features of 4sale used for further analyses and editing.
