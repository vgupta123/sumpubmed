attempts to integrate results from such accumulated knowledge resulted in literature-based protein-protein interaction networks  and pathway databases.
it is difficult to prove because the real ppins are mostly unknown.
we introduce a network discovery model which explicitly includes the space of possibilities in the form of a true underlying ppin.
while suspicion for research focus biases is growing, a concrete proof for it is still missing.
our model strongly suggests that research focus biases exist in the observed discovery dynamics of these networks.
the pattern of discovery is related to a theoretical concept proposed by kauffman called “expanding the adjacent possible”.
here we analyzed the longitudinal discovery process of literature-based mammalian and yeast ppins to observe that these networks are discovered non-uniformly.
