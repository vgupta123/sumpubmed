these views are designed for different roles: equipment specific views are used to gather instrumentation information; data processing oriented views are provided to enable the rapid development of analysis applications; and research project specific views are used to organize information for individual research experiments.
data management is an important aspect of any research enterprise.
it is the foundation on which most applications are built, and must be easily extended to serve new functionality for new scientific areas.
the adaptable data management system discussed is designed to support the seamless mining and analysis of biological experiment data that is commonly used in systems biology .
this management system allows for both the rapid introduction of new types of information and the evolution of the knowledge it represents.
to support these requirements data management systems are needed that can be rapidly built and readily adapted for new usage.
we have found that adopting a three-tier architecture for data management, built around distributed standardized content repositories, allows us to rapidly develop new applications to support a diverse user community.
