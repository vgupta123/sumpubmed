these results demonstrate that the rhs obtained from live pigs shows a highly significant correlation to the lung lesion score considered as a "gold standard".
bacterial lung infections are a major cause of economic losses in the pig industry; they are responsible for approximately 50% of the antibiotics used in pigs and, therefore, also present an increasing concern to consumer protection agencies.
a controlled experimental aerosol infection with an a. pleuropneumoniae serotype  <dig> isolate was performed using  <dig> weaning pigs of defined breeding lines from the breeds german landrace, piétrain, hamphire, and large white.
in contrast, pigs of the german landrace and piétrain breeding lines were predominantly found in the highest scoring quartile .
pigs were clinically assessed on days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection following a novel scoring system, the respiratory health score , which combines clinical, sonographic and radiographic examination results.
the different severity of signs among the tested pig breeding lines clearly suggests a genetic difference in the susceptibility of pigs to a. pleuropneumoniae infection.
the correlation of the ranking at days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection implies that the course of disease is highly dependent on the acute lung damage.
the ranking on day  <dig> was significantly correlated with the ranking based on the pathomorphological lung lesion score .
as a first step in this direction we applied a new respiratory health score system to study the susceptibility of four different pig breeding lines  towards the respiratory tract pathogen actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae.
in response to this changing market we investigated the feasibility of an old approach aimed at the breeding selection of more resistant pigs.
