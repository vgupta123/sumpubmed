using a gene prediction program which scans for a wide variety of promoters can help ensure genes are accurately predicted or not missed completely.
proteogenomic mapping resulted in the identification of previously unannotated genes gatc and rpmf and 5-prime extensions to genes mhp <dig>  mhp <dig>  and mhp <dig>  all conserved and annotated in other m. hyopneumoniae strains and mycoplasma species.
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae causes respiratory disease in swine and contributes to the porcine respiratory disease complex, a major disease problem in the swine industry.
furthermore, protein extraction using differential detergent fractionation effectively increases the number of membrane and cytoplasmic proteins identifiable my mass spectrometry.
proteomic analysis indicates  <dig> of  <dig>  known m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> proteins are expressed under the culture conditions given in this study.
