the e. coli o <dig> phage typing scheme exhibited a significantly modular network linked to the genetic similarity of each group showing that these groups are specialised to infect a subset of phage types.
phage typing of e. coli o <dig> facilitates public health surveillance and outbreak investigations, certain phage types are more likely to occupy specific niches and are associated with specific age groups and disease severity.
the typing phages were sequenced using paired-end illumina sequencing at the genome analysis centre and the animal health and veterinary laboratories agency and bioinformatics programs including velvet, brig and easyfig were used to analyse them.
sequencing the typing phage has enabled us to identify the variable genes within each group and to determine how this corresponds to changes in phage type.
the analysis showed that the t <dig> typing phages  differed by only three genes and that the t <dig> typing phages formed three distinct groups of similar genomic sequences: group  <dig> , group  <dig>  and group  <dig> .
a two-way euclidian cluster analysis highlighted the associations between groups of phage types and typing phages.
the aim of this study was to analyse the genome sequences of  <dig>  e. coli o <dig> typing phages and to determine the genes responsible for the subtle differences in phage type profiles.
