however, in order to achieve sub-nanometre resolution it is often necessary to capture and process many thousands or even several millions of 2d particle images.
when tested on the publicly available keyhole limpet hemocyanin dataset, we find that gempicker gives similar results to the findem program.
to achieve even higher processing speeds, the basic correlation calculations are accelerated considerably by using a hierarchy of parallel programming techniques to distribute the calculation over multiple gpus and cpu cores attached to multiple nodes of a computer cluster.
by using a theoretically optimal reduction algorithm to collect and combine the cluster calculation results, the speed of the overall calculation scales almost linearly with the number of cluster nodes available.
the very high picking throughput that is now possible using gpu-powered workstations or computer clusters will help experimentalists to achieve higher resolution 3d reconstructions more rapidly than before.
