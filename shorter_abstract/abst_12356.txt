genes with known functions are conserved in all mitotypes, but clear variation in open reading frames  with unknown functions among the six mitotypes was observed.
angiosperm mitochondrial genomes are more complex than those of other organisms.
analyses of the mitochondrial genome sequences of at least  <dig> angiosperm species have showed several common properties; these cannot easily explain, however, how the diverse mitotypes evolved within each genus or species.
the mitochondrial genome of ole is largest as a resulting of the duplication of a  <dig>  kb segment.
we have sequenced four brassica mitotypes, compared six brassica mitotypes and suggested a mechanism for mitochondrial genome formation in brassica, including evolutionary events such as inheritance, duplication, rearrangement, genome compaction, and mutation.
sequence relationship analysis showed that there has been genome compaction and inheritance in the course of brassica mitotype evolution.
we sequenced the mitotypes of cam , ole , jun , and car  and analyzed them together with two previously sequenced mitotypes of b. napus .
the jun mitotype is the result of an inherited cam mitotype, and pol is also derived from the cam mitotype with evolutionary modifications.
we analyzed the evolutionary relationships of brassica mitotypes by sequencing.
