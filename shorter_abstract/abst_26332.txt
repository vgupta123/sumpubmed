we analyzed the poly site regions of  <dig> species or phyla.
different groups of species showed different poly signal motifs: uuacuu at the poly site in the parasite trypanosoma cruzi; uguaac  in the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii; uguuug  at mainly the fourth base downstream of the poly site in the parasite blastocystis hominis; and aauaaa at approximately  <dig> bases and approximately  <dig> bases upstream of the poly site in animals and plants, respectively.
polyadenylation signal motifs are usually several hundred times more abundant around poly sites than in whole genomes.
this study identified the poly signal motifs, motif locations, and base composition patterns around mrna poly sites in protists, fungi, plants, and animals and provided insight into poly site evolution.
the evolutionary tendency for poly site selection is still largely unknown.
the poly site was usually an adenosine  in all analyzed species except for b. hominis, and there was weak a predominance in c. reinhardtii.
the polyadenylation of rna is critical for gene functioning, but the conserved sequence motifs , motif locations and abundances, and base composition patterns around mrna polyadenylation  sites are still uncharacterized in most species.
these predominant motifs usually had very specific locations, whether upstream of, at, or downstream of poly sites, depending on the species or phylum.
