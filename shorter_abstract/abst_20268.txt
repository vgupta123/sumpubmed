we thus caution against drawing hasty taxonomic conclusions from biogeographical patterns of mitochondrial markers derived from modern sampling alone.
by means of historic dna extracted from museum specimens, we aimed to investigate the evolution of the mitochondrial demographic structure of the hec in italy and malta throughout the twentieth century.

the pattern of an integral 'italica' core region and a disjunct euphorbiae distribution evolved very recently.
mitochondrial genes are among the most commonly used markers in studies of speciesâ€™ phylogeography and to draw conclusions about taxonomy.
however, our results indicate that such a pattern can emerge surprisingly quickly, even in a widespread and rather common taxon.
at the beginning of the twentieth century, the european mainland lineages were also present at a moderate frequency in southern italy and sicily.
the hyles euphorbiae complex  comprises six distinct mitochondrial lineages in the mediterranean region, of which one exhibits a cryptic disjunct distribution.
a separate biological entity in italy is further corroborated by larval colour patterns with a congruent, confined suture zone along the northern apennines.
the pattern of geographically separated mitochondrial lineages is commonly interpreted as representing long term separated entities.
to explain these strong demographic changes, we propose genetic drift due to anthropogenic habitat loss and fragmentation in combination with an impact from recent climate warming that favoured the spreading of the potentially better adapted 'italica' populations.
thus, geographical sorting of mitochondrial lineages in the hec was not as complete then as the current demography suggests.
