the lack of rich and reliable molecular markers and the shortage of high-density linkage maps are important constraints in spinach research work.
<dig> cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between the adjacent marker loci.
however, there have only been two reports completed on the genetic map of spinach.
in this study, a high-density genetic map of spinach based on the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing  technique was constructed; the sex-determining gene was also finely mapped.
finally,  <dig>  high-quality slaf markers were obtained, with  <dig>  polymorphic markers and  <dig> slaf markers were finally mapped onto the genetic map after linkage analysis.
combined with the high-density genetic map of spinach, the sex-determining gene x/y was located at the position of the linkage group   <dig> , which may be the ideal region for the sex-determining gene.
a high-density genetic map of spinach based on the slaf-seq technique was constructed with a backcross  population .

spinach is also an ideal plant for investigating the mechanism of sex determination because it is a dioecious species with separate male and female plants.
it will also provide an efficient reference for studies on the mechanism of sex determination in other dioecious plants.
at the same time, the sex-determining gene x/y was mapped to lg <dig> with super-bsa.
it was divided into  <dig> linkage groups corresponding to the number of spinach chromosomes.
some reports on the sex labeling and localization of spinach in the study of molecular markers have surfaced.
besides, the combination of bulked segregation analysis  with slaf-seq technology was employed to generate the linkage markers with the sex-determining gene.
