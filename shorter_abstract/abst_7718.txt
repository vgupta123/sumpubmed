both acyltransferases preferred 18:1-lpe over 16:0-lpe as acceptor and preferred palmitoyl-coa as acyl donor in combination with 18:1-lpe.
two previously uncharacterized arabidopsis genes that encode proteins with acyltransferase plsc regions were selected for study based on their sequence similarity to a recently identified lung lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase .
to identify their substrate specificity and biochemical properties, the two arabidopsis acyltransferases, designated atlpeat <dig>  , and atlpeat <dig>  were expressed in yeast knockout lines ale <dig> and slc <dig> that are deficient in microsomal lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase activities.
expression of atlpeat <dig> in the yeast knockout ale <dig> background exhibited strong acylation activity of lysophosphatidylethanolamine  and lysophosphatidate  with lower activity on lysophosphatidylcholine  and lysophosphatidylserine .
in conclusion it is suggested that the two atlpeats, with their different biochemical and expression properties, have different roles in membrane metabolism/homoeostasis.
