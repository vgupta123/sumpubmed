in silico analysis of hoxc <dig> showed predominance of α helices and presence of six conserved domains.
we deduced the putative 3d structure of hoxc <dig> protein and fifteen possible dna interacting residues within the homeodomain.
the hox proteins are transcriptional factors involved in regulation of pattern formation of the anterio-posterior body axis across the species.
the recombinant hoxc <dig> protein expressed as inclusion bodies was solubilized in tris buffer  and purified using ni-nta affinity column.
electrophoretic mobility shift assay  demonstrated the specific binding of hoxc <dig> protein with the promoter element, ce-lph <dig> of lactase-phlorizin hydrolase  gene showing reduced mobility of the protein-dna complex, corroborating with earlier report on the possible role of this protein in intestinal functions.
the purity and molecular weight of hoxc <dig> protein  were confirmed by sds-page and western blot analysis.
western blot analysis showed highest expression of hoxc <dig> protein in kidney and lung although its possible renal and respiratory roles are not yet established.
however, expression pattern of homeobox c <dig>  gene in the 5′ region, particularly in higher mammals remains largely unexplored.
employing immunohistochemistry approach, we localized hoxc <dig> protein in the nuclei across the tissues of buffalo.
we cloned and expressed homeobox c <dig>  gene from water buffalo bubalus bubalis.
most of the hox family genes have been studied with respect to their organization and expression during the embryonic stages.
present study augments our understanding on the specific expression of hoxc <dig> protein in kidney and lung in water buffalo.
