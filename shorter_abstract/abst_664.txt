it appears, therefore, that the residual structure has no influence on the kinetic stability of the native protein.
however, kinetic studies performed over a relatively wide temperature range revealed a complex unfolding mechanism comprising up to three observable phases, with largely different time constants, each accompanied by changes in secondary structure.
however, reported evidence points to the presence of residual structure in the denatured monomer at high temperature.
thermally denatured ytim showed a clear trend towards the formation of aggregation-prone, β-strand-like residual structure when ph decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> , even though thermal unfolding profiles retained a simple monophasic appearance regardless of ph.
this kinetic complexity is, however, not linked to the appearance of residual structure.
however, the presence of residual structure is clearly associated with increased irreversibility.
β-strand-type residual structure, which appears below ph  <dig> , is likely to be associated with increased irreversible aggregation of the unfolded protein.
besides, a simple sequential mechanism is unlikely to explain the observed variation of amplitudes and rate constants with temperature.
the slow temperature-induced unfolding of yeast tim shows three kinetic phases.
thermal unfolding scans suggest that no stable intermediates appear in the unfolding of ytim.
