monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation.
transduction efficiency was assessed using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.
flow cytometric analysis showed with all mois a peak shift corresponding to the presence of egfp-positive cells.
the objective of this study was to determine transduction efficiency of two hiv-based lentiviral vector configurations as delivery systems for the transduction of primary human blood monocyte-derived macrophages.
on day  <dig>  all transduced cultures showed egfp-positive cells by microscopy.
thus, transductions performed with vrx <dig> showed a higher number of egfp-positive cells than vrx <dig>
human blood monocytes were transduced using two vsv-g pseudotyped hiv- <dig> based lentiviral vectors containing egfp expression driven by either native hiv-ltr  or ef1Î± promoters .
lentiviral vectors were added to cultured macrophages at different times and multiplicities of infection .
this report shows that vsv-g pseudotyped hiv-based lentiviral vectors can efficiently transduce human blood monocyte-derived macrophages early during differentiation using low particle numbers that do not interfere with differentiation of monocytes into macrophages.
macrophages transduced between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after culturing showed the highest transduction efficiency at 2-hours transduction time.
for vrx <dig>  transduction efficiency was maximal at an moi of  <dig> to  <dig> and ranged between  <dig> and 67%.
for vrx <dig>  transduction efficiency was maximal at an moi of  <dig> and ranged between  <dig> and 90%.
