results of cytotoxicity like hemolytic and brine shrimp lethality tests suggested that ca-alginate immobilized mnp may effectively be used for detoxification of dyes and industrial effluents.
the enhanced catalytic potential of immobilized mnp led to  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig> % decolorization of sandal-fix red c4bln, sandal-fix turq blue gwf, sandal-fix foron blue e2bln, sandal-fix black ckf and sandal-fix golden yellow crl dyes, respectively.
in present study, a promising and eco‐friendly entrapment approach was adopted to immobilize purified manganese peroxidase  produced from an indigenous strain of ganoderma lucidum ibl- <dig> on ca-alginate beads.
mnp isolated from solid-state culture of g. lucidum ibl- <dig>  presented highest immobilization yield  using alginate beads prepared at optimized conditions of  <dig> %  sodium alginate,  <dig> %  calcium chloride  and  <dig>  mg/ml enzyme concentration.
g. lucidum mnp was immobilized in ca-alginate beads by entrapment method to improve its practical effectiveness.
furthermore, immobilized mnp also caused a significant reduction in biochemical oxygen demand  , chemical oxygen demand  , and total organic carbon   of aqueous dye solutions.
ca-alginate bound mnp was catalytically more vigorous, thermo-stable, reusable and worked over wider ranges of ph and temperature as compared to its free counterpart.
immobilization of mnp enhanced optimum temperature but caused acidic shift in optimum ph of the enzyme.

the immobilized mnp showed optimum activity at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> °c as compared to ph  <dig>  and  <dig> °c for free enzyme.
