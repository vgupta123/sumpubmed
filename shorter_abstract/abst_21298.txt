this analysis offers an alternate approach for increasing true positive rates, while decreasing false positive rates and hence improving the chip-seq peak identification process.
we define two methods to merge and rescore the regions of two peak detection systems and analyze the performance based on average precision and coverage of transcription start sites.
the results indicate that chip-seq peak detection can be improved by fusion using score or rank combination.
many peak detection systems have been developed; in this study, we utilize the following six: cisgenome, macs, peakseq, quest, sissrs, and trlocator.
our method of combination and fusion analysis would provide a means for generic assessment of available technologies and systems and assist researchers in choosing an appropriate system  for analyzing chip-seq data.
due to the recent rapid development in chip-seq technologies, which uses high-throughput next-generation dna sequencing to identify the targets of chromatin immunoprecipitation, there is an increasing amount of sequencing data being generated that provides us with greater opportunity to analyze genome-wide protein-dna interactions.
