this software was developed using java and runs on linux, windows, and mac os x. please contact ayums@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp if you are interested in the application.
ayums is a useful software tool for comprehensive quantitation of the proteome data generated by lc-ms/ms analysis.
using this algorithm, we developed a software tool named ayums that automatically identifies the peaks corresponding to differentially labeled peptides, compares these peaks, calculates each of the peak ratios in mixed samples, and integrates them into one data sheet.
relative quatitation can easily be performed by calculating the ratio of peak intensities corresponding to differentially labeled peptides in the ms spectrum.
recent lc-ms/ms  technology, in combination with the silac  method, has enabled us to make relative quantitation at the proteome level.
this software has enabled us to dramatically save time for generation of the final report.
