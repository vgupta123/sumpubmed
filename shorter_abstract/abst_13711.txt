genomic selection showed a three times higher prediction accuracy for fhb than stb disease severity for test sets largely unrelated to the training sets.
with the aim to further elucidate the genetic architecture underlying fhb and stb resistance, we phenotyped  <dig> european wheat hybrids and their  <dig> parental lines for fhb and stb disease severities and determined genotypes at  <dig>  single-nucleotide polymorphic loci.
our findings suggest that the genetic architecture is less complex and, hence, can be more properly tackled to perform accurate prediction for fhb than stb disease severity.
consequently, fhb disease severity is an interesting model trait to fine-tune genomic selection models exploiting beyond relatedness also knowledge of the genetic architecture.
