the plda gene will be phylogenetically compared to other housekeeping  genes, and a possible origin via horizontal gene transfer  will be evaluated through both intra- and inter-species evolutionary analyses.
horizontal gene transfer was inferred based on significantly different gc contents, the codon adaptation index, and a phylogenetic conflict between a tree of ompla protein sequences representing  <dig> species and a tree of the atpa hk protein for  <dig> species.
our results indicate that the bacterium is preserving the function of ompla, although some sites are still being evolutionarily optimized.
in this study, plda gene sequences were phylogenetically analyzed and compared with a large reference set of concatenated hk gene sequences.
several conserved helicobacter pylori genes have distinct genotypes in different parts of the world, biogeographic patterns that can be analyzed through phylogenetic trees.
although a vast majority of the residues in ompla were predicted to be under purifying selection, sites undergoing positive selection were also found.
our findings indicate that the plda gene could have been more recently acquired than seven of the hk genes found in h. pylori.
the current study will shed light on the importance of the plda gene in h. pylori.
in the past decade, researchers have proposed that the plda gene for outer membrane phospholipase a  is important for bacterial colonization of the human gastric ventricle.
in silico sequence analysis will be used to investigate whether the bacteria are in the process of preserving, optimizing, or rejecting the plda gene.
both hk and plda genes showed biogeographic clustering.
however, the common biogeographic patterns of both the hk and plda sequences indicated that the transfer occurred long ago.
