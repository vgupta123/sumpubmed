membrane components including purinergic receptors are already known to mediate cellular contact and aggregation in platelets.
our results suggesting a potential role for p2y <dig> protein in cell junction/communication and development, are totally innovative for the cns.
at postnatal day  <dig>  we find that p2y <dig> receptor in addition to purkinje neurons, is abundant on neuronal specializations identified as noradrenergic by anatomical, morphological and biochemical features.
p2y <dig> receptor is found enriched in membrane microdomains such as lipid rafts, in cerebellar synaptic vesicles, and is moreover visualized on synaptic varicosities by electron microscopy analysis.
in this work, we describe the cellular and subcellular presence of metabotropic p2y <dig> receptor in rat cerebellum at two distinct developmental ages, by means of immunofluorescence-confocal and electron microscopy as well as western blotting and direct membrane separation techniques.
p2y <dig> receptor immunoreactivity colocalizes with dopamine Î²-hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, neurofilament light chain, synaptophysin and flotillin, but not with glial fibrillary acidic protein for astrocytes.
when examined at postnatal day  <dig>  p2y <dig> receptor immunoreactivity is instead predominantly expressed only on bergmann and astroglial cells, as shown by colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein rather then neuronal markers.
in the cns, several p <dig> receptors for extracellular nucleotides are identified on neurons and glial cells to participate to neuron-neuron, glia-glia and glia-neuron communication.
