furthermore, a bias for specific bases within the first four positions at the site of insertion was revealed.
insertion site bias, or lack thereof, has not been demonstrated for cr <dig>  recent cr <dig> retrotranspositions were used to examine flanking regions for gc content and nucleotide bias at the insertion site.
these young cr1s are flanked by regions of low gc content .
our data suggest that cr <dig> is not inserting into regions of higher gc content within the coscoroba genome; but rather, preferentially inserting into regions of lower gc content.
the number of octomer repeats associated with a cr <dig> element increases after insertion with cr1s having one octomer being youngest.
furthermore, there appears to be a base preference  for the insertion site.
this study focused on those loci where the insertion event has been most recent, as this would tend to minimize noise introduced by post-integration mutational events.
the results of this study increase the current level of understanding regarding the elusive cr <dig> non-ltr retrotransposon.
elucidation of the exact octomer repeat sequence  allowed for the identification of younger insertion events.
