these results strongly suggest that histone h <dig> k <dig> acetylation plays a role in the expression of histone genes.
in this analysis we designed specific pcr primers for each histone h2a transcript and studied the expression levels and patterns using quantitative rt-pcr .
the replication-dependent histone h2a genes have different expression levels but similar expression patterns.
the chip-qpcr analysis showed that histone h <dig> k <dig> acetylation levels in promoter regions of both h2afz and hist3h2a are clearly higher than that in the promoter region of hist1h2aa.
among  <dig> replication-dependent h2a genes, the expression level of hist3h2a was highest.
in addition, we compared histone h <dig> k <dig> acetylation levels in the promoter regions of h2a genes by chip  â€“ quantitative pcr  analysis.
at least  <dig> replication-dependent histone h2a genes are distributed in  <dig> hist gene clusters on different chromosomes of the mouse genome.
