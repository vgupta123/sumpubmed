as a component of the tic complex, it is believed to form a preprotein-conducting channel across the inner membrane.
this method resulted in the recombinant protein being directed to the bacterial membrane without the addition of a bacterial targeting sequence.
we report a method for producing large amounts of recombinant attic <dig> using a codon-optimized strain of e. coli coupled with an autoinduction method of protein expression.
the arabidopsis thaliana protein attic <dig> is a key component of the protein import machinery at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts.
furthermore, we present evidence that the extramembranous n-terminus of the mature protein displays characteristics that are consistent with it being an intrinsically disordered protein domain.
