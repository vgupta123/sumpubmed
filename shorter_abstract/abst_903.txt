these bont/b-specific abs induced by nasal immunization were generally supported in large part by th <dig> cells, as opposed to hcβtre-immunized mice that showed more mixed th <dig> and th <dig> cells.
these results demonstrate that hcβtre-based immunogens are highly immunogenic, especially when genetically fused to ad2f, and ad2f can be exploited as a vaccine delivery platform to the mucosa.
in combination with the mucosal adjuvant, cholera toxin , enhanced mucosal iga and serum igg ab titers were induced by nasal hcβtre-ad2f relative to hcβtre alone; however, similar ab titers were obtained upon intramuscular immunization.
immunization with recombinant carboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chain  of botulinum neurotoxin  stimulates protective immunity against native bont challenge.
most studies developing a botulism vaccine have focused on the whole hc; however, since the principal protective epitopes are located within β-trefoil domain , we hypothesize that immunization with the hcβtre domain is sufficient to confer protective immunity.
using a mouse neutralization assay, sera from animals immunized with hcβtre and hcβtre-ad2f protected mice against  <dig>  ld <dig>
