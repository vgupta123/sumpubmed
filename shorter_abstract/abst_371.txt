a plasmid encoding the bioluminescent ca2+ probe aequorin was introduced into mesorhizobium loti usda 3147t strain to investigate whether a ca2+ response is activated in rhizobia upon perception of plant root exudates.
only root exudates from the homologous host lotus japonicus induce ca2+ signalling and downstream activation of nodulation genes.
during the interaction between rhizobia and leguminous plants the two partners engage in a molecular conversation that leads to reciprocal recognition and ensures the beginning of a successful symbiotic integration.
we find that m. loti cells respond to environmental and symbiotic cues through transient elevations in intracellular free ca2+ concentration.
in rhizobia it is not yet known whether ca2+ can act as a transducer of symbiotic signals.
