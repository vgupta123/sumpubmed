further, a secondary set of sequences not to be amplified by any primer pair may be uploaded.
in many contexts, researchers need specific primers for all sequences in a family such that each primer set amplifies only its target sequence and none of the others, e.g.
primers with high sequence similarity to non-target sequences are selected against.
to detect which transcription factor out of a family of very similar proteins that is present in a sample, or to design diagnostic assays for the identification of pathogen strains.
this paper presents primique, a new graphical, user-friendly, fast, web-based tool which solves the problem: it designs specific primers for each sequence in an uploaded set.
results are presented in interactive tables, and various primer properties are listed and displayed graphically.
