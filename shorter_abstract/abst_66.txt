most importantly, elevated mir-148a level in gastric cancer tissues was strongly correlated with distant metastasis, organ and peritoneal invasion and reduced survival rate.
this study provides a novel method to identify active oncomirs and their potential functions in gastric cancer progression.
the present data suggest that mir-148a could be a potential prognostic biomarker of gastric cancer and function as a tumor suppressor through repressing the activity of its regulated pin.
the potential functions of mirnas were determined by functional enrichment analysis and the activities of mirna-regulated pins were evaluated by the co-expression of protein-protein interactions .
we integrated the expression profiles of mirna and mrna with the human pin to reveal mirna-regulated pin in specific biological conditions.
they play important roles in cancer progression.
we uncovered several mirna-regulated networks which were enriched with functions related to cancer progression.
