the ripening of fleshy fruits is a complex developmental program characterized by extensive transcriptomic and metabolic remodeling in the pericarp tissues  making unripe green fruits soft, tasteful and colored.
h2o <dig> peak in sample skins at véraison was confirmed by in vitro quantification and was supported by the concomitant increase of catalase activity.
in grapevine and tomato, which are classified as non-climacteric and climacteric species respectively, the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide  and extensive modulation of reactive oxygen species  scavenging enzymes at the onset of ripening has been reported, suggesting that ros could participate to the regulatory network of fruit development.
the onset of ripening is regulated by a plethora of endogenous signals tuned to external stimuli.
membrane peroxidation was also observed by hplc-ms on galactolipid species at véraison.
a lipoxygenase , expressed at véraison and localizing inside the chloroplasts, was indeed able to catalyze membrane galactolipid peroxidation when overexpressed in tobacco leaves.
mono- and digalactosyl diacylglycerols were found peroxidized on one or both α-linolenic fatty acid chains, with a  <dig> absolute configuration implying the action of a specific enzyme.
ros-specific staining allowed to visualize not only h2o <dig> but also singlet oxygen  in berry skin cells just before color change in distinct subcellular locations, i.e.
this paper also reports the transient galactolipid peroxidation carried out by a véraison-specific chloroplastic lipoxygenase.
