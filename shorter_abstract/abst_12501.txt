similar results were obtained for β-alanine.
our results suggest that different heterologous expression systems can dramatically influence the agonist pharmacology of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors.
however, taurine efficacy was dramatically reduced in l-cell fibroblasts.
the efficacy of these partial agonists was also strongly reduced by the beta subunit.
finally, disruption of the tubulin cytoskeleton reduced the efficacy of partial agonists in a subunit-dependent, but system-independent, fashion.
while exploring pharmacological properties of alpha2beta glycine receptors compared to alpha2-homomers, we found that distinct heterologous expression systems appeared to differentially influence partial agonist pharmacology.
we conclude that complex interactions between receptor composition and extrinsic factors may play a significant role in determining strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor partial agonist pharmacology.
the β-amino acid taurine possessed 30–50% efficacy for alpha2-containing receptor isoforms when expressed in hek  <dig> cells.
nor did relative levels of expression correlate with partial agonist efficacy when compared within or between several different expression systems.
there were no significant differences in apparent strychnine affinity values calculated from concentration-response data between expression systems or subunit combinations.
strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in many adult forebrain regions consist of alpha <dig> + beta heteromeric channels.
this subunit composition is distinct from the alpha <dig> + beta channels found throughout the adult spinal cord.
