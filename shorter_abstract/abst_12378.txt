winhap <dig> is an extremely fast haplotype phasing program which can handle a large-scale genotyping study with any number of snps in the current literature and at least in the near future.
by replacing the computation-intensive step of constructing the maximum spanning tree with a heuristics of estimated initial haplotype, we released the winhap algorithm version  <dig> , which outperforms the other algorithms in terms of both running speed and overall accuracy.
this work further speeds up the winhap algorithm to version  <dig>   by utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy and the openmp parallel computing mode.
the haplotype phasing problem tries to screen for phenotype associated genomic variations from millions of candidate data.
