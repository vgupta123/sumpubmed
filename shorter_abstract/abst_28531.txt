quantification of the antimicrobial glycerol derivative, reuterin, was assessed in order to document the antipathogenic potential of probiotic biofilms.
l. reuteri biofilms differed in the quantities of reuterin secreted in this physiological state.
l. reuteri biofilms secreted factors that confer specific health benefits such as immunomodulation and pathogen inhibition.
immunomodulatory activities of biofilms were demonstrated by the abilities of specific l. reuteri strains to suppress human tnf production by lps-activated monocytoid cells.
future probiotic selection strategies should consider a strain's ability to perform beneficial functions as a biofilm.
