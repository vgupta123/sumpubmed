akin10-mediated phosphorylation did not affect the subcellular localization and dna-binding property of idd <dig>  instead, the transcriptional activation activity of the phosphorylated idd <dig> was significantly reduced.
notably, snrk1-overexpressing plants and idd8-deficient mutants exhibit similar phenotypes, including delayed flowering, suggesting that snrk <dig> is involved in the idd8-mediated metabolic control of flowering.
in this signaling scheme, the snrk <dig> signals are directly integrated into the idd8-mediated gene regulatory network that governs flowering transition in response to fluctuations in sugar metabolism, further supporting the metabolic control of flowering.
it is known that sugar metabolism and allocation between different physiological functions is intimately associated with flowering transition in many plant species.
our data show that snrk <dig> and its substrate idd <dig> constitute a sugar metabolic pathway that mediates the timing of flowering under sugar deprivation conditions.
meanwhile, it has been reported that sucrose nonfermenting-1-related protein kinase  <dig> , which acts as a sensor of cellular energy metabolism, is activated by sugar deprivation.
we examined whether the sugar deprivation-sensing snrk <dig> is functionally associated with idd <dig> in flowering time control through biochemical and molecular genetic approaches.
sugar plays a central role as a source of carbon metabolism and energy production and a signaling molecule in diverse growth and developmental processes and environmental adaptation in plants.
together, these observations indicate that akin <dig> antagonizes the idd <dig> function in flowering time control, a notion that is consistent with the delayed flowering phenotypes of akin10-overexpressing plants and idd8- <dig> mutant.
the indeterminate domain -containing transcription factor idd <dig> regulates flowering time by modulating sugar metabolism and transport under sugar-limiting conditions in arabidopsis.
overproduction of akin <dig>  the catalytic subunit of snrk <dig>  delayed flowering in arabidopsis, as was observed in idd8-deficient idd8- <dig> mutant.
