the software is open source and freely available at http://amplimethprofiler.sourceforge.net.
amplimethprofiler tool provides an easy and user friendly way to extract and analyze the epihaplotype composition of reads from targeted bisulfite sequencing experiments.
cpg sites in an individual molecule may exist in a binary state  and each individual dna molecule, containing a certain number of cpgs, is a combination of these states defining an epihaplotype.
here we present amplimethprofiler, a python-based pipeline for the extraction and statistical epihaplotype analysis of amplicons from targeted deep bisulfite sequencing of multiple dna regions.
epihaplotype based approaches, on the other hand, allow methylation profiles of cell populations to be studied at the single molecule level.
currently available tools for methylation analysis lack output formats that explicitly report cpg methylation profiles at the single molecule level and that have suited statistical tools for their interpretation.

it can be run on linux and os x platforms.
amplimethprofiler is written in python language and requires a local installation of blast and  qiime tools.
