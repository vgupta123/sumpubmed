our data show that intra- and interspecies gene expression models can successfully predict response in canine os, which may improve outcome in dogs and serve as pre-clinical validation for similar methods in human cancer research.
models were built and evaluated using microarray gene expression and drug sensitivity data from human and canine cancer cell lines, and canine os tumor datasets.
we evaluated the use of gene-expression based models built in an intra- or interspecies manner to predict chemosensitivity and treatment outcome in canine os.
the best carboplatin model utilized canine lines for gene identification and model training, with canine os tumor data for co-expression.
models were built using linear discriminant analysis via the misclassification penalized posterior algorithm.
the best doxorubicin model involved genes identified in human lines that were co-expressed and trained on canine os tumor data, which accurately predicted clinical outcome in 73 % of dogs .
genomics-based predictors of drug response have the potential to improve outcomes associated with cancer therapy.
dogs whose treatment matched our predictions had significantly better clinical outcomes than those that didn’t , and this predictor significantly associated with longer disease free intervals in a cox multivariate analysis .
