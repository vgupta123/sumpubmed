semantic errors elicited an n <dig>  followed by a late positivity in all groups.
although deaf learners have learned german as an l <dig> mainly via the visual modality they seem to engage comparable processing mechanisms as hearing l <dig> learners.
in native speakers of german, verb-agreement violations were followed by a left lateralized negativity, which has been associated with an automatic parsing process.
the present study compared the neural correlates of an intramodally and a crossmodally acquired second language .
two types of violations were realized: either a semantically implausible noun or a violation of subject-verb number agreement was embedded at a sentence medial position.
deaf people who had learned their l <dig>  german sign language , and their l <dig>  german, through the visual modality were compared with hearing l <dig> learners of german and german native speakers.
