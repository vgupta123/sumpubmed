a significant positive correlation between salmonella spp.
further studies on the epidemiology, molecular characterization and pathogenesis of salmonella and oxyurids are needed to assess the actual impact of these organisms, as single or associated infections, on tortoises and on other exotic pets.
these organisms are routinely isolated in healthy tortoises, although heavy infections may cause significant pathology.
our results suggest that caution should be exercised in translocation, husbandry, and human contact with tortoises and other exotic pets.
and oxyurids in  <dig> tortoises was conducted in southern italy and a possible correlation between the two pathogens was therefore investigated.
a survey of the prevalence of salmonella spp.
