4) an effect of manifestation on the distribution of the gamma network: in patients with a tinnitus history of less than  <dig> years, the left temporal cortex was predominant in the gamma network whereas in patients with tinnitus duration of more than  <dig> years, the gamma network was more widely distributed including more frontal and parietal regions.
long-range coupling in the alpha frequency band was decreased for tinnitus patients while long-range gamma coupling was increased.
furthermore we discuss the impact of this finding to tinnitus therapies using transcranial magnetic stimulation .
the analysis was based on a sample of  <dig> participants:  <dig> patients with chronic tinnitus and  <dig> healthy control participants.
consequently, in a quiet environment, tinnitus patients differ from control participants because they constantly perceive a sound whereas controls do not.
we found: 1) for tinnitus patients: a significant decrease of inter-areal coupling in the alpha  band and an increase of inter-areal coupling in the 48â€“ <dig> hz gamma frequency range relative to the control group.
subjective tinnitus is characterized by an auditory phantom perception in the absence of any physical sound source.
2) for both groups: an inverse relationship  of the alpha and gamma network coupling.
3) a discrimination of 83% between the patient and the control group based on the alpha and gamma networks.
we propose a tinnitus model that integrates this finding in the current knowledge about tinnitus.
these changes discriminate well between tinnitus and control participants.
