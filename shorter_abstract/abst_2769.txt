our genome-wide expression analysis identified a set of genes whose differential expression may be attributed to the genetic alterations associated with tumor formation and malignant growth.
notably, our est-based data mining procedure indicated that most of the changes in gene expression observed in cancer cells corresponded to gene inactivation patterns.
our validation result showed increased protein levels of bcl-xl in two different liver cancer specimens compared to normal liver.
chromosomes and chromosomal regions most frequently associated with aberrant expression changes in cancer libraries were also determined.
genes differentially expressed in normal versus tumor tissues were identified using a computer-based differential display strategy.
through the description of several candidates , our study illustrates the utility of in silico transcriptomics to identify tumor cell signatures, tumor-related genes and chromosomal regions frequently associated with aberrant expression in cancer.
we propose complete lists of genes that may serve as targets for projects seeking novel candidates for cancer diagnosis and therapy.
the aim of this study was to scan for such genes by whole-genome in silico subtraction using expressed sequence tag  data.
bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic member of the bcl- <dig> family, was selected for confirmation by western blot analysis.
