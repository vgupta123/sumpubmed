the “one-step” bpmv vector system therefore enables rapid and simple functional studies in common bean, and could be suitable for large-scale analyses.
however, as common bean is recalcitrant to stable genetic transformation, much work remains to be done for the development of functional genomics tools adapted to large-scale studies.
we used a bpmv-gfp construct to detect the spatial and temporal infection patterns of bpmv in vegetative and reproductive tissues.
here we report the successful implementation of an efficient viral vector system for foreign gene expression, virus-induced gene silencing  and genetic mapping of a bpmv resistance gene in common bean, using a “one-step” bpmv vector originally developed in soybean.
over the last two years, considerable advances have been made in common bean  genomics, especially with the completion of the genome sequence and the availability of rnaseq data.
with the goal of developing this vector for high-throughput vigs studies in common bean, we optimized the conditions for rub-inoculation of infectious bpmv-derived plasmids in common bean cv.
in the post-genomic era, these advances are timely for the common bean research community.
we then tested the susceptibility to bpmv of six cultivars, and found that only black valentine and jaloeep <dig> were susceptible to bpmv.
vigs of the phytoene desaturase  marker gene was successfully achieved with recombinant bpmv vectors carrying fragments ranging from  <dig> to 391 bp.
