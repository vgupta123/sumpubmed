therefore, survival at high-altitude may be facilitated by physiological mechanisms that permit faster growth rates, allowing completion of larval development within a shorter time period, alleviating the need for adaptations that extend the time available for larval growth.
we found that breeding did not occur below 5°c at any site and there was no significant relationship between breeding temperature and altitude, leading to a delay in spawning of five days for every 100 m increase in altitude.
the aim of this study was to assess the behavioural and physiological responses that facilitate survival in low-temperature environments.
; and 2) do tadpoles sampled from high-altitude sites differ physiologically from those from low-altitude sites, in terms of routine metabolic rate  and freeze tolerance?
the relationship between altitude and rmr varied by mountain but was lower for individuals sampled from high- than low-altitude sites within the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites .
in particular, we asked: 1) do high-altitude common frog  adults extend the time available for larval growth by breeding at lower temperatures than low-altitude individuals?
our results suggest that adults at high-altitude do not show behavioural adaptations in terms of breeding at lower temperatures.
ectotherms are particularly sensitive to low-temperature environments, which can result in a reduced activity period, slowed physiological processes and increased exposure to sub-zero temperatures.
extreme environments can impose strong ecological and evolutionary pressures at a local level.
