it is non-energy-based, and docking is, instead, scored by counting the occurrences of motifs of protein-ligand interaction networks constructed using structures of protein-ligand complexes.
in conventional scoring functions, energy terms modeling pairwise interactions are cumulatively summed, and the best docking solution is selected.
many of the top motifs, which comprise a multitude of chemical groups that interact simultaneously and make a highly significant contribution to motifscore, capture recurrent interacting patterns beyond pairwise interactions.
in this benchmark test, 84% of the highest-scored docking conformations had root-mean-square deviations  below  <dig>  Ã… from the native conformation, which is comparable with the best of several energy-based docking scoring functions.
here, we propose to transform protein-ligand interactions into three-dimensional geometric networks, from which recurring network substructures, or network motifs, are selected and used to provide probability-ranked interaction templates with which to score docking solutions.
