our results provide the first characterization of dlk <dig> transcripts, map the location of the dlk <dig> core promoter, and show the role of sp <dig> as a key regulator of dlk <dig> transcription, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the expression of the dlk <dig> gene.
in silico analysis revealed that dlk <dig> possesses a tata-less promoter containing minimal promoter elements associated with a cpg island, and sequences for inr and dpe elements.
first, we analyzed the dlk <dig> transcripts expressed by several mouse cells lines and tissues, and mapped the transcription start site by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends.
the goal of this work was the characterization of dlk <dig> mrna, as well as the analysis of the mechanisms that control its basal transcription.
the expression of the gene dlk <dig> is coordinated with that of dlk <dig> in several tissues and cell lines.
