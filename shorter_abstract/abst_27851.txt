we show that the concept of computational subtraction can be used to identify transgenic cdna sequences from genetically modified plants.
we believe that computational subtraction represents a powerful new strategy for determining if an organism has been genetically modified as well as to define the nature of the modification.
our datasets include 454-type sequences from a transgenic line of arabidopsis thaliana and published est datasets from commercially relevant species .
