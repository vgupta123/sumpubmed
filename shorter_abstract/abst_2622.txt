there are still numerous protein subfamilies within families and superfamilies that do not yet have conclusive empirical experimental evidence providing a specific function.
sequence alignments identified seven highly conserved residues , of which several have been implicated with n-acyltransferase activity in previously characterized examples.
the implication of residues previously characterized to be important for n-acyltransferase activity to hemolytic activity for the cog <dig> family members of the n-acyltransferase provides validation of the correct placement of the hemolytic capability annotation within the n-acyltransferase superfamily.
here, we report the characterization of one such protein produced by the pathogenic soil bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei, bpsl <dig>  which provided evidence for putative hemolysins in the cog <dig> family to have experimentally validated hemolytic activity.
both the r <dig> and r <dig> mutants resulted in a loss of hemolytic activity while mutations at the other five positions resulted in either reduction or increment in hemolytic activity.
