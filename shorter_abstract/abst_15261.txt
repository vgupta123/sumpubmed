analysis of mrna abundance in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from six mycobacterium bovis infected cattle and six non-infected controls was performed.
these results suggest that large-scale expression profiling can identify gene signatures of disease in peripheral blood that can be used to classify animals on the basis of in vivo infection, in the absence of exogenous antigenic stimulation.
lower relative expression of key innate immune genes, including the toll-like receptor  <dig>  and tlr <dig> genes, lack of differential expression of indicator adaptive immune gene transcripts , and lower bola major histocompatibility complex – class i  and class ii  gene expression was consistent with innate immune gene repression in the btb-infected animals.
in total,  <dig> gene features were differentially expressed at the p ≤  <dig>  level in bovine tuberculosis -infected and control animals, of which  <dig> were expressed at lower levels  in the infected group.
supervised hierarchical cluster analysis and class prediction validation identified a panel of  <dig> genes predictive of disease status and selected gene transcripts were validated  by real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr.
the advent of high-throughput functional genomics technologies has facilitated large-scale analyses of the immune response to this disease that may ultimately lead to novel diagnostics and therapeutic targets.
a targeted immunospecific bovine cdna microarray with duplicated spot features representing  <dig>  genes was used to test the hypothesis that a distinct gene expression profile may exist in m. bovis infected animals in vivo.
bovine tuberculosis is an enduring disease of cattle that has significant repercussions for human health.
