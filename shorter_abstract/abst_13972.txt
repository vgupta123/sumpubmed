among the early fine-tuned components, are proteins involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, chlorophyll catabolism, protein import, folding and turnover, synthesis and membrane insertion of photosynthetic subunits.
the group of genes differentially regulated in npq1lut <dig> is enriched in sequences encoding chloroplast proteins involved in cell protection against the damaging effect of ros.
we propose that the lack of zeaxanthin and lutein leads to 1o <dig> accumulation and this represents a signalling pathway in the early stages of stress acclimation, beside the response to adp/atp ratio and to the redox state of both plastoquinone pool.
up to now, the flu mutant was the only biological system adopted to define the regulation of gene expression by 1o <dig>  in this work, we propose the use of mutants accumulating 1o <dig> by mechanisms different from those activated in flu to better identify ros signalling.
biochemical analysis revealed that singlet oxygen  accumulated to higher levels in the mutant while other ros were unaffected, allowing to define the transcriptomic signature of the acclimatory response mediated by 1o <dig> which is enhanced by the lack of these xanthophylls species.
the mutant does not produce the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin, whose key roles include ros scavenging and prevention of ros synthesis.
reactive oxygen species  are unavoidable by-products of oxygenic photosynthesis, causing progressive oxidative damage and ultimately cell death.
