the genetic structure observed in poodles is the result of local mating patterns, implying that breed fragmentation may be different in different countries.
we studied patterns of genetic diversity within  <dig> poodles and compared it to  <dig> dogs from eight other breeds.
patterns of genetic diversity in other breeds suggest that assortative mating leading to fragmentation may be a common feature within many dog breeds.
breeds are considered to be uniform groups with similar physical characteristics, shaped by selection rooted in human preferences.
these characteristics are important for association mapping of candidate genes for diseases and therefore make dogs ideal models for gene mapping of human disorders.
this has led to a large genetic difference between breeds and a large extent of linkage disequilibrium within breeds.
our analyses revealed strong population structure within poodles, with differences among some poodle groups as pronounced as those among other well-recognized breeds.
instead, a novel set of five poodle groups was identified, defined by combinations of size and color, which is not officially recognized by the kennel clubs.
there are around  <dig> internationally recognized dog breeds in the world today, with a remarkable diversity in size, shape, color and behavior.
such pronounced structuring within dog breeds can increase the power of association mapping studies, but also represents a serious problem if ignored.
the same processes which have historically created dog breeds are still ongoing, and create further subdivision within current dog breeds.
matings have not taken place at random or within traditionally identified size classes in poodles.
however, genetic uniformity within breeds may not always be the case.
