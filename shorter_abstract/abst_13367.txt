all the samples used in the current study were genotyped for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms  located in the expected major sex-determining region in linkage group  <dig> .
sex determination in the widely farmed nile tilapia  is complex, involving genomic regions on at least three chromosomes  and interacting in certain cases with elevated early rearing temperature as well.
accordingly, the control of phenotypic sex, and in particular the production of monosex cultures, is of particular interest to the aquaculture industry.
overall, the results from this study suggest that these previously undetected qtls are involved in sex determination in the nile tilapia, causing sex reversal  with respect to the xx genotype at the major sex-determining locus in lg  <dig>

the only misassigned individuals were phenotypic males with the expected female genotype, suggesting that those offspring had undergone sex-reversal with respect to the major sex-determining locus.
fish species often exhibit significant sexual dimorphism for commercially important traits.
thus, sex ratios may vary substantially from 50%.
this study focused on mapping sex-determining quantitative trait loci  in families with skewed sex ratios.
three genetic maps were constructed consisting of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  snps from the three largest families.
