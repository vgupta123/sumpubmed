do rat and mouse taste buds have the same cell types, sensory transduction markers and synaptic proteins?
mouse taste buds contain an average of  <dig>  taste cells vs  <dig>  taste cells in rat taste buds.
the average volume of a mouse taste bud  is smaller than a rat taste bud .
these results suggest that rats and mice differ significantly in the percentages of taste cells expressing signaling molecules.
numerous electrophysiological, ultrastructural, and immunocytochemical studies on rodent taste buds have been carried out on rat taste buds.
there are significant differences  between mouse and rat taste buds in the percentages of taste cells displaying immunoreactivity for all five markers.
rat taste buds display significantly more immunoreactivity than mice for plcβ <dig> , α-gustducin , and synaptobrevin- <dig> .
in recent years, however, the mouse has become the species of choice for molecular and other studies on sensory transduction in taste buds.
we also determined the numbers of taste cells in the taste buds as well as taste bud volume.
the numerical density of taste cells in mouse circumvallate taste buds  is significantly higher than that in the rat .
in the present study we have used antisera directed against plcβ <dig>  α-gustducin, serotonin , pgp  <dig>  and synaptobrevin- <dig> to determine the percentages of taste cells expressing these markers in taste buds in both rodent species.
