we related various physicochemical factors, including total phosphorus load, embayment area, and submerged vegetation, to differences in fish species diversity and community relative abundance, biomass, and size structure both among and within embayments.
the importance of total phosphorus loading and vegetation in structuring fish communities has implications for anthropogenic impacts to embayment fish communities through activities such as farming and residential development, reduction of cultural eutrophication, and shoreline development and maintenance.
yellow perch  and centrarchids numerically dominated most embayment fish communities.
phosphorus loading influenced relative biomass, but not species diversity or relative abundance.
fish relative abundance differed among embayments; within embayments, fish abundance at individual sampling stations increased significantly with submerged vegetative cover.
embayments differed in surface area and depth, varied in their connections to lake ontario and their watersheds, and drained watersheds representing a gradient of agricultural to forested land use.
relative biomass differed among embayments and was positively related to total phophorus loading and embayment area.
fish community size structure, based on size spectra analysis, differed among embayments, with the frequency of smaller-bodied fishes positively related to percent vegetation.
biomass was dominated by piscivorous fishes including brown bullhead , bowfin , and northern pike .
we explored how embayment watershed inputs, morphometry, and hydrology influence fish community structure among eight embayments located along the southeastern shoreline of lake ontario, new york, usa.
