a model consisting of a single pair of interacting agents predicted very different erk activation  profiles, depending on the formation rate and stability of intercellular contacts, with the slow formation of stable contacts resulting in low but sustained activation of erk, and transient contacts resulting in a transient erk signal.
this prediction was supported by immunolabelling of an epithelial cell population grown in vitro, which confirmed heterogeneity of erk activation.
we have developed a multi-scale computational model that accounts for emergent heterogeneity arising from the influences of intercellular signalling on individual cells within a population.
our approach was to develop an ode model of juxtacrine egfr-ligand activation of the mapk intracellular pathway and to couple this to an agent-based representation of individual cells in an expanding epithelial cell culture population.
these results illustrate that mean experimental data obtained from analysing entire cell populations is an oversimplification, and should not be extrapolated to deduce the signal:response paradigm of individual cells.
extension of this model to a population consisting of hundreds to thousands of interacting virtual cells revealed that the activated erk profile measured across the entire cell population was very different and may appear to contradict individual cell findings, reflecting heterogeneity in population density across the culture.
most mathematical models of biochemical pathways consider either signalling events that take place within a single cell in isolation, or an 'average' cell which is considered to be representative of a cell population.
