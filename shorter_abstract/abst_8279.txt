this service has removed one of the primary bottlenecks in metagenome sequence analysis â€“ the availability of high-performance computing for annotating the data.
the pipeline produces automated functional assignments of sequences in the metagenome by comparing both protein and nucleotide databases.
phylogenetic and functional summaries of the metagenomes are generated, and tools for comparative metagenomics are incorporated into the standard views.
