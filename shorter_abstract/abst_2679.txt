these may represent novel connections between iron overload and pathological manifestations of hh such as cardiomyopathy and diabetes.
microarray analysis revealed iron-induced changes in the expression of several genes involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, transcription and cellular stress responses.
hemojuvelin, an upstream regulator of hepcidin expression, is expressed in mice mainly in the heart and skeletal muscle.
it has been suggested that soluble hemojuvelin shed by the muscle might reach the liver to influence hepcidin expression.
therefore, we investigated the effect of iron overload on gene expression in skeletal muscle and heart using illuminaâ„¢ arrays containing over  <dig>  probes.
heart muscle is one of the target tissues affected by iron overload, with resultant cardiomyopathy in some hh patients.
genes with up-regulated expression after iron overload in both skeletal and heart muscle included angiopoietin-like  <dig>  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase  <dig> and calgranulin a and b. the expression of transferrin receptor, heat shock protein 1b and dnaj homolog b <dig> were down-regulated by iron in both muscle types.
the most apparent changes in gene expression were confirmed using real-time rt-pcr.
