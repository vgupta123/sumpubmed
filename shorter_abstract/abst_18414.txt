in this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate whether art-treated hiv-infected patients exhibit immunosenescence; and whether immunosenescence is associated with age-related processes of inflammation, metabolism, adipose tissue, and muscle.
klrg <dig> expression was associated with age, metabolic syndrome, visceral adipose tissue, and high muscle mass.
t cell immunosenescence and exhaustion were assessed by flow cytometry analysis of cd8+ cells from  <dig> art-treated hiv-infected patients  and ten controls using markers of differentiation: cd27/cd28; maturation: cd27/cd45ra; senescence: killer cell lectin-like receptor g <dig> ; and exhaustion: programmed death- <dig> .
cd8+ t cell maturation was associated with age.
relationships between cd8+ t cell immunosenescence, exhaustion, and age-related processes were assessed using linear regressions.
pd- <dig> and klrg <dig> expression did not differ between hiv+ and controls, but depended on differentiation and maturation stages of the cells.
hiv-infection strongly affected cd8+ t cell differentiation and maturation, whereas age-related processes were only weakly associated with immune parameters.
