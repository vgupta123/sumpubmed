to elucidate the defence responses activated by baba in potato, a genome-wide transcript microarray analysis in combination with label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of the apoplast secretome were performed two days after treatment of the leaf canopy with baba at two concentrations,  <dig> and 10 mm.
to aid analysis, we present a more comprehensive functional annotation of the microarray probes and gene models by retrieving information from orthologous gene families across  <dig> sequenced plant genomes.
a major accumulation of pr proteins was also evident, and in the mevalonate pathway, genes involved in sterol biosynthesis were down-regulated, whereas several enzymes involved in the sesquiterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis were up-regulated.
the new annotation provided go terms to  <dig> previously un-annotated probes.
β-aminobutyric acid  can induce resistance in a wide range of plants against several types of pathogens, including potato infected with phytophthora infestans.

however, the molecular mechanisms behind this are unclear and seem to be dependent on the system studied.
over  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed and over  <dig> secretome proteins changed in abundance indicating a massive activation of defence mechanisms with 10 mm baba, the concentration effective against late blight disease.
baba at 10 mm affected several processes related to plant hormones and amino acid metabolism.
