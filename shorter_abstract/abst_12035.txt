in the field of light microscopy, the bio-formats library was designed to translate such proprietary data formats to a common, open-source schema, enabling sharing and reproduction of scientific results.
the core of scifio is its modular definition of formats, the design of which clearly outlines the components of image i/o to encourage extensibility, facilitated by the dynamic discovery of the scijava plugin framework.
scifio  is presented as a freely available, open-source library unifying the mechanisms of reading and writing image data.
while bio-formats has proved successful for microscopy images, the greater scientific community was lacking a domain-independent framework for format translation.
