axial osteitis of the proximal sesamoid bones and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament has been described in friesian horses as well as in other breeds.
the objectives of this study were to review the outcome of clinical cases of this disease in friesian horses and analyse the pathology of the bone-ligament interface.
case records of friesian horses diagnosed with axial osteitis of the proximal sesamoid bones and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament in the period 2002- <dig> were retrospectively evaluated.
axial osteitis of the proximal sesamoid bones and desmitis of the intersesamoidean ligament in the hindlimb of friesian horses carries a poor prognosis.
post-mortem examination was performed on horses that were euthanized  and included macroscopic necropsy , high-field  magnetic resonance imaging  and histopathology .
in addition to bone resorption at the proximo-axial margin of the proximal sesamoid bones, magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology showed osteoporosis of the peripheral compact bone and spongious bone of the proximal sesamoid bones and chronic inflammation of the intersesamoidean ligament.
