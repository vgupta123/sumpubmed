although bioinformatic analysis has been conducted to detect polyadenylation sites using nucleic acid sequences  in the public databases, one special type, single-block est is much less emphasized.
in the present study, we identified novel transcript variants in the human genome by detecting intronic polyadenylation sites.
to verify that these sites are from expressed transcripts, we analyzed the supporting est number of each site, blasted representative ests against known mrna sequences, traced terminal sequences from cdna clones, and compared with the data of affymetrix tiling array.
our data provide a genome-wide resource for identification of novel human transcript variants with intronic polyadenylation sites, and offer a new view into the mystery of the human transcriptome.
the expression of these novel variants was confirmed with computational and experimental tools.
our results provide evidence for novel transcript variants with intronic poly sites.
this bias leaves a large space to discover novel transcript variants.
poly-tailed ests were obtained from single-block ests and clustered into  <dig>  groups standing for  <dig>  genes.
additionally, rt-pcr confirmed 38%  of predicted novel transcript variants.
