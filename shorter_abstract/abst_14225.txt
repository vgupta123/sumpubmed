these results also demonstrated low expression in the colon, kidney, and langerhans islets.
in addition, the results of real-time quantitative pcr confirmed a wide distribution for the car <dig> and car <dig> mrnas, whereas the expression of the car <dig> mrna was restricted to the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, and eye.
the distribution of carp viii covers vertebrates and deuterostomes, and carp x appears to be universal in the animal kingdom.
immunohistochemical analysis showed a high expression level of carp viii in the mouse cerebellum, cerebrum, and also moderate expression in the lung, liver, salivary gland, and stomach.
carp sequences have been strongly conserved between different species, and all three carps show high expression in the mouse brain and carp viii is also expressed in several other tissues.
carp x was moderately expressed in the cerebral capillaries and the lung and very weakly in the stomach and heart.
positive signals for carp xi were observed in the cerebellum, cerebrum, liver, stomach, small intestine, colon, kidney, and testis.
in this study, we analyzed and evaluated the distribution of genes encoding carps in different organisms using bioinformatic methods, and studied their expression in mouse tissues using immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative pcr.
we collected  <dig> sequences, of which  <dig> came from novel or improved gene models which we created from genome data.
our phylogenetic analysis showed that duplication of ca <dig> into ca <dig> has occurred only in tetrapods , whereas an independent duplication of ca <dig> was found in fishes.
carbonic anhydrases  are found in many organisms, in which they contribute to several important biological processes.
