at least  <dig> gh <dig> genes are expressed in a range of organs and stages of rice, based on the cdna and est sequences in public databases.
the cdna of the os4bglu <dig> gene, which encodes a protein identical at  <dig> of  <dig> amino acid residues with the n-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by rt-pcr from rice seedlings.
most of the genes appear to have been derived from duplications that occurred after the divergence of rice and arabidopsis thaliana lineages from their common ancestor, and the two plants share only  <dig> common gene lineages.
glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig>  β-glucosidases have been implicated in physiologically important processes in plants, such as response to biotic and abiotic stresses, defense against herbivores, activation of phytohormones, lignification, and cell wall remodeling.
to begin this analysis, os4bglu <dig> β-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism.
phylogenetic analysis revealed that gh <dig> members with closely related sequences have similar gene structures and are often clustered together on the same chromosome.
plant gh <dig> β-glucosidases are encoded by a multigene family, so we predicted the structures of the genes and the properties of their protein products, and characterized their phylogenetic relationship to other plant gh <dig> members, their expression and the activity of one of them, to begin to decipher their roles in rice.
