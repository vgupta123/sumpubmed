foxp <dig> expression was found to be elevated in and mainly expressed by the cd4+ t cell sub-population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and liver tissues of patients with hepatitis b. the intrahepatic expression of foxp <dig> strongly correlated with the copies of hbv dna and the concentration of surface antigen, hbsag.
moreover, foxp <dig> expression was strikingly correlated with the production of these cytokines in liver tissues of chb patients.
however, the molecular interplay of foxp <dig> and the il-23/il- <dig> pathway in patients with chronic hepatitis b  remains unclear.
constitutive activation of the il-23/ <dig> pathway, thus, may support the chronic hepatitis b state.
foxp <dig> protein plays a critical role in mediating the inflammatory response and can inhibit the proinflammatory il-23/il- <dig> pathway.
to this end, we analyzed the expression patterns of foxp3- and il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related proinflammatory cytokines in  <dig> patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure,  <dig> patients with chb and  <dig> healthy controls.
il-23/il- <dig> pathway-related proinflammatory cytokines were also found to be significantly increased in patients' liver tissues, as compared to healthy controls.
