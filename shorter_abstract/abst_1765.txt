using innovative statistical methods we compared genotype distributions and interactions of epas <dig> snps rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> between sprint/power athletes , endurance athletes , and controls  in polish and russian samples.
in the pooled cohort of polish and russian athletes, 1) rs <dig> was associated with sprint/power athletic status; the aa genotype in rs <dig> was underrepresented in the sprint/power athletes, 2) rs <dig> was also associated with sprint/power athletic status; the tt genotype in rs <dig> was underrepresented sprint/power athletes, and 3) the interaction between rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> was associated with sprint/power athletic performance; the combinations of the aa genotype in rs <dig> with either the ag or gg genotypes in rs <dig>  or with the ct or cc genotypes in rs <dig>  were underrepresented in two cohorts of sprint/power athletes.
the endothelial pas domain protein  <dig>  activates genes that are involved in erythropoiesis and angiogenesis, thus favoring a better delivery of oxygen to the tissues and is a plausible candidate to influence athletic performance.
based on the unique statistical model rs1867785/rs <dig> are strong predictors of sprint/power athletic status, and the interaction between rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> might contribute to success in sprint/power athletic performance.
