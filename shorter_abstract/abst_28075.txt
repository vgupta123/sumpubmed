although it is clear that genetic variation for compensation exists among plants, little is known about the specific genetic underpinnings leading to enhanced fitness.
in the current study, we measured the relative expression of  <dig> invertase genes over the course of plant development in the arabidopsis thaliana genotypes columbia- <dig> and landsberg erecta, which typically overcompensate and undercompensate, respectively, when damaged.
we report that columbia- <dig> significantly up-regulated  <dig> of  <dig> invertase genes when damaged relative to when undamaged, and ultimately overcompensated for fruit production.
landsberg erecta, in contrast, down-regulated two invertase genes following damage and suffered reduced fitness.
knockout mutants of two invertase genes both exhibited significant undercompensation for fruit production, exhibiting a complete reversal of the wild type col-4’s overcompensation.
we also compared the compensatory performances of a set of invertase knockout mutants to the columbia- <dig> wild type.
our previous study identified the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase  <dig>  as a key regulator contributing to the phenomenon of overcompensation via its role in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway .

collectively, these results confirm that invertases are essential for not only normal plant growth and development, but also plants’ abilities to regrow and ultimately compensate for fitness following apical damage.
apart from g6pd <dig> we also identified an invertase gene which was up-regulated following damage and that potentially integrates with the oppp.
