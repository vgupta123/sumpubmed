the dsrnas of all three viruses, which included two conventionally encapsidated ones pv and cv and one unencapsidated example nk, were silenced and yielded characteristic vsirnas together with co-incidental silencing of host fungal genes which shared sequence homology with the viral genomes.
three dsrna viruses were investigated: aspergillus fumigatus partitivirus- <dig> , aspergillus fumigatus chrysovirus  and aspergillus fumigatus tetramycovirus- <dig>  which were selected because they induce phenotypic changes such as coloration and sectoring.
active silencing of double-stranded rna and the generation of small rnas  has been shown for several mycoviruses and it is anticipated that a similar mechanism will be activated in a. fumigatus isolates infected with mycoviruses.
to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the srna profiles of a. fumigatus isolates.
a well-characterised defence against virus infection is rna silencing.
virus-derived srnas were detected and characterised in the presence of virus infection.
host srna loci which were differentially expressed as a result of virus infection were also identified.
aspergillus fumigatus, an opportunistic pathogen causing fungal lung diseases in humans and animals, was recently shown to harbour several different types of mycoviruses.
