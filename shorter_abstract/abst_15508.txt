nucleolar localization sequences  are short targeting sequences responsible for the localization of proteins to the nucleolus.
nod is the first tool to provide predictions of nucleolar localization sequences in diverse eukaryotes and viruses.
while the web server is most convenient for making prediction for just a few proteins, the command line version of nod can return predictions for complete proteomes.
through stringent independent testing of the predictor using available experimentally validated nols-containing eukaryotic and viral proteins, the nod sensitivity and positive predictive value were estimated to be 71% and 79% respectively.
here, we describe nod, a web server and a command line program that predicts the presence of nolss in proteins.
using the web server, users can submit protein sequences through the nod input form and are provided with a graphical output of the nols score as a function of protein position.

given the large number of proteins experimentally detected in the nucleolus and the central role of this subnuclear compartment in the cell, nolss are likely to be important regulatory elements controlling cellular traffic.
