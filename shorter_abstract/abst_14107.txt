escherichia coli is a commensal bacterium of the gastro-intestinal tract of human and vertebrate animals, although the aquatic environment could be a secondary habitat.
the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydrological conditions on the structure of the e. coli population in the water of a creek on a small rural watershed in france composed of pasture and with human occupation.
during the wet period and the rainfall events, contamination from human sources was predominantly characterized by strains of the a phylo-group, whereas contamination by cattle mainly involved b <dig> phylo-group strains resistant to antibiotics and exhibiting hly.
isolates of the b <dig> phylo-group devoid of hly and sensitive to antibiotics were particularly abundant during the dry period.
it became apparent, after studying the distribution in the four main e. coli phylo-groups , the presence of the hly  gene and the antibiotic resistance pattern, that the e. coli population structure was modified not only by the hydrological conditions , but also by how the watershed was used .
the structure of an e. coli population in water is not stable, but depends on the hydrological conditions and on current use of the land on the watershed.
