using a combination of in silico and molecular approaches, we are able to present a substantial phylogenetic evidence that route <dig> has been transferred horizontally between panicoideae and several species of the genus oryza.
although most of the cases of hts described so far concern genes, there is increasing evidence that some involve transposable elements  in eukaryotes.
this study constitutes a new case of hts for an ltr-retrotransposon and we strongly believe that this mechanism could play a major role in the life cycle of transposable elements.
horizontal transfers  refer to the transmission of genetic material between phylogenetically distant species.
we have identified an ltr-retrotransposon, that we named route <dig>  with more than 95% sequence identity between rice and sorghum.
we therefore propose to integrate classe i elements into the previous model of transposable element evolution through horizontal transfers.
