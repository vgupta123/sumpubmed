it uses the well-known database of biochemical reactions kegg of biochemical reactions as primary information source from which biochemical reactions relevant to the considered network can be selected, edited and stored in a separate, user-defined database.
the first and most time-consuming step in the development of such models consists in the stoichiometric reconstruction of the network, i. e. compilation of all metabolites, reactions and transport processes relevant to the considered network and their assignment to the various cellular compartments.
therefore an information system is required to collect and manage data from different databases and scientific literature in order to generate a metabolic network of biochemical reactions that can be subjected to further computational analyses.
the list of compartmentalized biochemical reactions and membrane transport processes compiled by means of metannogen can be exported as an sbml file for further computational analysis.
the computer program metannogen facilitates the reconstruction of metabolic networks.
metannogen is a flexible tool to manage information for the design of metabolic networks.
transport processes of metabolites are entered like chemical reactions where reactants and products have different compartment attributes.
if a reaction is reported to occur in more than one cellular compartment, a corresponding number of reactions is generated each referring to one specific compartment.
the program requires java runtime environment  <dig>  or higher and about  <dig> mb of free ram and about  <dig> mb of free hd space.
one central goal of computational systems biology is the mathematical modelling of complex metabolic reaction networks.
