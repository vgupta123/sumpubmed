the mozambique tilapia oreochromis mossambicus has the ability to adapt to a broad range of environmental salinities and has long been used for investigating iono-osmoregulation.
however, to date most studies have focused mainly on several key molecules or parameters hence yielding a limited perspective of the versatile iono-osmoregulation in the euryhaline fish.

these findings would provide insights and resources to fuel future studies on gill iono-osmoregulation and cellular remodeling in response to salinity challenge and acclimation.
it has expanded our molecular perspective from a relatively few well-studied molecules to a plethora of gene transcripts and a myriad of canonical signaling pathways driving various biological processes that are operating in gills under hypo-osmotic and hyper-osmotic stresses.
the analysis revealed multiple signaling pathways in freshwater-acclimated gills acting in concert to maintain cellular homeostasis under hypo-osmotic environment while seawater-acclimated gills abounded with molecular signals to cope with the higher cellular turn-over rate, energetics and iono-regulatory demands under hyper-osmostic stress.
we have identified over  <dig> annotated gene transcripts with high homology  to human genes that were differentially expressed in freshwater- and seawater-acclimated gills of the mozambique tilapia.
these putative human homologs were found to be significantly associated with over  <dig> canonical signaling pathways that are operating in at least  <dig> biological processes in relation to branchial iono-osmoregulation and cellular remodeling.
this is the first study that has provided an unprecedented transcriptomic-wide perspective of gill iono-osmoregulation since such studies were initiated more than 80 years ago.
this study aimed to capture transcriptome-wide differences between the freshwater- and seawater-acclimated gills of the mozambique tilapia.
