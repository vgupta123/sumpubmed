we postulate that the india and southeast asia were close enough for exchange of freshwater organisms during the middle eocene, before the final indian-eurasian collision.
we investigate timing, direction and mechanisms of faunal exchange between india and southeast asia, based on a molecular phylogeny, molecular clock-derived time estimates and biogeographic reconstructions of the asian freshwater crab family gecarcinucidae.
although the gecarcinucidae are not an element of an ancient gondwana fauna, their subfamily gecarcinucinae, and probably also the liotelphusinae, evolved on the indian subcontinent and subsequently dispersed to southeast asia.
estimated by a model testing approach, this dispersal event took place during the middle eocene, and thus before the final collision of india and the tibet-part of eurasia.
our data support geological models that assume the indian plate having tracked along southeast asia during its move northwards.
