we generated a  <dig>  sequence expressed sequence tag dataset, defining ~ <dig>  different putative genes, and built an  <dig> -element transcriptome microarray for l. rubellus.
strikingly, less than half the putative genes  were assigned annotations from the gene ontology  system; this reflects the phylogenetic uniqueness of earthworms compared to the well-annotated model animals.
l. rubellus has a complex response to contaminant exposure, but this can be efficiently analysed using molecular methods, revealing unique response profiles for different classes of effector.
the microarray was used to identify adult- and juvenile-specific transcript profiles in untreated animals and to determine dose-response transcription profiles following exposure to three xenobiotics from different chemical classes: inorganic , organic , and agrochemical .
