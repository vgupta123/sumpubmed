a subcellular localization prediction indicated that the putative bcwrky proteins were enriched in the nuclear region.
a total of  <dig> bcwrkys were differentially expressed in response to at least one stress condition  tested on pak-choi leaves, and a co-expression analysis indicated stress-inducible bcwrkys co-regulated multiple abiotic stresses.
bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky <dig>  and bcwrky <dig> acted as key regulators and played dominant roles within co-regulatory networks of stress-inducible bcwrkys.
a total of  <dig> stress-inducible bcwrkys found in leaves can co-regulate multiple environmental stresses by integrating the potential mutual interactions of wrkys in pak-choi.
the wrky transcription factor is an important member of the stress-related transcription factors, which mediate diverse abiotic stresses in many plants.
this information will be valuable when exploring the molecular mechanisms of wrkys in response to abiotic stresses in plants.
however, up until now, the number of wrky members, and the regulatory mechanisms involved in abiotic stress responses in pak-choi , remained unknown.

the  <dig> putative bcwrky proteins were divided into three groups based on structural and phylogenetic analyses.
