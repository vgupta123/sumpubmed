mutation of the n-acetylation site, however, did not affect sec62p function in posttranslational protein import into the er.
a survey of yeast phosphoproteome data shows that sbh1p can be phosphorylated on multiple sites which are organized in two patches, one at the n-terminus of its cytosolic domain, the other proximal to the transmembrane domain.
here, we have investigated modifications of the heptameric sec complex which is responsible for post-translational protein import into the endoplasmic reticulum .
the phosphorylation site is conserved in mammalian sec61ß, but only partially in birds, and not in other vertebrates or unicellular eukaryotes, suggesting convergent evolution.

covalent modifications of proteins provide a mechanism to control protein function.
little is known about the biogenesis and regulation of individual sec complex subunits.
mutation of t <dig> to a did not affect the ability of mutant sbh1p to complement the growth defect in a Δsbh1Δsbh <dig> strain, and did not result in a hypophosphorylated protein which shows that alternate sites can be used by the t <dig> kinase.
we conclude that n-acetylation of transmembrane and tail-anchored proteins does not interfere with their er-targeting, and that sbh1p phosphorylation on t <dig>  which is not present in sbh2p, plays a non-essential role specific to the sec <dig> complex.
