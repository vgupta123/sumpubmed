in mammals immune stimulation results in major transcriptional changes in muscle, potentially to allow a reallocation of amino acids for use in the immune response and energy homeostasis.
in addition there were highly significant changes in the expression of genes related to regulation of the cell cycle, growth/structural proteins, proteolysis and lipid metabolism.
the effect of immune stimulation on the expression of genes related to the energy balance of fish is poorly understood.
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of immune stimulation on fish muscle gene expression.
this study highlights the potential negative effects of inflammation on muscle protein deposition and growth in fish and extends our understanding of energy allocation in ectothermic animals.

the ril-1β stimulation induced the expression of genes related to both the innate and adaptive immune systems.
co-stimulation of muscle cells with both rigf-i and ril-1β demonstrates cross talk between these pathways providing potential avenues for further research.
atlantic salmon  primary muscle cell cultures were stimulated with recombinant il-1β, a major proinflammatory cytokine, for 24 h in order to simulate an acute immune response.
the relationship between fish health and muscle growth is critical for continued expansion of the aquaculture industry.
