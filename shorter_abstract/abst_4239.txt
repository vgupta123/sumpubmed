we used regulatory regions of the zebrafish lysozyme c  gene to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein  and dsred <dig> expression in a manner that completely recapitulated the endogenous expression profile of lysc.
labeled cells were shown by co-expression studies and facs analysis to represent a subset of macrophages and likely also granulocytes.
functional assays within transgenic larvae proved that these marked cells possess hallmark traits of myelomonocytic cells, including the ability to migrate to inflammatory sources and phagocytose bacteria.
these reporter lines will have utility in dissecting the genetic determinants of commitment to the myeloid lineage and in further defining how lysozyme-expressing cells participate during inflammation.
