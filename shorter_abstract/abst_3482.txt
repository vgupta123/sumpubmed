in drosophila, germline pirnas are thought to be processed at a unique perinuclear structure, the nuage, that houses pirna pathway proteins including the piwi clade of argonaute family proteins, along with several tudor domain proteins, rna helicases and nucleases.
we further observed that loss of tej and tap together results in more severe defects in the pirna pathway in germline cells compared to single mutants: the double-mutant ovaries exhibit mis-localization of pirna pathway components and significantly greater reduction of pirnas against transposons predominantly expressed in germline compared to single mutants.
the single or double mutants did not have any reduction in pirnas mapping to transposons predominantly expressed in gonadal somatic cells or those derived from unidirectional clusters such as flamenco.
piwi-interacting rnas  are a special class of small rnas that provide defense against transposable elements in animal germline cells.
together with tej, tap is required for survival of germline cells during early stages and for polarity formation.
we previously demonstrated that tudor domain protein tejas , an ortholog of vertebrate tdrd <dig>  is an important component of the pirna pathway.
the tap gene genetically interacts with other pirna pathway genes and we also show that tap physically interacts with pirna pathway components, such as piwi family proteins aubergine and argonaute <dig> and the rna helicases spindle-e and vasa.
consistently, the loss of both tej and tap function resulted in mis-localization of piwi in germline cells, whereas piwi remained localized to the nucleus in somatic cells.
tej and tap also function in a synergistic manner to maintain examined pirna components at the perinuclear nuage and for pirna production in drosophila germline cells.
