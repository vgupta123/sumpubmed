it performs the above mentioned computational tasks using efficient algorithms that take the model of map evolution into account.
the wami interface is easy to use and the results of each analysis task are visualized.
in either domain, researchers need to compare the set of maps to each other, to build phylogenetic trees, to spot structural variations, and to study duplication dynamics.
due to variations in repeat type and organization as well as copy number, the minisatellite maps have been widely used in forensic and population studies.
in this paper we present wami, a web-server for the analysis of minisatellite maps.
a minisatellite map is a sequence of symbols that represents the tandem repeat array such that the set of symbols is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of distinct repeats.
