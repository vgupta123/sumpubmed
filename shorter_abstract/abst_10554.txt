examination of expression patterns implied these mirnas have roles in patterning the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes as well as the extraembryonic membranes.
examination of the expression patterns of novel mirnas, some unique to the apis group, indicated that they are likely to play a role in early honeybee development.
this may indicate mirnas play a rapidly evolving role in regulating developmental pathways, most likely through changes to the way their expression is regulated.
using next-generation sequencing and in situ hybridization, we have examined the mirna content of early honeybee embryos.
through small rna sequencing we found that 28% of known mirnas are expressed in the early embryo.
known mirnas that are deeply conserved in animal phyla display differences in expression pattern between honeybee and drosophila, particularly at early stages of development.
