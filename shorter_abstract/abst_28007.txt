the genetic basis of fatty acid biosynthesis in b. napus was investigated via quantitative trail locus  analysis using a doubled haploid  population with  <dig> lines.
these results enriched our knowledge of qtls for fatty acids metabolism and provided a new clue for genetic engineering fatty acids composition in b. napus.
after the qtl mapping, the epistatic and the candidate gene interaction analysis, a potential regulatory pathway controlling fatty acid biosynthesis in b. napus was constructed, including  <dig> enzymes encoded genes and five regulatory factors .
subsequently, the interaction between these five regulatory factors and the genes involved in fatty acid metabolism were analyzed.
a total of  <dig> homologous genes of arabidopsis thaliana that are involved in fatty acid metabolism were found within the confidence intervals  of  <dig> qtls.
a total of  <dig> individual qtls and a large number pairs of epistatic interactions associated with the content of  <dig> different fatty acids were detected.
its oil is a mixture of various fatty acids and dissection of the genetic network for fatty acids biosynthesis is of great importance for improving seed quality.
in this study, a potential regulatory pathway controlling the fatty acid was constructed by qtl analysis and in silico mapping analysis.
among them,  <dig> and  <dig> genes homologous to those of b. rapa and b. oleracea were detected, respectively.
