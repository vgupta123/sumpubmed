we study properties, like the fraction of pseudoknot structures, the dominant pseudoknot-shapes, neutral walks, neutral neighbors and local connectivity.
our results imply that, in analogy to rna secondary structures, 3-noncrossing pseudoknot rna represents a molecular phenotype that is well suited for molecular and in particular neutral evolution.
we can conclude that extended, percolating neutral networks of pseudoknot rna exist.
after giving some background on rna pseudoknot structures and providing an outline of the folding algorithm being employed, we present in this paper various, statistical results on the mapping from rna sequences into 3-noncrossing rna pseudoknot structures.
we then put our results into context of molecular evolution of rna.
the analysis of sequence-structure relations of rna is based on a specific notion and folding of rna structure.
these structures are folded by a novel, ab initio prediction algorithm, cross, capable of searching all 3-noncrossing rna structures.
