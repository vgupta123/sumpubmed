the notch signalling pathway emerged in metazoa via a diversity of molecular mechanisms, incorporating both novel and ancient protein domains during eukaryote evolution.
we searched for  <dig> components of the notch pathway in  <dig> different species that represent  <dig> major clades of eukaryotes, performed phylogenetic analyses and compared the domain compositions of the two fundamental molecules: the receptor notch and its ligands delta/jagged.
the origin of several components can be accounted for by the shuffling of pre-existing protein domains, or via lateral gene transfer.
we confirm that a notch pathway, with true receptors and ligands is specific to the metazoa.
in light of this essential role played in metazoan development, we surveyed a wide range of eukaryotic genomes to determine the origin and evolution of the components and auxiliary factors that compose and modulate this pathway.
of the  <dig> or so signal transduction pathways that orchestrate cell-cell interactions in metazoans, seven are involved during development.
this study also sheds light on the deep ancestry of a number of genes involved in this pathway, while other members are revealed to have a more recent origin.
one of these is the notch signalling pathway which regulates cellular identity, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis via the developmental processes of lateral inhibition and boundary induction.
