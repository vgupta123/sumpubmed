considering that avian and mammalian tlr are differentially mediated, the action of a natural product on avian tlr <dig> pathway was unclear.
the siga level in the intestinal fluid, the expression of chtlr <dig> mrna/protein in bursa of fabricius as well as the expression of downstream molecules of chtlr <dig>  were measured on alternate days.
the content of siga and the chtlr <dig> mrna expression/protein level were increased in non-dose-dependent manner after aps supplement.
high, medium and low doses of astragalus polysaccharide , were treated the chicken at 7-days-old age by gavage.

also, the expressions of a subset of myd88-independent pathway genes were more than myd88-independent, in particular with low doses of aps supplement for 7 days.
