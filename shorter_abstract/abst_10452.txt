transposon insertion sites from  <dig> uniformmu fsts were tested for inheritance by locus-specific pcr.
we found no evidence for somatic insertions within the 11% of insertion sites that were not confirmed.
instead, this subset of insertion sites had errors in locus-specific primer design due to incomplete or low-quality genomic sequences.
we show that fsts from the uniformmu population identify stable, germinal insertion sites in maize.
we conclude from these data that the current collection of  <dig>  non-redundant insertion sites from uniformmu provide a genome-wide resource for reverse genetics.
transposons can also generate somatic insertions that fail to segregate in subsequent generations.
gene knockouts are a critical resource for functional genomics.
the locus-specific pcr assays identified a knockout of a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that co-segregates with a seed mutant phenotype.
in arabidopsis, comprehensive knockout collections were generated by amplifying and sequencing genomic dna flanking insertion mutants.
