ljnip <dig>  in agreement with its putative role as an aquaporin, is capable of transferring water when expressed in yeast protoplasts.
here, we have focused on two putative aquaporin genes, ljnip <dig> and ljxip <dig>  which resulted to be upregulated in a transcriptomic analysis performed on mycorrhizal roots of lotus japonicus.
overall, the results have shown different functionality and expression specificity of two mycorrhiza-inducible aquaporins in l. japonicus.
at the same time, ljxip <dig> results to be the first xip family aquaporin to be transcriptionally regulated during symbiosis.
a phylogenetic analysis has shown that the two putative aquaporins belong to different functional families: nips and xips.
confocal analysis have demonstrated that egfp-ljnip <dig>  under its endogenous promoter, accumulates in the inner membrane system of arbusculated cells.
