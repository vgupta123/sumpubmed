however, genome-wide association between mrna expression level and the phosphorylation state of rnapii is unclear.
therefore, we examined the correlation between the phosphorylation of rnapii and mrna expression levels using a combined analysis by chipseq and rnaseq.
previous reports revealed that rna polymerase ii , which transcribes mrna, can be classified into the pausing state and the active transcription state according to the phosphorylation state of rpb <dig>  the catalytic subunit of rnapii.
cellular function is regulated by the balance of stringently regulated amounts of mrna.
a combined analysis using optimized rnaseq and chipseq for phosphorylated rnapii revealed that mrna levels correlate with the various phosphorylation states of rnapii.
our analysis indicated that the complexity of quantitative regulation of mrna levels could be classified into three categories according to the phosphorylation state of rnapii.
