gene expression data could provide insight into this question, but it is difficult to distinguish between a gene that causes a change in gene expression from a gene that is affected by this change.
we test this framework using human gene expression data describing localized prostate cancer progression.
integrating gene expression data and regulatory topologies can aid in identifying potentially causal mechanisms for observed changes in gene expression.
the top regulatory relationships identified by regnetb include the regulation of rln <dig>  rln <dig>  by pax <dig>  the regulation of acpp  by jun, bach <dig> and bach <dig>  and the co-regulation of pgc and gdf <dig> by maz and taf <dig>  these target genes are known to participate in tumor progression, but the suggested regulatory roles of pax <dig>  bach <dig>  bach <dig>  maz and taf <dig> in the process is new.
furthermore, the proteins that regulate gene expression are often themselves not regulated at the transcriptional level.
