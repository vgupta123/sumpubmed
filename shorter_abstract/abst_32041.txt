xylanase under current study showed significant production using agricultural residues and a broad range of ph stability in the alkaline region.
apparent km and vmax values of the xylanase for birchwood xylan were  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  μmol min− <dig> mg− <dig> respectively.
the biochemical characterization of the pure enzyme was carried out for its optimum ph and temperature , ph and temperature stability, molecular mass   and pi .
the purification of extracellular xylanase was carried out by fractional ammonium sulphate precipitation , followed by extensive dialysis and bio-gel p- <dig> gel-filtration chromatography.
the best isolate was identified to be aspergillus fumigatus r <dig>  the production kinetics showed the highest xylanase production  by this organism in 96 h using 1 % rice bran as the only carbon source.
aspergillus fumigatus r <dig> produced xylanase under submerged fermentation which degrades the complex hemicelluloses contained in agricultural substrates.
the purpose of our study was to purify xylanase and study its biochemical properties.
purified xylanase was analyzed by mass-spectrometry which revealed  <dig> unique peptides.
we have predicted the secondary structure of purified xylanase and evaluated its active site residues and substrate binding sites based on the global and local structural similarity.
the enzyme was purified  <dig>  folds with a specific activity of  <dig>  iu/mg.
various microorganisms were isolated from puducherry soil and screened by congo-red test.
