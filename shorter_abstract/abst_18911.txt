we have developed pydna, an extensible, free and open source python library for simulating basic molecular biology dna unit operations such as restriction digestion, ligation, pcr, primer design, gibson assembly and homologous recombination.
the planning of such constructs has traditionally been done manually using a dna sequence editor which becomes error-prone as scale and complexity of the construction increase.
a cloning strategy expressed as a pydna script provides a description that is complete, unambiguous and stable.
