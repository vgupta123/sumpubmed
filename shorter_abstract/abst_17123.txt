our study is partly motivated by the differences in gene discovery results caused by using different supervised gene screening methods.
constructing predictive models using high dimensional microarray measurements usually consists of three steps:  unsupervised gene screening;  supervised gene screening; and  statistical model building.
concordance is assessed by the relative fractions of overlaps between top ranked genes screened using different marginal statistics.
we consider the cases where the top 20%, 40% and 60% genes are screened.
microarray studies provide a way of linking variations of phenotypes with their genetic causations.
empirical studies are based on four public microarray data.
empirical studies show that  genes passed different supervised screenings may be considerably different;  concordance may vary, depending on the underlying data structure and percentage of selected genes;  evaluated with the bootstrap reproducibility index, genes passed supervised screenings are only moderately reproducible; and  concordance cannot be improved by supervised screening based on reproducibility.
we propose a bootstrap reproducibility index, which measures reproducibility of individual genes under the supervised screening.
we investigate concordance and reproducibility of supervised gene screening based on eight commonly used marginal statistics.
from a gene discovery point of view, the effect of supervised gene screening based on different marginal statistics cannot be ignored.
various simple statistics, such as t-statistic or signal to noise ratio, have been used to rank genes in the supervised screening.
supervised gene screening based on marginal gene ranking is commonly used to reduce the number of genes in the model building.
