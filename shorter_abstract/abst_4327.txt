very few information is available about the changes of nitrogen metabolism occurring under fe deficiency in strategy i plants.
the aim of this work was to study how cucumber  plants modify their nitrogen metabolism when grown under iron deficiency.
the data obtained in this work provided new insights on the responses of plants to fe deficiency, suggesting that this nutritional disorder differentially affected n metabolism in root and in leaf.

moreover, amino acids increased in the xylem sap of fe-deficient plants.
indeed under fe deficiency, roots respond more efficiently, sustaining the whole plant by furnishing metabolites  to the leaves.
furthermore, it was found that amino acid concentration greatly decreased in fe-deficient roots, whilst it increased in the corresponding leaves.
among factors that may limit no3- assimilation, fe potentially plays a crucial role being a metal cofactor of enzymes of the reductive assimilatory pathway.
under fe deficiency, only nitrate reductase  activity decreased both at the root and leaf level, whilst for glutamine synthetase  and glutamate synthase  an increase was found.
the activity of enzymes involved in the reductive assimilation of nitrate and the reactions that produce the substrates for the ammonium assimilation both at root and at leaf levels in fe-deficient cucumber plants were investigated.
nitrogen is a principal limiting nutrient in plant growth and development.
