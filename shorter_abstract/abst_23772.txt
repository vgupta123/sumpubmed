whereas reducing buna function diminishes cell number and cell size, overexpression of the short isoforms bunb and bunc antagonizes buna function.
tsc- <dig> belongs to a family of putative transcription factors encoded by four distinct loci in mammals.
transforming growth factor-β <dig> stimulated clone- <dig>  is assumed to act as a negative growth regulator and tumor suppressor.
under standard conditions, only the long protein isoform buna – but not the short isoforms bunb and bunc – is essential and affects growth.
in drosophila, all proteins homologous to the tsc-22/dip/bun family members are derived from a single locus called bunched .
since the published studies on mammalian systems have largely neglected the long tsc- <dig> protein version, we hypothesize that the long tsc- <dig> protein is a functional homolog of buna in growth regulation, and that it is antagonized by the short tsc- <dig> protein.
our findings establish a growth-promoting function of drosophila buna.
rather unexpectedly, bun mutations result in a growth deficit.
possible redundancy among the members of the tsc-22/dip/bun protein family complicates a genetic analysis.
