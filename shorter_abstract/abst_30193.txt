this model could be used to screen both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.
the principal method of prevention is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses.
in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo.
a mean of  <dig> and  <dig> otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm samples, respectively.
principal coordinates analysis  plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together.
the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from  the same volunteers at different time points, and  different panels of volunteers.
there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels .
in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance .
veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms.
the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device  seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing.
dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss.
