we have designed an automatic algorithm for the spatial normalization of bac cgh-array data, preventing the misinterpretation of experimental artifacts as biologically relevant outliers in the genomic profile.
it is based on the combination of a spatial segmentation algorithm called nem  and spatial trend estimation.
array-based comparative genomic hybridization  is a recently developed technique for analyzing changes in dna copy number.
we investigated various sources of systematic variation in array-cgh data and identified two distinct types of spatial effect of no biological relevance as the predominant experimental artifacts: continuous spatial gradients and local spatial bias.
we therefore developed an automatic method for the spatial normalization of array-cgh data.
we defined quality criteria for array-cgh data, demonstrating significant improvements in data quality with our method for three data sets coming from two different platforms .
local spatial bias affects a large proportion of arrays, and has not previously been considered in array-cgh experiments.
this method makes it possible to delineate and to eliminate and/or correct areas affected by spatial bias.
we show that existing normalization techniques do not correct these spatial effects properly.
as in all microarray analyses, normalization is required to correct for experimental artifacts while preserving the true biological signal.
