sequencing of cdna does not only provide an estimate of the absolute expression level, it can also be used for the identification of allele specific gene expression.
we developed pangea, a tool which enables a fast and user-friendly analysis of allele specific gene expression using the  <dig> technology.
pangea allows mapping of 454-ests to genes or whole genomes, displaying gene expression profiles, identification of snps and the quantification of allele specific gene expression.
to our knowledge, pangea is the first tool which facilitates the identification of allele specific gene expression.
pangea is distributed under the mozilla public license and available at:
pangea additionally implements a modification of the smith-waterman algorithm which deals with incorrect estimates of homopolymer length as occuring in the  <dig> technology
while mainly used for genomic sequencing, they are also very promising for gene expression profiling.
