the current study reaffirms our earlier reports on adjuvanticity of phytol compounds and sis-h in non autoimmune-prone balb/c and c57bl/ <dig> mice.
although all adjuvants tested impacted cytokine/chemokine milieu in favor of th1/th <dig> balance, the phytol compounds fared better in reducing the onset of autoimmune syndromes.
phytol derivatives are hydrophobic, oil-in water diterpenoids, while alum is hydrophilic, and sis is essentially a biodegradable and collagenous protein cocktail derived from extracellular matrices.
our results indicated that the phytol-derived adjuvant phis- <dig> exceeded alum in enhancing anti-phthalate antibody without much cross reactivity with ds-dna.
interestingly, these adjuvants facilitated isotype switching of anti-hapten, but not of anti-dna response.
the objective here was to assess the effectiveness of experimental adjuvants: two phytol-derived immunostimulants phis- <dig>  and phis- <dig> , and a new commercial adjuvant from porcine small intestinal submucosa , relative to a standard adjuvant alum.
we determined antibody isotype and cytokine/chemokine milieu induced by the above experimental adjuvants relative to alum.
we studied phthalate -specific and cross-reactive anti-dna antibody responses, and parameters associated with the onset of autoimmune disorders.
