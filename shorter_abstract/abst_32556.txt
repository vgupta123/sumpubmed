swine influenza is generally characterized by acute onset of fever and respiratory symptoms.
the concentrations of crp, hp and saa significantly increased before specific antibodies were detected.
swine influenza  is an acute respiratory disease caused by swine influenza virus .
the objective of this work was to study the acute phase proteins  responses after coinfection of piglets with h1n <dig> swine influenza virus  and pasteurella multocida  in order to identify whether the individual app response correlate with disease severity and whether app could be used as markers of the health status of coinfected pigs.
the most frequent complications of influenza are secondary bacterial pneumonia.
positive correlations were found between serum concentration of hp and saa and lung scores, and between clinical score and concentrations of pig-map and saa.
the results of current study confirmed that monitoring of app may revealed ongoing infection, and in this way may be useful in selecting clinically healthy pigs .
present results corroborated our previous findings that saa could be a potentially useful indicator in experimental infection studies  or as a marker for disease severity, because of correlation observed between its concentration in serum and disease severity .
the concentration of c-reactive protein  increased significantly at  <dig> dpi as compared to control pigs, and remained significantly higher to  <dig> dpi.
in all coinfected pigs clinical sings, including fever, coughing and dyspnea, were seen.

haptoglobin  was significantly elevated from  <dig> dpi to the end of study, while pig major acute phase protein  from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi.
level of serum amyloid a  was significantly higher from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi.
