bacteria of the genus bartonella are responsible for a large variety of human and animal diseases.
bartonella strains gave a strong positive signal and all were correctly identified.
we have developed a novel multiple antigenic microarray to serotype bartonella strains and to select poly and monoclonal antibodies.
we then tested the microarray for serotyping of bartonella strains and defining the profile of monoclonal antibodies.
screening of monoclonal antibodies towards the gro el protein of b. clarridgeiae identified  <dig> groups of antibodies, which were observed with variable affinities against bartonella strains.
we demonstrated that microarray of spotted bacteria can be a practical tool for serotyping of unidentified strains or species  by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.
it was validated using mouse polyclonal antibodies against  <dig> bartonella strains.
this could be used in research and for identification of bacterial strains.
