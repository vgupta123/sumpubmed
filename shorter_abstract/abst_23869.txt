in this paper, in order to identify driver genes effectively, we applied a generalized additive model to mutation profiles to filter genes with long length and constructed a new gene-gene interaction network.
then we integrated the mutation data and expression data into the gene-gene interaction network.
experiments on three tcga datasets, i.e., head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, demonstrated that the proposed method was effective.
cancer is a complex disease which is characterized by the accumulation of genetic alterations during the patient’s lifetime.

lastly, greedy algorithm was used to prioritize candidate driver genes from the integrated data.
