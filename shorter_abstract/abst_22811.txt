due to its high environmental stability and infectivity it is regarded as a category b biological weapon agent.
clinical presentation in humans can range from mild flu-like illness to acute pneumonia and hepatitis.
coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of q-fever, a widespread zoonosis.
endocarditis represents the most common form of chronic q-fever.
in order to serve as a diagnostic tool in an eventual biological weapon attack or in local epidemics we developed a real-time 5'nuclease based pcr assay with an internal control system.
testing of  <dig> follow up specimens of animal origin from a local q-fever epidemic rendered real-time pcr more sensitive than conventional pcr.
a sensitive and thoroughly evaluated real-time pcr was established.
compared to a conventional pcr assay sensitivity of real-time pcr was higher after testing samples from a local q-fever outbreak.
to demonstrate clinical application a total of  <dig> specimens of animal origin were compared with respect to manual and automated extraction.
to facilitate high-throughput an automated extraction procedure was evaluated.
limit of detection in blood was  <dig>  copies/ml  with a manual extraction procedure and  <dig>  copies/ml  with a fully automated extraction procedure, respectively.
