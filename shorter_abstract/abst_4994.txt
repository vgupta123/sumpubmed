we develop a two-stage approach consisting of a fast and simple algorithm based on a sliding window with poisson null distribution for detecting the genomic locations of peaks, followed by a linear support vector machine classifier to distinguish between peaks which represent the initiation of transcription and peaks that do not.
comparison of classification performance to the best existing method based on whole genome segmentation showed comparable precision and improved recall.
internal features, which are intrinsic to the data and require no further experiments, had high precision and recall rates.
addition of pooled external data or matched rna sequencing data resulted in gains of recall with equivalent precision.
the large-scale sequencing of 5' cap enriched cdna promises to reveal the diversity of transcription initiation across entire genomes.
due to both biological and technical noise, many of the peaks seen are not real transcription initiation events.
