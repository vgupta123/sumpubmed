the transcript abundance of suf operon specific for synthesis of fe-s cluster was up-regulated in n2-fixing condition, suggesting that sul system, which takes place of nifs and nifu, plays important role in the synthesis of nitrogenase.
non-nif genes specifically required in nitrogen fixation, such as mod, feoab and cys encoding transporters of mo, fe and s atoms, were coordinately transcribed with nif genes in n2-fixing condition.
non-nif genes specifically required in nitrogen fixation were also significantly up-regulated in n2-fixing condition.
the nif  gene operon composed of  <dig> genes  in this bacterium was significantly up-regulated in n2-fixing condition compared to non-n2-fixing condition, indicating that nif gene transcription is strictly controlled by nh4+ and o <dig>  qrt-pcr confirmed that these nif genes were differently expressed.
the transcriptional analysis of nitrogen fixation in paenibacillus is lacking, although regulation mechanisms of nitrogen fixation have been well studied in gram-negative diazotrophs.
this study provides valuable insights into nitrogen fixation process and regulation in gram-positive firmicutes.
diazotrophic  gram-positive and endospore-formed paenibacillus spp.
here we report a global transcriptional profiling analysis of nitrogen fixation in paenibacillus sp.

the transcription levels of nitrogen metabolism and anaerobic respiration were also analyzed.

we discover potential specific electron transporters which might provide electron from fe protein to mofe protein of nitrogenase.
