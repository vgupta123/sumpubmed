in contrast, five clonal lineages had fixed a large number of differences.
our data show that amf from one field have undergone recombination but that clonal lineages coexist.
morphological stasis over  <dig> million years and the lack of an observed sexual stage in any member of the phylum glomeromycota led to the controversial suggestion of amf being ancients asexuals.
finally, our results reconcile seemingly contradictory studies on whether amf are clonal or form recombining populations.
this finding has important consequences for understanding amf evolution, co-evolution of amf and plants and highlights the potential for commercially introduced amf inoculum recombining with existing local populations.
five statistical tests predicted multiple recombinant regions in the genome of a core set of isolates.
phylogenetic relationships among genotypes showed a reticulate network pattern providing a rationale to test for recombination.
