hyperpolarization-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated  channels are fundamental for these processes of cardiac physiology.
we expect that these findings will promote studies on other molecular markers that contribute to cardiac physiology.
cardiac rhythmic activity is initiated in functionally specialized areas of the heart.
our results suggest that hcn channel isoforms might be involved in the concerted differentiation of hl- <dig> cells and may indirectly affect the occurrence of contractile hl- <dig> cell activity.
here we investigated transcript and protein expression patterns of hcn channels in hl- <dig> cardiomyocytes using a combination of quantitative pcr analysis and immunocytochemistry.
gene expression profiles of hcn <dig>  hcn <dig> and hcn <dig> were acutely affected during hl- <dig> cell propagation.
