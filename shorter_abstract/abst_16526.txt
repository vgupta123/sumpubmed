our results also suggest that samps could be evolved or engineered to implement diverse response behaviors.
here we introduce mathematical models that elucidate how signals are propagated though the network upon receptor stimulation and control the level of active response regulator.
based on a systematic parameter analysis of the models, we show that key features of the dose-response behavior at steady state are controlled either by the molecular properties of the modulator or the signaling context.
we discuss data on rap-phr systems in b. subtilis to show how our models can contribute to an integrated view of samp signaling by combining biochemical, structural and physiological insights.
the hill coefficient and the ec <dig> are controlled in addition by the relative ligand affinities.
hence raps exemplify a class of monomeric signaling receptors, which we call switchable allosteric modulator proteins .
in particular, we find that the biochemical activity  and allosteric properties of the modulator control the response amplitude.
rap proteins from bacilli directly target response regulators of bacterial two-component systems and modulate their activity.
furthermore, we show that other contextual factors  have a substantial impact on the response, and we predict that there exists a modulator concentration which is optimal for response amplitude.
these proteins have potential applications in diverse biomedical and biotechnical settings, but a quantitative understanding of the impact of molecular and cellular factors on signal transduction is lacking.

their effects are controlled by binding of signaling peptides to an allosteric site.
