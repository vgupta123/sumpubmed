proteomic analysis showed that c. comatus transformed ginkgolide into gb by producing  <dig> aldo/keto reductases and catalases, and enhancing the metabolism of glucose, including embden-meyerhof pathway , hexose monophophate pathway  and tricarboxylic acid .

c. comatus could transform ginkgolides into gb when the medium contained 40 g/l glucose.
till now, gb is usually obtained from extraction of ginkgo biloba leaves through column chromatography with an extremely low yield and high cost, which can not meet clinical requirement.
in the current study, we studied the ability and mechanism to transform multi-component ginkgolide into gb by coprinus comatus in order to enhance the gb yield.
in the case of culture medium containing 20 g/l glucose, the transformation product was identified as 12% ga and 88% gb by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry , two stage mass spectrometry  and nuclear magnetic resonance .
our current study laid the groundwork for industrial production of gb.
when glucose concentration in medium was higher than 40 g/l, all ginkgolides were transformed into the gb.
when the strain transformed ginkgolides, the glucose metabolism was enhanced and the strain synthesized more aldo/keto reductases and catalases.
partial ga was also transformed into gb according to the yield  and the content of ga in the raw ginkgolide .
