the decoy with the most number of neighbors of up to a threshold distance is typically identified as the most representative decoy.
for practical use calibur is able to automatically discover from the input decoys a suitable threshold distance for clustering.
for a sample size of approximately  <dig> thousand decoys, calibur completed the analysis in one third of the time required when the strategies are not used.
we show empirical results indicating the effectiveness of each of the strategies employed.
as a result currently there is no tool that is designed to exactly cluster very large numbers of decoys, thus creating a bottleneck in the analysis.
