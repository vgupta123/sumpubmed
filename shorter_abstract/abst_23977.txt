hiv status was not associated with spoligotypes, resistance or previous tb treatment.
sub-saharan africa is endemic for both tb and hiv infection.
four strains  were resistant to multiple drugs: one  was resistant to inh and streptomycin and the other three  were mdr strains: one was resistant to inh, rifampicin and ethambutol and two were resistant to all four anti-tb drugs.
the spoligotypes were correlated with anti-tuberculous drug susceptibility in hiv-infected and non-hiv patients from tanzania.
twelve  of the  <dig> phenotypically tested strains were resistant to anti-tb drugs.
determination of the prevalence of m. tuberculosis strains and their drug susceptibility is important for tb control.
eight  were monoresistant strains:  <dig> to isoniazid  and one to streptomycin.
fourteen isolates  had new and unique spoligotypes while  <dig> isolates  belonged to  <dig> known spoligotypes.
