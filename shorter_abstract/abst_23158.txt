krüppel-like factor  <dig>  is a broadly expressed zinc-finger transcriptional repressor with diverse biological roles.
however, examination of murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking klf <dig> revealed significant de-repression of α-globin gene expression.
noting that klf <dig> binds α-globin gene regulatory sequences during erythroid maturation, we sought to determine whether klf <dig> also interacts with the α-globin locus to regulate transcription.
these findings reveal that the occupancy profile of klf <dig> at the α-globin locus differs in erythroid and non-erythroid cells.
in non-erythroid cells, klf <dig> distinctly binds to the hs- <dig> and hs- <dig> elements and plays a non-redundant, albeit modest, role in the silencing of α-globin expression.
we found that expression of a human transgenic α-globin reporter gene is markedly up-regulated in fetal and adult erythroid cells of klf3−/− mice.
in erythroid cells, klf <dig> primarily binds to the promoters of the adult α-globin genes, but appears dispensable for normal transcriptional regulation.
despite these observations, we did not detect an increase in endogenous murine α-globin expression in klf3
this suggests that klf <dig> may contribute to the silencing of the α-globin locus in non-erythroid tissue.
