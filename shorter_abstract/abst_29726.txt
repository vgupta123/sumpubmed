pten/pi3k/akt/gsk-3β pathway was found to be involved in hsv-1-induced kshv reactivation.
hsv- <dig> infection stimulated pi3k/akt and erk mapk signaling pathways that in turn contributed to kshv reactivation, which provided further insights into the molecular mechanism controlling kshv lytic replication, particularly in the context of hsv- <dig> and kshv co-infection.
by transfecting a series of dominant negative mutants and protein expressing constructs and using pharmacologic inhibitors, we found that either janus kinase  <dig> /signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  or jak1/stat <dig> signaling failed to regulate hsv-1-induced kshv replication.
additionally, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase  mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway also partially contributed to hsv-1-induced kshv replication.
recently, we reported that herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  was an important cofactor that activated lytic cycle replication of kshv.
however, hsv- <dig> infection of bcbl- <dig> cells activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /protein kinase b  pathway and inactivated phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten  and glycogen synthase kinase-3β .
kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  is causally linked to several acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related malignancies, including kaposi's sarcoma , primary effusion lymphoma  and a subset of multicentric castleman's disease.
