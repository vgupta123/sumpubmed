statistical significance t-test results show that our int/ipt system with re-ranking outperforms that without re-ranking by a statistically significant difference.
our experimental results also show that with the re-ranked int results, our unsupervised ipt system can achieve a competitive auc ip/r of  <dig> %, which outperforms the best bc ii.
compared to using only svm ranked int results, using re-ranked int results boosts auc ip/r by  <dig> %.
in this paper, we present a new re-ranking algorithm that considers co-occurrence among identifiers in an article to improve int and ipt ranking results.
combining the re-ranked int results with an unsupervised approach to find associations among interactors, the proposed method can boost the ipt performance.
the curation of such databases can be facilitated by employing text-mining systems to identify genes which play the interactor role in ppis and to map these genes to unique database identifiers  and then to return a list of interaction pairs for each article .
<dig> int challenge achieved a promising auc ip/r of  <dig> % by using a support vector machine -based ranking procedure.
experimentally verified protein-protein interactions  cannot be easily retrieved by researchers unless they are stored in ppi databases.
our int system developed for the biocreative ii.
