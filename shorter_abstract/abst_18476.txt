whole-cell labeling is a common application of fluorescent proteins , but many red and orange fps exhibit cytotoxicity that limits their use as whole-cell labels.
we show that these new fps retain the low cytotoxicity of dsred-express <dig>  in addition, we show that these new fps are useful as second or third colors for flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy.
recently, a tetrameric red fp called dsred-express <dig> was engineered for enhanced solubility and was shown to be noncytotoxic in bacterial and mammalian cells.
