using standard microarray protocols for the affymetrix genechipÂ® mapping  <dig> k array xba  <dig>  we show that relative allele signal  values provide a quantitative index of allele frequencies in pooled dna that correlate  <dig>  with allele frequencies for  <dig> snps that were genotyped individually for  <dig> individuals.
to detect qtl associations of small effect size, large samples and systematic screens of thousands of dna markers are required.
an efficient solution is to genotype case and control dna pools using snp microarrays.
quantitative trait locus  theory predicts that genetic influence on complex traits involves multiple genes of small effect size.
we demonstrate that this is practical using dna pools of  <dig> individuals.
