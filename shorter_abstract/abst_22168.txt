incorporating the ontologies' hierarchical topology into the algorithm increases the number of generated mappings.
in particular, it generates  <dig> % additional mappings from the clusters of orthologous groups  to ec numbers and a six-fold increase in mappings from cog to go terms.
the test results suggest that, for a given recall, the application of the consensus algorithm yields higher precision than when consensus is not used.
the major algorithms implemented in pipa are:  a profile database generation algorithm, which generates customized profile databases to predict particular protein functions,  an automated ontology mapping generation algorithm, which maps various classification schemes into go, and  a consensus algorithm to reconcile annotations from the integrated programs and databases.
pipa annotates protein functions by combining the results of multiple programs and databases, such as interpro and the conserved domains database, into common gene ontology  terms.
however, integrated systems usually do not provide mechanisms to generate customized databases to predict particular protein functions.
with the existence of many programs and databases for inferring different protein functions, a pipeline that properly integrates these resources will benefit from the advantages of each method.
our consensus algorithm for go annotation is based on the computation and propagation of likelihood scores associated with go terms.
the mappings to ec numbers show a very high precision  and recall , while the mappings to go terms show moderate precision  and low recall .
we use an association rule mining algorithm to automatically generate mappings between terms of two ontologies from annotated sample proteins.
