this method aims to measure the "phylogenetic representativeness" of a given sample or set of samples and it is based entirely on the pre-existing available taxonomy of the ingroup, which is commonly known to investigators.
several theoretical methods are available to optimize taxon choice in phylogenetic analyses.
provided that the investigators' expertise is mandatory in this field, phylogenetic representativeness makes up an objective touchstone in planning phylogenetic studies.
incomplete, biased, or improper taxon sampling can lead to misleading results in reconstructing evolutionary relationships.
taxon sampling is a major concern in phylogenetic studies.
we propose a new method to assess taxon sampling developing clarke and warwick statistics.
