moreover, distribution and molecular data on native populations could contribute to the recognition of common evolutionary features of successful aliens.
evidences of the ancient anthropogenic invasive origin of the italian hystrix cristata populations were clearly shown and the native african genetic background was preliminary described.
molecular coalescent-based bayesian analyses proposed the roman age as a putative timeframe of introduction and suggested a retention of genetic diversity during the early phases of colonization.
along with the genetic diversity retention during the bottlenecked steps of introduction, this finding could be better described by hypothesizing a multi-invasion event.
we analyzed  <dig>  mitochondrial base pairs, including cytochrome b, control region and rrna 12s, in  <dig> italian and  <dig> african specimens and assessed the ancient invasive origin of italian crested porcupine  populations from tunisia.
both standard population genetic and advanced molecular demography tools  did not evidence a clear genetic signature of the expected increase in population size after introduction.
the characterization of the native african genetic background revealed the existence of two differentiated clades: a mediterranean group and a sub-saharan one.
biological invasions can be considered one of the main threats to biodiversity, and the recognition of common ecological and evolutionary features among invaders can help developing a predictive framework to control further invasions.
today, long-term dynamics of biological invasions are still poorly understood and need further investigations.
