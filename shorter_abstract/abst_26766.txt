the circuit modelled in this work consists of a central negative feedback loop, in which the frequency  gene inhibits its transcriptional activator white collar- <dig> , interlocked with a positive feedback loop in which frq protein upregulates wc- <dig> production.
the model predicts the behaviour of mutants that uncouple wc- <dig> production from frq's positive feedback, and shows that the positive loop enhances the buffering of conidiation phase against seasonal photoperiod changes.
our simulations show that whilst the level of frq mrna is driven directly by the light input, the falling phase of frq protein, a molecular correlate of conidiation, maintains a constant phase that is uncoupled from the times of dawn and dusk.
we now test the relationship between flexibility and robustness, using a mathematical model of the circuit controlling conidiation in the fungus neurospora crassa.
further analysis demonstrates that this functional robustness is a consequence of the greater evolutionary flexibility conferred on the circuit by the interlocking loop structure.
our model shows that the behaviour of the fungal clock in light-dark cycles can be accounted for by a transcription-translation feedback model of the central frq-wc oscillator.
in all organisms, the clock circuits typically comprise multiple interlocked feedback loops controlling the rhythmic expression of key genes.
circadian clocks allow organisms to adapt to the predictable changes of the 24-hour day/night cycle by generating endogenous rhythms that can be entrained to the external cycle.
