eight recombinant fragments  of pathogenic leptospira were tested for their use as diagnostic markers for canine leptospirosis using the multi-antigen print immunoassay  platform: ligb  from l. interrogans serovar pomona, l. interrogans serovar copenhageni and l. kirschneri serovar gryppotyphosa, ligb  from l. interrogans serovar copenhageni, l. interrogans serovar canicola and l. kirschneri serovar gryppotyphosa, liga  l. interrogans serovar copenhageni and lipl <dig> from l. interrogans serovar copenhageni.
these results reinforce their potential as diagnostic candidates for the development of new methods for the serological diagnosis of canine leptospirosis.
the data were analyzed and roc curves were generated.
the microscopic agglutination test , the standard method for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis, may present limitations regarding its sensitivity.
current studies suggest that leptospira immunoglobulin-like  proteins and lipl <dig> are of particular interest as serodiagnostic markers since they are present only in pathogenic species of the leptospira genus.
