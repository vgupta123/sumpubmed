we assigned larval sex by c or l morphology and compared cell division frequencies in male and female eye-antennal discs in two species  sexually dimorphic for eyespan.
we confirmed the proposed association between disc morphology and sex by evaluating the combined heterozygosity of four x-linked microsatellite markers.
similar dimorphism in genital disc morphology was observed in eight other species spanning three representative diopsid genera.
here we describe two techniques, one morphological and one microsatellite-based, that identify the sex of stalk-eyed fly larvae and pupae.
this could be achieved by comparing gene expression during eyestalk development in males and females if the sex of pre-adult flies could be reliably assigned.
finally, sexual dimorphism for eyespan in two diopsid species is unlikely to be due to an increased rate of cell division at the third larval instar in males.
these procedures will facilitate studies of the evolution of sexually dimorphic development in a variety of other species.
eyespan and the degree of sexual dimorphism in eyespan vary considerably between species and several sexually dimorphic species show sexual selection through female mate preference for males with exaggerated eyespan.
we showed that genital discs of the stalk-eyed fly teleopsis dalmanni have two highly distinct morphologies, compact  and lobed .
the genes on which selection acts to regulate eyespan remain to be identified.
we demonstrated that individuals with c genital discs had hemizygous  genotypes while those with l discs were heterozygous  genotypes.
morphology and en expression in male and female genital discs are highly conserved within each genus of diopsidae.
we have made novel use of two complementary techniques for identifying the sex of pre-adult stalk-eyed flies.
