these results suggested that form modulates dendritic cell function and attenuates th <dig> and th <dig> responses induced by hdm.
we assessed the effect of the laba formoterol  on inflammatory cell responses in airway, lung and regional lymph nodes, using an hdm-induced murine allergic asthma model in vivo.
the concentration of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in lung tissue homogenate was elevated and led to an accumulation of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> producing cells in regional lymph nodes.
form treatment suppressed hdm-induced changes and caused an increase in the number of eosinophils and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage.
the bmdcs adoptive transfer experiment indicated that dendritic cells mediate the effect of form, since form treatment of bmdcs in vitro attenuated airway inflammation.
long-acting β <dig> adrenergic agonists  are commonly used combined with inhaled corticosteroids  to treat asthmatic patients.
the aim of this study was to investigate whether labas inhibit allergic airway inflammation and how this occurs.
adoptive transfer of bmdcs pulsed with hdm in the presence or absence of form to naïve mice was performed and the inflammatory response to subsequent hdm challenge was analyzed.
previous reports suggest that labas have an anti-inflammatory effect in bronchial asthma, and this should be further investigated.

thus, we propose that the clinical significance of labas should be re-investigated taking into account these immune-modulating effects.
the effect of form on cytokine production from bone marrow derived dendritic cells  stimulated with hdm was evaluated in vitro.
