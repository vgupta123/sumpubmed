the toolbox is implemented mainly in mathematica and returns numerically exact results.
further, the integration into mathematica provides a very flexible environment for the subsequent analysis and interpretation of the results.
sna is a interactive, high performance toolbox for analysing the possible steady state behaviour of metabolic networks by computing the generating and elementary vectors of their flux and conversions cones.
it is available under an open source license from: .
thanks to its performance and modular design, sna is demonstrably useful in analysing genome scale metabolic networks.
