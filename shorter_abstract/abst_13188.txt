additional selection analyses indicate that both families evolved under strong positive selection, suggesting that they are involved in the adaptation of bd to its hosts.
we propose that the acquisition of virulence effectors, in combination with habitat disruption and climate change, may have driven the bd epidemics and the decline in amphibian populations.
the decline in amphibian populations across the world is frequently linked to the infection of the chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis .
in this study, we show that two large families of known virulence effector genes, crinkler  proteins and serine peptidases, were acquired by bd from oomycete pathogens and bacteria, respectively.
this finding provides a starting point for biochemical investigations of chytridiomycosis.
