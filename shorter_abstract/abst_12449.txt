ribosome density mapping  along four of the mrnas with increased association revealed an increase in ribosomal density towards the end of the coding region for at least two of them.
yet, no general correlations with physical or functional features of the mrna were observed.
we did not find strong correlations between these changes and several physical features of the mrna, yet future studies with advanced tools may allow such correlations to be determined.
while negligible relative changes were observed in steady-state mrna levels, a significant number of mrnas appeared to have altered ribosomal density.
importantly, our results indicate an accumulation of ribosomes towards the end of the coding regions of some mrnas.
this suggests an involvement of s <dig> in ribosomal dissociation during translation termination.
the yeast ribosomal protein s <dig>  is located at the entrance tunnel of the mrna into the ribosome.
here we examined the effects of changing the c terminus of s <dig>  which is rich in acidic amino acids and extends out of the ribosome surface.
the ribosomal protein rps <dig> appears to be involved in the translation of many mrnas, since altering its c terminus led to a significant change in ribosomal association of many mrnas.
it is known to play a role in accurate decoding and its bacterial homolog  has recently been shown to be involved in opening rna duplexes.
notably, 40% of the genes having reliable signals changed their ribosomal association by more than one ribosome.
we performed a genome-wide analysis to reveal effects at the transcription and translation levels of all yeast genes.
read-through analysis did not reveal any increase in read-through of a premature stop codon by the mutant strain.
