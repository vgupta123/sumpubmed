in this paper we describe a novel method to achieve high yield bacterial expression of a small protein domain with considerable therapeutic potential; domain i of beta-2-glycoprotein i .
this largely scalable, partially automated method produces 50–75 mg of pure, folded, active domain i of β2gpi per litre of expression media.
patients develop autoantibodies targeting an epitope located on the n-terminal domain i of β2gpi rendering this domain of interest as a possible therapeutic.
this new method of production of domain i of β2gpi has increased the production yield by ~ <dig> fold compared to previous methods in e.coli.
the application of this method may enable production of domain i on sufficient scale to allow its use as a therapeutic.
