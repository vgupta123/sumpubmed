b- and t-cells, which were sorted from nine lymphoid organs of c57bl/6j mice after burn, were subjected to mulv-erv expression analyses.
overall, the post-burn mulv-erv expression pattern was dependent on lymphocyte type, time after injury, location of lymphoid organ, and mulv-erv type.
for instance, the mulv-erv expression in t-cells from the thymus and three cervical lymph nodes decreased at  <dig> hours post-burn while the expression of some mulv-ervs was augmented in b-cells derived from the mesenteric lymph node.
in this study, we examined whether mulv-ervs’ response to burn-elicited stressors is specific for certain lymphocyte populations and/or locations of lymphoid organ.
mulv-ervs’ response to burn-elicited stressors may be differentially controlled depending on lymphocyte type, location of lymphoid organ, mulv-erv type, and stress duration.
using the u <dig> sequences, some of which were isolated only from specific experimental groups , as probes,  <dig> putative mulv-ervs, including  <dig> full-length proviruses, were mapped followed by characterization of their biologic properties.
