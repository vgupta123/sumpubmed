simulations confirmed that the bias causing variants are predominantly false positives induced by reads from spatially distant repeated sequences.
in this article, we report a positional bias present in variant calling performed against draft reference assemblies constructed from de bruijn or string overlap graphs.
draft genome sequences generated by several popular assemblers appear to be susceptible to the positional bias potentially affecting many resequencing projects in non-model species.

the bias can be effectively reduced by filtering out the variants that reside in repetitive elements.
we assessed how frequently variants appeared at each position counted from ends of a contig or scaffold sequence, and discovered unexpectedly high number of variants at the positions related to the length of either k-mers or reads used for the assembly.
despite lower quality of such assemblies, they allowed researchers to extend a wide range of population genetic and genome-wide association analyses to non-model species.
the bias is particularly strong in contig assemblies.
scaffolding does not eliminate the bias but tends to mitigate it because of the changes in variants’ relative positions and alterations in read alignments.
