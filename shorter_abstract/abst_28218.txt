two runs of  <dig> pyrosequencing yielded 205 mb and 530 mb of sequence data for l <dig>  and l <dig>  est- libraries.
yellow lupin  is a minor legume crop characterized by its high seed protein content.
<dig>  isotigs translated into proteins and  <dig>  of them were full length.
two hundred and fifty four  and  <dig>  ssr primer pairs were able to amplify fragments from l. hispanicus and l. mutabilis dna, respectively.
fifty polymorphic est-ssrs were used to genotype a sample of 64 l. luteus accessions.
neighbor-joining distance analysis detected the existence of several clusters among l. luteus accessions, strongly suggesting the existence of population subdivisions.
in this study, we report the construction of 454-expresed sequence tag  libraries, carried out comparative studies between l. luteus and model legume species, developed a comprehensive set of est-simple sequence repeat  markers, and validated their utility on diversity studies and transferability to related species.
empirical evaluation of the est-ssr candidate markers resulted in  <dig> polymorphic est-ssrs.
massive sequencing of cdna libraries will continue to produce raw materials for gene discovery, identification of polymorphisms  for marker development, anchoring sequences for genome comparisons and putative gene candidates for qtl detection.
around 57% of l. luteus sequences had significant similarity with at least one sequence of medicago, lotus, arabidopsis, or glycine, and  <dig> % showed positive matches with all of these species.
l. luteus isotigs were also screened for the presence of ssr sequences.
l. luteus deep transcriptome sequencing will facilitate the further development of genomic tools and lupin germplasm.
a combined assembly  yielded  <dig>  contigs with an average contig length of  <dig> nucleotides.
although grown in several temperate countries, its orphan condition has limited the generation of genomic tools to aid breeding efforts to improve yield and nutritional quality.
