we found that the structural and functional architecture of this ppi network is highly modular.
these network modules can be assigned to specialized processes, specific cellular regions and their functional roles tend to partially overlap.
we quantitatively demonstrate that intra- and inter-module functional activity may be controlled by a family of transcription factors known to be associated with the prevention of hypertrophy.
putative biomarkers can, in general, be distinguished as "information traffic" mediators within this network.
our results suggest that hf biomarkers may be defined as key coordinators of intra- and inter-module communication.
the systems-driven analysis reported here provides the basis for the identification of potentially novel biomarkers and understanding hf-related mechanisms in a more comprehensive and integrated way.
the top high traffic proteins are encoded by genes that are not highly differentially expressed across hf and non-hf patients.
to support these efforts, here we report a global network of protein-protein interactions  relevant to hf, which was characterized through integrative bioinformatic analyses of multiple sources of "omic" information.
