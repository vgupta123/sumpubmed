when the cell layers of this plant are separated by passage through somatic embryogenesis, regenerated plants could show distinct dna profiles and a novel phenotype which proved different from that of the parent plant.
these results suggest that the phenotype of chardonnay  <dig> does not result from an interaction between the two distinct cell layers l <dig> and l <dig>  if phenotype conformity is further confirmed, somatic embryogenesis will result in true-to-type somaclones of chardonnay  <dig> and would be well suitable for gene transfer.
however, plants regenerated through somatic embryogenesis starting from anthers or nodal explants are composed only of l <dig> cells.
grapevine can be a periclinal chimera plant which is composed at least of two distinct cell layers .
genetically chardonnay clone  <dig> is a periclinal chimera plant in which is l <dig> and l <dig> cell layers are distinct.
plants obtained via organogenesis through meristematic bulks are shown to be composed of both cell layers.
