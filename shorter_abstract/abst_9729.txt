the source code for the snowyowl pipeline  and a web interface  is freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowyowl/.
the pipeline has been developed and streamlined by comparing its predictions to manually curated gene models in three fungal genomes and validated against the high-quality gene annotation of neurospora crassa; snowyowl predicted n. crassa genes with 83% sensitivity and 65% specificity.
hundreds of fungal genomes are now or will soon be sequenced.
the differences of fungal genomes from animal genomes and the phylogenetic sparsity of well-studied fungi call for gene-prediction tools tailored to them.
snowyowl efficiently uses rna-seq data to produce accurate gene models in both well-studied and novel fungal genomes.
snowyowl is a new gene prediction pipeline that uses rna-seq data to train and provide hints for the generation of hidden markov model -based gene predictions and to evaluate the resulting models.
snowyowl gains sensitivity by repeatedly running the hmm gene predictor augustus with varied input parameters and selectivity by choosing the models with best homology to known proteins and best agreement with the rna-seq data.

computational gene predictors have been intensively developed for and tested in well-studied animal genomes.
the recent availability of detailed information about transcript structure from high-throughput sequencing of messenger rna  delineates many expressed genes and promises increased accuracy in gene prediction.
