to the best of our knowledge, this is the first model for expression of multiple proteins in anatomically intact tissue, rather than within cells in culture.
the protein models include their complex expression patterns and which cell phenotypes express them.
new bioimaging techniques capable of visualising the co-location of numerous proteins within individual cells have been proposed to study tumour heterogeneity of neighbouring cells within the same tissue specimen.
here, we extend the model to include detailed models of protein expression to generate synthetic multiplex fluorescence data.
this has included both features that have been used as part of the model input and ones that have not been explicitly considered.
we then develop models for six proteins which are important colorectal cancer biomarkers and are associated with microsatellite instability, namely mlh <dig>  pms <dig>  msh <dig>  msh <dig>  p <dig> and pten.
the six proteins have been chosen as a case study to illustrate how the model can be used to generate synthetic multiplex immunofluorescence data.
comparison between the distribution of various features obtained from the real and synthetic organelles has shown very good agreement.
