distance methods are ubiquitous tools in phylogenetics.
however, poor computational efficiency has been a constraint on the applicability of distance methods on very large problem instances.
we present fastphylo, a software package containing implementations of efficient algorithms for two common problems in phylogenetics: estimating dna/protein sequence distances and reconstructing a phylogeny from a distance matrix.
we compare fastphylo with other neighbor joining based methods and report the results in terms of speed and memory efficiency.
