using molecular dynamics  simulations and normal mode analysis , we found that the p.ala84thr and p.phe128ser mutations are most likely to alter the protein structure near the fad binding site as well as disrupt the stability of the fad binding required for the activation of etf:qo.
recently, mutations in electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase  gene, encoding electron transfer flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase  have been reported to be the major causes of riboflavin-responsive madd.
high resolution melting  analysis and sequencing of the entire etfdh gene revealed a novel mutation  and the hotspot mutation  from a patient with madd.
intriguingly, nma revealed that several reported disease-causing mutations in the etf:qo protein show highly correlated motions with the fad-binding site.
based on the present findings, we conclude that the changes made to the amino acids in etf:qo are likely to influence the fad-binding stability.
according to the predicted 3d structure of etf:qo, the two mutations are located within the flavin adenine dinucleotide  binding domain; however, the two residues do not have direct interactions with the fad ligand.
