systemic treatment of sirna targeting rho- <dig> reduced hepatic ho- <dig> expression and decreased the serum bilirubin levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and sirna decreased the indirect bilirubin levels more effectively than sn-protoporphyrin , an ho- <dig> inhibitor.
the sirna distributed mostly in the liver and spleen of neonatal rat.
four pairs of sirna targeting rho- <dig> mrna were introduced into brl cells and compared for their inhibitory effect on the expression of rho- <dig> gene and production of rho- <dig> protein.
thus this study provides a novel therapeutic rationale for the prevention and treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
heme oxygenase  is one of the rate-limiting enzymes in catabolizing heme to bilirubin.
excessive accumulation of bilirubin contributes to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in rats.
serum bilirubin levels and hepatic ho- <dig> expression were further evaluated.
sirna targeting rho-l attenuates hepatic ho- <dig> expression and serum bilirubin levels.
