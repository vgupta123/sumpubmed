atmind expressed in the hl <dig> mutant can cause a punctate localization pattern of gfp-ecminc at cell ends.
the mincd complex prevents ftsz ring formation and the subsequent cell division at cell ends.
atmind was localized to puncta at the poles of e. coli cells and puncta in chloroplasts without oscillation.
in e. coli, the min operon  plays a key role in determining the site of cell division.
similar to the mind in bacillus subtilis, atmind is localized to the polar region in e. coli and interacts with ecminc to confine ecftsz polymerization and cell division at the midpoint of the cell.
surprisingly, atmind can rescue the minicell phenotype of e. coli hl <dig> mutant  in the absence of ecmine.
to learn whether the mind homologue in plants is functional in bacteria, atmind was expressed in e. coli.
yeast two hybrid and bifc analysis showed that atmind can interact with ecminc.
in arabidopsis thaliana, a homologue of mind has been shown to be involved in the positioning of chloroplast division site.
