in the current study, we used stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture  to compare the proteomic profiles of nthi biofilm and planktonic organisms.
selected reaction monitoring -ms was used to validate a subset of these proteins; among these were aerobic respiration control protein arca, nad nucleotidase and heme-binding protein a.
pathway analysis demonstrated that proteins involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and purine, pyrimidine, nucleoside, and nucleotide processes showed a general trend of downregulation in the biofilm compared to planktonic organisms.
conversely, proteins involved in transcription, dna metabolism, and fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism showed a general trend of upregulation under biofilm conditions.
the present proteomic study indicates that the nthi biofilm exists in a semi-dormant state with decreased energy metabolism and protein synthesis yet is still capable of managing oxidative stress and in acquiring necessary cofactors important for biofilm survival.
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  was performed on the tryptic peptides and  <dig> unique proteins were identified with 99% confidence.
comparisons of the nthi biofilm to planktonic samples demonstrated that  <dig> proteins showed differential expression with p-values â‰¤ <dig> .
bacteria were removed from the chambers, mixed based on weight, and protein extracts were generated.
non-typeable h. influenzae  is a nasopharyngeal commensal that can become an opportunistic pathogen causing infections such as otitis media, pneumonia, and bronchitis.
resistance of bacterial biofilms to clearance by host defense mechanisms and antibiotic treatments is well-established.
