such differences in expression patterns are a telltale sign of alternative splicing within the last exon of socs <dig>  in contrast, all three probe sets oscillated in a common phase in murine liver and white adipose tissue.
another component of the signaling pathway, janus kinase , is directly regulated by socs and has alternative transcript probe sets oscillating in counter-phase in a white adipose tissue specific manner.
here, we report our analysis of alternative transcripts in the leptin signaling pathway which is responsible for the systemic regulation of macronutrient storage and energy balance.
we hypothesize that differential oscillation of alternative transcripts may provide a mechanism to maintain steady levels of expression in spite of circadian baseline variation.
we demonstrate that in murine brown adipose tissue two downstream 3' probe sets experience circadian baseline oscillation in counter-phase to the upstream probe set.
it has been previously reported that most mammalian genes display a circadian oscillation in their baseline expression.
consequently, the phase and amplitude of each component of a signal transduction cascade has downstream consequences.
