out of  <dig> combinations of driver and effector construct integrations, several lines resulted in larval and pupal lethality with one line showing complete embryonic lethality.
ionizing radiation used to generate reproductive sterility in the mass-reared populations before release leads to reduction of competitiveness.
here, we present a first alternative reproductive sterility system for medfly based on transgenic embryonic lethality.
the high competitiveness of the transgenic lines and the achieved 100% embryonic lethality causing reproductive sterility without the need of irradiation can improve the efficacy of operational medfly sit programs.
the sterile insect technique  is an environment-friendly method used in area-wide pest management of the mediterranean fruit fly ceratitis capitata .
this line was highly competitive to wildtype medfly in laboratory and field cage tests.
these elements act differently in expression strength and their ability to drive lethal effector gene activation.
