in this study, we report for the first time various novel properties of the distribution of codon footprint counts in five organisms, based on large-scale analysis of ribosomal profiling data.
thus, our methods can be used in future studies related to translation and even transcription elongation.
these tend to be preserved along the inner part of the orf, but differ at the 5' and 3' ends of the orf, suggesting that the translation-elongation stage actually includes three biophysical sub-steps.
specifically, this method is based on next-generation sequencing, which theoretically can provide footprint counts that correspond to the probability of observing a ribosome in this position for each nucleotide in each transcript.
