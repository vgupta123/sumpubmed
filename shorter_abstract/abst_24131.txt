the μ-cs server is based on the web services technology and can be easily extended to support more microarray vendors .
the paper presents μ-cs , a cross-platform tool for the automatic normalization, summarization and annotation of affymetrix binary data.
consequently, μ-cs offers four main advantages:  it avoids to waste time for searching the correct libraries,  it reduces possible errors in the preprocessing and further analysis phases, e.g.
the analysis of microarray data requires an initial preprocessing phase  of raw data that makes them suitable for use on existing platforms, such as the tigr m <dig> suite.
thus novel, platform independent, and possibly open source tools enabling the semi-automatic preprocessing and annotation of microarray data are needed.
the μ-cs client is provided both as a plug-in of the tigr m <dig> platform and as a java standalone tool and enables users to read, preprocess and analyse binary microarray data, avoiding the manual invocation of external tools , the manual loading of preprocessing libraries, and the management of intermediate files.
the μ-cs server automatically updates the references to the summarization and annotation libraries that are provided to the μ-cs client before the preprocessing.
the μ-cs client is freely available as a plugin of the tm <dig> platform as well as a standalone application at the project web site .
moreover, users of the μ-cs plugin for tm <dig> can manage affymetrix binary files without using external tools, such as apt  and related libraries.
due to the incorrect choice of parameters or the use of old libraries,  it implements the annotation of preprocessed data, and finally,  it may enhance the quality of further analysis since it provides the most updated annotation libraries.
high throughput platforms, such as microarrays, enable the investigation of the whole genome in a single experiment.
