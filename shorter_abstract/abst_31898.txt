altruism also increased the attractiveness of men as potential partners for short-term flings, but to a lesser extent than when the same men were being considered for long-term relationships.
an evolved preference for other-regarding or helping behaviour in potential mates has been proposed as an additional mechanism by which these behaviours can yield direct fitness benefits in humans.
exactly why helping behaviours in a non-mating context might be attractive to potential mates, and whether they are honest signals of mate quality, remains to be elucidated.
our results unite two important areas of evolutionary theory – social evolution and sexual selection – and extend the list of means by which helping behaviours, which appear at first glance to be costly to the actor, can in fact earn direct fitness benefits.
helping behaviours may be attractive because they signal ‘good genes’ and/or because they are perceived as a signal of likely provision of non-genetic benefits .
despite its short-term costs, behaviour that appears altruistic can increase an individual’s inclusive fitness by earning direct  and/or indirect  benefits.
we asked  <dig> heterosexual women and  <dig> heterosexual men to rate the attractiveness of members of the opposite sex in the presence and the absence of information about helping behaviours.
