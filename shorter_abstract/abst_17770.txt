here, we use an array of different techniques for ground-based simulation of microgravity effects to assess the effect of suboptimal environmental conditions on the gene expression of drosophila in reduced gravity.
a global and integrative analysis, using “gene expression dynamics inspector”  self-organizing maps, reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices.
previous experiments have shown that the reduced gravity aboard the international space station  causes important alterations in drosophila gene expression.
these results suggest that the transcriptome as a whole can be finely tuned to gravity force.
in optimum environmental conditions, the alteration of gravity has only mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal, the gene expression must be tuned greatly and effects become more robust, probably linked to the lack of experience of organisms exposed to evolutionary novel environments such as a gravitational free one.
