patterns of their intra-genomic dispersal can be seen in the mt genome of vaceletia sp.
among these features is the presence of long intergenic regions, which are common in other eukaryotes, but generally absent in eumetazoa.
here we analyse poriferan mitochondrial intergenic regions, paying particular attention to repetitive sequences within them.
mt genomes of dictyoceratid sponges are identical in gene order and content but display major differences in size and organization of intergenic regions.
an even higher degree of diversity in the structure of intergenic regions was found among different orders of demosponges.
large intergenic regions of poriferan mt genomes are targets for insertions of repetitive hairpin- forming elements, similar to the ones found in non-metazoan opisthokonts.
such elements were likely present in some lineages early in animal mitochondrial genome evolution but were subsequently lost during the reduction of intergenic regions, which occurred in the eumetazoa lineage after the split of porifera.
in this context we introduce the mitochondrial genome of ircinia strobilina  and compare it with mtdna of other sponges.
porifera acquired their elements in several independent events.
the mitochondrial  genomes of sponges possess a variety of features, which appear to be intermediate between those of eumetazoa and non-metazoan opisthokonts.
