anyexpress offers scalable processing features such as binding, normalization, and summarization that are not present in existing software tools.
cross-platform analysis of gene express data requires multiple, intricate processes at different layers with various platforms.
anyexpress can combine cross-platform gene expression data, process data from both open- and closed-platforms, select a custom target reference, filter out undesirable probes or reads based on custom-defined biological features, and perform quantile-normalization with a large number of microarray samples.
current tools are so tightly coupled with reference information, such as reference genome, transcriptome database, and snp, which are often erroneous or outdated, that the output results are incorrect and misleading.
these results confirmed those of the original and secondary studies.
users can define custom target transcriptome database references for probe/read mapping in any species, as well as criteria to remove undesirable probes/reads.
we developed anyexpress, a software package that combines cross-platform gene expression data using a fast interval-matching algorithm.
