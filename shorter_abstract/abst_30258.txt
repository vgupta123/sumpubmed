the full genome sequences of  <dig> isolates of fhv- <dig> were determined, including two vaccine isolates and  <dig> clinical isolates that were collected over a period of approximately 40Â years.
no evidence of fhv- <dig> recombination was detected using multiple methods of recombination detection, even though many of the isolates originated from cats housed in a shelter environment where high infective pressures were likely to exist.
this study used next generation sequencing to compare the genomes of contemporary australian clinical isolates of fhv- <dig>  vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates, including isolates that predated the introduction of live attenuated vaccines into australia.
no potential genetic determinants of virulence were identified, but unique single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the ul <dig> and ul <dig> genes were detected in the vaccine isolates that were not present in the clinical isolates.
the snps detected only in the vaccine isolates offer the potential to develop pcr-based methods of differentiating vaccine and clinical isolates of fhv- <dig> in order to facilitate future epidemiological studies.
genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in the in vivo phenotype of fhv- <dig> isolates, but to date there have been limited studies investigating fhv- <dig> genetic diversity.
analysis of the genome sequences aimed to assess the level of genetic diversity, identify potential genetic markers that could influence the in vivo phenotype of the isolates and examine the sequences for evidence of recombination.
the results show that fhv- <dig> genomes are highly conserved.
analysis of the genome sequences revealed a remarkably low level of diversity  between the isolates.
felid herpesvirus  <dig>  causes upper respiratory tract diseases in cats worldwide, including nasal and ocular discharge, conjunctivitis and oral ulceration.
