while this implies a complete  analysis of the folding space, the computational effort depends only on the size of the shape space, which is much smaller.
from these results, and the fact that we use a complete and exact analysis of the folding space, we conclude that this approach opens up new and promising routes for investigating and understanding rna secondary structure.
soon after the first algorithms for rna folding became available, it was recognised that the prediction of only one energetically optimal structure is insufficient to achieve reliable results.
folding space analysis comprises various methods such as suboptimal folding, computation of base pair probabilities, sampling procedures and abstract shape analysis.
in this paper we extend the approach of abstract shape analysis.
an in-depth analysis of the folding space as a whole appeared necessary to deduce the structural properties of a given rna molecule reliably.
