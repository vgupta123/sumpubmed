the difference in the length of chd genes in s. c. hoya and p. sinensis is 13-, and 52-bp, respectively.
here, we are the first to introduce a pcr-melting curve analysis  to identify the gender of birds by genomic dna, which is gel-free, quick, and inexpensive.
in contrast, we redesigned sex-specific primers to yield 185- and 112-bp pcr products for the chd-z and chd-w genes of s. c. hoya, respectively, using pcr/mca.
spilornis cheela hoya  and pycnonotus sinensis  were used to illustrate this novel molecular sexing technique.
in this study, we introduced a high-throughput avian molecular sexing technique and successfully applied it to two species.
gender determination often fails when the difference in length between the pcr products of chd-z and chd-w genes is too short to be resolved.
using this specific primer set, at least  <dig> samples of s. c. hoya were examined simultaneously and the tm peaks of chd-z and chd-w pcr products were distinguished.
using griffiths' p2/p <dig> primers, molecular sexing failed both in pcr/electrophoresis of s. c. hoya and in pcr/mca of s. c. hoya and p. sinensis.
this new method holds a great potential for use in high throughput sexing of other avian species, as well.
