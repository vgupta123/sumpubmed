as sunflower is a plant model for seed oil biosynthesis, we anticipate that the developed genetic resource will be a useful tool to identify novel traits for sunflower crop improvement.
as proof-of-concept, we screened the m <dig> population for induced mutations in two genes related to fatty acid biosynthesis, fata an acyl-acp thioesterase and sad the stearoyl-acp desaturase and identified a total of  <dig> mutations.
the sunflower tilling platform was setup using endo-1-nuclease as mismatch detection system coupled with an eight fold dna pooling strategy.
to optimize the ems mutagenesis, we first conducted a “kill curve” analysis with a range of ems dose from  <dig> % to 3%.
based on the tilling of fata and sad genes, we calculated the overall mutation rate to one mutation every 480 kb, similar to other report for this crop so far.
pertaining to this endeavor, we developed a “chemically induced mutated genetic resource for detecting snp by tilling” in sunflower to create new traits.
