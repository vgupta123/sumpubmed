to address this inconsistency the effect of short, high-dose uv-b irradiation on detached arabidopsis thaliana leaves was examined.
after short treatment with a high dose of uv-b the arabidopsis leaves were either put into darkness or exposed to constant light for up to 4 days.
uv-b inhibited dark-induced chlorophyll degradation in arabidopsis leaves in a dose-dependent manner.
high doses of uv-b have opposing effects on leaves depending on their light status after uv treatment.
irradiation with high uv-b doses causes chlorophyll degradation, a decrease in the expression of genes associated with photosynthesis and its subsequent inhibition.
when followed by light treatment, the same doses of uv-b result in chlorophyll degradation.

uv-b treatment followed by constant light caused leaf yellowing and induced the expression of senescence-related genes.
the expression of photosynthesis-related genes, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency were higher in uv-b -treated leaves left in darkness.
in darkened leaves short uv-b treatment delays the appearance of senescence symptoms.
on the other hand, sublethal doses of uv-b are used in post-harvest technology to prevent yellowing in storage.
two different experimental models were used.
irrespective of light treatment a high uv-b dose led to clearly visible cell death 3 days after irradiation.
