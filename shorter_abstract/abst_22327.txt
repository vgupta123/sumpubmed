a newly isolated vibrio phage ϕpp <dig>  which was specific to the hosts of v. parahaemolyticus and v. alginolyticus, featured a long nonenveloped head of ~90 ×  <dig> nm and tail of ~ <dig> nm.
in addition to the three giant indels of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nt, ϕpp <dig> possessed unique proteins involved in potassium channel, gp <dig> , trna nucleotidyltransferase, and mob-type hes, which were not reported in kvp <dig>  the ϕpp <dig> peg <dig>  with strong promoters and translational initiation, was identified to be a mobe type, flanked by nrda and nrdb/c homologs.
vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> was characterized by morphology, growth, and genomics with three giant indels and different types of hes.
the gene analysis on the required elements for transcription and translation suggested that the ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> was an active mobe gene.
in both genomes, the capsid and tail genes have been identified, as well as the extensive representation of the dna replication, recombination, and repair enzymes.
coincidently, several pairs of he-flanking homologs with empty center were found in the phages of vibrio phages ϕpp <dig> and kvp <dig>  as well as in aeromonas phages , and cyanophage p-ssm <dig>
the phage was signified to be a new species of t4-related, differing from kvp <dig>
vibrio parahaemolyticus is associated with gastroenteritis, wound infections, and septicemia in human and animals.
