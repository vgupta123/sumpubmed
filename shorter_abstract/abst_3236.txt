in addition, metica suggests two ways to select the optimal number of model components and gives an order of interpretation for the components obtained.
the resulting data matrix usually contain huge number of variables and only few samples, and classical techniques using nonlinear mapping could result in computational complexity and overfitting.
however, a major problem with most ica algorithms is the output variations between different runs and the result of a single ica run should be interpreted with reserve.
interpreting non-targeted metabolomics data remains a challenging task.
ica was applied to simulated and experimental mass spectrometry -based non-targeted metabolomics data, under the hypothesis that underlying sources are mutually independent.
correlating the components obtained with prior biological knowledge allows understanding how non-targeted metabolomics data reflect biological nature and technical phenomena.
furthermore, it provides an innovative concept on which to base model selection: that of optimizing the number of reliable components instead of trying to fit the data.
independent component analysis  as a linear method could potentially bring more meaningful results than principal component analysis .
like the original icasso algorithm, metica evaluated the algorithmic and statistical reliability of ica runs.
this novel approach provides meaningful components due to their independent nature.
inspired from the icasso algorithm, a new ica method, metica was developed to handle the instability of ica on complex datasets.
