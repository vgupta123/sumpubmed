profile hmms are based on a set of  <dig> manually assembled antizyme sequences.
to distinguish between antizyme paralogs and orthologs from major phyla, antizyme sequences were clustered into twelve groups and specific combinations of profile hmms were designed for each group.
this manuscript describes a rapid and accurate computer tool for antizyme cds detection that requires minimal human involvement.
we have developed a computer tool, oaf  for identifying antizyme encoding sequences in spliced or intronless nucleic acid sequenes.
ornithine decarboxylase antizymes are proteins which negatively regulate cellular polyamine levels via their affects on polyamine synthesis and cellular uptake.
oaf performs well on raw est sequences and mrna sequences derived from genomic annotations.
oaf outputs sequence annotations in fasta, genbank flat file or xml format.
in virtually all organisms from yeast to mammals, antizymes are encoded by two partially overlapping open reading frames .
oaf utilizes a combination of profile hidden markov models  built separately for the products of each open reading frame constituting the entire antizyme coding sequence.
oaf will be used for the future updates of the recode database.
the oaf web interface and the source code are freely available at  and at a mirror site .
oaf can also be useful for identifying novel antizyme sequences when run with relaxed parameters.
