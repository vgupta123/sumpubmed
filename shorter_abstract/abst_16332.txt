appropriate pain management for lameness in swine is a critical control point for veterinarians and producers, but science-based guidance on optimal housing, management and treatment of lameness is deficient.
the results of the present study suggest that fm oral administration is not the most effective administration route for mature swine when compared to iv and im.
plasma samples collected up to 48 hours post-administration were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry  followed by non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis.
a mean peak plasma concentration  for im and po administration was 3748 ng/ml  and 946 ng/ml , respectively.
half-life  for iv, im and po administration was  <dig>  hours ,  <dig>  hours  and  <dig>  hours  respectively.
in comparison, bioavailability  for po administration was 22%  compared to im f at 76% .
the purpose of this study was to determine intravenous , intramuscular  and oral  fm pk in mature swine.
six mature swine  were administered an iv, im, or po dose of flunixin meglumine at a target dose of  <dig>  mg/kg in a cross-over design with a 10 day washout period between treatments.
no adverse effects were observed with flunixin meglumine administration for all routes.
flunixin meglumine was administered at an actual mean dose of  <dig>  mg/kg  iv, im and po.
tmax was recorded at  <dig>  hour  and  <dig>  hours  after po and im administration.
lower f and cmax of po-fm in comparison to im-fm suggest that po-fm is less likely to be an effective therapeutic administration route.
