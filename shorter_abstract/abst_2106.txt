in multivariate analysis, lower sil-7r levels were associated with acute gvhd :  <dig> , p >  <dig> ) and sibling donors .
increased sil-7r levels were also identified in plasma from patients who were not treated with anti-thymocyte globulin .
low sil-7r was associated with any grade of acute graft-versus-host disease  at  <dig> and 6 months  and with a positive cmv pcr at 2 months after hsct .
we performed a prospective study in adults  and children  undergoing ahsct measuring plasma il- <dig> and soluble il-7r  concentrations between  <dig> and 12 months after hsct in order to investigate the link between sil-7r and clinical events after ahsct.
recipients of sibling grafts showed high levels of il- <dig>  and bone marrow recipients had low il- <dig> levels .
sil-7r values were higher at  <dig>   <dig>  and 6 months  if the donor was a sibling as compared to an unrelated donor.
