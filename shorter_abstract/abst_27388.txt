these results point to the persistence of subject-specific taxa whose frequency fluctuates between the time points.
representatives of the class sphingobacteria, order sphingobacteriales and family clostridiaceae were found only in one subject.
of  <dig>  obtained sequences,  <dig>  passed the quality control.
fifteen out of  <dig> genera constituted  <dig> to 94% of the total sequences present in different samples.
among individual taxa, phylum bacteroidetes and order clostridiales  were the best indicators of intraindividual similarity of the salivary flora over time.
the salivary microbiota from five adults was analyzed at three time-points by means of the  <dig> pyrosequencing technology.
genus gemella, identified in all time-points of all individuals, was not defined as a core-microbiome genus in previous studies of salivary bacterial communities.
the salivary microbial community appeared to be stable over at least  <dig> days, allowing for subject-specific grouping using unifrac.
we compared saliva samples from different individuals in terms of the phylogeny of their microbial communities.
of these,  <dig> were shared by all time points of all individuals, while 15- <dig> genera were present in all three time-points of different individuals.
samples were dominated by seven major phyla: members of firmicutes, proteobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes and candidate division tm <dig> were identified in all samples; fusobacteria and spirochaetes were identified in all individuals, but not at all time-points.
inclusion of all available samples from more distant time points  confirmed this observation.
samples taken at closer time intervals were not necessarily more similar than samples obtained across longer sampling times.
