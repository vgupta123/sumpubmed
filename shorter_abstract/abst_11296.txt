here, we characterize the sv content of a personal genome with parliament, a publicly available consensus sv-calling infrastructure that merges multiple data types and sv detection methods.
while multiple data types and methods are available to detect these structural variants , they remain less characterized than smaller variants because of sv diversity, complexity, and size.
these svs span  <dig> mbp of the reference genome  and include  <dig>  events identified only with long-read data.
the hs <dig> data and complete parliament infrastructure, including a bam-to-sv workflow, are available on the cloud-based service dnanexus.
we demonstrate parliamentâ€™s efficacy via integrated analyses of data from whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization, short-read next-generation sequencing, long-read , long-insert , and whole-genome architecture  data from the personal genome of a single subject .
with the full parliament infrastructure, the hs <dig> data constitute a public resource for novel sv discovery, software calibration, and personal genome structural variation analysis.
