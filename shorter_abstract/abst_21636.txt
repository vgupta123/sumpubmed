moreover, csf-1r knock-down changed growth characteristics of highly invasive cell lines on matrigel matrix, and significantly decreased the ability of these cells to invade matrix.
it gives cancer cells the capacity to invade normal tissues and metastasize.
this study was therefore designed to characterize the role of csf-1r in canine mammary cancer cells proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion.
we showed that csf-1r silencing significantly increased apoptosis , decreased proliferation  and decreased migration  of canine mammary cancer cells.
csf- <dig> treatment increased invasion of cancer cells.
the evidence of the expression and functional role of the csf-1r in canine mammary cancer cells indicate that csf-1r targeting may be a good therapeutic approach.
the signaling of colony-stimulating factor- <dig> receptor  which is an important regulator of proliferation and differentiation of monocytes and macrophages regulates most of the tissue macrophages.
however, csf-1r is expressed also in breast epithelial tissue during some physiological stages i.g.
as far as we know, the study presented hereby is a pioneering experiment in this field of veterinary medicine.
tumor-associated macrophages  have high impact on the cancer development because they can facilitate matrix invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor cell motility.
our previous study has showed the expression of csf-1r in all examined canine mammary tumors.
