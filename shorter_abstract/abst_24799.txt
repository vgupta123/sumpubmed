loss of mstn in mice causes a doubling of skeletal muscle mass while loss of gdf <dig> in mice causes dramatic anterior homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton, kidney agenesis, and an increase in progenitor cell number in several tissues.
we show that mstn-/- gdf11-/- mice have more extensive homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton than gdf11-/- mice in addition to skeletal defects not seen in single mutants such as extra forelimbs.
we also show that deletion of gdf <dig> specifically in skeletal muscle in either mstn+/+ or mstn-/- mice does not affect muscle size, fiber number, or fiber type.
these results provide evidence that myostatin and gdf <dig> have redundant functions in regulating skeletal patterning in mice but most likely not in regulating muscle size.
