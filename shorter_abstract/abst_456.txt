cynara cardunculus l. is an edible plant of pharmaceutical interest, in particular with respect to the polyphenolic content of its leaves.
variable levels of hct expression were shown among wild and cultivated forms of c. cardunculus subspecies.
it includes three taxa: globe artichoke, cultivated cardoon, and wild cardoon.
in silico studies revealed the globe artichoke hct sequence clustering with one of the main acyltransferase groups .
we have isolated a  <dig> bp cdna which shares 84% aminoacid identity and 92% similarity with a tobacco gene responsible for the biosynthesis of cga from p-coumaroyl-coa and quinic acid.
the scope of this study is to better understand cga synthesis in this plant.
the dominating phenolics are the di-caffeoylquinic acids , which are largely restricted to cynara species, along with their precursor, chlorogenic acid .
heterologous expression of the full length hct  cdna in e. coli demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme efficiently synthesizes both chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroyl quinate from quinic acid and caffeoyl-coa or p-coumaroyl-coa, respectively, confirming its identity as a hydroxycinnamoyl-coa: quinate hct.
