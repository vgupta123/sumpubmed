protein secondary structures can also be determined experimentally from circular dichroism, and infrared spectroscopic data using empirical analysis methods.
here we have examined the secondary structure determination accuracies of sequence prediction methods with the empirically determined values from the spectroscopic data on datasets of proteins for which both crystal structures and spectroscopic data are available.
in this study we show that the sequence prediction methods have accuracies nearly comparable to those of spectroscopic methods.
combining sequence prediction with experimentally determined spectroscopic methods for protein secondary structure content significantly enhances the accuracy of the overall results obtained.
a number of sequence-based methods exist for protein secondary structure prediction.
in addition, combining the extra information content available from synchrotron radiation circular dichroism data with sequence methods also shows improvements.
