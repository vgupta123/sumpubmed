robustness, maintaining a constant phenotype despite perturbations, is a fundamental property of biological systems that is incorporated at various levels of biological complexity.
while the current evorsr environment is a versatile analysis framework, future versions can include features to enhance evolutionary studies of robustness.
current hypotheses suggest that robustness originated as a direct consequence of natural selection, as an intrinsic property of adaptations, or as a congruent correlate of environment robustness.
we present an overview of evorsr package and illustrate its features with the mirna gene cel-mir- <dig>
in this study, we developed the open-source integrated system evorsr  to explore the evolution of robustness based on biologically important landscapes induced by rna folding.
accordingly, evorsr can be used for future studies to investigate the evolution and origin of robustness and to address other common questions about robustness.
to elucidate the evolutionary origins of robustness, a convenient computational package is strongly needed.
evorsr is object-oriented, modular, and freely available at  under the gnu/gpl license.
