supplementation of ah in bm and ccm media accelerates cec wound closure of the in vitro corneal abrasion model by increasing the expression of genes and proteins associated with cec wound healing.
six new zealand white rabbits’ cec were isolated and cultured until passage  <dig>  circular wound area was created onto a confluent monolayer cec using a corneal trephine which mimicked corneal abrasion and treated with  <dig> % ah supplemented in basal medium  and complete cornea medium .
cultured cec exhibited similar morphology of polygonal shaped cells in all culture media.
fibronectin expression was increased at the initial stage while cd <dig> expression was increased at day  <dig>  post wound creation.
this study aimed to investigate the effects of ah on cultured corneal epithelial cells  on in vitro corneal abrasion wound healing model.

gene expression of ck <dig> increased in ah-supplemented groups throughout the study.
the protein expression of cec cultured in all media was in accordance to their respective gene expressions.
acacia honey  has been proven to improve skin wound healing, but its therapeutic effects on corneal epithelium has not been elucidated to date.
