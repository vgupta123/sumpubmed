processes of gene loss and gene duplication followed by functional divergence have been rampant in the evolution of fungal respiration.
we did not observe specific adaptations of the respiratory metabolism common to all pathogenic species.
duplications in respiratory proteins have been common, affecting 76% of the protein families surveyed.
besides clarifying orthology and paralogy relationships among respiratory proteins, our results reveal three parallel losses of the entire complex i, two of which are coupled to duplications in alternative dehydrogenases.
we detect several instances of paralogs of genes coding for subunits of respiratory complexes that have been recruited to other multi-protein complexes inside and outside the mitochondrion, emphasizing the role of evolutionary tinkering.
oxidative phosphorylation is central to the energy metabolism of the cell.
to identify the main mechanisms behind the evolution of respiratory pathways, we conducted a phylogenomics survey of oxidative phosphorylation components in the genomes of sixty fungal species.
