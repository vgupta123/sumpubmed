the methods have a broad scope of applicability, beyond the single gene â€“ including, for example, multiple gene interactions in the complete transcriptome.
we present tools to visualize complex splicing patterns in full-length cdna libraries.
developmental changes in pair-wise correlations are presented vectorially in 'clock plots' and linkage grids.
considerable attention is given to sparse contingency tables, which are inherent to single-gene libraries.
higher-order correlations are assessed statistically through monte carlo analysis of a log-linear model with an empirical-bayes estimate of the true probabilities of observed and unobserved splice forms.
alternative domains may interact, however, with unpredictable phenotypic consequences, necessitating integrated rna-level regulation of molecular composition.
we present two novel metrics: the linkage change index, which measures the directional change in pair-wise correlation with tissue differentiation, and the accuracy index, a very simple goodness-of-fit metric that is more sensitive than the integrated squared error when applied to sparsely populated tables, and unlike chi-square, does not diverge at low variance.
log-linear coefficients are visualized in a 'spliceprint,' a signature of splice correlations in the transcriptome.
