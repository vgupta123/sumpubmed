therapeutic levels of the stress hormone norepinephrine increased pneumococcal growth via a mechanism involving provision of iron from serum-transferrin and inotrope uptake, as well as enhancing expression of key genes in central metabolism and virulence.
analysis of the response of the pneumococcal pspa and pspc mutants to the stress hormone showed them to have a central involvement in the catecholamine response mechanism.
stress hormone exposure also markedly increased biofilm formation.
this report reveals that streptococcus pneumoniae, a commensal that can also be a major cause of community acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, is highly inotrope responsive.
collectively, our data suggests that streptococcus pneumoniae recognises host stress as an environmental cue to initiate growth and pathogenic processes.
one of them is the endogenously produced catecholamine stress hormones, which are also used therapeutically as inotropes.
recent work form our laboratories have found that stress hormones can markedly increase bacterial growth and virulence.
collectively, our evidence suggests that the pneumococcus has mechanisms to recognise and process host stress hormones to augment its virulence properties.
importantly, gene profiling showed that norepinephrine significantly enhanced expression of genes involved in central metabolism and host colonisation.
host signals are being shown to have a major impact on the bacterial phenotype.
