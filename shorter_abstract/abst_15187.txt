termites are one of the best studied systems for physiological collaborations between host and symbiota; however, most work in lower termites  focuses on the eukaryotic members of this symbiotic consortium.
sequence data provide new insights into biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport of major organic molecules and ions by the gut consortium, and corroborate previous findings suggesting that bacteria play direct roles in nitrogen fixation, amino acid biosynthesis, and lignocellulose digestion.
this study presents the most complete bacterial metatranscriptome from a lower termite and provides a framework on which to build a more complete model of termite-symbiont interactions including, but not limited to, digestion and pathogen defense.
here we present a metatranscriptomic analysis which provides novel insights into bacterial contributions to the holobiont of the eastern subterranean termite, reticulitermes flavipes, in the presence and absence of a fungal pathogen.
with regard to fungal pathogen challenge, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed candidate host and symbiont contigs were identified  including an upregulated bacterial amidohydrolase.
using a customized ribodepletion strategy, a metatranscriptome assembly was obtained representing the host termite as well as bacterial and protist symbiota.
