the interface facilitates meta-data acquisition and long-term safe-storage, while the graphical user interface helps the definition of a hit list and the visualization of biological modules among the hits, through gene ontology and protein-protein interaction analyses.
however, the currently available software applications to analyze rnai screen data usually lack the ability to visualize associated gene information in an interactive fashion.
technically, the approach has been largely inspired by techniques and tools developed for compound screening, including those for data analysis.
our software package, screensifter, can accelerate and facilitate screen data analysis and enable discovery by providing unique biological data visualization capabilities.
