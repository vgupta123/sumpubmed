the emerging assembly of pig sequence provides exact physical location of many markers, facilitating the study of a fine-scale recombination landscape of the pig genome by comparing a clone-based physical map to a genetic map.
alignments between the cytogenetic map, radiation hybrid  map, genetic maps and clone map of ssc-x with the physical map of human chromosome x  are presented.
variations in recombination fraction  among chromosomal regions, individuals and families have been observed and have an important impact on quantitative trait loci  mapping studies.
however, almost no recombination occurred in a large region of ~ <dig> mb extending from the centromere to xq <dig>  whereas in the surrounding regions and in the xq telomeric region a recombination rate of  <dig> - <dig>  cm/mb was observed, more than twice the chromosome-wide average rate.
lack of recombination in such a large region makes it impossible to narrow qtl interval using traditional fine-mapping approaches.
significant differences in θ among f <dig> females within each population were observed for several chromosomal intervals.
the relationship between recombination variation and haplotype polymorphism is shown for the first time in pigs.
the average recombination rate across ssc-x is of ~ <dig>  cm/mb.
this study reveals marked regional, individual and haplotype-specific differences in recombination rate on ssc-x.
the largest variation was observed in both populations in the interval umnp71-sw <dig>  or more precisely in the subinterval umnp891-umnp <dig>  the individual variation in θ over this subinterval was found associated with f <dig> females' maternal haplotypes  and independent of paternal haplotype .
