using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy we compared key developmental features of laser-manipulated and control samples, including the olfactory pit, dorsal, ventral and pectoral fins, notochord, pectoral fin buds, otic capsule, otic vesicle, neuromast patterning, and kinocilia of the olfactory pit rim and cristae of the lateral wall of the ear.
an exogenous fluorescent probe, fluorescein isothiocyanate , was successfully introduced into blastomere cells and found to diffuse throughout all developing cells.
however, the effect of the applied fs laser pulses on cell viability and development has yet to be determined.
using the reported manipulation tool, we addressed whether the applied fs laser pulses induced any short- or long-term developmental effects in embryos reared to  <dig> and  <dig> days post-fertilization .
in our study, no significant differences in hatching rates and developmental morphologies were observed in laser-manipulated samples relative to controls.
