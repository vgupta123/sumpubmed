cd4+ t-cell epitopes play a crucial role in eliciting vigorous protective immune responses during peptide -based vaccination.
predivac can make predictions for 95% of all mhc class ii protein variants , a substantial advance over other available methods.
in addition, the specificity of cd4+ t-cells is often directed to a very limited set of immunodominant peptides in pathogen proteins.
we developed the computational tool predivac to predict cd4+ t-cell epitopes.
a central finding was the high accuracy delivered by the method in the identification of immunodominant and promiscuous cd4+ t-cell epitopes, which play an essential role in epitope-based vaccine design.
the comprehensive hla class ii allele coverage along with the high specificity in identifying immunodominant cd4+ t-cell epitopes makes predivac a valuable tool to aid epitope-based vaccine design in the context of a genetically heterogeneous human population.the tool is available at: http://predivac.biosci.uq.edu.au/.
the ability to account for mhc class ii polymorphism is critical for epitope-based vaccine design tools, as different allelic variants can have different peptide repertoires.
the performance of the method was assessed both for high-affinity hla class ii peptide binding and cd4+ t-cell epitope prediction.

the ability to predict what epitopes are most likely to dominate an immune response remains a challenge.
