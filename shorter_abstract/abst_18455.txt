we compared here four different methods to analyze data derived from a time course mrna expression profiling experiment which consisted in the study of the effects of estrogen on hormone-responsive human breast cancer cells.
several methods for processing time series gene expression data are presented, including evaluation of benefits and drawbacks of the different methods applied.
microarray experiments enable simultaneous measurement of the expression levels of virtually all transcripts present in cells, thereby providing a ‘molecular picture’ of the cell state.
the potential use of the statistical analysis of microarray data in time series has not been fully exploited so far, due to the fact that only few methods are available which take into proper account temporal relationships between samples.
we present and discuss the results obtained by applying to these datasets different statistical methods for serial gene expression analysis.
the final list of differentially expressed genes underwent cluster analysis of functional type, to identify groups of genes with similar regulation dynamics.
the resulting protocol for data analysis was applied to characterization of the gene expression changes induced by estrogen in human breast cancer zr- <dig>  cells over an entire cell cycle.
gene expression was monitored with the innovative illumina beadarray platform, which includes an average of 30- <dig> replicates for each probe sequence randomly distributed on the chip surface.
