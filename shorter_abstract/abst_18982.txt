phenotypic noise strongly depended on the strain background.
this tuning may happen on specific traits or by varying the degree of global phenotypic buffering.
we profiled hundreds of quantitative traits in more than  <dig>  cells of  <dig> natural strains, which represent various geographical and ecological origins of the species.
we observed abundant trait variation between strains, with no correlation with their ecological origin or population history.
using automated image analysis, we describe here the phenotypic diversity of s. cerevisiae morphology at single-cell resolution.
whether this is the case or not remains, however, unclear because phenotypic noise has very rarely been quantified in natural populations.
our results demonstrate that phenotypic noise does differ quantitatively between natural populations.
given the potential fitness advantage provided by phenotypic noise in fluctuating environments, the possibility that it is directly subjected to evolutionary selection is being considered.
phenotypic noise, defined here as trait variability among isogenic cells of the same type and sharing a common environment, has therefore received a lot of attention.
for selection to act, phenotypic noise must differ between contemporary genotypes.
noise variation was largely trait-specific  but also global .
most quantitative measures of phenotypic traits represent macroscopic contributions of large numbers of cells.
