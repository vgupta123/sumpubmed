the success of the r <dig> strain as a pathogen that caused the pacific northwest and vancouver island outbreaks may imply that rnai machinery loss could be beneficial under certain circumstances during evolution.
genome rearrangement and synteny loss may suggest a greater retrotransposon mobilization caused by rnai pathway absence, but the effective presence of srnas that matches retrotransposon sequences means that an alternative retrotransposon silencing mechanism could be active in genomic integrity maintenance of c. gattii vgii strains.
this study therefore aimed to evaluate in silicio the effect of retrotransposons and their control mechanisms by small rnas on genomic stability and synteny loss of c. gattii r <dig> through retrotransposons sequence comparison and orthology analysis with other  <dig> c. gattii genomic sequences available.
however, despite the lower retrotransposon number, vgii exhibited increased synteny loss and genome rearrangement events.
the absence of argonaute genes in the fungal pathogen cryptococcus gattii r <dig> and other vgii strains indicates that yeasts of this genotype cannot have a functional rnai pathway, an evolutionarily conserved gene silencing mechanism performed by small rnas.
