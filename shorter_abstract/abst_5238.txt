additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our method through extraction of biologically relevant epigenetic changes in prostate cancer.
the illumina humanmethylation <dig> beadchip  measures the dna methylation of  <dig>  cpgs in the human genome.
currently, there is no clear method or pipeline for determining which of the probes on the hm450k bead array should be retained for subsequent analysis in light of these issues.
we comprehensively assessed the effects of snps, indels, repeats and bisulfite induced reduced genomic complexity by comparing hm450k bead array results with whole genome bisulfite sequencing.
however, certain genomic factors may compromise the ability to measure methylation using the array such as single nucleotide polymorphisms , small insertions and deletions , repetitive dna, and regions with reduced genomic complexity.
from this, we derived a set of high-quality probes that provide unadulterated measurements of dna methylation.
our method significantly reduces the risk of false discoveries when using the hm450k bead array, while maximising the power of the array to detect methylation status genome-wide.
