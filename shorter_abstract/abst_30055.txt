a hierarchical classification was performed to examine how the indicators influenced the awi.
full-time farmers had cleaner animals  and their animals had less lameness .
thirty-three indicators were collected in five categories: locomotion ; social interactions  , flooring , environment  and stockpersonship .
part-time farmers had greater  "social interactions": calving  and weaning  scores.
beef suckler farms  were assessed once with housed cattle and once with cattle at grass using an animal welfare index .
improving animal welfare is an increasingly important aspect of livestock production systems predominantly due to increased consumer concern about the source of animal products.
the objectives were  to evaluate animal welfare of irish beef suckler herds using an animal welfare index ,  to examine correlations between parameters, how they influence the awi and investigate the applicability of the parameters used,  to investigate the impact of the activity of the farmer , the interest of the farmer and the number of animals on the awi.
part and full-time farming did not differ  in awi scores.
there was no difference  in awi between full-time and part-time farmers.
the number of animals on-farm and the interest of the stockperson were negatively and positively correlated , respectively, with the awi.
