confocal microscopy coupled to immunocytochemistry together with the use of a progranulin-green fluorescent protein fusion construct revealed progranulin to be located within compartments of the secretory pathway including the golgi apparatus.
stable transfection of the human progranulin gene into the nsc- <dig> motor neuron cell line stimulates the appearance of dendritic structures and provides sufficient trophic stimulus to survive serum deprivation for long periods .
we have investigated progranulin gene expression and subcellular localization in cultured mouse embryonic motor neurons and examined the effect of progranulin over-expression and knockdown in the nsc- <dig> immortalized motor neuron cell line upon proliferation and survival.
in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical techniques revealed that the progranulin gene is highly expressed by motor neurons within the mouse spinal cord and in primary cultures of dissociated mouse embryonic spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia.
this work highlights the importance of progranulin as neuroprotective growth factor and may represent a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases including motor neuron disease.
however, it is uncertain what the role of progranulin is in normal or diseased motor neuron function.
preliminary studies indicated high progranulin gene expression in spinal cord motor neurons.
we have demonstrated that progranulin is abundantly expressed in motor neurons and is cytoprotective over prolonged periods when over-expressed in a neuronal cell line.
knockdown of progranulin expression using shrna technology further reduced cell survival.
