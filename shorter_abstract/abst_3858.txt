the gene expression profiles of two archaeal lrp-homologues report in detail their role in h. salinarum r <dig>  lrpa <dig> and lrp show similar functions to those already described in bacteria, but in addition they play a key role in regulatory networks, such as controlling the transcription of other regulators.
analytical dna-affinity chromatography was adapted to high salt, and demonstrated binding of lrpa <dig> to its own promoter, as well as l-aspartate dependent binding to the aspb <dig> promoter.
the aspb <dig> gene, coding for an aspartate transaminase, was repressed by lrpa <dig> in the presence of l-aspartate.
it was shown that lrp affects the transcription of multiple target genes, including those encoding enzymes involved in amino acid synthesis, central metabolism, transport processes and other regulators of transcription.
