the significant variations between clones during clone selection, and the relatively high content of amidated species  in comparison to reference material , led us to develop a cell line with reduced production of c-terminal amidated monoclonal antibodies using genetic manipulation.
these two cell lines now represent a pool from which the candidate clone with the highest comparability to the reference molecule can be selected, for production of high-quality and safe therapeutics.
during development of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in chinese hamster ovary  cells, c-terminal amidated species are observed.
two genetically modified cell lines were generated using a zinc finger nuclease approach to decrease c-terminal amidation on recombinant monoclonal antibodies.
c-terminal amidation is catalysed by peptidylglycine Î±-amidating monooxygenase , an enzyme known to be expressed in cho cells.
initial target validation was performed using the rna interference approach against pam, which resulted in a cho cell line with c-terminal amidation decreased to 3%.
plasmid dna and mrna for zinc finger nucleases were used to generate a pam knock-out, which resulted in two cho cell lines with c-terminal amidation decreased to 6%, in cho der <dig> and cho der <dig> cells.
due to the transient effects of small-interfering rnas, and possible stability problems using short-hairpin rnas, we knocked-down the pam gene using zinc finger nucleases.
