in this study, we adopt a structural systems biology approach and develop a mathematical model to investigate various types of cooperative calcium-calmodulin interactions.
our model predicts that the specificity and selectivity of cam target regulation is likely to be due to the following factors: variations in the target-specific ca2+ dissociation and cooperatively effected dissociation constants, and variations in the number of ca2+ ions required to bind cam for target activation.
the results of our analysis reduce the gap between current understanding of intracellular calmodulin function at the structural level and physiological calcium-dependent calmodulin target activation experiments.
we compare the predictions of our analysis with physiological dose-response curves taken from the literature, in order to provide a quantitative comparison of the effects of different mechanisms of cooperativity on calcium-calmodulin interactions.
calmodulin is an important multifunctional molecule that regulates the activities of a large number of proteins in the cell.
