clark can also classify bac clones or transcripts to chromosome arms and centromeric regions.
we introduce clark a novel approach to classify metagenomic reads at the species or genus level with high accuracy and high speed.
the problem of supervised dna sequence classification arises in several fields of computational molecular biology.
extensive experimental results on various metagenomic samples show that the classification accuracy of clark is better or comparable to the best state-of-the-art tools and it is significantly faster than any of its competitors.
in its fastest single-threaded mode clark classifies, with high accuracy, about  <dig> million metagenomic short reads per minute.
