kl <dig> encodes an ecorii-c endonuclease/methylase pair and vsr endonuclease that are predicted to function during the lytic cycle to cleave non-self dna, protect the phage genome and repair methylation-induced mutations.
as prophages, ks <dig> and kl <dig> integrate into an amp nucleosidase gene and a threonine trna gene, respectively.
these phages have over 50% of their proteins in common with enterobacteria phage p <dig> and so can be classified as members of the peduovirinae subfamily and the "p2-like viruses" genus.
unlike other p2-like viruses, the ks <dig> prophage is maintained as a plasmid.
because bcc bacteria are broadly antibiotic resistant, phage therapy is currently being investigated as a possible alternative treatment for these infections.
the burkholderia cepacia complex  is comprised of at least seventeen gram-negative species that cause infections in cystic fibrosis patients.
as ks <dig> has previously been shown to be active against burkholderia cenocepacia in vivo, genomic characterization of these phages is a crucial first step in the development of these and similar phages for clinical use against the bcc.
the p <dig> e+e' translational frameshift site is conserved among these three phages and so they are predicted to use frameshifting for expression of two of their tail proteins.
the lysbc genes of ks <dig> and kl <dig> are similar to those of p <dig>  but in ks <dig> the organization of these genes suggests that they may have been acquired via horizontal transfer from a phage similar to Î». ks <dig> contains two sequence elements that are unique among these three phages: an isbmu2-like insertion sequence and a reverse transcriptase gene.
