our findings demonstrate that the mcyb <dig> and mcyc adenylation domains are recombination hotspots in the microcystin synthetase gene cluster.
our results provide support for complex evolutionary processes taking place at the mcyb <dig> and mcyc adenylation domains which recognize and activate the amino acids found at x and z positions.
we also find clear evidence for independent adenylation domain conversion of mcyb <dig> by unrelated peptide synthetase modules in strains of the genera nostoc and microcystis.
a recombination event between the first module of mcyb  and mcyc in the microcystin synthetase gene cluster is linked to the simultaneous production of microcystin variants in strains of the genus microcystis.
the recombination events replace only the adenylation domain in each case and the condensation domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc are not transferred together with the adenylation domain.
this study demonstrates that functional peptide synthetases are created in nature through transfer of adenylation domains without the concomitant transfer of condensation domains.
many structural variants of microcystins are produced simulatenously.
