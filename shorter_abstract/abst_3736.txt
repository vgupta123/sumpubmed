the estuarine tapertail anchovy  is widely distributed in the yangtze river, the coastal waters of china, korea, and the ariake sound of japan.
in the “metabolism” category, “glucose metabolism” and “lipid metabolism” were major subclasses.
it is a commercially important species owing to its nutritional value and delicate flavor.
pathway enrichment analysis based on loading stress-responsive unigenes identified significantly stress related pathways.
however, coilia nasus is strongly responsive to stress, this often results in death, which causes huge losses.
in this study, we used next-generation sequencing technologies to study changes in gene expression in response to loading stress and the mechanism of death caused by loading stress in coilia nasus.

the transcriptional expression of rate-limiting enzymes in “glucose metabolism” and “lipid metabolism” was detected by rt-qpcr, all were significantly increased after stress.
apoptosis associated proteins tumor necrosis factor alpha , caspase  <dig>  cytochrome c and caspase  <dig> in the stress group were significantly elevated, moreover, liver injury indicators  were also significantly elevated, which indicates that loading stress induced liver injury.
loading stress may induce liver injury through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which was activated by tnf-α.
a total of  <dig>  unigenes were generated, the mean unigene size and n <dig> were 607 bp and 813 bp, respectively.
