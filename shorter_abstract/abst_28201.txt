using a genomic library of paenibacillus thiaminolyticus, constructed in e.coli dh5α cells, nucleotide sequence of a new α-l-fucosidase isoenzyme was determined and submitted to the embl database .
the enzyme was expressed in e.coli and affinity chromatography was used for purification of his-tagged α-l-fucosidase.
this enzyme was produced in form of histidine-tagged protein in e.coli bl <dig>  cells and purified by metaloaffinity chromatography.
activity-based screening of a genomic library was used to isolate the gene encoding a novel α-l-fucosidase.
hydrolytic and transglycosylation abilities of α-l-fucosidase iso <dig> were tested using different acceptor molecules.
according to the cazy database, these enzymes belong to families  <dig> and  <dig>  some of them are also reported to be able to catalyze transglycosylation reactions, during which α-l-fucosylated molecules, representing compounds of interest especially for pharmaceutical industry, are formed.
thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry were used for transglycosylation reactions evaluation.
