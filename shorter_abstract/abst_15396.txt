staphylococcus aureus is a human pathogen that causes a wide variety of life-threatening infections using a large number of virulence factors.
genetic and functional analysis shows that msa has a global effect on gene expression in s. aureus.
based on our predictions we hypothesise that msa is a novel signal transducer that might be involved in the interaction of the s. aureus with its environment.
preliminary sequence analysis showed that msa is a putative membrane protein.
we confirm that msa is a putative membrane protein with three transmembrane regions.
we have used several computational tools to predict the physico-chemical properties, secondary structural features, topology, 3d tertiary structure, binding sites, motifs/patterns/domains and cellular location.
we also predict that msa has phosphorylation sites and binding sites suggesting functions in signal transduction.
this work aims at predicting the structure and function of the msa protein.
one of the major global regulators used by s. aureus is the staphylococcal accessory regulator .
