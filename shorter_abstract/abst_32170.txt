the ability of the cna transgenic yeast to develop resistance to al was significantly higher than that of control yeast.
residual al in the cna transgenic yeast culture media was significantly lower than the amount of al originally added to the media or the residual al remaining in the control yeast culture media.
previous studies have found that can is involved in the regulation of the stress responses.
the phosphatase activities of ∆cnaa, cna <dig> and cna <dig> were lower than the wild-type protein.
in this study, the growth of cryptococcus humicola was inhibited by the can inhibitor tacrolimus  under aluminum  stress.

a cam-binding domain and key amino acids responsible for interaction with cam were identified.
these results suggest that the region between r <dig> and s <dig> is essential for the interaction with cam and i <dig>  i <dig> are key amino acids in this region.
cam-binding domain and key amino acids responsible for interaction with cam were identified and both are required for phosphatase activities.
the expression of cna encoding a catalytic subunit a  and its interaction with cam were upregulated when the concentration of al was increased.
