interestingly, comparison of the non-legume and legume tf with signaling elements from actinorhizal species revealed a new subgroup of nodule-specific c2h <dig> tf that could be specifically involved in actinorhizal symbioses.
the aim of this work was to identify potential transcription factors involved in the establishment and functioning of actinorhizal symbioses.
based on published transcriptome datasets and quantitative pcr analysis, we found that 39% and 26% of these transcription factors were regulated during c. glauca and a. glutinosa-frankia interactions, respectively.
we also identified an actinorhizal-specific transcription factor belonging to the zinc finger c1-2i subfamily we named cgzf <dig> in c. glauca and agzf <dig> in a. glutinosa.
we identified  <dig> putative transcription factors by in silico analysis in  <dig> families in casuarina glauca  and  <dig> in  <dig> families in alnus glutinosa  est databases.
phylogenetic studies confirmed the presence of common key transcription factors such as nsp, nf-ya and ern-related proteins involved in nodule formation in legumes, which confirm the existence of a common symbiosis signaling pathway in nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbioses.
we identified putative nodulation-associated transcription factors with particular emphasis on members of the gras, nf-ya, erf and c2h <dig> families.

in silico identification, transcript analysis, and phylogeny reconstruction of transcription factor families paves the way for the study of specific molecular regulation of symbiosis in response to frankia infection.
