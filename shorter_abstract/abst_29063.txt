polycomb repressive complex  <dig> -catalyzed h3k27me <dig> marks are tightly associated with the wus-ag negative feedback loop to terminate floral stem cell fate to promote carpel development, but the roles of polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  in this event remain largely uncharacterized.
indeterminate carpel development in the atring1a;atring1b double mutant is due to replum/ovule-to-carpel conversion in association with ectopic expression of class i knox  genes.
genetic interaction analysis indicates that the atring1a/b-regulated knox-i pathway acts largely in a complementary manner with the wus-ag pathway in controlling floral stem cell maintenance and proper carpel development.

moreover, atring1a and atring1b also play a critical role in ovule development, mainly through promoting the degeneration of non-functional megaspores and proper integument formation.
promoter-driven gus reporter analysis showed that atring1a and atring1b display a largely similar expression pattern, except in the case of the exclusively maternal-preferred expression of atring1b, but not atring1a, in the endosperm.
