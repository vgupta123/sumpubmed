for cellular metabolism, complexity can be reduced by decomposition into pathways with particular biochemical functions, and the concept of elementary flux modes provides a systematic way for organizing metabolic networks into such pathways.
our method can easily operate on large, genome-scale networks since it does not require all relevant modes of the metabolic network to be generated.
these improvements arise from not having to generate all relevant elementary modes prior to initiating the decomposition.
our method can achieve computational time improvements exceeding 2000-fold and requires only several seconds to generate elementary mode decompositions on genome-scale networks.
while decomposition using elementary flux modes has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding and manipulating cellular metabolism, its utility, however, is severely limited since the number of modes in a network increases exponentially with its size.
we illustrate the utility of our method for metabolic engineering of escherichia coli and for understanding the survival of mycobacterium tuberculosis  during infection.
here, we present a new method for decomposition of metabolic flux distributions into elementary flux modes.
the decompositions from our method are useful for understanding complex flux distributions and debugging genome-scale models.
