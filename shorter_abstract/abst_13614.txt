at 24 h, dose dependent γ-h2ax foci were more numerous than at 2 h, and greater in tumours than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
sg <dig> also had significant in vivo antitumour activity against canine melanoma xenografts, and the comet and γ-h2ax foci methods were relevant pharmacodynamic assays.
based on its in vitro potency, the spectrum of in vivo and clinical activity against human tumours, and its tolerability in human patients, sg <dig> has potential as a novel therapeutic against spontaneously occurring canine malignancies.
dna interstrand cross-linking  was determined using a modification of the single cell gel electrophoresis  assay.

sg <dig> exhibited significant anti-tumour activity against two canine melanoma tumour models in vivo.
sg2000-induced h2ax phosphorylation measured by immunohistochemistry showed good correspondence, but less sensitivity, than measurement of foci.
effects on cell cycle distribution were assessed by flow cytometry and measurement of γ-h2ax by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry.
either once, or weekly x  <dig>  dose-dependent dna icl was observed in tumours  at 2 h and persisted at 24 h. icl increased following the second and third doses in a repeated dose schedule.
sg <dig> displayed potent activity in vitro against canine cancer cell lines as a result of the formation and persistence of dna icls.
in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed using srb and mtt assays, and in vivo activity was assessed using canine tumour xenografts.
sg <dig> had a multi-log differential cytotoxic profile against a panel of  <dig> canine tumour cell lines representing a range of common tumour types in dogs.
anti-tumour activity was observed at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/kg given i.v.
the formation of γ-h2ax foci was slow, becoming evident after 4 h and reaching a peak at 24 h.
in the cmec- <dig> melanoma cell line, dna icls increased linearly with dose following a 1 h treatment.
peak icl was achieved within 1 h and no removal was observed over 48 h. a relationship between dna icl formation and cytotoxicity was observed across cell lines.
sg <dig>  is a sequence selective dna minor groove cross-linking agent.
