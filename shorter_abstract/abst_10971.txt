in  <dig> skinless, boneless retail broiler meat samples  collected from food stores in alabama, usa, from  <dig> through  <dig> was examined.
in retail broiler meat for these years was 41%, with no statistical differences in the prevalence by year .
a large diversity of pfge profiles was found for c. jejuni, with some profiles from the same processing plants reappearing throughout the years.
although no statistical differences  were observed in the prevalence of c. jejuni by season, the lowest prevalence of c. coli was recorded from october through march.
the average prevalence of campylobacter spp.
tenderloins had a lower prevalence of campylobacter spp.
seasons did not affect the prevalence of c. jejuni but statistically affected the prevalence of c. coli .
c. coli and c. jejuni had an average prevalence of 28% and 66%, respectively.
the prevalence of c. coli varied by brand, plant, season, state, store and year, while the prevalence of c. jejuni varied by brand, product, state and store.
seasons did not affect the prevalence of c. jejuni, but they did affect the prevalence of c. coli.
isolates were identified with multiplex pcr assays and typed with pulsed field gel electrophoresis .
larger pfge databases are needed to assess the temporal reoccurrence of pfge profiles to help predict the risk associated with each profile.
data were analyzed by nominal variables  that may affect the prevalence of these bacteria.
