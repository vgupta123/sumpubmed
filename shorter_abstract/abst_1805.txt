three commonly observed adaptations in halophilic proteins are higher surface acidity, bound ions and increased numbers of intermolecular ion pairs .
halophilic proteins frequently bind anions and cations and in hvpcna cation binding may compensate for the remarkable reduction in positive charge in the pore region, to facilitate functional interactions with dna.
to investigate the halophilic adaptation of such a key protein we have crystallised and solved the structure of haloferax volcanii pcna  to a resolution of  <dig>  Ã….
instead, bound cations within the solvation shell of hvpcna may permit sliding along negatively charged dna by reducing electrostatic repulsion effects.
this may reflect the fact that the trimer is intrinsically stable over a wide range of salt concentrations and therefore additional modifications for trimer maintenance in high salt conditions are not required.
hvpcna possesses the former two adaptations but not the latter, despite functioning as a homotrimer.
in this way, hvpcna may harness its environment as opposed to simply surviving in extreme halophilic conditions.
the overall architecture of hvpcna is very similar to other known pcnas, which are highly structurally conserved.
the number of ion pairs observed in the hvpcna monomer-monomer interface was unexpectedly low.
