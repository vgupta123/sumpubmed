tritici , and poplar leaf rust melampsora species, and the corn smut fungus, ustilago maydis .
a collection of  <dig>  fungal genes was identified and compared to sequences of the cereal rusts, puccinia graminis f. sp.
the generation of genomic resources for these microbes is leading to novel insights into biology such as interactions with the hosts and guiding directions for breakthrough research in plant pathology.
from pycniospores and aeciospores, produced by infecting the alternate host, meadow rue ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads were generated, respectively.
the current set of pt unigenes contributes to gene discovery in this major cereal pathogen and will be invaluable for gene model verification in the genome sequence.
to support gene discovery and gene model verification in the genome of the wheat leaf rust fungus, puccinia triticina , we have generated expressed sequence tags  by sampling several life cycle stages.
fungal genes were predicted using the est version of the self-training genemarks algorithm.
we focused on several spore stages and isolated haustorial structures from infected wheat, generating  <dig>  ests.
focusing on spore stages, direct comparison to um identified potential functional homologs, possibly allowing heterologous functional analysis in that model fungus.
to refine the est database, we compared est sequences by blastn to a set of  <dig> pyrosequencing-generated contigs and sanger bac-end sequences derived both from the pt genome, and to ests and genome reads from wheat.
tritici  and stripe rust, p. striiformis f. sp.
many potentially secreted protein genes were identified by similarity searches against genes and proteins of pgt and melampsora spp., revealing apparent orthologs.
we produced sequences from both the sexual  and asexual  stages of the life cycle.
rust fungi are biotrophic basidiomycete plant pathogens that cause major diseases on plants and trees world-wide, affecting agriculture and forestry.
