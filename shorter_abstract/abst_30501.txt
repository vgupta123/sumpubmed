our method has an improved sensitivity and better specificity in relation to polyphen- <dig>  we also publish predictions for the complete set of  <dig>  possible missense variants in the  <dig> human mtdna-encoded polypeptides.
moreover, there is not available curated dataset of neutral and damaging mtdna missense variants to test the accuracy of predictors.
we have developed a svm classifier  specific for mtdna missense variants.
<dig> allows a better selection of candidate damaging missense variants from mtdna.
each instance is described by a set of three attributes based on evolutionary conservation in eukaryota of wildtype and mutant amino acids as well as coevolution and a novel evolutionary analysis of specific substitutions belonging to the same domain of mitochondrial polypeptides.
polyphen- <dig> showed the best results for a screening proposal with a good sensitivity.
nevertheless, the number of false positive predictions was too high.
a careful search of discriminatory attributes and a training step based on a curated dataset of amino acid substitutions belonging exclusively to human mtdna genes allows an improved performance.
several methods have been developed to predict the pathogenicity of missense mutations but none has been specifically designed for classification of variants in mtdna-encoded polypeptides.
because mtdna sequencing of patients suffering mitochondrial diseases is revealing many missense mutations, it is needed to prioritize candidate substitutions for further confirmation.
training and validation of the model was executed with  <dig>  mtdna damaging and neutral amino acid substitutions, previously curated by a set of rigorous pathogenicity criteria with high specificity.
