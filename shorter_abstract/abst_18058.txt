haplotype reconstruction is the problem of resolving the hidden phase information in genotype data obtained from laboratory measurements.
we propose a novel approach for haplotype reconstruction based on constrained hidden markov models.
relatively simple probabilistic approaches for haplotype reconstruction based on structured hidden markov models are competitive with more complex, well-established techniques in this field.
results show that it is competitive with other recently proposed methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, while offering a particularly good trade-off between computational costs and quality of results for large datasets.
models are constructed by incrementally refining and regularizing the structure of a simple generative model for genotype data under hardy-weinberg equilibrium.
solving this problem is an important intermediate step in gene association studies, which seek to uncover the genetic basis of complex diseases.
