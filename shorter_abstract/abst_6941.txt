a permutation analysis showed that top findings from our approach have a much lower false discovery rate compared to those from a traditional gwas of drug sensitivity.
functional study found that knocking down abcd <dig> in vitro led to increased apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell line skov <dig> after cisplatin treatment.
using genome-wide genetic, gene expression, and microrna expression  data, we developed an integrative approach to investigate the genetic and epigenetic basis of chemotherapeutic sensitivity.
we developed an integrative approach to the investigation of the genetic and epigenetic basis of human complex traits.
through a sequential multi-stage framework, we identified genes and mirnas whose expression correlated with platinum sensitivity, mapped these to genomic loci as quantitative trait loci , and evaluated the associations between these qtls and platinum sensitivity.
