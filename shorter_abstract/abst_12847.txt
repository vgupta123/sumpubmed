culture-plate methods were used to analyse the bacterial microflora.
the present study investigated whether the supplementation with bacillus cereus var.
we conclude that the supplementation of b. cereus var.
studies indicated different viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes, such as rotavirus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and cryptosporidium are discussed.
clostridium perfringens and enterobacteria were equally prevalent in foals with diarrhoea and those who were not afflicted.
but little is known about the development of intestinal microflora in foals.
toyoi would modify the developing intestinal microflora and consequently reduce diarrhoea in foals.
toyoi supplementation had no effect on bacterial microflora.
toyoi had no effect on the occurrence of diarrhoea and health status in the foals.
from birth, the foals were randomly assigned to three treatment groups: placebo , low dosage  and high dosage .
almost all foals develop transient diarrhoea within the first weeks of life.
