still, because our knowledge of even well-studied model organisms such as this one is incomplete, this network reconstruction contains gaps and possible errors.
a keio collection based dataset of e. coli gene essentiality was obtained from literature data and compared to model predictions.
the smiley algorithm was then used to predict the most likely missing reactions in the reconstructed network, adding reactions from a kegg based universal set of metabolic reactions.
the ijo <dig> reconstruction of the metabolic network of escherichia coli is one of the most complete and accurate metabolic reconstructions available for any organism.

the feasibility of these putative reactions was determined by comparing updated versions of the model to the experimental dataset, and genes were predicted for the most feasible reactions.
a new model improvement workflow was developed to compare model based phenotypic predictions to experimental data to fill gaps and correct errors.
