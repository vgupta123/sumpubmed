certain eukaryotic genomes, such as those of the amitochondriate parasites giardia and trichomonas, have very low intron densities, so low that canonical spliceosomal introns have only recently been discovered through genome sequencing.
here we have used environmental expressed sequence tag  sequencing to identify  <dig> genes from the uncultivable oxymonad streblomastix strix, to survey intron densities in this most poorly studied excavate group.
moreover, over 50% of these are at positions shared between a broad spectrum of eukaryotes, suggesting theyare very ancient introns, potentially present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes.
