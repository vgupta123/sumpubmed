here we show that sbp2l is an sbp <dig> paralogue in vertebrates and is the only form of secis binding protein in invertebrate deuterostomes, suggesting a key role in sec incorporation in these organisms, but an sbp2/sbp2l fusion protein is unable to support sec incorporation in vitro.
in addition, likely due to a gene duplication event in the early vertebrate lineage, sbp <dig> and sbp2l are paralogous in vertebrates.
in eukaryotes, this event requires at least three specific factors: secis binding protein  <dig> , a specific translation elongation factor , selenocysteinyl trna, and a cis-acting selenocysteine insertion sequence  element in selenoprotein mrnas.
an in-depth phylogenetic analysis of the conserved l7ae rna binding domain suggests an ancestral relationship with ribosomal protein l <dig>  in addition, we describe the emergence of a motif upstream of the sbp <dig> rna binding domain that shares significant similarity with a motif within the pseudouridine synthase cbf <dig>
while the phylogenetic relationships of selenoprotein families and the evolution of selenocysteine usage are well documented, the evolutionary history of secis binding proteins has not been explored.
