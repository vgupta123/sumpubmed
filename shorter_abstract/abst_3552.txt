we also gathered previously published eqtl data supporting a functional role for four of these snps shown to associate with disease phenotypes.
we have demonstrated the potential of publicly available resources to identify high priority candidate snps for functional studies and for disease risk prediction.
we determined  <dig> of these mress snps were listed in gwas association studies, or in strong ld with a gwas snp, and may represent the functional variants of identified gwas snps.
comparison of fst statistics  for predicted mress snps against non mress snps revealed a significantly higher  degree of subdivision among mress snps, suggesting a role for these snps in environmentally driven selection.
genome wide association studies , have identified scores of genetic variants that appear to contribute to human disease risk.
in the present study, focused on functional variants related with the binding of micrornas , we utilized snp data, including newly released  <dig> genomes project data to perform a genome-wide scan of snps that abrogate or create mir recognition element  seed sites .
furthermore,  <dig> of these have evidence of co-expression of target mrna and the predicted mir.
