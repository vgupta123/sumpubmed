we compare the accuracy of the method in classifying protein folds with some existing techniques.
searching for proteins that contain similar substructures is an important task in structural biology.
the exact solution of most formulations of this problem, including a recently published method based on tableaux, is too slow for practical use in scanning a large database.
we find that including constraints based on the separation of secondary structure elements increases the accuracy of protein structure search using maximally-similar subtableau extraction, to a level where it has comparable or superior accuracy to existing techniques.
