illumina technologies cover more bases in coding and untranslated regions.
each capture technology was evaluated for its coverage of different exome databases, target coverage efficiency, gc bias, sensitivity in single nucleotide variant detection, sensitivity in small indel detection, and technical reproducibility.
furthermore, whereas most of the technologies provide reduced coverage in regions with low or high gc content, the nextera technology tends to bias towards target regions with high gc content.
our data should help researchers who are planning exome sequencing to select appropriate exome capture technology for their particular application.
the global analysis of protein coding regions in genomes of interest by whole exome sequencing is a widely used application.
