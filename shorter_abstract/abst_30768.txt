plasmid dna molecules are closed circular molecules that are widely used in life sciences, particularly in gene therapy research.
for that purpose, we have adopted a dna assembly algorithm that uses nucleotides as building blocks.
monte carlo methods have been used for several years to simulate the conformational behavior of dna molecules.
in this paper, we present a new algorithm for the deformation of plasmid dna molecules for monte carlo simulations.
we also present the results of three experiments comparing our deformation move with the standard and biased crankshaft moves in terms of acceptance ratio of the trials, energy and temperature evolution, and average displacement of the molecule.
in each iteration these simulation methods randomly generate a new trial conformation, which is either accepted or rejected according to a criterion based on energy calculations and stochastic rules.
compared with both crankshaft moves, our move generates simulation trials with higher acceptance ratios and smoother deformations, making it suitable for real-time visualization of plasmid dna coiling.
these simulation trials are generated using a method based on crankshaft motion that, apart from some slight improvements, has remained the same for many years.
the move underlying our algorithm preserves the size and connectivity of straight-line segments of the plasmid dna skeleton.
