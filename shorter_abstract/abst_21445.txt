the dta analysis revealed that more than  <dig> differentially regulated unigenes respond to the shading signal, some of which might be involved in the fruitlet abscission process in litchi, shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying organ abscission.
eleven of the  <dig> differentially regulated unigenes, which were randomly selected for more detailed expression comparison during the course of shading treatment, were identified as being likely to be involved in the process of fruitlet abscission in litchi.
here, high-throughput rna sequencing  was employed for the de novo assembly and characterization of the fruit transcriptome in litchi, and differentially regulated genes, which are responsive to shading, were also investigated using digital transcript abundanceprofiling.
the assembled transcriptome of litchi fruit provides a global description of expressed genes in litchi fruit development, and could serve as an ideal repository for future functional characterization of specific genes.
however, a lack of transcriptomic and genomic information hinders our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying fruit set and fruit development in litchi.
shading during early fruit development decreases fruit growth and induces fruit abscission.
litchi  is one of the most important fruit trees cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas.
more than  <dig> million paired-end reads were generated and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp.
a total of  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million high-quality tags were generated from shaded and non-shaded libraries, respectively.
these unigenes were annotated by querying against various public databases, with  <dig>  unigenes found to be homologous to genes in the ncbi genbank database and  <dig>  unigenes annotated based on known proteins in the swiss-prot database.
