the complexity is especially evident in the region spanning exons  <dig> through  <dig> where a number of the alternative splicing events are thought to affect calcium sensitivity, voltage dependence and the kinetics of activation and deactivation of this calcium-activated chloride channel.
we identified tmem16a transcript variants consisting of alternative exons 6b,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  our findings indicate that many of these exons are expressed in various combinations and that these splicing events are mostly conserved between mouse and human.
our results suggest that tmem16a gene is significantly more complex than previously described.
the identification of multiple tmem16a splice variants suggests that alternative splicing is an exquisite mechanism that operates to diversify tmem16a channel function in both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
mouse tmem16a is reported to consist of  <dig> exons that code for a  <dig> amino acid protein.
in this study our aim was to provide details of mouse tmem16a genomic structure and to investigate if tmem16a transcript undergoes alternative splicing to generate channel diversity.
additional splicing events were identified including a novel conserved exon 13b, tandem splice sites of exon  <dig> and  <dig> and two intron retention events.
tmem16a  is an eight transmembrane protein that functions as a calcium-activated chloride channel.
in addition, we confirmed the expression of these exon variants in other mouse tissues.
