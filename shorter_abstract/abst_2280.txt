we conducted a number of reranking experiments using the trec  <dig> genomics track test collection in which scores extracted from pagerank and hits analysis were combined with scores returned by an off-the-shelf retrieval engine.
this article explores the hypothesis that these networks can be exploited for text retrieval, in the same manner as hyperlink graphs on the web.
the link structure of content-similarity networks can be exploited to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval systems.
graph analysis algorithms such as pagerank and hits have been successful in web environments because they are able to extract important inter-document relationships from manually-created hyperlinks.
these results generalize the applicability of graph analysis algorithms to text retrieval in the biomedical domain.
experiments demonstrate that incorporating pagerank scores yields significant improvements in terms of standard ranked-retrieval metrics.
we consider the application of these techniques to biomedical text retrieval.
