furthermore, we show that enzymes commonly perceived as orthologous, such as human branching enzyme gbe <dig> and e. coli branching enzyme glgb, are in fact related by a gene duplication and consequently paralogous.
despite being usually associated with animal liver glycogen and plant starch, energy storage in the form of branched glucose polymers is clearly an ancient process and has probably been present in the last universal common ancestor of all present life.
we show that branching and debranching enzymes can be found in all kingdoms of life, including all major groups of eukaryotes, and thus were likely to have been present in the last universal common ancestor  but have been lost in seemingly random fashion in numerous single-celled eukaryotes.
we also show how animal branching and debranching enzymes evolved from their luca ancestors by acquiring additional domains.
patterns of conservation in the evolution of the glycogen/starch branching and debranching enzymes hint at some as yet unknown mechanisms, as mutations disrupting these patterns lead to a variety of genetic diseases in humans and other mammals.
