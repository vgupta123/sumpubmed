a hallmark of tfp is the ability to retract the pilus upon surface contact, a property mediated by the atpase pilt.
in a previous study, we were able to show that one pilin gene, pila, was essential for virulence of a type b strain in a mouse infection model.
this suggests that expression and surface localisation of pila contribute to virulence in the highly virulent type a strain, while pilt was dispensable for virulence in the mouse infection model.
interestingly, out of the two major human pathogenic subspecies only the highly virulent type a strains have a functional pilt gene.
all four francisella tularensis subspecies possess gene clusters with potential to express type iv pili .
interestingly, when mice were infected with a mixture of each mutant strain and the wild-type strain, the pila, pilc and pilq mutants were out-competed, while the pilt mutant was equally competitive as the wild-type.
in this work we have examined the role of several tfp genes in the virulence of the pathogenic type a strain schu s <dig>  pila, pilc, pilq, and pilt were mutated by in-frame deletion mutagenesis.
