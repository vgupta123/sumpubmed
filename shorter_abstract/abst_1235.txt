the assembled sequences were annotated by blastx comparison against a non-redundant protein sequence database with  <dig> % of the sequences having a blast match.
the genome of origin for the sequences produced was predicted using eclat with sequences derived from the axenically grown symbiotic partners used as training sequences for the classification model.
lichens are symbiotic organisms that have a remarkable ability to survive in some of the most extreme terrestrial climates on earth.
our results present a first transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly for a lichen species and describe the ongoing molecular processes and the most active pathways in c. rangiferina.
genetic resources have been established in lichen species for the study of molecular systematics and their taxonomic classification.
these data provide a first glimpse into the molecular nature of the lichen symbiosis and characterise the transcriptional space of this remarkable organism.
no lichen species have been characterised yet using genomics and the molecular mechanisms underlying the lichen symbiosis and the fundamentals of desiccation tolerance remain undescribed.
we report the characterisation of a transcriptome of the grey reindeer lichen, cladonia rangiferina, using high-throughput next-generation transcriptome sequencing and traditional sanger est sequencing data.
<dig> % of the sequences had a gene ontology term match and  <dig> % of the sequences had a domain or structural match following an interpro search.
