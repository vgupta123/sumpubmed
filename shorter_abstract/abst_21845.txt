directed expression of srl-rnai in the d. melanogaster eye causes abnormal ommatidia and bristle formation while eye specific expression of srl-ey does not produce the minor rough eye phenotype associated with high temperature gmr-gal <dig> expression.
ddc-gal <dig> mediated tissue specific expression of srl transgene constructs in d. melanogaster da neurons causes altered lifespan and climbing ability.
the reduced lifespan and climbing ability associated with a tissue specific expression of srl in da neurons provides a new model of pd in d. melanogaster which may be used to identify novel therapeutic approaches to human disease treatment and prevention.
parkinson disease  is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting with symptoms of resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and additional severe cognitive impairment over time.

expression of a srl-rnai causes an increase in mean lifespan but a decrease in overall loco-motor ability while induced expression of srl-ey causes a severe decrease in mean lifespan and a decrease in loco-motor ability.
the sole drosophila melanogaster homologue of this gene family, spargel , has been shown to function in similar pathways of mitochondrial upkeep and biogenesis.
