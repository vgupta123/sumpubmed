but, currently there is a lack for visualizations that are able to deal with phased haplotype data.
we present inphap, an interactive visualization tool for genotype and phased haplotype data.
as a proof of concept, we apply inphap to the phased haplotype data set of phase  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes project.
as of today, inphap is the only visual analytical tool that allows the user to explore unphased and phased haplotype data interactively.

inphap closes the gap between common visualization tools for unphased genotype data and introduces several new features, such as the visualization of phased data.
interactive visualizations, that allow the user to explore the data in various ways, can be of great assistance in the process of making well informed decisions.
to understand individual genomes it is necessary to look at the variations that lead to changes in phenotype and possibly to disease.
thereby, inphapâ€™s ability to show genetic variations on the population as well as on the individuals level is demonstrated for several disease related loci.
inphap features a variety of interaction possibilities such as zooming, sorting, filtering and aggregation of rows in order to explore patterns hidden in large genetic data sets.
