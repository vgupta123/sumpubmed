tilling , a general reverse genetic technique that combines traditional mutagenesis with high throughput methods for mutation discovery, is such a method.
heteroduplexes were formed through denaturation and annealing of pcr products, mismatches digested with a crude preparation of cel i nuclease and cleaved fragments visualized using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
while these can be powerful, a non-transgenic, unbiased targeted mutagenesis method that can generate a range of allele types would add considerably to the analysis of the rice genome.
to apply tilling to rice, we developed two mutagenized rice populations.
we estimate that the density of induced mutations is two- to threefold higher than previously reported rice populations .
one population was developed by treatment with the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulphonate , and the other with a combination of sodium azide plus methyl-nitrosourea .
