hexactinellid mtdnas have shown similar trends in gene content, nucleotide composition, and codon usage, and have retained a large gene syntenty.
analysis of the mtdna of a. vastus has provided evidence diagnostic for + <dig> programmed translational frameshifting, a phenomenon disparately reported throughout the animal kingdom, but present in the hexactinellid mtdnas that have been sequenced to date.
the a. vastus mtdna consisted of a  <dig>  base pair circular molecule containing thirteen protein-coding genes, divergent large and small subunit ribosomal rnas, and a reduced set of  <dig> trnas.
the a. vastus mtdna showed a typical hexactinellid nucleotide composition and shared a large synteny with the other sequenced glass sponge mtdnas.
here we determined the first complete mitochondrial genome of a hexactinellid sponge, aphrocallistes vastus, and compared it to published poriferan mtdnas to further describe characteristics specific to hexactinellid and other sponge mitochondrial genomes.
mitochondrial genomes  of numerous sponges have been sequenced as part of an ongoing effort to resolve the class-level phylogeny of the porifera, as well as to place the various lower metazoan groups on the animal-kingdom tree.
it also contained an unidentified open reading frame and large intergenic space region.
most recently, the partial mtdna of two glass sponges, class hexactinellida, were reported.
