we explored the molecular mechanism of resistance to bph in rice by comparing expressions of tf genes between rht and tn <dig>  we speculate that the level of gene repression, especially for early tf genes, plays an important role in the defense response.
transcription factors  are up-stream regulators of various genes that bind to specific dna sequences, thereby controlling the transcription from dna to mrna.
they are key regulators for transcriptional expression in biological processes, and are probably involved in the bph-induced pathways in resistant rice varieties.
we detected  <dig> tf genes showing differential expression signals between the two rice varieties.
however, the molecular mechanism of bph-resistance in rice remains unclear.
we conducted a microarray experiment to analyze tf genes related to bph resistance in a sri lankan rice cultivar, rathu heenati .
the molecular responses of plants to sucking insects resemble responses to pathogen infection.
we have selected  <dig> tf genes related to bph resistance for further analyses to understand the molecular responses to bph feeding in rice.
of these,  <dig> tf genes were probably related to bph-induced resistance in rht and tn <dig>  and  <dig> may be related to constitutive resistance only in rht.
at an fc threshold of > <dig>  there were  <dig> induced tf genes and  <dig> constitutive resistance tf genes.
of these,  <dig> were probably involved in bph-induced resistance, and  <dig> in constitutive resistance to bph in rht.
among the  <dig> tf genes related to bph-induced resistance, most of them were readily induced in tn <dig> than in rht by bph feeding, for instance,  <dig> tf genes were up-regulated in tn <dig>  but only  <dig> tf genes were up-regulated in rht at  <dig> hours after bph infestation; 2– <dig> times more tf genes were induced in tn <dig> than in rht by bph.
we compared the expression profiles of tf genes in rht with those of the susceptible rice cultivar taichun native  <dig> .
