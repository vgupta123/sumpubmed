we demonstrated this framework in a search for prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer which resulted in the identification of several prognostic image features and a promising multimodal  prognostic signature.
its application to a set of breast cancer cases resulted in image-based and combined  prognostic scores for relapse-free survival.
the framework proposed allows for a joint analysis of images and gene expression data.
genomics and proteomics are nowadays the dominant techniques for novel biomarker discovery.
the images were reduced to a set of salient patterns and additional measurements of their spatial distribution, with the resulting features being directly used in a standard biomarker discovery application.
thus, integrating the histopathology images in the biomarker discovery workflow could potentially lead to the identification of new image-based biomarkers and the refinement or even replacement of the existing genomic and proteomic signatures.
we developed a framework for integrating the histopathology images in the biomarker discovery workflow based on the bag-of-features approach – a method that has the advantage of being assumption-free and data-driven.
however, histopathology images contain a wealth of information related to the tumor histology, morphology and tumor-host interactions that is not accessible through these techniques.
