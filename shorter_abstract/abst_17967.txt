sin <dig>  is part of a transcriptional deacetylase complex, which generally mediates the formation of repressive chromatin.
a nucleolar localization of hsin3b and all the eto homologues was demonstrated upon overexpression in cos- <dig> cells, and confirmed for the endogeneously expressed proteins in k <dig> cells.
the purpose of this work was to study possible interactions between corepressors human sin3b  and the eto homologues â€“ eto , mtg <dig>  and mtgr <dig> .
in addition, the subnuclear localization of the hsin3b and the eto homologues was also examined.
our data from protein-protein interactions and immunolocalization experiments support that hsin3b is a potential member of a corepressor complex involving selective eto homologues.
results with both ectopically expressed proteins in cos- <dig> cells and endogeneous proteins in the k <dig> human erytholeukemia cell line demonstrated interactions between hsin3b and eto or mtg <dig> but not mtgr <dig>  furthermore, nuclear extract of primary placental cells showed complexes between hsin3b and eto.
