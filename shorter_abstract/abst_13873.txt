we report findings from an experiment designed to test the effects of environmental variability on the adaptation and divergence of replicate populations of e. coli.
these results support the hypothesis that environmental heterogeneity can give rise to more rugged adaptive landscapes, which in turn promote evolutionary diversification.
these results also demonstrate that this effect depends on the form of environmental heterogeneity, with greater divergence when the pairs of resources fluctuated temporally rather than being presented simultaneously.
this design allowed us to compare the effects of resource identity and presentation on the evolutionary trajectories followed by replicate populations.
combinations of sugars were presented either simultaneously or as temporally fluctuating resource regimes.
among-population divergence also differed across regimes, with variation higher in those groups that evolved in fluctuating environments than in those that faced constant resource regimens.
for example, a heterogeneous environment might lead to a more rugged adaptive landscape, making it more likely that replicate populations would evolve toward distinct adaptive peaks, relative to a uniform environment.
this divergence under the fluctuating conditions increased between  <dig> and  <dig> generations, consistent with replicate populations evolving toward distinct adaptive peaks.
environmental conditions affect the topology of the adaptive landscape and thus the trajectories followed by evolving populations.
to date, the influence of environmental variability on evolutionary dynamics has received relatively little experimental study.
after  <dig> generations, the fitness of all populations had increased relative to the common ancestor, but to different extents.
