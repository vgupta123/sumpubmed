this study of the expression of germ cell markers in the honeybee implies that in this species either germ cells are formed by an inductive event, late in embryogenesis, or they are formed early in development in the absence of vasa and nanos expression.
this contrasts with germ cell development in other members of the hymenoptera, diptera and lepidoptera.
studies of specification of germ-cells in insect embryos has indicated that in many taxa the germ cells form early in development, and their formation is associated with pole plasm, germ plasm or an organelle called the oosome.
these cells are the developing germ cells that are moved dorsally by dorsal closure and are placed in the genital ridge.
in this study i report the cloning and expression analysis of honeybee homologues of vasa and nanos, germ cell markers in insects and other animals.
none of these morphological features associated with germ cell formation have been identified in the honeybee apis mellifera.
