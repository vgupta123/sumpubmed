gene ontology  is widely used to capture detailed expert knowledge in genomic-scale datasets and as a consequence has grown to contain many terms, making it unwieldy for many applications.
the use of ontologies to control vocabulary and structure annotation has added value to genome-scale data, and contributed to the capture and re-use of knowledge across research domains.
we illustrate this method by application to go, generating go slims at different information thresholds, characterising their depth of semantics and demonstrating the resulting gains in statistical power.
here we present an objective framework for generating customised ontology slims for specific annotated datasets, exploiting information latent in the structure of the ontology graph and in the annotation data.
this framework combines ontology engineering approaches, and a data-driven algorithm that draws on graph and information theory.
