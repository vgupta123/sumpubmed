we propose new algorithms that process high-throughput sequencing  data to extract unnamed vj junctions and gather them into clones for quantification.
in leukemia, they are used to quantify the minimal residual disease during patient follow-up.
our methods identified the main clone, as well as additional clones that were not identified with standard protocols.
the algorithms were applied to tr γ hts data from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and also on data simulating hypermutations.
