the presence and absence of mcm <dig> and  <dig> is concordant in all taxa sampled with the exception of drosophila species.
mcm <dig> is highly divergent in all drosophila species and may not provide a good model for mcm <dig> in other eukaryotes.
we used comparative genomics and phylogenetics to reconstruct the diversification of the eukaryotic mcm2- <dig> gene family, demonstrating that mcm2- <dig> were formed by seven gene duplication events before the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes.
yeast and animal cells require six mini-chromosome maintenance proteins  for pre-replication complex formation, dna replication initiation and dna synthesis.
these six individual mcm proteins form distinct heterogeneous subunits within a hexamer which is believed to form the replicative helicase and which associates with the essential but non-homologous mcm <dig> protein during dna replication.
in some eukaryotes mcm <dig> and mcm <dig> paralogues also appear to be involved in dna replication although their exact roles are unclear.
mcm <dig> and  <dig> are widely distributed in eukaryotes and group together on the mcm phylogenetic tree to the exclusion of all other mcm paralogues suggesting co-ancestry.
in contrast archaea generally only possess one mcm homologue which forms a homohexameric mcm helicase.
