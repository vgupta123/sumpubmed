our data demonstrate that the smac-pkcδ interaction is direct and that it is facilitated by an open conformation of pkcδ.
protein kinase c δ  is known to be an important regulator of apoptosis, having mainly pro- but also anti-apoptotic effects depending on context.
in addition, we found that c <dig> and c <dig> domains from several pkc isoforms have smac-binding capacity.
in a previous study, we found that pkcδ interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein smac.
the interaction is enhanced by the pkc activator tpa and seems to be independent of pkcδ catalytic activity since the pkc kinase inhibitor gf109203x did not inhibit the interaction.
we found that pkcδ binds directly to smac through its regulatory domain.
the binding is mediated via the pkcδ regulatory domain and both the c <dig> and c <dig> domains have smac-binding capacity.
because the knowledge on the molecular determinants of the interaction is limited, we aimed at characterizing the interactions between pkcδ and smac.
