they recognize similar asymmetric cognate sites and cleave at a distance of 11/ <dig> nt from the recognition site.
family enzymes is also of practical importance in gene manipulation technology, as it extends the range of available dna cleavage specificities.
in the case of tsoi the classic biochemical selection method was successful, probably because of the substantially lower optimal reaction temperature of tsoi .
in continuing our research into the new family of bifunctional restriction endonucleases , we describe the cloning of the tsoirm gene.
tsoi rease, which originate from thermophilic thermus scotoductus rfl <dig> , was cloned in escherichia coli  using two rounds of biochemical selection of the t. scotoductus genomic library for the tsoi methylation phenotype.
currently, the family includes six thermostable enzymes: taqii, tth111ii, tthhb27i, tspgwi, tspdti, tsoi, isolated from various thermus sp.
besides basic research advances, the cloning and characterisation of the new prototype rease from the thermus sp.
the orf was pcr-amplified, subcloned into a pet <dig> derivative under the control of a t <dig> promoter and was subjected to the third round of biochemical selection in order to isolate error-free clones.
dna sequencing of restriction-resistant clones revealed the common open reading frame  of  <dig> bp, coding for a large polypeptide of  <dig> aminoacid  residues, which exhibited a high level of similarity to tth111ii .
