ten of the σb-positively regulated genes of l. monocytogenes are absent in l. innocua.
we used quantitative real-time pcr analysis and immuno-blot analysis to examine σb expression during growth of l. monocytogenes egd-e. whole genome-based transcriptional profiling was used to identify σb-dependent genes at different growth phases.
genes comprising the σb regulon encode solute transporters, novel cell-wall proteins, universal stress proteins, transcriptional regulators and include those involved in osmoregulation, carbon metabolism, ribosome- and envelope-function, as well as virulence and niche-specific survival genes such as those involved in bile resistance and exclusion.
the general stress response, controlled by the alternative sigma factor, σb, has an important role for bacterial survival both in the environment and during infection.
a total of  <dig> σb-positively regulated listerial genes had homologs in b. subtilis, but only  <dig> have been previously described as being σb-regulated in b. subtilis even though both species share a highly conserved σb-dependent consensus sequence.
