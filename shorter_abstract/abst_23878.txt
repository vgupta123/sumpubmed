modern banana cultivars are primarily interspecific triploid hybrids of two species, musa acuminata and musa balbisiana, which respectively contribute the a- and b-genomes.

the m. balbisiana genome has been associated with improved vigour and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses and is thus a target for musa breeding programs.
results for the plantains demonstrated the expected 2: <dig> distribution of reads across the a- and b-genomes, but for the aaa genomes, results show they contain regions of significant homology to the b-genome supporting proposals that there has been a history of interspecific recombination between homeologous a and b chromosomes in musa hybrids.
the usefulness of this b-genome sequence was evaluated by mapping rna-seq data from a set of triploid aaa and aab hybrids simultaneously to both genomes.
there is substantial sequence divergence from the a-genome at a frequency of  <dig> homozygous snp per  <dig>  bp, and a high degree of heterozygosity corresponding to one heterozygous snp per  <dig>  bp.
we have generated and annotated a draft reference musa b-genome and demonstrate that this can be used for molecular genetic mapping of gene transcripts and small rna expression data from several allopolyploid banana cultivars.
our strategy was to align pkw gdna reads against the published a-genome and to extract the mapped consensus sequences for subsequent rounds of evaluation and gene annotation.
this draft therefore represents a valuable resource to support the study of metabolism in inter- and intraspecific triploid musa hybrids and to help direct breeding programs.
the resulting b-genome is 79% the size of the a-genome, and contains  <dig>  predicted functional gene sequences which is nearly identical to the  <dig>  of the a-genome.
