to guarantee clean genome assemblies and to prevent the introduction of contamination into public databases, considerable quality control efforts are put into post-sequencing analysis.
the latter also enables the removal of any contaminant, yielding a clean sample.
as genomic coverage in the tree of life is highly fragmented, there is an urgent need for a reference-free methodology for contaminant identification in sequence data.
we present acdc, a tool specifically developed to aid the quality control process of genomic sequence data.
acdc can reliably detect contamination in single-cell genome data.
results are displayed in an interactive user interface.
tested on a large number of samples from diverse sequencing projects, our software is able to quickly and accurately identify contamination.
a major obstacle in single-cell sequencing is sample contamination with foreign dna.
second, reference-free inspection is enabled by the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that include fast, non-linear dimensionality reduction of oligonucleotide signatures and subsequent clustering algorithms that automatically estimate the number of clusters.
