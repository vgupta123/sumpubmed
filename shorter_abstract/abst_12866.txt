coordinated expression patterns and similar promoter architectures among the 'early response' genes suggest that they belong to a potential regulon  that responds to elevated levels of ros during chilling stress.
based on the current results, it appears that this regulon is independent of aba and cbf/dreb, and that its activation has an important contribution in configuring the rapid responses of rice seedlings to chilling stress.
recent evidence also showed that the cbf/dreb regulon is not unique to ca but evolutionarily conserved between chilling-insensitive  and chilling-sensitive  plants.
in this study, the wide contrast in chilling sensitivity between indica and japonica rice was used as model to identify other regulatory clusters by integrative analysis of promoter architecture  and gene expression profiles.
the cbf/dreb-regulated network of genes has been shown to play a prominent role in freeze-tolerance of arabidopsis through the process of cold acclimation .
cultivar-specific expression signatures of the candidate genes indicate a positive correlation between the activity of the putative regulon and genotypic variation in chilling tolerance.
among this group were four transcription factors including ros-bzip <dig> and another larger sub-group with a common feature of having as1/ocs-like elements in their promoters.
a hypothetical model of an ros-mediated regulon  triggered by chilling stress was assembled in rice.
transcriptome analysis in chilling tolerant japonica rice identified a subset of  <dig> 'early response' genes that were upregulated during the initial  <dig> hours at 10Â°c.
