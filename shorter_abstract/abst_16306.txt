scientific experiments often comprise complex data flows, selection of adequate parameters, and analysis and visualization of intermediate and end results.
we strongly believe that our efforts not only decrease the turnaround time to obtain scientific results but also have a positive impact on reproducibility, thus elevating the quality of obtained scientific results.
we have developed a set of tools that enables the scientific community to benefit from workflow interoperability.
furthermore, not all features of all workflow engines are royalty-free â€”an aspect that could potentially drive away members of the scientific community.
our work will not only reduce time spent on designing scientific workflows, but also make executing workflows on remote high-performance computing resources more accessible to technically inexperienced users.
we have also overcome the shortcomings and combined the features of two royalty-free workflow engines with a substantial user community: the konstanz information miner, an engine which we see as a formidable workflow editor, and the grid and user support environment, a web-based framework able to interact with several high-performance computing resources.
