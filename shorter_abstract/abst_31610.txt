phylogenetic analysis in hypocreales fungi revealed an extensive history of gene loss and duplication.
the pattern of intron loss and gain is consistent with this phylogeny.
e. festucae is exceptional in that it contains two kexin-like genes.
phylogenetic analysis indicated that these slps belong to four different subtilisin families: proteinase k, kexin, pyrolysin and subtilisin.
in fungi, slps can play either a general nutritive role, or may play specific roles in cell metabolism, or as pathogenicity or virulence factors.
