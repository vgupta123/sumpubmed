the invariant lineage of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has potential as a powerful tool for the description of mutant phenotypes and gene expression patterns.
we have developed a companion software package, acetree, which links the images and the annotations using tree representations of the lineage.
that method uses time-lapse confocal imaging of a strain expressing histone-gfp fusions and a software package, starrynite, processes the thousands of images and produces output files that describe the location and lineage relationship of each nucleus at each time point.
