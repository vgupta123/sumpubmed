the method we present here is able to purify protein complexes from specific tissues.
tissue-specific biotinylation is achieved by the expression in select tissues of the bacterial biotin ligase bira, which biotinylates proteins tagged with the avi peptide.
affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry  is a widely used approach to identify protein interactions and complexes.

in multicellular organisms, the accurate identification of protein complexes by ap/ms is complicated by the potential heterogeneity of complexes in different tissues.
here, we present an in vivo biotinylation-based approach for the tissue-specific purification of protein complexes from caenorhabditis elegans.
we have identified the domains that mediate the dlg-1/atad- <dig> interaction, and show that this interaction contributes to c. elegans development.
we validated the ability of our approach to identify bona fide protein interactions by identifying the known lgl- <dig> interaction partners par- <dig> and pkc- <dig>  purification of the discs large protein dlg- <dig> identified several candidate interaction partners, including the aaa-type atpase atad- <dig> and the uncharacterized protein maph- <dig> .
we generated n- and c-terminal tags combining gfp with the avi peptide sequence, as well as four bira driver lines expressing bira ubiquitously and specifically in the seam and hyp <dig> epidermal cells, intestine, or neurons.
we uncovered a series of dlg- <dig> interactors, and conclude that atad- <dig> is a biologically relevant interaction partner of dlg- <dig>  finally, we conclude that maph- <dig>  is a microtubule-associated protein of the map <dig> family and a candidate neuron-specific interaction partner of dlg- <dig>
