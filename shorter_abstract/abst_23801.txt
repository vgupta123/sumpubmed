results of multi-locus phylogenetic analyses show clade support for at least seventeen species-level lineages including two new laetiporus in china.
we used six genetic markers to estimate a genus-level phylogeny including  the internal transcribed spacer ,  nuclear large subunit rdna ,  nuclear small subunit rdna ,  translation elongation factor 1-Î± ,  dna-directed rna polymerase ii subunit  <dig> , and  mitochondrial small subunit rdna .
molecular dating using beast estimated the present crown group diverged approximately  <dig>  million years ago  in the early miocene.
biogeographic analyses using rasp indicated that laetiporus most likely originated in temperate zones with east asia and north america having the highest probability  of being the ancestral area.
four intercontinental dispersal routes and a possible concealed dispersal route were established for the first time.
the aim of this study was to characterize the molecular relationship, origin and historical biogeography of the species in important brown rot fungal genus laetiporus from east asia, europe, pan-america, hawaii and south africa.
