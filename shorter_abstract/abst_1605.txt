these results suggest that our technique can detect pkc translocation initiated by ligand binding to mglur <dig> and its modulation by a1r.
we cultured hek <dig> cells on the gold-plated slide glass and evoked spr at the interface between the cellâ€™s plasma membrane and the gold surface with incident light.
spr imaging turned out to be utilizable for monitoring gpcr-mediated pkc translocation and its modulation by a different gpcr in a heterologous expression system.
this increase indeed reported pkc translocation because it was reduced by a pre-treatment with bisindolylmaleimide- <dig>  a pkc inhibitor.
the translocation of activated native pkc to the plasma membrane is expected to alter the incident angle-spr extent relation, and this could be detected as a change in the intensity of light reflection from the specimen illuminated at a fixed incident angle.
however, fluorescence imaging, the technique widely used for this purpose, requires a fluorescent dye which may inhibit biological responses or a fluorescent-tagged target protein created through time-consuming genetic manipulation.
g protein-coupled receptors  are ubiquitous surface proteins mediating various biological responses and thus, important targets for therapeutic drugs.
real-time observation of gpcr signaling and modulation in living cells is key to molecular study of biological responses and pharmaceutical development.
in this study, we applied two-dimensional surface plasmon resonance  imaging to monitoring the translocation of protein kinase c , a major gpcr-coupled signaling molecule in the widely used hek <dig> cell lines and examined whether the signaling of, and, modulation between heterologously expressed gpcrs can be measured without fluorescent labeling.
this technique provides a powerful yet easy-to-use tool for molecular study of biological responses and pharmaceutical development.
direct activation of pkc with 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increased the reflection intensity.
a pre-treatment with -n6-phenylisopropyladenosine, an a1r-selective agonist suppressed mglur1-mediated reflection increase.
- <dig> -dihydroxyphenylglycine, a mglur <dig> agonist, increased the reflection intensity, and the pkc inhibitor reduced this increase.
