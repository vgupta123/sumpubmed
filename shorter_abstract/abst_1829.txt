these data suggest that phcynpv and anpenpv might be variants of each other, and that the differences in cross-infection might be caused by gene mutations.
the genome sequences of two anpenpv isolates have been published.
however, most of the six genes required for infectivity via the oral route were found in phcynpv and in the two anpenpv isolates, with high sequence similarities.
most of the genes in phcynpv are similar to the two anpenpv isolates, including the direction of expression of the orfs.
the two viruses have similar polyhedral morphologies and their viral fragments share high sequence similarity.
two species of wild silkworms, the chinese oak silkworm  and the castor silkworm philosamia cynthia ricini, can acquire a serious disease caused by nucleopolyhedrin viruses  .
the genome of phcynpv is  <dig>   <dig> bp, with a g + c content of  <dig> %, and encodes  <dig> open reading frames  of at least  <dig> amino acids  .
however, the physical maps of the viral genomes and cross-infectivity of the viruses are different.
between phcynpv and anpemnpv-l and -z isolates,  <dig> orfs are identical, including  <dig> baculovirus core genes.
