in plants carotenoids play an important role in the photosynthetic process and photo-oxidative protection, and are the substrate for the synthesis of abscisic acid and strigolactones.
understanding the genetic basis of grain yellow pigments, and identifying associated markers provide the basis for improving wheat quality by molecular breeding.
identifying qtls linked to carotenoid pigmentation can contribute to understanding genes underlying carotenoid accumulation in the wheat kernels.
ten carotenoid genes mapped in chromosome regions underlying pigment content qtls indicating possible functional relationships between candidate genes and the trait.
in addition to their protective role as antioxidants and precursors of vitamin a, in wheat carotenoids are important as they influence the colour  of the grain.
the genome-wide association study based on genotyping a tetraploid wheat collection with  <dig>  gene-associated snps validated quantitative trait loci  previously detected in biparental populations and discovered new qtls for grain colour-related traits.
twenty-four candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of carotenoid compounds have been identified in wheat by comparative genomics.
together these outputs can be combined to exploit the genetic variability of colour-related traits for the nutritional and commercial improvement of wheat products.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  found in the coding sequences of  <dig> candidate genes allowed their chromosomal location and accurate map position on two reference consensus maps to be determined.
