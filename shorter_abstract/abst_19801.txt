fpb was used to remove the background from all fingerprints of three grapevine physical map projects.
a clone fingerprint is composed of true peaks representing real fragments and background peaks, mainly composed of e. coli genomic dna, partial digestions, star activity by-products, and machine background.
that is why background peaks removal has become an important issue and needs to be automatized, especially in capillary electrophoresis based fingerprints.
the large variation in the quality of fingerprints that is usually present in large fingerprinting projects represents a major difficulty in the correct removal of background peaks that has only been partially addressed by the methods so far adopted that all require a long manual optimization of parameters.
its usefulness has been proved for whole-genome shotgun projects as a post-assembly validation and recently it has also been used in the assembly step to constrain on bacs positions.
the construction of a whole-genome physical map has been an essential component of numerous genome projects initiated since the inception of the human genome project.
high-throughput fingerprinting leads to the production of thousands of bac clone fingerprints per day.
in all cases a successful assembly was built.
