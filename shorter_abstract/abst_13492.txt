it combines a data warehouse approach with some rigorous statistical methods for assessing the as of genes involved in diseases.
beat is a web tool which allows uploading and analyzing exon array datasets using standard statistical methods and an easy-to-use graphical web front-end.
beat has been tested on a dataset with  <dig> samples and tuned using new datasets of exon array experiments from  <dig> colorectal cancer and  <dig> renal cell cancer samples produced at the medical genetics unit of irccs casa sollievo della sofferenza.
the exon array technology, with more than five million data points, can detect approximately one million exons, and it allows performing analyses at both gene and exon level.
beat provides a user-friendly platform for a comprehensive study of as events in human diseases, displaying the analysis results with easily interpretable and interactive tables and graphics.
to highlight all possible as events, alternative names, accession ids, gene ontology terms and biochemical pathways annotations are integrated with exon and gene level expression plots.
last generation affymetrix genechip human exon  <dig>  st arrays offer a more detailed view of the gene expression profile providing information on the as patterns.
meta statistics are proposed as a novel approach to explore the analysis results.
the user can customize the results choosing custom thresholds for the statistical parameters and exploiting the available clinical data of the samples for a multivariate as analysis.
