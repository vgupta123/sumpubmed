in any case, a comprehensive description of the host-microbiota interactions can not ignore the profile of eukaryotic viruses within the virome, as viruses are definitely critical for the regulation of the host immunophenotype.
the tool uses hierarchical databases for eukaryotic viruses to unambiguously assign reads to viral species more accurately and > <dig> fold faster than other existing approaches.
only some software have been designed to profile the viral sequences, however they are not efficient in the characterization of viruses in the context of complex communities, like the intestinal microbiota, containing bacteria, archeabacteria, eukaryotic microorganisms and viruses.
we validated viromescan on synthetic microbial communities and applied it on metagenomic samples of the human microbiome project, providing a sensitive eukaryotic virome profiling of different human body sites.
