then, we used a next-generation sequencing -based method  to detect the whole genome methylation of the two regions in malnourished mice and normal mice.

our findings may help to indicate the genome-wide dna methylation status of different brain regions and the effects of malnutrition on brain dna methylation.
notably, we found that in the thalamus,  <dig> discriminable variations existed and that approximately 60% were related to neuronal development or psychiatric diseases.
by quantifying the total amount of 5-methylcytosine  in the thalamus and the hippocampus of postnatal malnourished mice and normal mice, we found the two regions showed differences in global dna methylation status.
the results also indicate that postnatal malnutrition may increase the risk of psychiatric disorders.
pathway analyses of the corresponding genes highlighted changes for  <dig> genes related to long-term potentiation .
the methylation level in the thalamus was much higher than that in the hippocampus.
postnatal brains appear to exhibit stimulus-induced methylation changes because of factors such as environment, lifestyle, and diet .
dna methylation has been viewed as the most highly characterized epigenetic mark for genome regulation and development.
the purpose of this study was to examine how extensively the brain dna methylome is regulated by nutrition in early life.
