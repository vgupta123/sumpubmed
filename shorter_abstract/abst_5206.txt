using high performance liquid chromatography, combined with electrochemical detection  we found that mecp2-/y mice exhibit an alteration of da metabolism in the ponto-bulbar region at  <dig> weeks followed by a more global alteration of monoamines when the disease progresses .
female patients are affected with an incidence of 1/ <dig> live births and develop normally from birth to 6- <dig> months of age before the onset of deficits in autonomic, cognitive, motor functions  and autistic features.
