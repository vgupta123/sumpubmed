the results quantify for the first time in an animal population the high diversity of pathogens a population may have to deal with and the levels of co-infections with key pathogens such as theileria parva.
the infectious diseases of east african livestock  project is an epidemiological study of cattle health in western kenya with the aim of providing baseline epidemiological data, investigating the impact of different infections on key responses such as growth, mortality and morbidity, the additive and/or multiplicative effects of co-infections, and the influence of management and genetic factors.
a longitudinal cohort study of newborn calves was conducted in western kenya between 2007- <dig>  calves were randomly selected from all those reported in a  <dig> stage clustered sampling strategy.
mortality was mainly to east coast fever, haemonchosis, and heartwater.
the study followed the  <dig> calves over the first  <dig> weeks of life or until death and when they were reported clinically ill. the cohort experienced a high all cause mortality rate of 16% with at least 13% of these due to infectious diseases.
only  <dig>  of routine visits were classified as clinical episodes, with a further  <dig> reported by farmers.
blood and tissue samples were collected in association with all visits and screened using a range of laboratory based diagnostic methods for over  <dig> different pathogens or infectious exposures.
there is a widely recognised lack of baseline epidemiological data on the dynamics and impacts of infectious cattle diseases in east africa.
