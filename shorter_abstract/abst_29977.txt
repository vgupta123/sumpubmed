our results suggest that btb spreads more rapidly in dairy herds compared to other herd types, a likely cause being management and demographic-related factors.
however, outbreaks in dairy herds can be controlled more rapidly than in typically extensive herd types.
overall, dairy herds showed higher β  than beef or bullfighting herds .
time to recover otf status was also significantly lower in dairy herds, and length of btb episodes was significantly reduced when the ifn-γ was implemented to manage the outbreak.
eradication of bovine tuberculosis  through the application of test-and-cull programs is a declared goal of developed countries in which the disease is still endemic.
