additionally, new visualization tools were developed to enable the user to easily examine further sequence associated criteria such as higher order structure, conservation, g+c content, transition-transversion profiles and in situ target accessibility patterns.
the probe design tools of the arb software package take into consideration several criteria such as number, position and quality of diagnostic sequence differences while designing oligonucleotide probes.
the entire arb software package along with the probe accessibility data is available from the arb home page .
the evaluation of proposed probe targets with respect to higher-order rrna structure is of importance for successful design and performance of in situ hybridization experiments.
using this tool, in silico probe design and evaluation can be performed with respect to in situ probe accessibility data.
the different types of sequence associated information  can be visualized by user defined background colors within the arb primary and secondary structure editors as well as in the probe match tool.
