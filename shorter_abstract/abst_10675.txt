the present results suggest that tsst- <dig> production is not directly associated with the agr structure, but is instead controlled by unknown transcriptional/translational regulatory systems, or synthesized by multiple regulatory mechanisms that are interlinked in a complex manner.
the amounts of tsst- <dig> produced by clinical mrsa isolates varied.
we found that 75% of surveyed mrsa isolates  possessed the tst gene and that  <dig> % belonged to agr class  <dig>  the concentrations of tsst- <dig> secreted into culture supernatants by  <dig> strains measured by western blotting differed 170-fold.
staphylococcus aureus  is an important pathogen associated with both nosocomial and community-acquired infections and its pathogenicity is attributed to its potential to produce virulence factors.
we previously found that some strains produce relatively large amounts of tsst-1; however, no reports have described the amount of tsst- <dig> produced by clinical isolates.
sequencing the entire agr locus  revealed that some had allelic variations regardless of the amount of tsst- <dig> produced whereas sequencing the sar, sigma factor b and the tst promoter region revealed no significant changes.
