here, a genome-wide identification and comparison of the ppr genes from  <dig> organisms was performed, including the moss physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii, the eudicot arabidopsis, and the monocots rice and foxtail millet.
the duplication and divergence rates of the foxtail millet ppr genes  showed that the expansion period of this gene family around  <dig> mya, and indicated that genome segmental duplication was very likely the primary mechanism underlying the expansion of the ppr gene family in vascular plants.
our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding the roles of ppr proteins and will be useful in the prioritization of particular ppr proteins for subsequent functional validation studies in foxtail millet.

subcellular localization analysis of  <dig> ppr proteins indicated that  <dig> proteins were localized to chloroplasts, that  <dig> were localized to mitochondria, and that  <dig> were localized to the cytoplasm.
pentatricopeptide repeat  proteins are encoded by a large gene family of approximately  <dig> members in arabidopsis and  <dig> in rice, which characterized by tandem repetitions of a degenerate  <dig> amino acid characteristic sequence motifs.
it appears that the expansion of this gene family prior to the divergence of the euphyllophytes and the lycophytes in land plants.
an analysis of a complete set of sippr genes/proteins that included classification, chromosomal location, orthologous relationships, duplication analysis, and auxiliary motifs is presented.
expression analysis of the sippr genes under stress conditions revealed that the expression of  <dig> sippr genes was responsive to abiotic stress.
a large majority of the ppr genes in the higher plants are localized in organelles.
the majority of characterized ppr proteins have been found to function in modulating the expression plastid and mitochondrial genes in plants.
