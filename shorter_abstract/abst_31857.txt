we believe that explicit knowledge-based approaches to make neuroscientific knowledge computationally accessible will be helpful in tackling this challenge and will enable a variety of applications exploiting this knowledge, such as surgical planning.
computational neuroanatomical approaches such as described in this work could become a key tool in translational informatics, leading to decision support applications that inform and guide surgical planning and personalized care for neurological disease in the future.
we built a prototype model of the motor system that integrates descriptive anatomic and qualitative functional neuroanatomical knowledge.
neuroanatomical knowledge can be represented in machine-accessible format using ontologies.
in addition to modeling normal neuroanatomy, our approach provides an explicit representation of abnormal neural connectivity in disease states, such as common movement disorders.
the ontology-based models can be evaluated computationally, enabling development of automated computer reasoning applications.
a critical challenge in neuroscience is organizing, managing, and accessing the explosion in neuroscientific knowledge, particularly anatomic knowledge.
we developed ontology-based models of neuroanatomy to enable symbolic lookup, logical inference and mathematical modeling of neural systems.
the ontology-based representation encodes both structural and functional aspects of neuroanatomy.
