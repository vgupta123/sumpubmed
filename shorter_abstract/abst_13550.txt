our data also indicate when administered to a patient with a compromised blood-brain barrier, desloratadine may cause sedation.
to fully examine the in vivo antimuscarinic efficacy of desloratadine, two murine and two rat models were utilized.
however, both in vitro and in vivo experimentation indicates that the third generation antihistamine, desloratadine, antagonizes muscarinic receptors.
therefore, second and third generation antihistamines which effectively antagonize the h <dig> receptor without significant affinity for muscarinic receptors have been developed.
the presented data demonstrate that the third generation antihistamine, desloratadine, does not significantly antagonize peripheral muscarinic receptors mediating salivation and lacrimation, therefore, xerostomia and dry eyes should not be observed with therapeutic use of desloratadine.
patients with compromised cardiovascular systems should be closely monitored when administered desloratadine based on our results that desloratadine has the ability to interfere with normal cardiovascular function mediated by muscarinic receptors.
in conscious mice, desloratadine failed to inhibit oxotremorine-induced  salivation, lacrimation, and tremor.
muscarinic receptor mediated adverse effects, such as sedation and xerostomia, significantly hinder the therapeutic usefulness of first generation antihistamines.
negative chronotropic effects caused by oxotremorine were inhibited by desloratadine, methoctramine, and the muscarinic m <dig> selective antagonist, 4-damp .
in the conscious animal, inhibition of baroreflex-mediated bradycardia was evaluated.
