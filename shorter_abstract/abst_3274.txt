the mechanism of cellulose degradation by r. albus  <dig> is not well-defined and is thought to involve pilin-like proteins, unique carbohydrate-binding domains, a glycocalyx, and cellulosomes.
global transcriptomic analysis of r. albus  <dig> grown at identical dilution rates on cellulose and cellobiose in a chemostat showed that this bacterium, when growing on cellulose, utilizes a carbohydrate-degrading strategy that involves increased transcription of the rare carbohydrate-binding module  family  <dig> domain and the tryptophan biosynthetic operon.
fermentation analysis of r. albus  <dig> revealed the ability to produce ethanol and acetate on a wide range of fibrous substrates in vitro.
in particular, they are important in ruminants where they digest a wide range of plant cell wall polysaccharides.
a comparison of the r. albus  <dig> genome sequence against the genome sequences of related bacteria that either encode or do not encode cellulosomes revealed that r. albus  <dig> does not encode for most canonical cellulosomal components.
bacteria in the genus ruminococcus are ubiquitous members of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract.
our data suggest that r. albus  <dig> does not use canonical cellulosomal components to degrade cellulose, but rather up-regulates the expression of cbm37-containing enzymes and tryptophan biosynthesis.
this study contributes to a revised model of carbohydrate degradation by this key member of the rumen ecosystem.
