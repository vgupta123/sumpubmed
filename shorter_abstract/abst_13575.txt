however rnai screening using sirnas is hampered by non-specific or off target effects of the sirnas, making it difficult to separate genuine hits from false positives.
three of these seed sequences appear in the human mirnas mir-26a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  transfection of mimics of these mirnas protects several cell types from trail-induced cell death.
further these results show that rnai screening enriches for sirnas with relevant off-target effects.
we have conducted a careful examination of off-target effects during an sirna screen for novel regulators of the trail apoptosis induction pathway.
we identified  <dig> hexamers and  <dig> heptamer seed sequences that appeared multiple times in the top twenty sirnas in the trail apoptosis screen.
using a novel statistical enrichment approach, we systematically identified a further  <dig> hexamer and  <dig> heptamer seed sequences enriched in high scoring sirnas.
some of these effects can be identified by the over-representation of certain seed sequences in high-scoring sirnas and we demonstrate the usefulness of such systematic analysis of enriched seed sequences.
