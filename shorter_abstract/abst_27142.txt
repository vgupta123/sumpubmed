we developed a conservation-independent technique based on an integrative approach that combines machine learning, bioinformatic tools, biological insights of known mirna expression profiles and universal criteria of plant mirnas to identify mirnas with more confidence.
the predicted mirnas are highly associated with abiotic stress responses, tolerance and development.
this approach provides a broad repertoire of hexaploid wheat mirnas associated with abiotic stress responses, tolerance and development.
these valuable resources of expressed wheat mirnas will help in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms involved in freezing and al responses and tolerance mechanisms as well as for development and flowering.
it allowed the discovery of  <dig> mirna candidates associated with different abiotic stresses and development stages.
in addition, many environmental and biological factors affecting mirna expression were not yet considered, resulting still in an incomplete repertoire of wheat mirnas.
however, the currently used approaches to identify mirnas in this polyploid complex system focus on conserved and highly expressed mirnas avoiding regularly those that are often lineage-specific, condition-specific, or appeared recently in evolution.
the developed pipeline can potentially identify novel wheat mirnas that share features common to several species or that are species specific or clade specific.
go enrichment analysis showed that they may play biological and physiological roles associated with cold, salt and aluminum  through auxin signaling pathways, regulation of gene expression, ubiquitination, transport, carbohydrates, gibberellins, lipid, glutathione and secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, as well as floral transition and flowering.
