the percentage of ngn3-gfp-positive clusters increases dramatically with the chain length of interconnected spermatogonia.
furthermore, ngn3-gfp-negative cells are found in chains of ngn3-gfp-positive spermatogonia, suggesting that cells in the aal spermatogonia could revert to a more primitive state.
although the undifferentiated spermatogonia can be topographically divided into as , apr , and aal  spermatogonia, subdivision of this primitive cell population using cytological markers would greatly facilitate characterization of their functions.
life-long production of spermatozoa depends on spermatogonial stem cells.
spermatogonial stem cells exist among the most primitive population of germ cells â€“ undifferentiated spermatogonia.
in the present study, we show that lin <dig>  a pluripotency factor, is specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia  in mouse.
