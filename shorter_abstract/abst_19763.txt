these include severe delays in post-implantation development and defects in the anterior midline and neural folds at headfold stages.
our results indicate that the bmp <dig> signalling pathway contributes to the development of the anterior visceral endoderm, and reveal an early functional redundancy between the products of the murine dishevelled genes.
however, this approach is difficult to apply in specific windows of time, and to simultaneously knock-down multiple genes.
here we report an efficient method for dsrna-mediated gene silencing in late cleavage-stage mouse embryos that permits examination of phenotypes at post-implantation stages.
it also reveals a novel role for bmp <dig> in the regulation the anterior visceral endoderm specific gene expression and its positioning.
