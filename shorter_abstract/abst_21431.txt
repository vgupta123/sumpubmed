in silico analysis of transcript abundance identified hundreds of gdta in canker versus healthy stem tissues.
chestnut cdna showed higher coding sequence similarity to genes in other woody plants than in herbaceous species.
these dta genes belong to various pathways involving cell wall biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species , salicylic acid , ethylene, jasmonic acid , abscissic acid , and hormone signalling.
the similar set of gdtas in american chestnut and chinese chestnut suggests that the variation in sensitivity to this pathogen between these species may be the result of different timing and amplitude of the response of the two to the pathogen infection.
here, further analyses of a larger dataset and assemblies including both  <dig> and capillary sequences were performed and defense related genes with differential transcript abundance  in canker versus healthy stem tissues were identified.
resources developed in this study are useful for functional genomics, comparative genomics, resistance breeding and phylogenetics in the fagaceae.
backcross breeding has been underway to introgress resistance from chinese chestnut into surviving american chestnut genotypes.
over one and a half million cdna reads were assembled into  <dig>  transcript contigs from american chestnut and  <dig>  transcript contigs from chinese chestnut.
the number of genes tagged, the length of coding sequences, and the numbers of tagged members within gene families showed that the cdna dataset provides a good resource for studying the american and chinese chestnut transcriptomes.
development of genomic resources for the family fagaceae, has focused in this project on castanea mollissima blume  and castanea dentata  borkh  to aid in the backcross breeding effort and in the eventual identification of blight resistance genes through genomic sequencing and map based cloning.
a century ago, chestnut blight disease  devastated the american chestnut.
