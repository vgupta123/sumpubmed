as predicted by the trade-off hypothesis of virulence, costs of infection with wnv mp <dig> in terms of survival were directly correlated to viral load, yet resistance to infection with this virulent strain was equally costly.
our results demonstrate strain-specific effects on mosquito survival, fecundity, and blood feeding behavior.
taken together, these results demonstrate that wnv mp <dig> infection decreases the transmission potential of cx.
using west nile virus  and culex pipiens mosquitoes, we tested the hypothesis that intrahost fitness is correlated with virulence in mosquitoes by evaluating life history traits following exposure to either non-infectious bloodmeals or bloodmeals containing wildtype  or the high fitness, mosquito-adapted strain, wnv mp <dig> derived from wnv wt.
virulence is often coupled with replicative fitness of viruses in vertebrate systems, yet the relationship between virulence and fitness of arthropod-borne viruses  in invertebrates has not been evaluated.
pipiens populations despite the increased intrahost fitness of this strain, indicating that a virulence-transmission trade-off in invertebrates could contribute significantly to the adaptive and evolutionary constraint of arboviruses.
although the interactions between vector-borne pathogens and their invertebrate hosts have been characterized as being largely benign, some costs of arbovirus exposure have been identified for mosquitoes.
pipiens and altered fecundity and bloodfeeding such that early egg output was enhanced at a later cost.
specifically, both resistance to and infection with wnv mp <dig>  but not wnv wt, decreased survival of cx.
