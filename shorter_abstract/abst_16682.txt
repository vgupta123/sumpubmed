sexually dimorphic traits mainly result from differential expression of genes present in both sexes.
sex-differential genes are related to various biological systems, and suggest new insights into the pathophysiology of diverse human diseases.
we also identified a significant association between sex-specific gene transcription and reduced selection efficiency and accumulation of deleterious mutations, which might affect the prevalence of different traits and diseases.
such genes can be subject to different, and even opposing, selection constraints in the two sexes.
this can impact human evolution by differential selection on mutations with dissimilar effects on the two sexes.

this seeming paradox might partially explain the high incidence of human infertility.
interestingly, many of the sex-specific genes that also undergo reduced selection efficiency are essential for successful reproduction in men or women.
this work provides a comprehensive overview of the sex-differential transcriptome and its importance to human evolution and human physiology in health and in disease.
