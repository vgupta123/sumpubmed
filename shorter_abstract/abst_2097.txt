to reduce costs, sequencing of restriction enzyme based reduced representation libraries can be utilized.
post sequencing, it performs optimized demultiplexing using these barcodes to create fastq files per barcode which can easily be plugged into existing variant analysis pipelines.
here we demonstrate the usability of the gbsx toolkit and demonstrate improved in-line barcode demultiplexing and trimming performance compared to existing tools.
gbsx provides an easy to use suite of tools for designing and demultiplexing of gbs experiments.
gbsx is a package that assists in selecting the appropriate enzyme and the design of compatible in-line barcodes.
to deal with gbs experimental design and initial processing specific bioinformatic tools are needed.
