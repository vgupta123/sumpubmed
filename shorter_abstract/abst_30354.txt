as we observed response parallelism between individuals from demes belonging to similar thermal groups for these traits, some of the differentiation seems likely to result from local adaptation
in order to explore the degree of temperature-related divergence in early development, a multi-temperature common-garden experiment was performed on embryos from four different demes experiencing different spring temperatures.
individuals from warm streams had the highest yolk-consumption rate under cold conditions.
following colonization of new habitats and subsequent selection, adaptation to environmental conditions might be expected to be rapid.
early developmental characters were measured to test if individuals from the four demes respond differently to the treatment temperatures.
