the above patterns are broadly integrated in an analysis discussing relations between ku, the non-homologous end joining dna repair pathway, ageing and lymphocyte development.
these patterns and their analysis support non-homologous end joining double strand break repair as central to the ageing-relatedness of dna repair genes.
the goal is to build classification models that allow us to discriminate between ageing-related and non-ageing-related dna repair genes, in order to better understand their different properties.
the main patterns discovered by the classification methods are as follows:  the number of protein-protein interactions was a predictor of dna repair proteins being ageing-related;  the use of predictor attributes based on protein-protein interactions considerably increased predictive accuracy of attributes based on gene ontology  annotations;  go terms related to "response to stimulus" seem reasonably good predictors of ageing-relatedness for dna repair genes;  interaction with the xrcc <dig>  protein is a strong predictor of ageing-relatedness for dna repair genes; and  dna repair genes with a high expression in t lymphocytes are more likely to be ageing-related.
in this paper we propose a data mining approach, based on classification methods , for analysing data about human dna repair genes.
