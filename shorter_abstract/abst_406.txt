then, the fraction of suv420h <dig> captured and characterized by tap/ms is a soluble fraction which may be in a stable association with hp <dig>  consequently, suv420h <dig> may be recruited to heterochromatin in association with hp <dig>  and stably maintained at its heterochromatin sites in an hp1-independent fashion.
we studied the dynamic properties of suv420h <dig> and the hp <dig> in living cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.
our results showed that hp <dig> proteins are highly mobile with different dynamics during the cell cycle, whereas suv420h <dig> remains strongly bound to pericentric heterochromatin.
frap experiments reveal that in contrast to hp <dig>  suv420h <dig> is strongly associated to pericentric heterochromatin.
histone lysine methylation plays a fundamental role in chromatin organization and marks distinct chromatin regions.
controlled chromatin organization is crucial for gene expression regulation and genome stability.
an  <dig> amino-acids region of suv420h <dig>  the heterochromatic targeting module, recapitulates both, hp <dig> binding and strong association to heterochromatin.
in particular, trimethylation at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  and at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig>  governed by the histone methyltransferases suv39h1/ <dig> and suv420h1/ <dig> respectively, have emerged as a hallmark of pericentric heterochromatin.
therefore, it is essential to analyze mechanisms responsible for high order chromatin packing and in particular the interplay between enzymes involved in histone modifications, such as histone methyltransferases and proteins that recognize these epigenetic marks.
