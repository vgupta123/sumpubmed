we contrasted the mirna content of first year crop plants with that of second year crop ones, and were able to show that of  <dig> conserved  and six novel mirnas ,  <dig> of the former and three of the latter were differentially expressed.
the three novel mirnas were predicted to target seven genes, and the  <dig> conserved ones  <dig> genes.
using a massively parallel  dna sequencing platform, it was possible to identify and quantify the abundance of a large number of r. glutinosa mirnas.
we have compared differential mirnas expression in the first year crop  r. glutinosa plants and second year crop  ones.
the outcome identifies some potential leads for understanding the molecular basis of the processes underlying the difficulty of maintaining the productivity of continuously cropped r. glutinosa.
the potential targets of  <dig> of these differentially expressed mirnas involved in the main transcription regulation, plant development and signal transduction.
while there is some information available describing the physiological and environmental causes of this yield decline, there is as yet no data regarding the changes in gene expression which occur when the species is continuously cropped.
