the aim of the present study was to look for this parasite in  <dig> foxes collected in an apennine area of central italy by different diagnostic methods.
preliminarily, we can say that no e. multilocularis could be found in the study area.
these data will enable us to follow temporal changes of the spatial distribution of the parasite in the study area of the central apennines.
due to its low specificity the elisa kit for e. multilocularis coproantigens is not suitable for epidemiological surveys, whereas molecular diagnostics applied to faecal samples give useful results.
the foxes were heavily parasitized by  <dig> helminthic genera, but none of the animals was infected by e. multilocularis neither by e. granulosus .
finally, absence of e. granulosus in foxes living in the endemic areas studied confirms the thought that this tapeworm prefers a different definitive host.
molecular diagnostics were sensitive and specific for the detection and identification of tapeworm eggs in faeces, but less sensitive, although specific, to adult tapeworms in the intestinal content.
thus, more surveys need to be done in other italian regions in order to monitor the spreading of e. multilocularis.
recent studies on geographic distribution of echinococcus multilocularis in europe show that it has a wider range than previously thought.
low specificity was observed in commercially available elisa kits for the detection of e. multilocularis antigens in the faeces.
italy, previously considered e. multilocularis-free, is now part of these new areas: infected foxes  have been observed in a northern alpine territory.
