this study characterised ifitms in two distantly related marsupial species, the australian tammar wallaby and the south american grey short-tailed opossum, and analysed the phylogeny of the ifitm family in vertebrates.
as in eutherians, most marsupial ifitm genes exist within a cluster, contain two exons and encode proteins with two transmembrane domains.
only two ifitm genes, ifitm <dig> and ifitm <dig>  have orthologues in both marsupials and eutherians.
like eutherians, marsupials also have multiple ifitm genes that exist in a gene cluster.
the differing expression patterns for many of the paralogues, together with poor sequence conservation between species, suggests that ifitm genes have acquired many different roles during vertebrate evolution.
ifitm <dig> arose in bony fish and ifitm <dig> in tetrapods.
the bone-specific expression of ifitm <dig> appears to be restricted to therian mammals, suggesting that its specialised role in bone production is a recent adaptation specific to mammals.
five ifitm paralogues were identified in both the tammar and opossum.
interferon inducible transmembrane proteins  have diverse roles, including the control of cell proliferation, promotion of homotypic cell adhesion, protection against viral infection, promotion of bone matrix maturation and mineralisation, and mediating germ cell development.
