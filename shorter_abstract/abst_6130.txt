lung infections as well as lymphadenitis are most often caused by m. avium subsp.
we developed a random mutagenesis method based on illegitimate recombination and integration of a hygromycin-resistance marker.
the genus mycobacterium  comprises highly pathogenic bacteria such as m. tuberculosis as well as environmental opportunistic bacteria called non-tuberculous mycobacteria .
only few virulence genes from m. avium have been defined among other things due to difficulties in generating m. avium mutants.
more efforts in developing new methods for mutagenesis of m. avium and identification of virulence-associated genes are therefore needed.
ntm are ubiquitous and have been isolated from soil, natural water sources, tap water, biofilms, aerosols, dust and sawdust.
while the incidence of tuberculosis is declining in the developed world, infection rates by ntm are increasing.
screening for mutations possibly affecting virulence was performed by monitoring of ph resistance, colony morphology, cytokine induction in infected macrophages and intracellular persistence.
