the selected methods were cello, multiloc, proteome analyst, ptarget and wolf psort.
proteins localized to the secretory pathway were the most difficult to predict, while nuclear and extracellular proteins were predicted with the highest sensitivity.
in addition, an independent evaluation set of  <dig> mouse proteins from locate with a bias towards the subcellular localization underrepresented in swissprot was used.
all methods showed lower performance on the locate dataset and variable performance on individual subcellular localizations was observed.
in order to perform a comprehensive survey of prediction methods, we selected only methods that accepted large batches of protein sequences, were publicly available, and were able to predict localization to at least nine of the major subcellular locations , peroxisome, and lysosome).
in order to address this paucity of data, many computational prediction methods have been developed.
determination of the subcellular location of a protein is essential to understanding its biochemical function.
