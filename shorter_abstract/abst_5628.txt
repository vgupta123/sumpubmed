second, biochemical characterization of the purified spda protein showed that, contrary to expectation, it had no detectable activity against 3′, 5′camp and, instead, high activity against the positional isomers 2′, 3′camp and 2′, 3′cgmp.
we further showed that clr is a 3′, 5′camp-dependent dna-binding protein and identified a dna-binding motif to which clr binds.
a spda null mutant was also partially affected in 3′, 5′camp signaling.
3′, 5′camp signaling in sinorhizobium meliloti was recently shown to contribute to the autoregulation of legume infection.
circumstantial evidence suggests that spda may contribute insulating 3′, 5′camp-based signaling from 2′, 3′ cyclic nucleotides of metabolic origin.
fourth, we have shown a negative impact of exogenous 2′, 3′camp on 3′, 5′camp-mediated signaling in vivo.
spda is a nodule-expressed 2′, 3′ specific phosphodiesterase whose biological function remains elusive.
third, we provide direct experimental evidence that the purified clr protein was able to bind both 2′, 3′camp and 3′, 5′camp in vitro at high concentration.
