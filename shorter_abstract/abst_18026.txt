profile hidden markov models , clustered subalignments and 3d structural predictions defined potential interaction motifs and specificity determining sites to reveal distinct signatures between the four homologous microtubule binding domains and independent divergence of the amino terminus.
these pathophysiological studies have yet to be complemented by computational analyses of its molecular evolution and structural models of all its functional domains to explain the molecular basis for its conservation profile, its site-specific interactions and the propensity to conformational disorder and aggregate formation.
these analyses clarified ambiguities of mapt nomenclature, defined the order, timing and pattern of its molecular evolution and identified key residues and motifs relevant to its protein interaction properties and pathogenic role.

additional unexpected findings included the expansion of cysteine-containing, microtubule binding domains of mapt in cold adapted antarctic icefish and the emergence of a novel multiexonic saitohin  gene from repetitive elements in mapt intron  <dig> of certain primate genomes.
bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses, genetic linkage maps and domain architectures distinguished a nonvertebrate outgroup from the emergence of map <dig> and its subsequent ancestral duplication to map <dig> and mapt.
