neural expression included axonal tracks, olfactory bulb, purkinje cell layer and dentate gyrus.
clic <dig> is involved in multiple cellular processes including apoptosis, cellular differentiation, inflammation and endothelial tubulogenesis.
renal clic <dig> expression was most pronounced in proximal tubules, although altered renal function was not detected in the absence of clic <dig>  myeloid cells and b cells of the spleen are rich in clic <dig> expression as are cd <dig> and cd <dig> positive t cells.
we analyzed clic <dig> expression during embryonic development and adult organs.
in order to fulfill this goal, we generated a knock-in mouse to express green fluorescent protein  from the clic <dig> locus, thus substituting the gfp coding region for clic <dig>  we used gfp protein expression to eliminate cross reaction with other clic family members.
in a comprehensive study detailing clic <dig> expression in situ in a mouse model that excludes cross reaction with other family members, we were able to document previously unreported expression for clic <dig> in developing fetus, particularly the brain.
in the adult mouse, clic <dig> is highly expressed globally in vascular endothelial cells as well as in liver, lung alveolar septae, pancreatic acini, spermatogonia, renal proximal tubules, cardiomyocytes and thymic epithelial cells.
