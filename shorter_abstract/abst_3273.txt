previous studies on somatotopy using functional mri have either used low field strength, have included a small number of subjects or failed to attribute activations to any area within s <dig>  in the present study we included twenty subjects, who were investigated at  <dig> tesla .
results from the group analysis, that is both the location of the fingers and the euclidian distances, are well comparable to results from previous studies using a wide range of modalities.
on the subject level the spatial localisation of the fingers showed a less stringent somatotopic order so that the location of a finger in a single subject cannot be predicted from the group result.
we focused specifically on brodmann area 3b, which neurons have discrete receptive fields with a potentially more clearcut somatotopic organisation.
the primary sensory cortex  in the postcentral gyrus is comprised of four areas that each contain a body map, where the representation of the hand is located with the thumb most laterally, anteriorly and inferiorly and the little finger most medially, posteriorly and superiorly.
the euclidian distance between the first and fifth finger was  <dig>  mm, between the first and second finger  <dig>  mm and between the remaining fingers on average  <dig>  mm.
the spatial distribution for all fingers' peak activation was determined and group as well as individual analysis was performed.
in the group analysis the thumb was located most laterally, anteriorly and inferiorly with the other fingers sequentially positioned more medially, posteriorly and superiorly.
