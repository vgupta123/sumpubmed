the ctpp of nad <dig> is sufficient for vacuolar targeting and plays an important role in detoxification of the defensin as it moves through the plant secretory pathway.
by transgenically expressing the class ii plant defensin nad <dig> with and without its cognate ctpp we have demonstrated that nad <dig> is phytotoxic to cotton plants when expressed without its ctpp.
transgenic cotton plants expressing constructs encoding the nad <dig> precursor with the ctpp had the same morphology as non-transgenic plants but expression of nad <dig> without the ctpp led to plants that were stunted, had crinkled leaves and were less viable.
plant defensins are small , basic, cysteine-rich proteins that have a major role in innate immunity in plants.
immunofluorescence microscopy and transient expression of a green fluorescent protein -ctpp chimera were used to confirm that the ctpp is sufficient for vacuolar targeting.
finally circular dichroism and nmr spectroscopy were used to show that the ctpp adopts a helical confirmation.
in this report we have described the role of the ctpp on nad <dig>  a class ii defensin from nicotiana alata flowers.
