previous approaches to the study of genomic fragility have examined the distribution of breaks, as well as the coincidence of breaks with segmental duplications and repeats, within a single species.
furthermore, the fragile regions are enriched for segmental duplications.
our investigation, based on human, chimp, mouse, rat, dog and chicken, suggests that the propensity of a chromosomal region to break is significantly correlated among independent lineages, even when covariates are considered.
in contrast, we investigate whether this regional fragility is an inherent genomic characteristic and is thus conserved over multiple independent lineages.
we do this by quantifying the extent to which certain genomic regions are disrupted repeatedly in independent lineages.
recent findings indicate that evolutionary breaks in the genome are not randomly distributed, and that certain regions, so-called fragile regions, are predisposed to breakages.
based on a novel methodology, our work provides additional support for the existence of fragile regions.
