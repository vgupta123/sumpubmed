the findings of the study also provide support for the notion that peripheral blood can be used as a surrogate tissue to study the systemic effect of exercise training.
we identified  <dig> significant transcripts differentially expressed in the leukocyte transcriptome of young endurance athletes as compared with non-athlete controls with a false discovery rate  <  <dig> , comprising mainly the genes encoding ribosomal proteins and the genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
endurance exercise training, especially the high-intensity training, exhibits a strong influence on the immune system.
consequently, we chose to investigate the alterations in the transcriptional profile of blood leukocytes in young endurance athletes as compared with healthy sedentary controls, using affymetrix human gene  <dig>  st array.
our data indicates that in young healthy individuals, intense endurance exercise training  can chronically induce transcriptional changes in the peripheral blood leukocytes, upregulating genes related to protein production and mitochondrial energetics, and downregulating genes involved in inflammatory response.
gene set enrichment analysis identified three major gene set clusters: two were up-regulated in athletes including gene translation and ribosomal protein production, and mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation and biogenesis; one gene set cluster identified as transcriptionally downregulated in athletes was related to inflammation and immune activity.
