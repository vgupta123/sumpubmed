replication initiation at origins of replication in the yeast genome takes place on chromatin as a template, raising the question how histone modifications, for instance histone acetylation, influence origin firing.
in previous work, we identified sum <dig> as an origin-binding protein that contributes to efficient replication initiation.
in this study, we investigated how sum <dig> affected replication initiation.
taken together, our results demonstrate a role for histone deacetylation in origin activity and reveal a novel aspect of origin regulation by chromatin.
these results suggest recruitment of the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex to a number of yeast origins, where hst <dig> deacetylated h <dig> k <dig>
we found that it functioned in initiation as a component of the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex, implying a role for histone deacetylation in origin activity.
furthermore, mutation of lysines to glutamines in the h <dig> tail, which imitates the constantly acetylated state, resulted in a reduction of origin activity comparable to that in the absence of hst <dig>  showing that deacetylation of h <dig> was important for full initiation capacity of these origins.
initiation requires binding of the replication initiator, the origin recognition complex , to a consensus sequence within origins.
we identified several origins in the yeast genome whose activity depended on both sum <dig> and hst <dig>  importantly, sum1Δ or hst1Δ caused a significant increase in histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  acetylation levels, but not other h <dig> acetylation sites, at those origins.
sum <dig> is part of the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex that represses meiotic genes during vegetative growth via histone deacetylation by the histone deacetylase  hst <dig>
