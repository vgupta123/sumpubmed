prostate cancer  is a disease with multifactorial etiology that includes both genetic and environmental components.
recurrent chromosome copy number abnormalities  were observed in both hpin and cap.
it is therefore likely that the alterations in copy number are part of a programmed cycle of events that promote tumour development, progression and survival.
the combination of lcm, mda and gacgh is ideally suited for the identification of cnas from small cell clusters and may assist in the discovery of potential genomic markers for early diagnosis, or identify the location of tumour suppressor genes  or oncogenes previously unreported in hpin and cap.
the accumulation of cnas, which occurs during this process is non-random and may indicate chromosomal regions important in tumourigenesis.
