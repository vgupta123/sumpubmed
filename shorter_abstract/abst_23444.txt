subcomplexes b and c had nadh:dehydrogenase activity, while subcomplexes c and d contained subunits of complex i membrane arm.
pgz binds complex i subunits, which induces disassembly of this complex, reduces its activity, depletes cellular atp, and, in mice and hepg <dig> cells, upregulates nuclear dna-encoded gene expression of complex i and iii subunits.
in isolated mitochondria from mouse liver, we measured the effects of pgz treatment on mrc complex activities, fully-assembled complex i and its subunits, gene expression of complex i and iii subunits, and pgz binding to mitochondrial complexes.
formation of supercomplexes ci+ciii2+civn and ci+ciii <dig> decreased in mouse liver mitochondria exposed to pgz, while formation of these supercomplexes was increased in mice treated with pgz.
in vitro, pgz decreased activity of complexes i and iii of the mrc, but in vivo only complex i activity was decreased in mice treated for  <dig> weeks with  <dig> mg/kg/day of pgz.
thiazolidinediones are antidiabetic agents that increase insulin sensitivity but reduce glucose oxidation, state  <dig> respiration, and activity of complex i of the mitochondrial respiratory chain .
in these cells, pgz decreased intracellular atp content and enhanced gene expression of specific protein  <dig> and peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor γ coactivator 1α .
autoradiography and coimmunoprecipitation assays showed pgz binding to subunits ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  and ndufa <dig>  treatment with pgz increased mitochondrial gene transcription in mice liver and hepg <dig> cells.
in vitro treatment of isolated liver mitochondria with pgz disassembled complex i, resulting in the formation of several subcomplexes.
in mice treated with pgz, fully assembled complex i was increased and two additional subcomplexes were found.
two-dimensional analysis of complex i using blue native/sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  showed that in vitro pgz induced the formation of four subcomplexes of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kda, respectively.
the aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which pioglitazone , a member of the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic agents, decreases the activity of the mrc.
