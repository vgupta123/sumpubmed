our results demonstrate that the meta-analysis based on systems biology level provide a more useful approach to study the molecule mechanism of complex disease.
then, microrna expression profiles and chip-seq data were integrated for the further pathway enrichment analysis.
in this study, we therefore developed a systems biology based approach by integrating three types of omics data to identify common pathways in glioma.
the integration of different types of omics data, including gene expression microarrays, microrna and chip-seq data, suggest some common pathways correlated with glioma.
with recent advances in microarray technology, including genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, it brings a great challenge for integrating this "-omics" data to analysis complex disease.
however, the meta-analysis for pathway analysis based on multiple microarray datasets has not been systematically pursued.
among these gene expression datasets,  <dig> pathways were found in genego database that shared by four stages.

among them, the pathway of tgf-beta-dependent induction of emt via smad is of particular importance.
