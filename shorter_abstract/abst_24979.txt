we found that censol sequences are very similar between the two species but the censol copy number in s. invicta is much greater than that in s. geminata.
centromeres are essential for accurate chromosome segregation, yet sequence conservation is low even among closely related species.
our results are consistent with a model of simple runaway centromere expansion due to centromere drive.
centromere drive predicts rapid turnover because some centromeric sequences may compete better than others during female meiosis.

in addition, centromere expansion in s. invicta is not correlated with the duplication of cenh <dig>  comparative analyses revealed that several closely related fire ant species also possess long centromeres.
in addition to sequence composition, longer centromeres may have a transmission advantage.
we report the first observations of extremely long centromeres, covering on average 34 % of the chromosomes, in the red imported fire ant solenopsis invicta.
bioinformatics and molecular analyses identified censol, the major centromeric satellite dna repeat.
