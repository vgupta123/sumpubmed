the mutagenesis method was also used to alter the substrate specificity of β-lactamase which does not significantly hydrolyse the antibiotic cefotaxime.
in protein drug development, in vitro molecular optimization or protein maturation can be used to modify protein properties.
one basic approach to protein maturation is the introduction of random dna mutations into the target gene sequence to produce a library of variants that can be screened for the preferred protein properties.
the practical implications of our results are that suitable improved protein candidates can be recovered from in vitro protein evolution approaches using significantly fewer rounds of mutagenesis and selection, and with little or no collateral damage to the protein or its mrna.
to demonstrate the high diversity that can be sampled from a qβ replicase-generated mrna library, the approach was used to evolve the binding affinity of a single domain vnar shark antibody fragment  against malarial apical membrane antigen- <dig>  via ribosome display.
in this report, we describe a novel rna-based random mutagenesis strategy that utilizes qβ replicase to manufacture complex mrna libraries with a mutational spectrum that is close to the ideal.
the binding constant  of 12y- <dig> was increased by 22-fold following two consecutive but discrete rounds of mutagenesis and selection.
