our results demonstrate the usefulness of whole genome approaches at detecting major determinants of resistance as well as compensatory mutations that alleviate the fitness cost associated with resistance.
the acquisition of these mutations conferred a fitness cost however, which was further enhanced by the acquisition of a mutation in a rna methyltransferase implicated in resistance.
to analyze the role of these mutations, we reconstituted resistance by serial whole genome transformation of a novel resistant isolate into two strains with sensitive background.
comparative genomic analyses revealed that transformants acquired g2576t transversions in every gene copy of 23s rrna and that the number of altered copies correlated with the level of linezolid resistance and cross-resistance to florfenicol and chloramphenicol.
