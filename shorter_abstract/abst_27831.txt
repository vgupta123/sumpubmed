the syntenic regions detected were up to  <dig> kb in populus.
two syntenic regions between arabidopsis and these bacs were much shorter, around  <dig> kb.
we also found syntenic regions that are conserved between the prunus bacs and medicago.
we observed a more complex network of synteny between prunus-arabidopsis, indicative of multiple genome duplication and subsequence gene loss in arabidopsis.
the array of synteny corresponded with the proposed whole genome duplication events in populus and medicago.
using map-anchored prunus sequences, we detected many syntenic blocks with several gene pairs between prunus and populus or arabidopsis.
fragmentary conservation of synteny has been reported between map-anchored prunus sequences and arabidopsis.
eight prunus bac sequences and map-anchored prunus sequences were used in the comparison.
other peach bacs also showed extensive synteny with populus.
we found a well conserved synteny across the prunus species – peach, plum, and apricot – and populus using a set of homologous prunus bacs.
our result shows the striking microsynteny between the prunus bacs and the genome of populus and medicago.
