a fungal its sequence dataset generated by  <dig> sequencing of environmental samples is used to demonstrate the utility of clotu.
clotu is implemented in a linux computer cluster and is freely accessible to academic users through the bioportal web-based bioinformatics service .
clotu has been constructed to be highly user-friendly and flexible, since different types of analyses are needed for different datasets.
clotu is a flexible and easy to use bioinformatics pipeline that includes different options for filtering, trimming, clustering and taxonomic annotation of high throughput sequence reads.
in clotu, the user can filter out low quality sequences, trim tags, primers, adaptors, perform clustering of sequence reads, and run blast against ncbinr or a customized database in a high performance computing environment.
the implementation of high throughput sequencing for exploring biodiversity poses high demands on bioinformatics applications for automated data processing.
