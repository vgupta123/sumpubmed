the interactors identified play various roles in developmental process or basic biochemical events such as ribosome biogenesis.
we have conducted the first extensive search for let- <dig> interactors using a multi-directional approach and established the first interaction map of let-756/fgf with other fgf binding proteins from other species.
we found kin- <dig> and kin- <dig>  the orthologs of ck2α and ck2β, as new partners of let- <dig>  third, following the assumption that recognition motifs mediating protein interaction may be conserved between species, we screened a two-hybrid cdna human library using let- <dig> as bait.
the interactions were validated by co-immunoprecipitation and determination of their site of occurrence in mammalian cells.
