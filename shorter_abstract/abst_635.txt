our method uses supervised learning approaches to train a model describing the dependence of enhancer activity on sequence features and histone marks.
additionally, we assess the relevance of different sequence motifs in prediction accuracy showing that even tissue-specific enhancer activity depends on multiple motifs.
building whole-genome models of transcriptional networks requires mapping all relevant enhancers and then linking them to target genes.
transcriptional regulation in multi-cellular organisms is a complex process involving multiple modular regulatory elements for each gene.
in this work we present a new approach for discovery of regulatory elements based on the combination of sequence motifs and epigenetic marks measured with chip-seq.
our results indicate that using combination of features provides superior results to previous approaches based on either one of the datasets.
based on our results, we conclude that it is worthwhile to include sequence motif data into computational approaches to active enhancer prediction and also that classifiers trained on a specific set ofenhancers can generalize with significant accuracy beyond the training set.
while histone modifications remain the dominant feature for accurate predictions, the models based on sequence motifs have advantages in their general applicability to different tissues.
previous methods of enhancer identification based either on sequence information or on epigenetic marks have different limitations stemming from incompleteness of each of these datasets taken separately.
