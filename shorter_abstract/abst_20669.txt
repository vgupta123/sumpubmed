there is an overwhelming number of different methods that can be applied, none of which is ideally suited for all experimental designs.
additionally, we compare qrt-pcr measurements of transcripts from different ranges of expression intensities to the respective normalized values of the microarray data.
thus, it is important to identify a normalization method appropriate for the experimental setup under consideration that is neither too negligent nor too stringent.
this study provides a recommendation for deciding which normalization method is best suited for a particular experimental setup.
comparisons of different normalization methods have already been conducted, none of which, to our knowledge, comparing more than a handful of methods.
major aim is to derive optimal results from the underlying experiment.
looking at different statistical measures, we point out the ideal versus the actual observations.
among others, methods provided by the beadstudio software are taken into account.
in the present study,  <dig> different ways of pre-processing illumina sentrix beadchip array data are compared.
