we identified  <dig> genes exhibiting differential expression in mammary tumors developed in transgenic mice expressing constitutively active stat <dig>  vs. its c-terminally truncated variant .
the different gene-expression profiles in mammary tumors caused by the stat5Δ <dig> and stat5ca variants, corroborated by the absence of a direct link to transgenic stat <dig> expression, imply distinct metabolic consequences for their oncogenic role which probably initiate early in tumor development.
a set of  <dig> genes linked stat5Δ <dig> expression to the poorly differentiated carcinoma phenotype and stat5ca to the highly differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma.
specifically affected genes exhibited differential expression in an individual tumor set vs. its counterpart and the intact mammary gland:  <dig> genes were specifically affected by stat5ca, and 94% of these were downregulated, the latter involved in suppression of tumor suppressors and proliferation antagonistics.
these genes mediate established stat <dig> effects on cellular processes such as proliferation and cell death, as well as yet-unrelated homeostatic features, e.g.
stat <dig> is a latent transcription factor that regulates essential growth and survival functions in normal cells.
constitutive activity of stat <dig> and the involvement of its c-terminally truncated variant have been implicated in blood cell malignancies and mammary or breast cancer.
stat5Δ <dig> mrna expression was below detection levels in the tumors and the amount of stat5ca transcript was not correlated with the expression of its specifically affected genes.
to distinguish the individual contributions of the stat <dig> variants to mammary tumorigenesis, global gene-expression profiling was performed on transgenic stat5-induced tumors.
this substantial downregulation distinguishes the stat5ca-induced tumorigenic consequences from the relatively equal effect of the stat5Δ <dig> on gene expression, which included significant elevation in the expression of oncogenes and growth mediators.
the list of genes specifically affected by the stat <dig> variants may provide a basis for the development of a marker set for their distinct oncogenic role.
