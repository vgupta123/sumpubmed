for classification using all available image bands, we find the best performance  is obtained from either the multispectral or our "ccd" rgb imagery, with an overall increase in performance of  <dig> % compared to the next best performing image type.
for classification using single image bands, the single best multispectral band  gave a performance increase of  <dig> %, compared to performance of the single best rgb band .
principal components analysis of the multispectral imagery indicates only two significant image bands, which is not surprising given the presence of two stains.
our results indicate that multispectral imagery for routine h&e stained histopathology provides minimal additional spectral information for a pixel-level nuclear classification task than would standard rgb imagery.
it has been hypothesized that the additional spectral bands contain further information useful for classification as compared to the  <dig> standard bands of rgb imagery.
we present an analysis of the utility of multispectral versus standard rgb imagery for routine h&e stained histopathology images, in particular for pixel-level classification of nuclei.
we present analyses of our data designed to test this hypothesis.
our multispectral imagery has  <dig> spectral bands, spaced  <dig> nm within the visual range of 420â€“ <dig> nm.
