to test this ability in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, we infected porcine alveolar macrophages with wild-type salmonella typhimurium and its isogenic mutants devoid of two major pathogenicity islands, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  the induction of genes linked with m <dig> or m <dig> polarization was determined by quantification of gene expression by rt-qpcr.
on the other hand, wild-type salmonella typhimurium induced a low m <dig> response but a high, dose-dependent m <dig> response in infected macrophages.
the response to Î”spi- <dig> mutant infection was virtually the same as the wild-type strain.
