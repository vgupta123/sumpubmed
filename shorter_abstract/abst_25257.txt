micrornas  play an important role in different biological activities and have been shown to regulate the innate immunity in the bacterial infection.
the gga-mir-125b-5p, gga-mir-34a-5p, gga-mir-1416-5p and gga-mir- <dig> could play an important role in se infection through regulating their target genes.
the finding herein will pave the foundation for the studies of microrna regulation in se infection in laying hens.
more immune-related go bp terms than metabolism-related terms were found in g <dig>  expression of  <dig> immune-related genes of four differentially expressed mirnas was detected through qrt-pcr.
the regulatory direction of gga-mir-1416-5p, gga-mir- <dig>  and gga-mir-34a-5p were opposite with the target genes of tlr <dig>  bcl <dig>  tlr1la, notch <dig> and thbs <dig>  respectively.
average number of reads of three libraries constructed from infected and non-infected chickens was  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  respectively.
salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis  is a food-borne pathogen and of great threat to human health through consuming the contaminated poultry products.
in total,  <dig> unique target genes regulated by differentially expressed mirnas were predicted, in which,  <dig> genes were uniquely regulated by up-regulated mirnas ,  <dig> genes were uniquely regulated by down-regulated mirnas , and  <dig> were co-regulated by both up and down- regulated mirnas .
the objective of this study is to identify mirnas associated with se infection in laying chicken cecum.
the mirnas contribute to the response to se infection at the onset of egg laying through regulating the homeostasis between metabolism and immunity.
there were  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> potential novel mirnas identified in which  <dig> mirnas were significantly differentially expressed between infected and non-infected chickens.
