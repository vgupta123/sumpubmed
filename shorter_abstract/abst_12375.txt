the c-cbl-associated protein , also known as ponsin, localizes to focal adhesions and stress fibers and is involved in signaling events.
one major phosphorylation site, tyr <dig>  and two minor contributors tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> were identified as abl phosphorylation sites, whereas src preferentially phosphorylates tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  phosphorylation of cap was not necessary for its localization to focal adhesions and stress fibers, but tyr326phe substitution alters the function of cap during cell spreading.
our findings suggest that coordinated action of src and abl might regulate the function of cap and reveal a functional role especially for the src-mediated tyr phosphorylation of cap in cell spreading.
according to previous findings, cap binds to tyrosine kinase c-abl.
