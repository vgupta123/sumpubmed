in order to elucidate the evolutionary pathway of kdo2-lipid a biosynthesis, we examined the distribution of genes encoding the nine enzymes across bacteria.
it anchors the lps into the outer membrane of most gram-negative bacteria.
we found that not all gram-negative bacteria have all nine enzymes.
some gram-negative bacteria have no genes encoding these enzymes and others have genes only for the first four enzymes .
the nine-enzyme pathway, which was established based on the studies mainly in escherichia coli k <dig>  appears to be the most derived and optimized form.
lipid a is the highly immunoreactive endotoxic center of lipopolysaccharide .
the kdo2-lipid a biosynthetic pathway exemplifies extremely plastic evolution of bacterial genomes, especially those of proteobacteria, and how these mainly pathogenic bacteria have adapted to their environment.
two of such events happened within the proteobacteria lineage, followed by functional specialization of the duplicated genes and pathway optimization in these bacteria.
it is found only in e. coli and related proteobacteria.
