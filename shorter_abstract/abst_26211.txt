using oryza glaberrima as the outgroup, 80 % of the cnv events turned out to be insertions in nipponbare.
there were  <dig>  annotated genes affected by these cnv events.
we experimentally validated  <dig> functional cnv genes including osmads <dig>  bph <dig>  osdcl2b and osmads <dig>  implying that cnvs might have contributed to phenotypic variations in rice.
most cnv genes were found to be located in non-co-linear positions by comparison to o. glaberrima.
one of the origins of these non-co-linear genes was genomic duplications caused by transposon activity or double-strand break repair.
this study showed the impact and origin of copy number variations in rice on a genomic scale.

comprehensive analysis of mutation mechanisms suggested an abundance of cnvs formed by non-homologous end-joining and mobile element insertion.
here, by an ngs-based approach, we generated a cnv map comprising  <dig>  deletions compared to the reference genome ‘nipponbare’.
