comparison of the genomes of the two isolates revealed that the highly conserved 5′ utr of a putative dna-directed rna polymerase seems to be associated with insertion and rearrangement events.
phytoplasma australiense’ isolate paa, the variation between housekeeping genes was generally less than 1% at a nucleotide level.
the difference in size between the two isolates was largely due to the number and size of potential mobile units , which contributed to some changes in gene order.
comparison with other phytoplasma genomes showed that modification methylases were, in general, species-specific.
a putative methylase  found in ‘ca.
phytoplasma australiense’ appeared to have no analogue in any other firmicute, and we believe has been introduced by way of lateral gene transfer.
two types of pmus have been identified on the basis of the order of three to four conserved genes, with both pmus appearing to have been present in the last common ancestor of ‘ca.
‘candidatus phytoplasma australiense’ is associated with at least nine diseases in australia and new zealand.
