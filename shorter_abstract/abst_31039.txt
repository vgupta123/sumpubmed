it is common for the results of a microarray study to be analyzed in the context of biologically-motivated groups of genes such as pathways or gene ontology categories.
the graphical user interface includes tools for creating and modifying gene sets, visualizing the gene ontology as a table or tree, and visualizing gene expression data.
erminej implements multiple algorithms for gene set analysis, including over-representation and resampling-based methods that focus on gene scores or correlation of gene expression profiles.
in addition to a graphical user interface, erminej has a command line interface and an application programming interface that can be used to automate analyses.
the most common method for such analysis uses the hypergeometric distribution  to look for "over-representation" of groups among genes selected as being differentially expressed or otherwise of interest based on a gene-by-gene analysis.
