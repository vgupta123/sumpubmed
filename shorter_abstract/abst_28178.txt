establishment of haematological and biochemical reference intervals is important to assess health of animals on individual and population level.
age differences were seen for the majority of the haematological variables, whereas sex influenced only mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, aspartate aminotransferase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase, Î²-globulin, bile acids, triglycerides and sodium.
for each of the variables, the reference interval was described based on the 95% confidence interval, and differences due to host characteristics sex and age were included if detected.
the following variables were not affected by host characteristics: red blood cell, white blood cell, monocyte and platelet count, alanine transaminase, amylase, bilirubin, free fatty acids, glucose, calcium, chloride, potassium, and cortisol.
reference intervals for  <dig> haematological and  <dig> biochemical variables were established based on  <dig> apparently healthy free-ranging brown bears  in sweden.
to our knowledge, this is the first report of reference intervals for free-ranging brown bears in sweden.
the biochemical and haematological reference intervals provided and the differences due to host factors age and gender can be useful for evaluation of health status in free-ranging european brown bears.
venous blood samples were collected during anaesthesia for radio collaring and marking for ecological studies.
