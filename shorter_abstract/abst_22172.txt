phylogenetic tools and ‘tree-thinking’ approaches increasingly permeate all biological research.
osiris enables all aspects of phylogenetic analysis within galaxy, including de novo assembly of high throughput sequencing reads, ortholog identification, multiple sequence alignment, concatenation, phylogenetic tree estimation, and post-tree comparative analysis.
we developed a suite of wrappers for new and existing phylogenetics tools for the galaxy workflow management system that we call osiris.
therefore, there is an urgent need for accessible, modular, and sharable tools for phylogenetic analysis.
at the same time, phylogenetic data sets are expanding at breakneck pace, facilitated by increasingly economical sequencing technologies.
osiris can serve as a foundation for other phylogenomic and phylogenetic tool development within the galaxy platform.
