the 50-residue segments were partitioned persistently and universally into some dozens  of major sub-networks, irrespective of the number of clusters.
additionally, the network was characterized by non-power-law statistics, which is also a novel finding.
main findings are:  the universe of  <dig> residue segments found here was characterized by non-power-law statistics.
several studies have demonstrated that protein fold space is structured hierarchically and that power-law statistics are satisfied in relation between the numbers of protein families and protein folds .
we examined the internal structure and statistics in the fold space of  <dig> amino-acid residue segments taken from various protein folds.
using this similarity measure, the segments were classified into a number  of clusters.
the network was partitioned persistently into four regions for kc â‰¥  <dig>  this main partitioning is consistent with results of earlier studies, where similar partitioning was reported in classifying protein domain structures.
therefore, the universe differs from those ever reported for the protein domains.
we used inter-residue contact patterns to measure the tertiary structural similarity among segments.
