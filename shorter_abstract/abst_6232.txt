thus, microarray data could provide insight into the regulation of this complex gene.
correlated genes discovered in this study regulate nervous system development, and are associated with various types of cancer and neurological disorders.
the key steps of the analysis included: dividing datasets into subsets with biologically meaningful sample content ; analyzing co-expression with the bdnf gene in each subset separately; and confirming co- expression links across subsets.
the study demonstrates the potential of the "subset" approach in co-expression conservation analysis for studying the regulation of single genes and proposes novel regulators of bdnf gene expression.
alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor  gene expression contribute to serious pathologies such as depression, epilepsy, cancer, alzheimer's, huntington and parkinson's disease.
in our study, we performed meta-coexpression analysis of publicly available microarray data using bdnf as a "guide-gene" introducing a "subset" approach.
studying bdnf expression remains difficult due to its multiple neural activity-dependent and tissue-specific promoters.
however, co-expression patterns can be different under various conditions that are represented by subsets in a dataset.
also, several transcription factor identified here have been reported to regulate bdnf expression in vitro and in vivo.
therefore, exploring the mechanisms of bdnf regulation represents a great clinical importance.
conventional microarray co-expression analysis is usually carried out by merging the datasets or by confirming the re-occurrence of significant correlations across datasets.
therefore, assessing co-expression by measuring correlation coefficient across merged samples of a dataset or by merging datasets might not capture all correlation patterns.
