gras transcription factors are plant-specific proteins that play diverse roles in plant development.
however, the functions of a number of gras genes identified in rice are unknown, especially the gras genes related to rice drought resistance have not been characterized.
osgras23-overexpressing rice plants showed improved drought resistance and oxidative stress tolerance as well as less h2o <dig> accumulation compared with the wild-type plants.

a trans-activation assay in yeast cells demonstrated that the osgras <dig> protein possessed a strong transcriptional activation activity.
the osgras23-gfp fused protein was localized in the nucleus of tobacco epidermal cells.
our results demonstrate that osgras <dig> encodes a stress-responsive gras transcription factor and positively modulates rice drought tolerance via the induction of a number of stress-responsive genes.
furthermore, microarray analysis showed that several anti-oxidation related genes were up-regulated in the osgras23-overexpressing rice plants.
drought is a major abiotic stress factors that reduces agricultural productivity.
