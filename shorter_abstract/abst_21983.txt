s. enterica serovar kentucky was shown to actively invade a eukaryotic monolayer, though at a rate that was significantly lower than typhimurium.
strains mutated for t3ss formation were able to initiate invasion of the eukaryotic monolayer to varying degrees based on strain, in the case of kentucky, the mutated strain initiated invasion at a level that was not significantly different from the wild-type strain.
in this study, field-isolated salmonella enterica serovar kentucky and a known human pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were mutated and evaluated for the invasion of human colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelial cells.
additionally, strains mutated for t3ss formation were less invasive than the wild-type strains, but the decrease in invasion was not significant in kentucky.
a different result was observed for typhimurium as the mutation significantly lowered the rate of invasion in comparison to the wild-type strain.
critical to the development of salmonellosis in humans is the interaction of the bacterium with the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract.
