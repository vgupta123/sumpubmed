we propose using the binormal auc  as the objective function for two-sample classification, and the scaled threshold gradient directed regularization method for regularized estimation and biomarker selection.
the roc  technique has been widely used in disease classification with low dimensional biomarkers.
we develop monte carlo based methods for evaluating the stability of individual biomarkers and overall prediction performance.
application of the method to two cancer studies shows that the identified genes are reasonably stable with satisfactory prediction performance and biologically sound implications.
extensive simulation studies show that the proposed approach can generate parsimonious models with excellent classification and prediction performance, under most simulated scenarios including model mis-specification.
tuning parameter selection is based on v-fold cross validation.
it is also of interest to develop methods for evaluation of classification performance and ranking of identified biomarkers.
the overall classification performance is satisfactory, with small classification errors and large aucs.
compared with the empirical roc approach, the binormal roc is computationally more affordable and robust in small sample size cases.
