the mostly used n <dig> measure summarizes the assembly results by the length of the scaffold  overlapping the midpoint of the length-order concatenation of scaffolds .
we propose and implement a comprehensive and efficient approach to compute a metric that summarizes scaffold assembly correctness and length.
especially for scaffold assemblies it is non-trivial to combine a correctness measure to the n <dig> values, and the current methods for doing this are rather involved.
we propose a simple but rigorous normalized n <dig> assembly metric that combines n <dig> with such a correctness measure; assembly is split into as many parts as necessary to align each part to the reference.
as a side result of independent interest, we show how to modify co-linear chaining to restrict gaps to produce a more sensible global alignment.
