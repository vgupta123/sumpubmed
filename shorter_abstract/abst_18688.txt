we examined the morphological and genetic variability of congeneric fruit bats cynopterus sphinx and c. brachyotis using  <dig> samples from two natural contact zones and  <dig> allopatric locations in the indian subcontinent; and investigated the population differentiation patterns, evolutionary history, and the possibility of cryptic diversity in this species pair.
analysis of microsatellites, cytochrome b gene sequences, and restriction digestion based genome-wide data revealed that c. sphinx and c. brachyotis do not hybridize in contact zones.
however, cytochrome b gene sequences and genome-wide snp data helped uncover a cryptic, hitherto unrecognized cynopterine lineage in northeastern india coexisting with c. sphinx.
further analyses of shared variation of snps using pattersonâ€™s d statistics suggest introgression between this lineage and c. sphinx.
multivariate analyses of morphology using genetically classified grouping confirmed substantial morphological overlap between c. sphinx and c. brachyotis, specifically in the high elevation contact zones in southern india.
our results uncover novel diversity and detect a pattern of genetic introgression in a cryptic radiation of bats, demonstrating the complicated nature of lineage diversification in this poorly understood taxonomic group.
our results highlight the importance of genome-wide data to study evolutionary processes of morphologically similar species pairs.
