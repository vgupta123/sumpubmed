therefore, the present study aimed to determine the expression stability of common reference genes  under the influence of glucosamine, curcumin and diacerein in the il-1Î²-stimulated c-28/i <dig> chondrocyte model, using the genorm software tool.
according to their expression stability, genorm analysis revealed rankings of the  <dig> most stable genes  as follows: gapdh, b2m and sdha in glucosamine treated samples and hprt <dig>  gapdh and b2m in curcumin or diacerein treated samples.
for the investigation of chondroprotective action on chondrocyte gene expression, quantitative real-time rt-pcr is the method of choice.
cpa treatment of c-28/i <dig> chondrocytes significantly affected the expression level of many reference genes .
for normalization purposes in gene profiling studies on glucosamine action, the genes gapdh, b2m and sdha are recommended as single reference genes depending on the expression level of the target gene or more favourably in combination.
our study points out the problem of relying on commonly used reference genes without an accurate validation process.
chondroprotective agents  such as glucosamine, curcumin and diacerein represent potential remedies for the management of osteoarthritis and several studies have been performed on their effects in-vitro and in-vivo.
