by mapping the differentially expressed genes in the human interactome map using cytoscape software, we identified a single scale-free network consisting of  <dig> interacting proteins and containing  <dig> differentially expressed proteins.
these long-term effects of tgfβ <dig> in hutec involve genes that are highly interconnected, thereby generating a scale-free network that we named the "tgfβ <dig> interactome", whose hubs represent proteins that may have a crucial role for hutec in response to tgfβ <dig>
the gene ontology analysis showed an excess of up-regulated proteins involved in biological processes, such as "morphogenesis", "cell fate determination" and "regulation of development", and the most up-regulated genes belonged to these categories.
understanding how mesenchymal cells arise from epithelial cells could have a strong impact in unveiling mechanisms of epithelial cell plasticity underlying kidney regeneration and repair.
in primary human tubular epithelial cells  under different tgfβ <dig> concentrations we had observed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  but not epithelial-myofibroblast transdifferentiation.
in our model, smad signaling was not the tgfβ <dig> action effector; instead, the engagement of ras/mapk signaling pathway seems mainly to regulate genes involved in the cell cycle and proliferation/apoptosis.
in fact: 1) the principal biological categories involved in the process concern morphogenesis and development; 2) the most up-regulated genes belong to these categories; and, finally, 3) some intracellular pathways are involved, whose engagement during kidney development and nephrogenesis is well known.
the purpose of this study is to comprehensively delineate genetic programs associated with tgfβ1-driven emt in our in vitro model using gene expression profile on large-scale oligonucleotide microarrays.
in addition,  <dig> genes were mapped to the kegg pathways and  <dig> pathways with more than nine differentially expressed genes were identified.
we hypothesized that the process triggered by tgfβ <dig> could be a dedifferentiation event.
our present findings support the hypothesis that context-dependent emt generated in our model by tgfβ <dig> might be the outcome of a dedifferentiation.
