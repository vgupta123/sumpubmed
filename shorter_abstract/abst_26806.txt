a bioinformatics search identified  <dig> thyroid response elements in the promoter regions of  <dig> different genes thought to be directly regulated by thyroid hormones.
transcriptional profiling of thyroid hormone disrupted animals coupled with a novel bioinformatics search revealed new thyroid response elements associated with genes previously unknown to be responsive to thyroid hormone.
thyroid hormones exert their effects through interactions with thyroid receptors that directly bind thyroid response elements and can alter transcriptional activity of target genes.
a subgroup of thyroid hormone-disrupted pups received intraperitoneal injections of replacement thyroid hormones four hours prior to sacrifice .
thyroid response elements found in the promoter regions of tor1a, 2310003h01rik, hect3d and slc25a <dig> were further validated by confirming that the thyroid receptor is associated with these sequences in vivo and that it can bind directly to these sequences in vitro.
the effects of short-term thyroid hormone perturbation on hepatic mrna transcription in juvenile mice were evaluated, with the goal of identifying genes containing active thyroid response elements.
the regulatory regions of the genome adjacent to these genes were examined for half-site sequences that resemble known thyroid response elements.
three different arrangements of thyroid response elements were identified.
some of these thyroid response elements were located far up-stream  of the transcription start site of the regulated gene.
an additional group received only thyroid hormones four hours prior to sacrifice .
