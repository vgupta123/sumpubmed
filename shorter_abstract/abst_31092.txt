the signal peptide of eosinophil cationic protein  plays an important role in translocating ecp to the extracellular space.
in the present study, we first generated a dna microarray dataset, which showed that ecpsp upregulated proinflammatory molecules, including chemokines, interferon-induced molecules, and toll-like receptors.
we then constructed a functional linkage network by integrating the microarray dataset with the pathway database of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes .
furthermore, integrating tgf-α and egfr with the functional linkage network indicated that stat <dig> and stat <dig> served as hubs that connect two functional clusters, including  cell proliferation and survival, and  inflammation.

follow-up analysis revealed that stat <dig> and stat <dig>  important transcriptional factors that regulate cytokine expression and release, served as hubs to connect the pathways of cytokine stimulation  and inflammatory responses.
our approach, involving experimental and computational systems biology, predicts pathways and potential biological functions for further characterization of this novel function of ecpsp under inflammatory conditions.
we previously reported that ecpsp inhibits microbial growth and regulates the expression of mammalian genes encoding tumor growth factor-α  and epidermal growth factor receptor .
