through a proteogenomics effort, we have used ms/ms data to anchor the annotation of previously undescribed genes and to re-annotate previous gene models in order to improve the current genome annotation.
here we introduce the honey bee peptideatlas, a web-based resource for visualizing mass spectrometry data across experiments, providing protein descriptions and gene ontology annotations where possible.
the honey bee peptideatlas will contribute to the efficiency of bee proteomics and accelerate our understanding of this species.
this publicly accessible and interactive database is an important framework for the current and future analysis of mass spectrometry data.
honey bees are a mainstay of agriculture, contributing billions of dollars through their pollination activities.
