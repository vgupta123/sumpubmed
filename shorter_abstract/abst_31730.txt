great:scan is a collection of related and interconnected applications currently able to perform systematic analyses of genome regularities as well as to improve transcription factor binding sites  and gene regulatory network predictions based on gene positional information.
firstly, the analysis of contiguous genome segments across species, has highlighted the conservation of gene arrangement  along chromosomal regions.
genome layout and gene regulation appear to be interdependent.
evidence for non-random genome layout, defined as the relative positioning of either co-functional or co-regulated genes, stems from two main approaches.
here we present the genome regulatory and architecture tools scan  software for the systematic study of the interplay between genome layout and gene expression regulation.
we demonstrate the capabilities of these tools by studying on one hand the regular patterns of genome layout in the major regulons of the bacterium escherichia coli.
on the other hand, we demonstrate the capabilities to improve tfbs prediction in microbes.

finally, we highlight, by visualisation of multivariate techniques, the interplay between position and sequence information for effective transcription regulation.
