therefore, rapid detection of β-lactam-mediated morphological changes may have important clinical implications.
a total of  <dig> β-lactam antibiotics or β-lactam–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations were analyzed for their ability to induce filamentation.
antibiotics of the β-lactam group are able to alter the shape of the bacterial cell wall, e.g.
three e. coli strains displaying different resistant profiles and differences in filamentation kinetics were used to study a novel image analysis algorithm to quantify length of bacteria and bacterial filamentation.
the objective was to examine an automated image analysis algorithm for quantification of filamentous bacteria using the 3d digital microscopy imaging system, ocelloscope.
the automated image analysis algorithm showed a clear ability to rapidly detect and quantify β-lactam-induced filamentation in e. coli.
filamentation peaked at approximately 120 min with an average cell length of 30 μm.
early determination of antimicrobial susceptibility may be complicated by filamentation of bacteria as this can be falsely interpreted as growth in systems relying on colorimetry or turbidometry .
