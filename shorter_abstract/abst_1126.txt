proteins, individual cells, and cell populations denote different levels of an organizational hierarchy, each of which with its own dynamics.
multi-level modeling is concerned with describing a system at these different levels and relating their dynamics.
multi-level modeling implies the hierarchical nesting of model entities and explicit support for downward and upward causation between different levels.
as a result, the presented approach facilitates developing and maintaining multi-level models that, for instance, interrelate intracellular and intercellular dynamics.
an example model is presented that analyses the interplay of an intracellular control circuit with states at cell level, its relation to cell division, and connections to intercellular communication within a population of cells.
rule-based modeling has increasingly attracted attention due to enabling a concise and compact description of biochemical systems.
to those belong rule schemata, hierarchical nesting of species, assigning attributes and solutions to species at each level and preserving content of nested species while applying rules.
rule schemata allow a concise and compact description of complex models.
concepts to support multi-level modeling in a rule-based language are identified.
the example is described in ml-rules - a rule-based multi-level approach that has been realized within the plug-in-based modeling and simulation framework james ii.
rule-based languages are a suitable starting point for developing a concise and compact language for multi-level modeling of cell biological systems.
in addition, it allows different methods for model analysis, since more than one semantics can be defined for the same syntax.
