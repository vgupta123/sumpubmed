the identity of the purified protein was verified using in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry as well as immunological techniques.
with this stationary phase, suitable operation conditions for two-step gradient elution using ammonium sulphate were determined experimentally.
in this contribution, a method for purifying soybean  protein p <dig>  using hydrophobic interaction chromatography is presented.
soybeans play a prominent role in allergologic research due to the high incidence of allergic reactions.
conditions could be simplified further using a onestep gradient, which gave comparable purification in a shorter process time.
