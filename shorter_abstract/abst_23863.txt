here we show that many long ncrnas exhibit dynamic expression patterns during neuronal and oligodendrocyte  lineage specification, neuronal-glial fate transitions, and progressive stages of ol lineage elaboration including myelination.
we also observed changes in ncrna expression profiles in response to treatment with trichostatin a, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that prevents the progression of ol progenitors into post-mitotic ols by altering lineage-specific gene expression programs.
this is the first report of long ncrna expression in neuronal and glial cell differentiation and of the modulation of ncrna expression by modification of chromatin architecture.
long non-protein-coding rnas  are emerging as important regulators of cellular differentiation and are widely expressed in the brain.
