polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers  method produces allele-specific dna bands of different lengths by adding four designed primers and it achieves the single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping by electrophoresis without further steps.
however, computation of feasible ctpp primers is still challenging.
in this study, we propose a ga -based method to design a feasible ctpp primer set to perform a reliable pcr experiment.
the slc6a <dig> gene was tested with  <dig> snps for dry dock experiments which indicated that the proposed algorithm provides ctpp primers satisfied most primer constraints.
the ga-based ctpp primer design method provides all forms of estimation for the common primer constraints of pcr-ctpp.
