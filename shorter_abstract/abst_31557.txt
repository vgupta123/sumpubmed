combining these established statistical methods that are available in most statistical packages, we observed that the diagnostic accuracy of our approach was 100%,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the real datasets used in the study.
the proposed algorithm can be used for accurate diagnosis in the setting of dichotomous classification of disease states.
we validated the proposed algorithm using several simulation datasets in addition to four publicly available real datasets that compared i) subjects having cancer with those without; ii) subjects with two different cancers; iii) subjects with two different types of one cancer; and iv) subjects with same cancer resulting in differential time to metastasis.
here, we suggest a statistical algorithm that – assuming each molecular biomarker to be a diagnostic test – enriches the diagnostic performance of an optimized set of independent biomarkers employing established statistical techniques.
in a synthetic dataset, we also observed that all the biomarkers chosen by our algorithm were indeed truly differentially expressed.
