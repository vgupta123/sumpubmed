the gene expression profile suggests higher metabolic and transport activities, enhanced cell proliferation, elevated oxidative stress, and altered vascular biology in males.
to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms for this difference, we analyzed gender-dependent gene expression in kidneys of three groups of  <dig> day-old rats.
the number of genes exhibiting gender-dependent expression was highly influenced by the genetic background of the rat group examined.
post-puberty deterioration of kidneys is more rapid in males than in females.
our data suggest that early puberty, with gender-related elevation in oxidative stress in males, is a key compromising factor on kidneys in males.
<dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes showed differential gene expression between males and females  in us, mhm and mhm*bn rats, respectively.
furthermore, elevated levels of superoxide anion  in males compared to females were detected at early puberty, but neither at pre-puberty nor at late puberty/early adulthood.
