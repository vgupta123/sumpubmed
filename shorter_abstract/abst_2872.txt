robenacoxib appears to reduce articular inflammation as assessed by c-reactive protein which supports the concept that robenacoxib is a tissue-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
there was no correlation between c-reactive protein concentrations in serum and matched synovial fluid samples.
there was a significant reduction in the lameness score  and an increase in the radiographic score  between pre- and post-treatment assessments.
thirty four dogs with stifle osteoarthritis secondary to failure of the cranial cruciate ligament were recruited into this study.
robenacoxib proved effective in reducing lameness in dogs with failure of the cranial cruciate ligament and osteoarthritis of the stifle joint.
there was no difference between pre-  and post –  treatment serum c-reactive protein levels although synovial fluid levels were significantly reduced  .
lameness, radiographic features, synovial cytology and c-reactive protein concentrations in serum and synovial fluid were assessed before and 28 days after commencing a course of robenacoxib at a dose of 1 mg/kg sid.
the drug also reduced levels of c-reactive protein in the synovial fluid taken from the affected stifle joint.
robenacoxib is a novel and highly selective inhibitor of cox- <dig> in dogs and cats and because of its acidic nature is regarded as being tissue-selective.
