insoluble β- <dig> -glucan binding and hydrolysis were boosted by the presence of n-and c-terminal domains.
carbohydrate-binding assay directly confirmed the binding capabilities of the n-and c-terminal domains.
both the n-and c-terminal domains exerted strong binding activity toward insoluble β- <dig> -glucan, and could be classified into cbm families.
activity comparison of full-length pgla and truncated forms revealed the negative effect of c-terminal region on thermal stability of the enzyme.
s <dig>  the gene pgla contained a 2631-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids which shows 76% identity with the β- <dig> -glucanase  from bacillus circulans iam <dig>  the encoded protein pgla is composed of a signal peptide, an n-terminal leader region, a glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  catalytic domain and a c-terminal immunoglobulin like  domain.
kinetic analysis showed that the presence of n-and c-terminus enhances the substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency of the catalytic domain toward laminarin.
the escherichia coli expression system of pgla and five truncated derivatives containing one or two modules was constructed to investigate the role of catalytic and non-catalytic modules.
however, the temperature for optimal activity was strongly influenced by the c-terminal domain and ranged from  <dig> to 60°c.
deletion of c-terminal domain resulted in obviously enhancing enzymatic thermostability.
this study provides new insight into the impacts of non-catalytic modules on enzymatic properties of β- <dig> -glucanase.
a β- <dig> -glucanase gene designated pgla was cloned from a newly isolated strain paenibacillus sp.
thus, the identification and characterization of novel β- <dig> -glucanases with high catalytic efficiency and stability is of particular interest.
