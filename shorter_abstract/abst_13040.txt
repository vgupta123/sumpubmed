in the present study, word-stress was manipulated with statistical information and placed in different syllables within trisyllabic nonsense words to explore the result of the combination of the cues in an online word segmentation task.
the results demonstrated that listeners can integrate specific prosodic and distributional cues when segmenting speech.
the behavioral results showed that words were segmented better when stress was placed on the final syllables than when it was placed on the middle or first syllable.
the electrophysiological results showed an increase in the amplitude of the p <dig> component, which seemed to be sensitive to word-stress and its location within words.
