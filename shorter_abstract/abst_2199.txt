grb <dig> is frequently overexpressed in invasive and metastatic human cancers and is implicated in cancer progression via its interaction with the erbb <dig> receptor and focal adhesion kinase  that play critical roles in cell proliferation and migration.
as a first step towards understanding how grb <dig> may be inhibited by g7-18nate, we solved the crystal structure of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain to  <dig>  Å resolution.
we propose that the current study will assist with the development of second generation grb <dig> sh <dig> domain inhibitors, potentially leading to novel inhibitors of cancer cell migration and invasion.
itc measurements of the interaction of the g7-18nate peptide with the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain revealed that it binds with a binding affinity of kd = ~ <dig>  μm and nmr spectroscopy titration experiments revealed that peptide binding causes perturbations to both the ligand binding surface of the grb <dig> sh <dig> domain as well as to the dimer interface, suggesting that dimerisation of grb <dig> is impacted on by peptide binding.
human growth factor receptor bound protein  <dig>  is an adapter protein that mediates the coupling of tyrosine kinases with their downstream signaling pathways.
we describe the details of the peptide binding site underlying target specificity, as well as the dimer interface of grb  <dig> sh <dig>  dimer formation of grb <dig> was determined to be in the μm range using analytical ultracentrifugation for both full-length grb <dig> and the sh <dig> domain alone, suggesting the sh <dig> domain forms the basis of a physiological dimer.
