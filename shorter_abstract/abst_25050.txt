we found that loj mutants have expression profiles consistent with activation of stress responses.
because of the molecular and genetic tools available for drosophila, the fly will be a useful system for investigating the tissue-specific functions of p <dig> proteins and for determining the how disrupting these molecules causes stress responses in vivo.
of particular note is our observation that approximately 20% of the loci up regulated in loj mutants are drosophila immune-regulated genes , many of which are transcriptional targets of nf-κb or jnk signaling pathways.
nearly 20% of the genes with increased message levels in the loj mutant are transcriptional targets of drosophila nf-κb proteins.
genes involved in ameliorating stress, such as those encoding products involved in proteolysis, metabolism and protein folding, are differentially expressed in loj mutants compared to controls.
yeast p <dig> mutants have minor secretory defects and induce an er stress response that likely results from accumulation of proteins in the er due to disrupted trafficking.
activation of nf-κb transcription factors is the hallmark of an er stress response called the er overload response.
therefore, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that drosophila p <dig> mutations induce stress, possibly via activation of er stress response pathways.
the loj mutant expression profiling data support the hypothesis that loss of p <dig> function causes a stress response.
we performed genome-wide profiling experiments on tissues from drosophila females with a mutation in the p <dig> gene logjam  and identified changes in message levels for  <dig> genes.
members of the p <dig> protein family, which are transmembrane constituents of er and golgi-derived transport vesicles, function in trafficking some secretory proteins in yeast and higher eukaryotes.
