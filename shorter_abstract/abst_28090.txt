finally, using a deterministic model we showed that the wave of advance of a favourable allele at a linked locus, when crossing a strong enough barrier to gene flow, generates a step in neutral allele frequencies comparable to the step observed between the two m. edulis populations at the outlier locus.
few models of genetic hitchhiking in subdivided populations have been developed and the rarity of empirical examples is even more striking.
we validated the outlier status of this locus, and analysed dna sequence polymorphism in order to identify the nature of the selection responsible for the unusual differentiation.
in the bay of biscay , a patch of m. edulis populations happens to be separated from its north sea conspecifics by a wide region occupied only by the sister species m. galloprovincialis.
secondly, we observed the genetic signature of a selective sweep within both m. edulis populations in the form of a star-shaped clade of alleles.
this clade was nearly fixed in the north sea and was segregating at a moderate frequency in the bay of biscay, explaining their genetic differentiation.
combining models and data we show that among-population differentiation can also dramatically increase following a selective sweep in a structured population.
