our data suggest that grlj acts at several stages of dictyostelium development and that it is a negative regulator in dictyostelium development.
inactivation of the grlj gene leads to precocious development, and the mutant completes development ~ <dig> hours earlier.
gfp-tagged grlj localises to the plasmamembrane and to internal membranes.
d. discoideum has seventeen family  <dig> members of gpcrs, denoted grla through grlr.
alterations were also noted at the slug stage and in spore formation.
their transcripts are detected throughout development with increased levels during early and late development.
the completed genome sequence revealed the presence of several families of gpcrs in dictyostelium, among them members of the family  <dig> of gpcrs, the gabab/glutamate like receptor family, which in higher eukaryotes is involved in neuronal signaling.
until recently, the cyclic amp receptors  were the only known g protein coupled receptors in dictyostelium discoideum.
