these fragments are interspersed with dna repeats, pseudogenes and genes coding for products involved in dna replication, integration and transposition.
in order to find the integration sites of the viral genome, a genomic library from esv-1-infected algae was screened using labelled esv- <dig> dna.
a protein similar to a new class of tyrosine recombinases might be a key enzyme of this system.
some of these gene products are not encoded by esv- <dig> but are present in the genome of other members of the ncldv family.
our results support the hypothesis that some dsdna viruses are monophyletic and evolved principally through genome reduction.
moreover, we hypothesize that phaeoviruses have probably developed an original replication system.
previous studies indicated that the viral genome is integrated into the host dna.
further analysis suggests that the ectocarpus algal genome contains traces of the integration of a large dsdna viral genome; this genome could be the ancestor of the extant ncldv genomes.
analysis revealed that the algal genome is split by a copy of viral sequences that have a high identity to esv- <dig> dna sequences.
