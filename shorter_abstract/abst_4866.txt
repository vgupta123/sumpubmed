features like drop-to-file, svm based automated retrieval of pubmed bibliography for pdf reprints, and annotation support make bibglimpse an efficient, light-weight reprint manager that facilitates distributed literature research for work groups.
building on an established open search engine, full-text search and structured queries are supported, while at the same time making shared collections of annotated reprints accessible to literature classification and text-mining tools.
for instance, distributed annotation would be very well suited for providing topic focussed, expert knowledge enriched text corpora.
moreover, it may be used to create content enriched, annotated text corpora for research in text-mining.
