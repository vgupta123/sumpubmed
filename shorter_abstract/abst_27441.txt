nitric oxide  and reactive oxygen species  production by mØ infected with wild-type or ∆kstd strains was detected using griess reagent and chemiluminescence methods, respectively.
the mtb mutant ∆kstd strain, which is unable to use cholesterol as a source of carbon and energy, has a limited ability to multiply in resting mØ following infection, reflecting a failure of the ∆kstd strain to inhibit the tlr2-dependent bactericidal activity of resting mØ.
strains defective in cholesterol transport or degradation exhibit attenuated growth in activated macrophages and diminished infectivity in animal models.
a mutant mtb h37rv strain containing an inactivated kstd gene , which encodes 3-ketosteroid 1-dehydrogenase , was previously prepared using the homologous recombination-based gene-replacement technique.
a control strain carrying the kstd gene complemented with an intact kstd was also previously constructed.
moreover, the mutant was unable to inhibit the no and ros production induced through toll-like receptor  <dig>  signaling in infected resting mØ.
the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- <dig> by mØ after infection with wild-type or mutant mtb was examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
the aim of this study was to evaluate intracellular replication of a cholesterol degradation-deficient mtb mutant in human macrophages  in vitro and assess the functional responses of mtb mutant-infected mØ.
in contrast, mutant and wild-type mtb behaved similarly in mØ activated with ifn-γ before and during infection.
