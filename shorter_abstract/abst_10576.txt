insertion elements  are known to play an important role in the evolution and genomic diversification of escherichia coli o157:h <dig> lineages.
the highly variable genomic locations of is <dig> in o157:h <dig> strains of the a <dig> clonal complex indicates that this insertion element probably played an important role in genome plasticity and in the divergence of o157:h <dig> lineages.
o157:h <dig> strains carry is <dig> elements sub-type i and iii whereby the ancestral o55:h <dig> carries sub-type ii.
it was recently shown that the lack of o <dig> antigen expression in two o rough e. coli o157:h <dig> strains was due to is <dig> insertions at  <dig> different locations in the gne gene that is essential for the o antigen biosynthesis.
in particular, is <dig> has been found in multiple copies in the e. coli o157:h <dig> genome and is one of the most prevalent is in this serotype.
the comparison of  <dig> e. coli o157:h <dig> genome and plasmid sequences showed numerous is <dig> insertion sites, although not uniformly distributed among strains.
analysis of strains selected from various clonal groups defined on the e. coli o157:h <dig> stepwise evolution model showed that is <dig> was not observed in sorbitol fermenting o <dig>  clones that are on a divergent pathway in the emergence of o157:h <dig>  this suggests that the absence of is <dig> in sfo <dig> strains probably occurred during the divergence of this lineage, albeit it remains uncertain if it contributed, in part, to their divergence from other closely related strains.
