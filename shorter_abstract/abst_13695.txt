when a d. w. quechua female is crossed with a d. w. willistoni male, the hybrid males  are unable to father progeny; however, the reciprocal cross produces fertile hybrids.
comparisons of parental and hybrid males copulation durations showed no significant reduction in copulation duration of f1qw males.
here we explore whether pre-copulatory or post-copulatory pre-zygotic mechanisms serve as major deterrents in the ability of f1qw males to father progeny.
drosophila willistoni quechua and drosophila willistoni willistoni are two subspecies that experience reproductive isolation.
however, the sterile f1qw males contain large amounts of motile sperm.
interrupted copulations of the parental species confirmed that sperm transfer occurs before the minimum copulation duration registered for f1qw males.
however, we found that when females mate with f1qw males, sperm is not present inside the female storage organs and that the lack of sperm in storage is due to failure to transfer sperm rather than spillage or active sperm dumping by females.
sterility of f1qw hybrid males is primarily driven by their inability to transfer sperm during copulation.
