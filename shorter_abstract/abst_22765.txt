furthermore, there are no size-limitations in the systems under study, which are not limited to the transmembrane domains but include also the water-soluble portions.
prediction of the native oligomer is therefore accomplished by a number of progressive growing steps, each made of one docking run, filtering and cluster analysis.
with cα-rmsds lower than  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer, regardless of the resolution of the structural models.
collectively, the results of this study emphasize the effectiveness of the prediction protocol that will be extensively challenged in quaternary structure predictions of other integral membrane proteins.
we introduce a computational protocol for effective predictions of the supramolecular organization of integral transmembrane proteins, starting from the monomer.
our computational approach consists in rigid-body docking samplings, starting from the docking of two identical copies of a given monomer.
despite the demonstrated constitutive and functional importance of supramolecular assemblies of transmembrane subunits or proteins, effective tools for structure predictions of such assemblies are still lacking.
benchmarks of the approach were done on ten homo-oligomeric membrane proteins with known quaternary structure.
each docking run is followed by membrane topology filtering and cluster analysis.
for all these systems, predictions led to native-like quaternary structures, i.e.
