individuals can reduce these costs by delaying their sexual maturation, albeit at the price of the later onset of breeding, to eventually reach the same adult size as individuals that grow up in a benevolent environment.
in mosquitofish , males with limited food intake early in life delay maturation to reach a similar adult body size to their well-fed counterparts .
although delaying maturation to reach the same body size as well fed juveniles can ameliorate some costs of a poor start in life, our findings suggest that costs might still arise because of sexual selection against these males.
we found that a maleâ€™s diet early in life significantly influenced his sperm reserves and sperm replenishment rate.
here we tested whether a poor early diet is costly due to the reduced expression of sexually selected male characters, namely genital size and ejaculate traits.
it should be noted, however, that the observed effects are modest , and the assumption that lower sperm production translates into a decline in fitness under sperm competition remains unconfirmed.
shortly after maturation males with a restricted early diet had significantly lower sperm reserves and slower replenishment rates than control diet males, but this dietary difference was no longer detectable in older males.
