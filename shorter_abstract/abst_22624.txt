recent studies have shown that such networks have an underlying hierarchical organization.
we use our method to analyze the transcriptional regulatory networks of e. coli, h. sapiens and s. cerevisiae.
our experiments demonstrate that:  our method gives statistically better results than three existing state of the art methods;  our method is robust against errors in the data and  our methodâ€™s performance is not affected by the different topologies in the data.
transcription factors regulate numerous cellular processes by controlling the rate of production of each gene.
