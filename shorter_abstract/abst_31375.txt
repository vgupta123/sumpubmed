ovine models of these pathologies are limited by the poor understanding of ovine neutrophil respiratory burst function.
in the absence of priming or activating agonists, ovine neutrophils displayed a low level of respiratory burst function which was not enhanced by either paf, tnf-Î±, lps or fmlp, but was significantly enhanced by pma.
this improved understanding of ovine neutrophils will facilitate the validitation of ovine biomedical models of human pathologies in which neutrophils have been implicated.
respiratory burst function resulting in the release of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion  from neutrophils is one of the key mechanisms of the innate immune system, and maladaptive control of this mechanism is thought to play a pivotal role in the development of pathologies such as acute lung injury and sepsis.
aspects of ovine neutrophil respiratory burst function to be characterised were: i) the maximum rate of o2- generated ; ii) the time taken to reach vmax; iii) the total amount of o2- generated during the reaction; and iv) the duration of the reaction.
this study successfully adapted a commonly used method of measuring human neutrophil respiratory burst function to characterise different aspects of ovine neutrophil respiratory burst function.
