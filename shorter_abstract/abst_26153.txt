here, we implement and explore experimentally existing and new local search heuristics for the gtap using simulated and real data.
the methods presented here improve by more than three orders of magnitude in execution time the best local search heuristics existing to date when applied to real data.
at the core of every biological problem lies a phylogenetic component.
phylogenies attempt to answer an important question posed in biology: what are the ancestor-descendent relationships between organisms?
the problem of simultaneous tree and alignment estimation under maximum parsimony is known in combinatorial optimization as the generalized tree alignment problem .
the gtap is the steiner tree problem for the sequence edit distance.
typically the steiner tree is presented under the manhattan or the hamming distances.
like many biologically interesting problems, the gtap is np-hard.
a phylogeny postulates shared ancestry relationships among organisms in the form of a binary tree.
results show that phylogenies selected using the gtap from unaligned sequences are competitive with the best methods and algorithms available.
the patterns that can be observed in nature are the product of complex interactions, constrained by the template that our ancestors provide.
