meanwhile, comparative analysis of transcriptome under cold stress revealed that one ice <dig> putative ortholog, five cbf putative orthologs,  <dig> nac transcription factors and four cold-induced orhologs were up-regulated at least two fold in response to cold stress.
enhancing cold tolerance capability will increase the total cultivation area and subsequently oil productivity of this tropical species.
developing molecular markers related to cold tolerance would be helpful for molecular breeding of cold tolerant elaeis guineensis.
of these  <dig> gene-based ssrs,  <dig> were derived from expressed sequences up- or down-regulated at least two-fold in response to cold stress.
in the present study, a series of ssr markers were developed based on sequences differentially expressed in response to cold stress.
the polymorphic information content  of these polymorphic ssr markers across  <dig> lines of elaeis guineensis varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .
the oil palm  has the highest oil yield of any crop species, as well as comprising the richest dietary source of provitamin a. for the tropical species, the best mean growth temperature is about 27°c, with a minimal growth temperature of 15°c.
in total,  <dig> gene-based ssrs were identified in  <dig>  expressed sequences from elaeis guineensis transcriptome data: approximately one ssr was detected per  <dig> expressed sequences.
using in-silico mapping,  <dig>  of the  <dig> polymorphic ssr markers were located onto the  <dig> elaeis guineensis chromosomes.
these est-ssr markers would be particularly useful for gene mapping and population structure analysis in elaeis guineensis.
total coverage of  <dig> mbp was achieved, with an average physical distance of  <dig>  mbp between adjacent markers .
interestingly, 5′ untranslated region of both unigene <dig>  and cl <dig> contig <dig>  both contained an ssr markers.
meanwhile, the est-ssr loci were inducible expressed in response to low temperature, which may have potential application in identifying trait-associated markers in oil palm in the future.
