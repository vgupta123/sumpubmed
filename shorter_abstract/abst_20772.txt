experiments with real datasets show that p-ecrnj can find better trees than the best known maximum likelihood methods so far and can efficiently improve local topological transforms in reasonable time.
another more exhaustive topological transformation is p-edge contraction and refinement .
however, these topological transformations often fall easily into local optima, since there are not many trees accessible in one step from any given tree.
inference of evolutionary trees using the maximum likelihood principle is np-hard.
the main idea of p-ecrnj is to use neighbor joining  to refine the unresolved nodes produced in p-ecr.
the topological transformations often used in heuristics are nearest neighbor interchange , subtree prune and regraft  and tree bisection and reconnection .
