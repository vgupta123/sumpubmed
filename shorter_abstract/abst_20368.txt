within this set  <dig> snps are described in the sssnp target database to cause modified splicing.
aassites uses several gene prediction programs and open reading frame prediction to compare the wild type  and the variant gene sequence.
the results of the comparison are combined by a handmade rule system to classify a change in splicing as “likely, probable, unlikely”.
having received good results from tests with snps known for changing the splicing pattern we checked  <dig>  snps from the human genome which are located near splice sites for their ability to change the splicing pattern of the gene and hereby result in a different protein.
because most snp annotation tools look for snps which lead to an amino acid exchange or a premature stop, we designed a new tool called aassites which searches for snps which modify splicing.
due to next generation sequencing methods the number of known human snps has grown.
screening  <dig>  known human snps we detected about  <dig>  snps which probably modify splicing.
