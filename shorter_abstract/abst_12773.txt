furthermore, the target prediction results were confirmed using dual luciferase reporter assay, and ago-mir-656a-3p was demonstrated to regulate the expression of cyp6j <dig> post-transcriptionally through binding to the 3′ utr of cyp6j <dig>
our research results indicate that mirnas may be involved in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals in a. gossypii, and these results also represent an important new small rna genomics resource for further studies on this topic.
we constructed five small rna libraries from apterous aphis gossypii adults that had fed on an artificial diet containing various allelochemicals.
we found that the transcript levels of several mirnas were increased or decreased in all of the allelochemical treatment libraries compared to the control.
using illumina sequencing, a total of  <dig>  million clean reads was obtained, and  <dig> mirnas were identified from a. gossypii.
although the regulatory roles of mirnas in various biological processes have been investigated, there is as yet an absence of studies about the regulatory roles of mirnas involved in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals in insects.

the putative target genes of the mirnas were predicted using in silico tools, and the target genes of several mirnas were presumed to be involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds.
comparative analysis of read counts indicated that both conserved and novel mirnas were differently expressed among the five libraries, and the differential expression was validated via qrt-pcr.
