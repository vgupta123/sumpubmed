these sequences were used to perform phylogenetic reconstructions and to identify functionally conserved amino acids.
none of these mutations, presumably upon functionally essential amino acids, significantly abolished its enzyme activities.
a truncated version of this enzyme  predicted to adopt a 6-fold, and thus entirely lacking a c-terminus phosphate-binding site, was identified and shown to have hisa activity.
we constructed a hmm profile that correctly classifies sequences of unknown function into the hisa and pria enzyme sub-families.
these results are in agreement with a link between promiscuous enzymes and intragenic epistasis.
using this hmm profile, we mined a large metagenome to identify plausible evolutionary intermediate sequences between hisa and pria.
as expected, reconstruction of the evolution of pria from hisa with hmm profiles suggest that functional shifts involve mutations in evolutionarily intermediate enzymes of otherwise functionally essential residues or motifs.
hmm provides a convenient approach for gaining insights into these evolutionary processes.
we searched for functional evolutionary intermediates between the hisa and pria enzyme families in order to understand the functional divergence between these families.
biochemical characterization of one selected enzyme  with a mutation within the functionally essential n-terminus phosphate-binding site, namely, an alanine instead of a glycine in hisa or a serine in pria, showed that this evolutionary intermediate has dual-substrate specificity.
current sequence-based approaches to identify enzyme functional shifts, such as enzyme promiscuity, have proven to be highly dependent on a priori functional knowledge, hampering our ability to reconstruct evolutionary history behind these mechanisms.
