a hypertrophy of paneth cells and an increase in the number of mitotic cells were observed in bov group, while the number of mast cells remained unaltered.
bovicin hc <dig> is an antimicrobial peptide that shows a broad spectrum of activity and potential for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.
histological and morphometric analysis were performed and the relative expression of cytokines was analyzed by real-time rt-pcr.
the oral administration of bovicin hc <dig> to balb/c mice reduced weight gain and caused alterations in the small intestine, although absorptive changes have not been detected.
bovicin hc <dig> has only minor effects on intestinal permeability and did not elicit an allergenic response upon oral administration to animal models.
to gain insight about the safety of bovicin hc <dig> application, the histological and immunostimulatory effects of orally administrated bovicin hc <dig> to balb/c mice were evaluated.
balb/c mice were divided into three groups: negative control ; mice given purified bovicin hc <dig> ; mice given ovalbumin .
increased expression of tnf-α, inf-γ and il- <dig> was observed in the small intestine upon bovicin hc <dig> administration.
considering the low in vivo toxicity of bovicin hc <dig>  it might be a good candidate for enteral applications.
