bioinformatic analysis revealed that the genes were involved in complex pathways, such as signal transduction, protein degradation, ion transport, carbon and amino acid metabolism, and transcriptional and translational regulation, and might play important roles at the late stage of the response to waterlogging.
signal transduction plays a key role in activating genes related to the tolerance mechanism for survival during prolonged waterlogging.
previous studies have mostly focused on revealing the mechanism of the response at the early stage, and there is limited information about the transcriptional profile of genes in maize roots at the late stage of waterlogging.
in this study, the transcriptome at the late stage of waterlogging was assayed in root cells of the tolerant inbred line hz <dig>  using suppression subtractive hybridization .
the late response to waterlogging in maize roots involves a broad spectrum of genes, which are mainly associated with two response processes: defense at the early stage and adaption at the late stage.
the crosstalk between carbon and amino acid metabolism reveals that amino acid metabolism performs two main roles at the late stage: the regulation of cytoplasmic ph and energy supply through breakdown of the carbon skeleton.
reverse northern analysis of a set of  <dig> cdna clones from the ssh library revealed a large number of genes were up-regulated by waterlogging.
a forward ssh library using rna populations from four time points  after waterlogging treatment was constructed to reveal up-regulated genes, and transcriptional and linkage data was integrated to identify candidate genes for waterlogging tolerance.
