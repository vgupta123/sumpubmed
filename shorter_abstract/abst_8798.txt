our approach was applied to  <dig>  human ppis with tertiary structures of their protein complexes already solved.
in this era of rapid accumulation of ppi data, there is great need for a methodology that can efficiently select drug target ppis by holistically assessing the druggability of ppis.
using the model, we predicted several promising candidates for druggable ppis, such as smad4/ski.
to assess the druggability of the ppis,  <dig> attributes were selected to cover a wide range of structural, drug and chemical, and functional information on the ppis.
protein-protein interactions  are challenging but attractive targets of small molecule drugs for therapeutic interventions of human diseases.
as more ppi data are accumulated in the near future, our method will have increased ability to accelerate the discovery of druggable ppis.
thirty ppis known to be druggable were carefully selected from previous studies; these were used as positive instances.
among the attributes, the two with the greatest discriminative power in the best svm model were the number of interacting proteins and the number of pathways.
the best svm model constructed discriminated the already-known target ppis from others at an accuracy of 81%  in cross-validation.
