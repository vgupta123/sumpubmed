here we report the positive identification of the full set of l. monocytogenes pbps and the characteristics of the hitherto undescribed pbpd <dig> .
eight l. monocytogenes pbps were identified by the binding of fluorescent β-lactam antibiotic derivatives boc-fl, boc- <dig> and amp-alexa <dig> to proteins in whole cells or membrane/cell wall extracts.
pbpd <dig>  was not visualized in whole cell extracts, most probably due to its low abundance, but it was shown to bind boc-fl after recombinant overexpression and purification.
the affinity purified recombinant protein had dd-carboxypeptidase activity and preferentially degraded low-molecular-weight substrates.
mutants lacking lmo <dig> and another low molecular mass  pbp, pbp <dig>  - both with dd-carboxypeptidase activity - displayed only slight morphological alterations, demonstrating that they are dispensable for cell survival and probably participate in the latter stages of peptidoglycan synthesis.
bacterial penicillin-binding proteins  can be visualized by their ability to bind radiolabeled or fluorescent β-lactam derivatives both whole cells and membrane/cell enriched fractions.
nine out of the ten putative l. monocytogenes pbp genes were shown to encode proteins that bind derivatives of β-lactam antibiotics, thus enabling their positive identification.
since lmo <dig> preferentially degrades low-molecular- mass substrates, this may indicate a role in cell wall turnover.
the gene encoding a ninth pbp  was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli as a his-tagged protein.
