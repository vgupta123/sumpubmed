the results indicate that mrna expression data for the matched normal tissues available in tcga are statistically reliable, and are highly useful to assess novel associations of genes with functional pathways in normal physiology as well as in the cancer tissues.
the cop <dig> signalosome, composed of eight subunits, is implicated in cancer genetics with its deneddylase activity to modulate cellular concentration of oncogenic proteins such as ikb and tgfÎ².
pathway analysis revealed a high coordination of the expression of the cops <dig> and the other cop <dig> genes with mitochondria-related functional pathways, including genes encoding the respiratory chain complex.
primarily focusing on gene expression data of the normal tissues of the head and neck, the cancer genome atlas  database was used to identify groups of genes that were expressed synergistically with the cop <dig> genes, particularly with the cops <dig> , which possesses the catalytic activity of cop <dig>
expressions of seven of the cop <dig> genes  were found to be highly synergistic in the normal tissues.
in contrast, the tumor tissues decreased the coordinated expression pattern of cop <dig> genes.
this study revealed the significant correlation between the expressions of the cop <dig> genes and those related to the mitochondrial activity.
