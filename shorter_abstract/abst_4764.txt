mammalian positively selected genes have accumulated more recent amino acid repeats than other mammalian genes.
it has been suggested that recent expansions could be associated with the potential of adaptation to new environments.
there is no correlation with expression level.
relaxed purifying selection or positive selection do not associate with more or more recent amino acid repeats.
our analyses show that amino acid repeat expansions are causally independent from protein adaptive evolution in mammalian genomes.
their occurrence is slightly favoured by the sequence context but mainly determined by the molecular function of the gene.
the expansion of amino acid repeats is determined by a high mutation rate and can be increased or limited by selection.
however, we found little support for an accelerated evolutionary rate as the main driver for the expansion of amino acid repeats.
the most significant predictors of amino acid repeats are gene function and gc content.
