furthermore, we link increased 5hmc density to histone modification binding sites, to the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, and to exon-intron boundaries.
we show that, although there is inter-individual variability in 5hmc content among unrelated individuals, approximately  <dig> % of all cpgs on autosomal chromosomes contain 5hmc, while sex chromosomes contain far less.
collectively, these results present an important reference for the growing number of studies that are interested in the investigation of the role of 5hmc in brain and mental disorders.
the recent discovery that methylated cytosines are converted to 5-hydroxymethylated cytosines  by the family of ten-eleven translocation enzymes has sparked significant interest on the genomic location, the abundance in different tissues, the putative functions, and the stability of this epigenetic mark.
our data also provide evidence suggesting that 5hmc has transcriptional regulatory properties, as the density of 5hmc was highest in enhancer regions and within exons.
