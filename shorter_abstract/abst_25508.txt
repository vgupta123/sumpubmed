in this work, we report the first molecular and physiological characterization of events taking place along a leaf developmental gradient in sugarcane.
investments on the development of new sugarcane varieties have been made to maximize sucrose yield, a trait dependent on photosynthetic capacity.
photosynthetic response to co <dig> indicated divergence in photosynthetic capacity based on pepcase activity, corroborated by activity quantification  and distinct levels of carbon discrimination on different segments along leaf length.
rna-seq data indicated a plethora of biochemical pathways differentially expressed along the leaf.
however, detailed studies on sugarcane leaves are scarce.
several genes with higher expression in the middle segment, the one with the highest photosynthetic rates, were identified and their role in sugarcane productivity is discussed.
interestingly, sugarcane leaf segments had a different transcriptional behavior compared to previously published data from maize.
the complex genetic architecture and the lack of a complete genomic sequence in sugarcane hamper the adoption of molecular approaches to study its physiology and to develop new varieties.
however, our data indicates that some transcriptional factors were segment-specific and the sugarcane leaf undergoes through the process of suberizarion, photosynthesis establishment and senescence.
additionally, leaf segments had contrasting amount of chlorophyll, nitrogen and sugars.
