the flexible 380s loop in the starch catalytic domain may be important in defining the specificity of action for each different ss and the g-x-g in motif vi could define ssiv and ssiii action particularly.
based on bioinformatics analysis of the catalytic region of  <dig> sss and  <dig> glycogen synthases , it is suggested that the valine residue in the highly conserved k-x-g-g-l motif in ssiii and ssiv may be a determining feature of primer specificity of these sss as compared to gbssi, ssi and ssii.
the wheat ssivb gene was preferentially expressed in leaf and was not regulated by a circadian clock.
to gain a better understanding of the differences in ss sequences that underscore their specificity, the previously uncharacterised ssivb from wheat was cloned and extensive bioinformatics analyses of this and other sss sequences were done.
five ss isoforms, ssi, ii, iii, iv and granule bound ssi, have been identified, each with a unique catalytic role in starch synthesis.
phylogenetic analysis showed that in plants, ssiv is closely related to ssiii, while ssi, ssii and granule bound ssi clustered together and distinctions between the two groups can be made at the genetic level and included chromosomal location and intron conservation.
the wheat ssiv cdna is most similar to rice ssivb with which it shows synteny and shares a similar exon-intron arrangement.
further, identified differences at the amino acid level in their glycosyltransferase domains, predicted secondary structures, global conformations and conserved residues might be indicative of intragroup functional associations.
