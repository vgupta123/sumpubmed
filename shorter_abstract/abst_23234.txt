viral rna was detected within  <dig>  hours using capture-target-intermediate oligonucleotide hybridization and gold np-mediated silver staining in the absence of rna fragmentation, target amplification, and enzymatic reactions.
the lower limit of detection  of the assay was less than  <dig> fm for purified pcr fragments and  <dig> tcid <dig> units for h5n <dig> viral rna.
in this report, we describe a rapid and simple gold nanoparticle -based genomic microarray assay for specific identification of avian influenza virus h5n <dig> and its discrimination from other major influenza a virus strains .
the new method described here may be useful for simultaneous detection and subtyping of major influenza a viruses.
the np-based microarray assay was able to detect and distinguish h5n <dig> sequences from those of major influenza a viruses .
