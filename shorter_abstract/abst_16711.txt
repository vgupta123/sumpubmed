one assay targets the internal transcribed spacer region  of the fungal genome while the other targets the more variable intergenic spacer region .
fungal skin infections associated with ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, a member of the chrysosporium anamorph of nannizziopsis vriesii  complex, have been linked to an increasing number of cases of snake fungal disease  in captive snakes around the world and in wild snake populations in eastern north america.

the pcr assays were qualified using skin samples collected from  <dig> snakes for which o. ophiodiicola had been previously detected by culture,  <dig> snakes with gross skin lesions suggestive of sfd but which were culture-negative for o. ophiodiicola, and  <dig> snakes with no clinical signs of infection.
both assays performed equivalently and proved to be more sensitive than traditional culture methods, detecting o. ophiodiicola in 98% of the culture-positive samples and in 40% of the culture-negative snakes that had clinical signs of sfd.
the its assay has great utility for assisting with sfd diagnoses whereas the igs assay offers a valuable tool for research-based applications.
we developed two taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction  assays to rapidly detect o. ophiodiicola in clinical samples.
these assays represent the first published methods to detect o. ophiodiicola by real-time pcr.
in addition, the assays did not cross-react with a panel of  <dig> fungal species that are closely related to o. ophiodiicola or that commonly occur on the skin of snakes.
