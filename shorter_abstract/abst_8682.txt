peo is a peitc essential oil containing >95% natural peitc.
peo treatment also reduced mucosal inflammation, depletion of goblet cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells.
peo likely affects an intricate network of immune signaling genes including a novel concentration dependent reduction of total cellular signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  as well as nuclear phosphorylated-stat <dig> .
expression analyses were also carried out for immune function related genes, transcription factors and cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-activated mouse macrophage cells.
the disease attenuation by peo is likely associated with suppression of activation of stat <dig> transcription and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
