in this study we used a label-free quantitative proteomic approach to estimate differences in protein abundance between two closely related m. tuberculosis strains; the virulent h37rv strain and its attenuated counterpart h37ra.
interestingly, the possible protein-export membrane protein secf , and three abc-transporter proteins  were among the more abundant proteins in m. tuberculosis h37rv.
however, differences in protein expression are probably an important factor.
as expected, the majority of the identified proteins had similar relative abundance in the two strains.
however,  <dig> membrane-associated proteins were observed with a  <dig> or more fold difference in their relative abundance in one strain compared to the other.
