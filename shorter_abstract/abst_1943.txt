the chimeric protein was expressed at high level as inclusion bodies.
th <dig> antagonist is a chimeric protein that inhibits the in vitro biological activities of human ifn-γ, and is a partial agonist/antagonist of human il- <dig>  with these attributes, the chimera has the potential to offer a new opportunity for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
the th <dig> antagonist molecule consists of the extracellular region for the human ifnγ receptor chain  <dig> fused by a four-aminoacid linker peptide to human  <dig> n-terminal aminoacid residues of il- <dig>  the corresponding gene fragments were isolated by rt-pcr and cloned in the ptpv- <dig> vector.
a chimeric antagonist that can antagonize the action of th <dig> immunity mediators, ifn-γ and il- <dig>  was designed, engineered, expressed in e. coli, purified and evaluated for its in vitro biological activities.
