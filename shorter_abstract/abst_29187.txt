in an effort to determine if retinoids are capable of inducing th <dig> cytokine responses in human t cell cultures, we stimulated human pbmcs with immobilized anti-cd <dig> mab in the presence or absence of all-trans retinoic acid  or 9-cis-ra.
stimulation of human pbmcs and purified t cells with atra and 9-cis-ra increased mrna and protein levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> and decreased levels of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and tnf-α upon activation with anti-cd <dig> and/or anti-cd <dig> mabs.
besides th <dig> and th <dig> cytokines, a number of additional proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines including several chemokines were also differentially regulated by atra treatment.
