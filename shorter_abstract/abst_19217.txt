the physiological analyses clearly demonstrate the high biochemical versatility found in the c. violaceum genome and molecular methods allowed to detect the intra and inter-population diversity of isolates from three brazilian ecosystems.
isolates from three brazilian ecosystems: brazilian savannah , atlantic rain forest and amazon rain forest.
clusters based on biochemical profiles were congruent with clusters obtained by the 16s rrna gene tree.
according to the phylogenetic analyses, isolates from the amazon rain forest and savannah displayed a closer relationship to the chromobacterium violaceum atcc  <dig>  furthermore, 16s rrna gene tree revealed a good correlation between phylogenetic clustering and geographic origin.
the isolates recovered from amazon and atlantic rain forests presented the most similar biochemical characteristics to the chromobacterium violaceum atcc  <dig> strain.
chromobacterium violaceum is a free-living bacterium able to survive under diverse environmental conditions.
the isolates from brazilian savannah presented greater physiologic diversity and their biochemical profile was the most variable of all groupings.
in this study we evaluate the genetic and physiological diversity of chromobacterium sp.
