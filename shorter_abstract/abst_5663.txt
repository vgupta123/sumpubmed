in this simple setting, an approach for estimating evolutionary and demographic parameters based on comparison of diversity measures is a feasible alternative to the existing bayesian methods , which are instead based on the simulation of genealogies.
the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck in hiv sexual or mother-to-infant transmission has been well documented.
this results in a majority of new infections being homogeneous, i.e., initiated by a single genetic strain.
early after infection, prior to the onset of the host immune response, the viral population grows exponentially.
more specifically, we consider a homogeneous infection  prior to the onset of host-induced selection, where we can assume a random accumulation of mutations.
this allows for more computationally efficient methods to derive the time since the most recent common ancestor.
