potential inhibitors were screened experimentally by inhibition assays.
three compounds were discovered as potential inhibitors of pad <dig> by virtual screening.
twenty two of the top-ranked water-soluble compounds were selected for inhibitory screening against pad <dig>  three compounds showed significant inhibition of pad <dig> and their ic <dig> values were investigated.
rheumatoid arthritis  is an autoimmune disease with unknown etiology.
anticitrullinated protein autoantibody has been documented as a highly specific autoantibody associated with ra.
pad <dig> is a new therapeutic target for ra treatment.
the structures of the three compounds show no resemblance with previously discovered pad <dig> inhibitors, nor with existing drugs for ra treatment.
the compounds are commercially available and can be used as scaffolds to design more potent inhibitors against pad <dig>
