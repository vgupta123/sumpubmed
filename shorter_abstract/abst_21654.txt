three particular examples are introduced here to illustrate the power of the multiple tf-map alignments to characterize conserved regulatory elements in absence of sequence similarity.
the characterization of regulatory regions from co-expressed genes at the sequence level, however, does not yield satisfactory results in many occasions as promoter regions of genes sharing similar expression programs often do not show nucleotide sequence conservation.
the analysis of the promoter sequence of genes with similar expression patterns is a basic tool to annotate common regulatory elements.
we have now extended the basic algorithm to permit multiple promoter comparisons using the progressive alignment paradigm.
results in this dataset indicate that tf-map alignments are able to detect high-level regulatory conservation at the promoter and the 3'utr gene regions, which cannot be detected by the typical sequence alignments.
in a recent approach to circumvent this limitation, we proposed to align the maps of predicted transcription factors  instead of the nucleotide sequence of two related promoters, taking into account the label of the corresponding factor and the position in the primary sequence.
multiple sequence alignments are on the basis of most comparative approaches.
