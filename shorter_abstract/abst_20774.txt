specifically, a poisson-lognormal model is incorporated into the bayesian framework to model within-sample variation; a gamma-gamma model is then used to model between-sample variation, which accounts for over-dispersion of read counts among multiple samples.
we systematically study the variation in count data and dissect the sources of variation into between-sample variation and within-sample variation.
we have developed a novel bayesian hierarchical approach to investigate within-sample and between-sample variations in rna-seq data.
simulation studies, where sequencing counts are synthesized based on parameters learned from real datasets, have demonstrated the advantage of the proposed method in both quantification of mrna abundance and identification of differentially expressed genes.
however, precise quantification of mrna abundance and identification of differentially expressed genes are complicated due to biological and technical variations in rna-seq data.
a novel bayesian framework is developed for joint estimate of gene level mrna abundance and differential state, which models the intrinsic variability in rna-seq to improve the estimation.
recent advances in rna sequencing  technology have offered unprecedented scope and resolution for transcriptome analysis.
moreover, performance comparison on data from the sequencing quality control  project with ercc spike-in controls has shown that the proposed method outperforms existing rna-seq methods in differential analysis.
