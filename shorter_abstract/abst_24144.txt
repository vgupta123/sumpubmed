comparative genome-wide pathway mapping revealed that the biological drug effects were realized largely via different pathways and mechanisms.
our approach provides mechanistic rationales for the differential and common effects of drugs and may help to better understand the origins of drug actions and the design of combination therapies.
information derived from the chemical structure and experimental omics data from short-term efficacy studies are combined to predict the possible protein targets and cellular pathways affected by drugs.
we have developed a generic method for predicting the effects of drugs on biological processes.
validation of the method with anti-atherosclerotic compounds  demonstrated a great conformity between the computationally predicted effects and the wet-lab biochemical effects.
in line with the predictions, the drugs showed differential effects on inflammatory pathways , transcriptional regulators  and enzymes , and they quenched different aspects of the inflammatory signaling cascade.
