treatment of pc <dig> cells with atp elicited a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity .
this pharmacological characterisation provides evidence for a critical role of ionotropic p2x receptors.
the present data show that atp induces nfat-dependent changes in gene expression in pc <dig> cells by acting on p2x receptors.
in many cell types, sustained elevation of intracellular calcium levels cause changes in gene expression via activation of the transcription factor nfat .
inhibition of store-operated calcium entry by the pyrazole derivative btp <dig> also diminished atp-dependent nfat activation.
maximal nfat activation depends on both depolarisation-induced calcium influx and store-operated calcium entry and requires the activity of the protein phosphatase calcineurin and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
the activation of nfat transcriptional activity by extracellular atp was characterised with the help of reporter gene assays.
blockade of l-type voltage-dependent calcium channels by nifedipine reduced the response of nfat to atp, indicating that a depolarisation-mediated calcium influx was required for maximal nfat activation.
furthermore, atp-induced nfat activation was associated with the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases erk1/ <dig>  finally, treatment with atp increased the levels of the nfat target transcripts, rcan1- <dig>  and bdnf .
treatment of neuronal pc <dig> cells with atp induces depolarisation and increases intracellular calcium levels via purinergic receptors.
we have therefore characterised the signalling pathway by which atp regulates nfat-dependent gene expression in pc <dig> cells.
