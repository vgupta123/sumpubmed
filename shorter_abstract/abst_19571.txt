we showed that inhibitors of pi3k, akt <dig>  pkcζ and small gtpases significantly reduced neurite outgrowth.
pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ acted upstream of the small gtpases rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  which in turn modulate lamellipodia formation of svz-derived neurons.
transfection of svz-derived neurons with inactive forms of rac <dig> or cdc <dig> also decreased neurite length whereas transfection with constitutively active forms of rac <dig>  cdc <dig> or akt <dig> as well as with full-length pi3k or pkcζ increased neurite length.
complex intracellular signaling is involved in the initiation of neurite protrusion and subsequent elongation.
we showed the involvement of pi3k/akt1/pkcζ/rac1/cdc <dig> pathway in neurite outgrowth of postnatally born svz neurons.
neurite outgrowth is a key process during neuronal migration and differentiation.
we analyzed key intracellular components of neurite outgrowth signaling in postnatally born subventricular zone  neurons in vitro.
