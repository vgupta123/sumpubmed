the maximum temperature in both regions significantly decreased 10 s following yawns , with a return to basal temperatures after 20 s.
this study is the first clear demonstration of yawning-induced thermal cooling on the surface of the face, providing convergent evidence that this behavior plays a functional role in thermoregulation.
studies have shown that yawns are strongly associated with physiological and pathological conditions that increase brain temperature, and that they are followed by equivalent decreases in brain temperature.
as other studies have demonstrated that yawning is capable of reducing cortical brain temperature, our current data support the idea that yawning functions as a thermoregulator, affecting all structures within the head.
however, measured reductions in cranial or facial temperatures following yawning have yet to be reported, to our knowledge.
to accomplish this, we used a subline of sprague-dawley rats that yawn at a much greater rate  than do outbred sprague-dawley rats .
