the present data show that leptin induces a cytokine-like transcriptional response in rinm5f cells, consistent with the proposed function of leptin as a modulator of immune and inflammatory responses.
the leptin receptor  is a class i cytokine receptor that mediates activation of stat transcription factors.
in this study, we characterise the regulation of inflammation-related genes by leptin in insulinoma cells and compare the effect of transcriptional regulation by leptin with that of other cytokines.
we have used rinm5f insulinoma cells as a model system for a peripheral target cell of leptin.
experiments with leprb point mutants revealed that the upregulation of the inflammation-related genes depended on the presence of tyrosine- <dig> which mediates the activation of the transcription factors stat <dig> and stat <dig>  reporter gene assays showed that leptin induced the expression of preprotachykinin- <dig> and lipocalin- <dig> on the level of promoter regulation.
six transcripts encoding inflammation-related proteins were found to be upregulated by activation of leprb, namely lipocalin- <dig>  pancreatitis-associated protein, preprotachykinin- <dig>  fibrinogen-Î², tissue-type plasminogen activator  and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase .
inhibition of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets.
finally, leptin treatment increased caspase 3-like proteolytic activity in rinm5f cells.
