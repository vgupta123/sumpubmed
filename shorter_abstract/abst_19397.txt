our data suggest that the oviduct functions as a biological sensor that screens the spermatozoon, and then responds by modifying the oviductal environment.
here we investigated the alternative possibility, namely that the oviducts can recognise x- and y- spermatozoa, and may thus be able to bias the offspring sex ratio.
