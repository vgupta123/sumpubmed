the enumeration is achieved efficiently by exploring a set of rigid transformations.
our approach incorporates a surface identification technique and a method for avoiding clashes of two subunits when computing rigid transformations.
our method achieved a success rate higher than other methods, with the prediction quality improved in terms of both accuracy and coverage.
our results show that this approach consistently performs better than other methods in binding site identification.
we propose a method which enumerates “all” the configurations  between two proteins  and evaluates each configuration by the interaction between its components using the atomic contact energy function.
when the optimal transformations according to the atomic contact energy function are identified, the corresponding binding sites are given as predictions.
the interface in a complex involves two structurally matched protein subunits, and the binding sites can be predicted by identifying structural matches at protein surfaces.
