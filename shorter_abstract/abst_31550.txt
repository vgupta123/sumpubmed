genes involved in male reproduction are often the targets of natural and/or sexual selection.
the adaptive evolution of scml <dig> in primates provides a new case in understanding the evolutionary process of genes involved in primate male reproduction.
to test whether scml <dig> is the target of selection in primates, we sequenced and compared the coding region of scml <dig> in major primate lineages, and we observed the signature of positive selection in primates.
we analyzed the molecular evolutionary pattern of scml <dig> in diverse primate species, and we observed a strong signature of adaptive evolution which is caused by darwinian positive selection.
when compared with the paralogous genes  of the same family, scml <dig> evolved rapidly in primates, which is consistent with the proposed adaptive evolution, suggesting functional modification after gene duplication.
the immunohistochemical data indicates that scml <dig> is preferentially expressed in germ stem cells of testis, therefore likely involved in spermatogenesis.
scml <dig> is a recently identified x-linked gene with preferential expression in testis.
gene expression analysis in rhesus macaques shows that during male sexual maturation, there is a significant expression change in testis, implying that scml <dig> likely plays a role in testis development and spermatogenesis.
