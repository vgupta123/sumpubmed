classification methods such as svm, rbf neural nets, mlp neural nets, bayesian, decision tree and random forrest methods have been used in recent studies.
in this study, we compared the efficiency of the classification methods including; svm, rbf neural nets, mlp neural nets, bayesian, decision tree and random forrest methods.
we applied these methods to eight publicly available datasets, and compared how these methods performed in class prediction of test datasets.
we evaluated the class prediction efficiency of each gene list in training and test cross-validation using supervised classifiers.
further the efficiency of the feature selection methods including support vector machine recursive feature elimination , chi squared, and csf were compared.
results revealed the importance of feature selection in accurately classifying new samples and how an integrated feature selection and classification algorithm is performing and is capable of identifying significant genes.
several classification and feature selection methods have been studied for the identification of differentially expressed genes in microarray data.
we presented a study in which we compared some of the common used classification, clustering, and feature selection methods.
we reported that the choice of feature selection methods, the number of genes in the gene list, the number of cases  substantially influence classification success.
however there is lack of comparison between these methods to find a better framework for classification, clustering and analysis of microarray gene expression results.
based on features chosen by these methods, error rates and accuracy of several classification algorithms were obtained.
in each case these methods were applied to eight different binary  microarray datasets.
