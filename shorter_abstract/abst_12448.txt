this is particularly obvious in b. bavariensis, a rodent adapted species that has diverged from the bird-associated b. garinii most likely in asia.
illumina technology was used to obtain genome-wide sequence data for  <dig> strains of  <dig> named genospecies of the b. burgdorferi species complex and genomic data already published for  <dig> additional strain  was added.
it now consists of two populations one of which most probably invaded europe following adaptation to a new vector  and currently expands its distribution range.
understanding the evolutionary relationship of species of the complex is fundamental to explaining patterns of speciation.
phylogenetic reconstruction based on  <dig> orthologous single copy genes shows that the genospecies represent clearly distinguishable taxa with recent and still ongoing speciation events apparent in europe and asia.
the position of borrelia species in the phylogeny is consistent with host associations constituting a major driver for speciation.
the results imply that genotypes/species with novel properties regarding host or vector associations have evolved recurrently during the history of the species complex and may emerge at any time.
interestingly, the data also demonstrate that vector associations are an additional driver for diversification in this tick-borne species complex.
we suggest that the finding of vector associations as a driver for diversification may be a general pattern for tick-borne pathogens.
the core genome analysis presented here provides an important source for investigations of the underlying mechanisms of speciation in tick-borne pathogens.
this in turn forms a crucial basis to frame testable hypotheses concerning the underlying processes including host and vector adaptations.
