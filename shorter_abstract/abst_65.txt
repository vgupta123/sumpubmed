this study provides unique, experimental insights into the combined roles of coevolving parasites and population size on the evolution of mating rate.
to gain insights into the interaction between these dual selective factors, we used populations from a coevolution experiment with the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum, and its microsporidian parasite, nosema whitei.
our results show that parasites can be key determinants of the sexual behaviour of their hosts.
but in small populations, coevolution did not lead to decreased male mating rates.
coevolved females from both large and small populations appeared to be more willing to accept mating than non-coevolved females.
furthermore, we find that males and females respond differently to the same environmental conditions.
coevolution with parasites and population size are both expected to influence the evolution of mating rates.
we maintained each experimental population at two different population sizes.
