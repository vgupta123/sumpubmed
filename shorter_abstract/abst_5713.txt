the fungus-growing ant-microbe symbiosis consists of coevolving microbial mutualists and pathogens.
here, a more extensive phylogenetic analysis of escovopsis lineages infecting the gardens of apterostigma ants demonstrates that these pathogens display patterns of phylogenetic congruence with their fungal hosts.
though there is clear evidence of host-specificity on the part of diverse escovopsis lineages, these pathogens have switched occasionally to novel host fungi.
