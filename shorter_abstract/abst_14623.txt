based on gene mutation patterns and genomic changes we identify lines representative of the fgfr3-driven tumor pathway and of the tp53/rb tumor suppressor-driven pathway.
this is a comprehensive genomic characterization of  <dig> urothelial bladder carcinoma  cell lines including information on origin, mutation status of genes implicated in bladder cancer , copy number alterations assessed using high density snp arrays, uniparental disomy  events, and gene expression.
cancer cell lines are useful tools for its study.
high-density array copy number analysis identified significant focal gains  and losses  in regions altered in tumors but not previously described as affected in bladder cell lines.
overall, there is a predominance of more aggressive tumor subtypes among the cell lines.
the compiled information should serve as a useful reference to the bladder cancer research community and should help to select cell lines appropriate for the functional analysis of bladder cancer genes, for example those being identified through massive parallel sequencing.
previously undescribed chromosome x losses found in ubc lines also point to potential tumor suppressor genes.
