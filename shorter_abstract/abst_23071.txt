mirmaid is available as a public web service but is also easily installed as a local application.
third-party mirna data resources can be modularly integrated as mirmaid plugins or they can loosely couple with mirmaid as individual entities in the world wide web.
we have developed a software framework, designated here as mirmaid, with the goal of integrating mirna data resources in a uniform web service interface that can be accessed and queried by researchers and, most importantly, by computers.
the software framework is freely available under the lgpl open source license for academic and commercial use.
furthermore, a large number of decentralized online resources are now available, each contributing with important mirna annotation and information.
it exposes mirbase data as inter-connected web services.
mirmaid is an intuitive and modular software platform designed to unify mirbase and independent mirna data resources.
it enables mirna researchers to computationally address complex questions involving the multitude of mirna data resources.
