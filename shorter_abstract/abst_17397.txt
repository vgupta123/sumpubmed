we propose this hb phenotype illustrates a novel mechanism for adaptively elevating the co <dig> carrying capacity of eastern mole blood during burst tunnelling activities associated with subterranean habitation.
this phenotype arises by increasing the intrinsic o <dig> affinity of the hemoglobin  molecule, by decreasing the intracellular concentration of allosteric effectors , or by suppressing the sensitivity of hb to these physiological cofactors.
however, this replacement also abolishes key binding sites for the red blood cell effectors cl-, lactate and dpg  at δ82lys, thereby markedly reducing competition for carbamate formation  at the δ-chain n-termini.
molecular modelling indicates that this functional shift is principally attributable to a single charge altering amino acid substitution in the β-type δ-globin chain  of this species that perturbs electrostatic interactions between the dimer subunits via formation of an intra-chain salt-bridge with δ82lys.
here we report that strictly fossorial eastern moles  have evolved a low o <dig> affinity, dpg-insensitive hb - contrary to expectations for a mammalian species that is adapted to the chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia of subterranean burrow systems.
