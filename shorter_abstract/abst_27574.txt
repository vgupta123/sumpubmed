in this study we report the characterisation of organic hydroperoxide resistance gene ohr and its regulator ohrr in s. meliloti.
resistance to h2o <dig> and superoxides has been extensively studied in s. meliloti.
in contrast resistance to organic peroxides has not been investigated while s. meliloti genome encodes putative organic peroxidases.
this report demonstrates the significant role ohr and ohrr proteins play in bacterial stress resistance against organic peroxides in s. meliloti.
the inactivation of ohr did not affect symbiosis and nitrogen fixation, suggesting that redundant enzymatic activity exists in this strain.
both ohr and ohrr are expressed in nodules suggesting that they play a role during nitrogen fixation.
the expression of ohr and ohrr genes is specifically induced by organic peroxides.
the ohr and ohrr genes are expressed in nodule-inhabiting bacteroids suggesting a role during nodulation.
ohrr binds to the intergenic region between the divergent genes ohr and ohrr.
sinorhizobium meliloti is a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium that elicits nodules on roots of host plants medicago sativa.
organic peroxides are produced by plants and are highly toxic.
