using publicly available rna-seq data, we found more than one hundred cases where junction reads connected protein-coding gene exons with a downstream mono-exonic lncrna, revealing the need for a careful evaluation of lncrna 5â€²-boundaries.
reconstructing transcript models from rna-sequencing  data and establishing these as independent transcriptional units can be a challenging task.
using the zipper plot, we found evidence of transcription for a set of well-characterized lncrnas and observed that fewer mono-exonic lncrnas have cage peaks overlapping with their tsss compared to multi-exonic lncrnas.
to tackle this problem we have developed the zipper plot, a novel visualization and analysis method that enables users to simultaneously interrogate thousands of human putative transcription start sites  in relation to various features that are indicative for transcriptional activity.
our method only requires three tab-separated fields  as input and generates a report that includes a detailed summary table, a zipper plot and several statistics derived from this plot.
current state-of-the-art tools for long non-coding rna  annotation are mainly based on evolutionary constraints, which may result in false negatives due to the overall limited conservation of lncrnas.
