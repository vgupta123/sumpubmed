advanced glycation end products generated in the circulation of diabetic patients were reported to affect the function of vascular wall.
we examined the effects of advanced glycation end products-bovine serum albumin  on endothelial connexin <dig>  expression and gap-junction communication.
in human aortic endothelial cells  treated with a series concentrations of age-bsa  for  <dig> and  <dig> hours, cx <dig> transcript and cx <dig> protein were reduced in a dose dependent manner.
in addition, gap-junction communication was reduced.
however, all reversions of down-regulated cx <dig> by inhibitors did not restore the functional gap-junction communication.
