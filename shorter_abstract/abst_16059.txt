one of the significant unmet needs in veterinary surgery and pain management is for longer acting opioids for cats to effectively bridge the gap between the in-hospital and at-home recovery periods.
er-bup had a positive influence on subjective pain scores during the 72 h postsurgery .
symmetry indices were derived for kinetic variables  of each forelimb for landing following a jump and for walking.
observational pain scores and kinetic data  were collected prior to  and at intervals for 72 h following surgery.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , transdermal fentanyl patches, and transmucosal buprenorphine are probably the most commonly used options for providing post-operative analgesia in the early at-home period.
a proof of concept study of an extended release formulation of buprenorphine hcl  was conducted using objective kinetic measures and a unilateral onychectomy model.
furthermore, landing onto a psw from an elevated perch may be a useful and efficient way to assess analgesics in cats using a unilateral model of limb pain.
er-bup resulted in significantly decreased asymmetry in limb use during landing  and walking .
all animals underwent a unilateral forelimb onychectomy per period with a washout/recovery period in between.
using a blinded, randomized, two period crossover design, four cats were allocated to control  or er-bup  treatment groups.
no cats required rescue analgesics based on subjective pain score.
this study demonstrates that sc administration of er-bup may be an effective analgesic for a 72 h period postoperatively.
