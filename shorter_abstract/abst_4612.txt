the results show that our method successfully reveals many subtype-specific regions in the identified maps of biological contexts, which well represent biological functions that can be connected to specific subtypes.
we found not only the results that are consistent with previous studies, but also new hypotheses on the biological mechanisms specific to certain cancer types that warrant further investigations.
unlike conventional approaches to build modular networks of individual genes, our focus is to identify cancer-generic and subtype-specific interactions between contextual gene sets, of which each gene set share coherent transcriptional patterns across a subset of samples, termed contextual gene set.
the analysis on the contextual gene sets and characterization of networks of interaction composed of these sets discovered distinct functional differences underlying various types of cancer.
the results also revealed that network components specific to different types of cancer are related to different biological functions than cancer-generic network components.
two cancer data sets were analyzed to support the validity of condition-specificity of identified interactions.
when compared to an existing approach, the proposed method was much more sensitive in identifying condition-specific interactions even in heterogeneous data set.
in this study, we describe a novel method to discern molecular interactions specific to certain molecular contexts.
we then apply a novel formulation for quantitating the effect of the samples from each subtype on the calculated strength of interactions observed.
