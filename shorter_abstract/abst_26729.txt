gene tree topology supported monophyly of chrs and a myohr clade that included nhrs sequences, indicating these designations are functional rather than evolutionary.
notably, the topology of the hr gene tree did not mirror the phylogeny of annelida as presently understood, and we found evidence of extensive hr gene duplication and loss in annelids.
despite extensive study on hemoglobins and hemocyanins, little is known about hemerythrin  evolutionary history.
sequences of  <dig> putative hr genes were identified from  <dig> annelid species in  <dig> different families and bayesian inference revealed two major clades with strong statistical support.
