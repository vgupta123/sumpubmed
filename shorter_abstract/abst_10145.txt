france continues to monitor for sbv, and updated information is made available online on a regular basis .
congenital sbv morbidity level was on average moderate, although higher in sheep than in other ruminant species.
in france, sbv emergence was monitored through a national multi-stakeholder surveillance and investigation system.
outbreaks of congenital sbv are expected to occur sporadically from now on, but further epidemics may also occur if immunity at population level declines.
sbv impact in infected herds was primarily due to the birth of stillborns or deformed foetuses and neonates.
in addition, in infected herds, farmers reported retrospectively a lower prolificacy during the vector season, suggesting a potential impact of acute sbv infection during mating and early stages of gestation.
on average, 8% of lambs, 3% of calves and 2% of kids born in sbv-infected herds showed typical congenital sbv deformities.
based on the monitoring data collected from january  <dig> to august  <dig>  we describe the spread of sbv in france during two seasons of dissemination  and we provide a large-scale assessment of the impact of this new disease in ruminants.
