analysis of flowering time data from various arabidopsis natural accessions indicated that the fri-ler allele retains some functionality.
usually, late-flowering accessions carry functional fri alleles , whereas early flowering accessions contain non-functional alleles.
nevertheless, the fri-ler allele revealed a weaker effect when compared to the fully functional fri-wt allele, mainly due to reduced expression.
we generated transgenic lines carrying the fri-col or fri-ler allele in order to compare their effect on flowering time, vernalization response and flc expression in the same genetic background.
the present study defines for the first time the existence of a new class of arabidopsis accessions with an intermediate phenotype between slow and rapid cycling types.
we demonstrate that the fri-ler allele induces flc expression, delays flowering time and confers sensitivity to vernalization in contrast to the true null fri-col allele.
most of the natural variation in flowering time in arabidopsis thaliana can be attributed to allelic variation at the gene frigida , which activates expression of the floral repressor flowering locus c .

although using available data from a common garden experiment we cannot observe fitness differences between accessions carrying the fri-ler or the fri-col allele, the phenotypic changes observed in the lab suggest that variation in these alleles could play a role in adaptation to specific natural environments.
we characterize their modes of regulation through allele-specific expression and their relevance in nature through re-analysis of published datasets.
