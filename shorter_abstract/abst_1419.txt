members of group a and b have been extensively characterized, but little information on the group d mapks has been reported.
mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades play pivotal roles in mediating biotic and abiotic stress responses.
the analysis of the promoter region of ghmpk <dig> revealed a group of putative cis-acting elements related to stress responses.
southern blot analysis suggests ghmpk <dig> is single copy in the cotton genome, and rna blot analysis indicates that ghmpk <dig> transcripts accumulate following pathogen infection and treatment with multiple defense-related signal molecules.
in plants, mapks are classified into four major groups  according to their sequence homology and conserved phosphorylation motifs.
transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing ghmpk <dig> displayed significant resistance to fungi  and bacteria  pathogen, and the transcripts of pathogen-related  genes were more rapidly and strongly induced in the transgenic plants.
these results suggest that ghmpk <dig> might be involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, including biotic and abiotic stress signaling pathways.
furthermore, transgenic arabidopsis showed reduced drought tolerance and rapid h2o <dig> accumulation.
