a comprehensive analysis of their functional capabilities and interactions reveals their functional coupling, with many cases of metabolic and informational complementation.
using comparative genomics, we confirm that both genomes have undergone a reductive evolution, although with some unusual genomic features as a consequence of coevolving in an exceptional compartmentalized organization.
m. endobia seems to be responsible for the biosynthesis of most cellular components and energy provision, and controls most informational processes for the consortium, while t. princeps appears to be a mere factory for amino acid synthesis, and translating proteins, using the precursors provided by m. endobia.
essential primary endosymbionts can coexist with facultative secondary symbionts which can, eventually, establish metabolic complementation with the primary endosymbiont, becoming a co-primary.
in this scenario, we propose that both entities should be considered part of a composite organism whose compartmentalized scheme  resembles a eukaryotic cell.
we report the genome sequencing of m. endobia str.
