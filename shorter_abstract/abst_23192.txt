we evaluated prediction of gene expression data based on  <dig> studies, sourced from a combined total of  <dig>  samples.
we show that gene expression data can be computationally constructed, thereby potentially reducing the costs of gene expression profiling.
in conclusion, this method shows great promise of opening new avenues in research on low-rank matrix completion in biological sciences.
there is an opportunity to reduce both the cost and time for generating such expression datasets.
this is achieved by modelling expression data as a low-rank matrix and then applying recently discovered techniques of matrix completion by using nonlinear convex optimisation.
it is shown that such datasets can be constructed with a low relative error even at high missing value rates , and that such predicted datasets can be reliably used as surrogates for further analysis.
we propose a framework in which complete gene expression values can be reliably predicted in-silico from partial measurements.
