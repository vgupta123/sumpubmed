these effects were abolished after inhibition of protein kinase a with h- <dig> pointing to the important role of phosphorylation of calcium channels in the potentiation of i transients.
we recorded i changes in the micromolar range after modulation of adenylate cyclase, inhibition of phosphodiesterase and activation of g-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors.
using viral gene transfer we showed its efficient expression in organotypic brainstem preparations.
ca2+-dependent i transients were suppressed after blockade of adenylate cyclase with  <dig>  mm adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2'5'-dideoxyadenosine and potentiated after inhibiting phosphodiesterase with isobutylmethylxanthine and rolipram.
i levels increased after membrane depolarisation and release of ca2+ from internal stores.
using a strictly neuron-restricted promoter we virally transduced neurons in the organotypic brainstem slices which contained pre-b√∂tzinger complex, constituting the rhythm-generating part of the respiratory network.
during paired stimulations, the second depolarisation and ca2+ release evoked bigger camp responses.
fluorescent camp sensor epac1-camps was expressed both in neuronal cell bodies and neurites, allowing us to measure intracellular distribution of camp, its absolute levels and time-dependent changes in response to physiological stimuli.
while imaging of calcium is commonly used in neuroscience applications, probing for camp levels has not yet been performed in living vertebrate neuronal tissue before.
