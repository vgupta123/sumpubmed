they treat those length-k substrings appear at least m times as correct substring and correct the error reads based on these substrings.
we introduced a method to calculate the probability of false positives and false negatives of the length-k substring using different thresholds.
experimental results on both real data and simulated data showed that our calculation is correct and we can reduce the total error substrings by  <dig> % and  <dig> % when compared to ecindel and srcorr respectively.
dna assembling is the problem of determining the nucleotide sequence of a genome from its substrings, called reads.
in this paper, we propose a method to calculate the probabilities of false positive and false negative when determining whether a length-k substring is correct using threshold m. based on this optimal threshold m that minimizes the total errors .
however, since the threshold m is chosen without any solid theoretical analysis, these algorithms cannot guarantee their performances on error correction.
