contigs assembled from a normalized roche  <dig> hamster liver library comprising  <dig>  million long reads were used to identify 10â€™ <dig> unique transcripts based on homology to refseq database entries from human, mouse, and rat.
we compared the liver transcriptome of hamster with equivalent data from human, rat, minipig, and cynomolgus monkeys to highlight differential gene expression with focus on lipid metabolism.
for mrna quantification we mapped  <dig> million sage tags  from the same rna source to the annotated hamster liver transcriptome contigs.
the tms approach is suited for fast and inexpensive transcript profiling in cells or tissues of species where a fully annotated genome is not available.
this includes the syrian hamster mesocricetus auratus as an important model for dyslipidaemia because it mirrors many aspects of human disease and pharmacological responses.
