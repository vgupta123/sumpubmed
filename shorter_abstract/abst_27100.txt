with this method, biologically useful information can be detectable by applying various analytic methods to the combined data set with increased sample size.
the method transformed gene expression ratios into the form of a reference data set on a gene by gene basis.
the transformation method was slightly more effective when a data set with strong homogeneity in the same experimental group was used as a reference data set.
therefore, one of the most pressing challenges in the field of microarray technology is how to integrate results from different microarray experiments or combine data sets prior to the specific analysis.
such systematic differences present a substantial obstacle to the analysis of microarray data, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable information.
two microarray data sets based on a 17k cdna microarray system were used, consisting of  <dig> normal colon mucosa and  <dig> colorectal cancer tissues.
a simple integration method was introduced which was based on the distributions of gene expression ratios among different microarray data sets.
in the mixed data set, two previously identified subgroups of normal and tumor were well separated, and the efficiency of integration was more prominent in tumor groups than normal groups.
hierarchical clustering analysis, density and box plots, and mixture scores with correlation coefficients revealed that the two data sets were well intermingled, indicating that the proposed method minimized the experimental bias.
in addition, any rna source effect was not detected by the proposed transformation method.
proposed method is simple but useful to combine several data sets from different experimental conditions.
