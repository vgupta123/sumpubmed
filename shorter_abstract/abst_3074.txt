here we measured chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and water potential of citrus leaves infiltrated with recombinant purified xacpnp and demonstrate that the peptide improves the physiological conditions of the tissue.
plant natriuretic peptides  belong to a novel class of peptidic signaling molecules that share some structural similarity to the n-terminal domain of expansins and affect physiological processes such as water and ion homeostasis at nano-molar concentrations.
we demonstrate that xacpnp induces changes in host photosynthesis at the level of protein expression and in photosynthetic efficiency in particular.
importantly, the proteomic analysis revealed that these responses are mirrored by rapid changes in the host proteome that include the up-regulation of rubisco activase, atp synthase cf <dig> α subunit, maturase k, and α- and β-tubulin.
