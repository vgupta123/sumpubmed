the fc fusion did not prolong the biological half-life of the plant-expressed enzyme pcoch3-fc, but increased the yield of the enzyme expression in the plant under the same experimental conditions.
a challenge for practical therapeutic use of this enzyme exists in the large-scale protein production and, therefore, it is interesting to identify a low-cost and feasible, sustainable source of coch3-fc production.
further studies on the pcoch3-fc production in plants should focus on the development of vectors with additional genes/promoters for the complete protein sialylation and for a better yield.
a recently reported cocaine hydrolase  fused with fragment crystallizable  region of human immunoglobulin g <dig>  denoted as coch3-fc, is known as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cocaine overdose and addiction.
however, compared to the mammalian-cell expressed coch3-fc protein, pcoch3-fc had a shorter biological half-life, probably due to the lack of protein sialylation in plant.
the plant-expressed protein, denoted as pcoch3-fc, was as active as that expressed in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo.
