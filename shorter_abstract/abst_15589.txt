transposable elements  and other repetitive elements are a large and dynamically evolving part of eukaryotic genomes, especially in plants where they can account for a significant proportion of genome size.
it is not appropriate for comparing repetitive elements across the species boundaries, for which de novo methods are more appropriate.
the mapping approach proved highly effective within the reference species but underestimated te abundance in interspecific comparisons relative to the de novo methods.
we generated low-coverage illumina whole genome shotgun sequencing reads for multiple individuals of cacao  and related species.

a standard set of ultra-conserved orthologous sequences  standardized te data between samples and provided phylogenetic information on the relatedness of samples.
individual t. cacao accessions have unique patterns of te abundance indicating that the te composition of the genome is evolving actively within this species.
individual t. cacao accessions have unique spectra of te composition indicating active evolution of te abundance within this species.
ltr/gypsy elements are the most abundant, comprising c.10% of the genome.
theobroma grandiflorum has a similar te composition to t. cacao, but the related genus herrania is rather different, with ltrs making up a lower proportion of the genome, perhaps because of a massive presence  of distinctive low complexity satellite-like repeats in this genome.
short read alignment/mapping to reference te contigs provides a simple and effective method of investigating intraspecific differences in te composition.
next generation sequencing and new computational tools have greatly facilitated the investigation of te variation within species and among closely related species.
within t. cacao the retroelement families show an order of magnitude greater sequence variability than the dna transposon families.
