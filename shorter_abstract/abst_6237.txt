we evaluated five parameters susceptible to horse trampling: soil strength, vegetation cover, percent of nonnative vegetation, plant species diversity, and macroinvertebrate abundance.
we also tested whether or not plant cover and species diversity were affected by the presence of horse feces.
horse trailing resulted in reduced vegetation cover, compacted soils, and in cases of intermediate intensity disturbance, increased plant species diversity.
extensive trailing can result in a surprisingly large impact area: we estimate that <  <dig> horses used >  <dig> km <dig> of trails in our study area.
the presence of horse feces did not affect plant cover, but it did increase native plant diversity.
in contrast, increased native plant diversity near trails and feces could be viewed as positive outcomes.
adverse impacts, such as soil compaction and increased erosion potential, were limited to established horse trails.
we conducted a study in a southern california desert to understand how feral horse movements and horse feces impacted this arid ecosystem.
