little is known about the genome sequences of euphausiacea  although these crustaceans are abundant components of the pelagic ecosystems in all oceans and used for aquaculture and pharmaceutical industry.
we defined the first tissue transcriptional signatures of e. superba based on functional categorization among the examined tissues.
this study reports the results of an expressed sequence tag  sequencing project from different tissues of euphausia superba .
quantitative rt-pcr analysis was performed to quantify and validate the expression levels of ten genes presenting different est countings in krill tissues.
we have constructed and sequenced five cdna libraries from different antarctic krill tissues: head, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores.
our catalogue provides for the first time a genomic tool to investigate the biology of the antarctic krill.
clusters, consensuses and related similarity and gene ontology searches were organized in a dedicated e. superba database .
in addition, bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant e. superba sequences identified  <dig> microsatellite containing ests.
