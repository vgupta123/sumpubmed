it belonged to the siphoviridae family with a hexagonal head diameter of about 99 nm and a non-contractile tail of about 103 nm × 39 nm.
2-keto-gluconic acid  producing bacteria had also been attacked and lysed by bacteriophages which lowered the glucose consumption and 2kga yield and even stopped the fermentation process.
the phage ksl- <dig> was a novel bacteriophage specifically infecting pseudomonas fluorescens k <dig>  the remedial action of feeding fresh seed culture to the infected broth was an easily-operating and effective method to maintain a high 2kga yield and avoid the draft of infected broth.
one-step growth curve gave its latent and burst periods of 90 min and 75 min with a burst size of  <dig> phage particles per infected cell.
its optimal moi to infect p. fluorescens k <dig> was about  <dig> .
this phage was stable with a ph range of  <dig> – <dig> , and sensitive to thermal treatment.
the phage ksl- <dig> of pseudomonas fluorescens k <dig> was isolated from abnormal 2kga fermentation broth.
compared with the infected 2kga fermentation, the remedial experiments restored 2kga fermentation performance by increasing the produced 2kga concentration to  <dig>  g/l and shortening the total fermentation time of 80 h with the productivity and yield of  <dig>  g/l.h and  <dig>  g/g.
the obtained data proved that this method was effective to combat the phage infections problems during the 2kga fermentation.
in this study, we presented the characteristics of a novel virulent bacteriophage specifically infecting pseudomonas fluorescens k <dig> and proposed an efficient remedial action for this phage infection to reduce the production loss.
finally, a simple remedial action was proposed by feeding fresh seed culture.
the genome size of phage ksl- <dig> was estimated to be approximately  <dig> kbp.
