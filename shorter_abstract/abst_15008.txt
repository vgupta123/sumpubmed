here, we report a large set of bac-end sequences , use them for developing ssr  markers, and apply them in genetic linkage mapping.
a genetic linkage map was constructed, consisting of  <dig> loci onto  <dig> linkage groups and covering a total of  <dig> .
the ssrs mined from bess will be of use in further molecular analysis of the peanut genome, providing a novel set of markers, genetically anchoring bac clones, and incorporating gene sequences into a linkage map.
<dig> cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci.
it has a very narrow genetic base that may well derive from a relatively recent single polyploidization event.
two markers related to resistance gene homologs  were mapped to two different groups, thus anchoring  <dig> rgh-bac contig and  <dig> singleton.
accordingly molecular markers have low levels of polymorphism and the number of polymorphic molecular markers available for cultivated peanut is still limiting.
cultivated peanut  is an important crop worldwide, valued for its edible oil and digestible protein.
the new set of  <dig>  ssrs as well as about  <dig>  published or unpublished ssrs were screened against two parents of a mapping population, generating  <dig> polymorphic loci.
