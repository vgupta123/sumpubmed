in the bacterium caulobacter crescentus, ctra coordinates dna replication, cell division, and polar morphogenesis and is considered the cell cycle master regulator.
in particular, orthologous genes of the divl-ccka-chpt-ctra phosphorelay, the divj-plec-divk two-component system, the cpdr-rcda-clppx proteolysis system, the methyltransferase ccrm and transcriptional regulators dnaa and gcra were identified in representative genomes of alpha-proteobacteria.
ctra activity varies during cell cycle progression and is modulated by phosphorylation, proteolysis and transcriptional control.
in a phosphorylated state, ctra binds specific dna sequences, regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and silences the origin of replication.
ctra, dnaa and gcra binding sites and ccrm putative methylation sites were predicted in promoter regions of all these factors and functions controlled by ctra in all alphas were predicted.
two schemes appeared to evolve: a complex circuit in caulobacterales and rhizobiales and a simpler one found in rhodobacterales.
