a new module has been used to define binding sites in mhc molecules.
the systematic framework for understanding structural variations in mhc class ii molecules enables large scale comparison of binding grooves and sub-pockets, which is likely to have direct implications towards predicting epitopes and understanding peptide binding preferences.
we also present how differences in sub-pockets of molecules associated with a pair of autoimmune diseases, narcolepsy and rheumatoid arthritis, were captured by pocketmatch <dig>
here we report a new approach to compare the binding sites of mhc class ii molecules using their three dimensional structures.
we show that our methodology is useful for classification of mhc class ii molecules based on similarities or differences among their binding sites.
mhc/hla class ii molecules are important components of the immune system and play a critical role in processes such as phagocytosis.
comparison of binding sites of  <dig> mhc molecules, both at the whole groove and individual sub-pocket levels has been carried out, and their clustering patterns analyzed.
understanding peptide recognition properties of the hundreds of mhc class ii alleles is essential to appreciate determinants of antigenicity and ultimately to predict epitopes.
