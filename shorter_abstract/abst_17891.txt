the intra-hippocampus and intra-bla injections of way- <dig> improved the delirium-like behavior of rats by significantly reducing the expression of nlrp <dig> inflammasome and the release of il1-Î² and il <dig> into csf.
the measurement of the concentrations of noradrenaline,  <dig> -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, the homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid and serotonin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid  of scopolamine-induced delirium rats were significantly increased.
the total distance and the number of crossing and rearing in the elevated plus maze test and the time spent in the light compartment in the dark/light test of scopolamine-treated rats were significantly increased while the percentage of time spent in the open arms was decreased, showing the validity of the established delirium rat model.
a delirium rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine and behavioral changes evaluated through open field and elevated plus maze experiments.
the purpose of this paper was to assess the central pharmacological activity of way- <dig> in a rat model of scopolamine-induced delirium and its underlying mechanism.
