in addition to determining in vitro inhibition abilities of a panel of mabs against bont/b1-/b <dig>  this work has determined b <dig>  and 2b <dig>  to be the best mabs for sample preparation before endopep-ms. these mab characterizations also have the potential to assist with mechanistic studies of bont/b protection and treatment, which is important for studying alternative therapeutics for botulism.
among the mabs, there were significant differences in ability to extract bont/b subtypes and inhibitory effect on bont catalytic activity.
however, some antibodies inhibit or neutralize the enzymatic activity of bont, so the choice of antibody for toxin extraction is critical.
botulism is caused by botulinum neurotoxins , extremely toxic proteins which can induce respiratory failure leading to long-term intensive care or death.
some of the mabs tested enhanced the in vitro light chain activity of bont/b, suggesting that bont/b may undergo conformational change upon binding some mabs.
