results presented here indicate, for the first time, a distinct functional role for msh <dig> in vivo and show that expression of this gene is necessary for wild-type levels of fertility.
quantitative real-time pcr revealed several t <dig> lines with reduced msh <dig> expression.
investigating the bread wheat  ph <dig>  locus has identified numerous candidate genes that may have a role in controlling such processes, including tamsh <dig>  a plant specific member of the dna mismatch repair family.
positive segregants from two t <dig> lines studied in detail showed reduced msh <dig> expression when compared to transformed controls and null segregants.
in both t <dig> lines, reduced seed set in positive segregants was observed.
chromosome pairing, recombination and dna repair are essential processes during meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms.
sequencing of the three msh <dig> genes, located on the short arms of wheat chromosomes 3a, 3b and 3d, has revealed no significant sequence divergence at the amino acid level suggesting conservation of function across the homoeogroups.
