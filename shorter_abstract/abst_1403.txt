we have succeeded in employing additional knowledge through adding unannotated data points, while responding to the inherent noise of this method by imposing an automated, rule-based pre-selection step.
in this framework, the annotated data is used to find plausible candidates for positive data points, which are included in the machine learning process.
we find a considerable improvement in recall compared to the baseline system.
