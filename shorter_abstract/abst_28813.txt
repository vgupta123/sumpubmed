our study was carried out on serum samples from  <dig> rams from the south of france where the disease is enzootic.
the standard serological test to detect b. ovis infection in rams is the complement fixation test , which has imperfect sensitivity and specificity in addition to technical drawbacks.
the high sensitivity and acceptable specificity of this i-elisa kit support its potential interest to avoid the limitations of cft.
after optimising the cut-off values in order to avoid doubtful results without deteriorating the concordance between the results of the two tests, the i-elisa appeared to be slightly more sensitive than cft  compared to se cft =  <dig>  , 95% cri).
the parallel association increased sequence sensitivity, thus appearing more suitable for eradicating the disease in infected flocks.
other available tests include the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  but no i-elisa kit has been fully evaluated.
the study aimed to compare an i-elisa kit and the standard cft.
a bayesian approach was used to estimate tests characteristics .
the choice of test sequence and interpretation criteria depends on the epidemiological context, screening objectives and the financial and practical constraints.
however, cft was slightly more specific than i-elisa  compared to sp i-elisa = <dig>  , 95% cri).
brucella ovis causes an infectious disease responsible for infertility and subsequent economic losses in sheep production.
