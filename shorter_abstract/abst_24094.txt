thp- <dig> cells infected with recombinant ms expressing pkng , showed significant reduction in pkcα expression.
based on our earlier study, we have extrapolated for the first time that knockdown of pkcα, impairs phagocytosis of mycobacteria by macrophages while their intracellular survival is drastically increased.
since pkng is uniquely expressed in bcg, ra, rv but not in ms and has been reported to promote intracellular survival of mycobacteria, led us to believe that pkng may be involved in such downregulation of pkcα.
all together, our data reveal a mechanism that shows substantial interdependence of pkcα with pkng, in sustaining mycobacterial infection.
the results strongly demonstrate that pathogenic mycobacteria recognize and then inhibit pkcα to circumvent phagocytosis and the hostile environment of macrophages.
intracellular trafficking of mycobacteria is comprehensively dependent on the unusual regulation of host proteins.
