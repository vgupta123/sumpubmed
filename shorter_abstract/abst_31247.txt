the whole genome of the strain was sequenced  and the draft genome was annotated.
whose 16s rdna is 99% identical to the respective nucleotide sequence of the recently published strain f. guangzhouensis.
francisella isolates from patients suffering from tularemia in germany are generally strains of the species f. tularensis subsp.
since w12- <dig> exhibits a putative new type-vi secretion system and f. tularensis subsp.
to our knowledge, no other francisella species are known for germany.
recently, a new francisella species could be isolated from a water reservoir of a cooling tower in germany.
further research is needed to investigate the epidemiology, ecology and pathogenicity of francisella species present in germany.
the overall sequence identity of the fopa, gyra, rpoa, groel, sdha and dnak genes is only 89%, indicating that strain w12- <dig> is not identical to f. guangzhouensis.
isolate w12- <dig> is closely related to the recently described f. guangzhouensis species and it replicates within eukaryotic host cells.
the growth optimum of the isolate is approximately 30°c, it can grow in the presence of 4–5% nacl  and is able to grow without additional cysteine within the medium.
holarctica was found not to be the sole species in germany, the new isolate is an interesting species to be analyzed in more detail.
various virulence genes common to the genus francisella are present, but the francisella pathogenicity island  is missing.
w12- <dig> was isolated from a water reservoir of a cooling tower of a hospital in germany.
