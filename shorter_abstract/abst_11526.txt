we provide evidence that dietary changes alone are sufficient to alter notch signalling and reversibly change niche size in the adult in wild type flies.
notch can act in cap cells to prevent their loss while activation of notch in the flanking escort cells results in expansion of the niche.
notch signalling in cap and escort cells is similarly reduced and restored by dietary shifts to nutrient poor and rich media.
we show that the drosophila ovary gsc cap cell niche is a dynamic structure, which can contract and expand in fluctuating dietary conditions.
these findings reveal an unexpected reversible plasticity of the gsc niche whose responses provide an integrated read out of the physiological status of the fly that is modulated by diet and age.
in old flies decreased notch signalling is associated with decreased robustness of the niche to dietary changes.
previous studies have shown a strong link between diet and the regulation of oogenesis, making this a useful model system in which to investigate dietary regulation of the niche and its associated stem cells.
the drosophila ovary germline stem cell  niche is a well-studied model, which is comprised of cap cells that provide anchorage and maintenance signals for gscs to maintain oogenesis.
cap cells are lost when adult flies are shifted to nutrient poor diet and are restored after returning flies to nutrient-rich medium.
we show notch acts in different cells to maintain and re-expand the niche and propose a model in which cell fate transitions between cap cells and flanking somatic cells accounts for niche dynamics.
changes in niche size were not associated with apoptosis or cell division.
stem cells can respond to environmental and physiological inputs to adaptively remodel tissues.
