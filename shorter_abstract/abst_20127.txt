an essential requirement is the access to the complete biochemical knowledge - especially on the biochemical reactions.
since the available databases differ in the number of biochemical reactions and the annotation of the reactions, an integrated knowledge resource would be of great value.
currently, it comprises  <dig>  unique biochemical reactions.
this knowledge is extracted from the scientific literature and collected in biological databases.
as source databases the biochemical databases brenda, kegg, and metacyc were used.
we developed a comprehensive non-redundant reaction database containing known enzyme-catalyzed and spontaneous reactions.
an integrated non-redundant reaction database has been developed and is made available to users.
