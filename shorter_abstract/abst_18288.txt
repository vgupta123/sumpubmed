our results show significant evidence, for instance, for inhibitory mechanisms between the transcription factors and reveal a previously unknown dependency between the dosage of the inducing cytokine tgf Î² and the expression of the master regulator of competing  regulatory t cell lineage.
we develop an integrative modeling framework which combines rna sequencing data with mathematical modeling and enables us to construct a mechanistic model for the core th <dig> regulatory network in a data-driven manner.
while the inducing cytokine signals and core transcription factors driving the differentiation towards th <dig> lineage are well known, detailed mechanistic interactions between the key components are poorly understood.
the differentiation of naive cd 4+ helper t  cells into effector th <dig> cells is steered by extracellular cytokines that activate and control the lineage specific transcriptional program.
