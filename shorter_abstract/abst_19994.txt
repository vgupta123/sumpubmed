compression resulted in reduced table sizes but resulted in no significant difference in the total execution time for neighbour discovery.
the spatial indexing scheme significantly decreases the time taken to calculate atomic contacts and could be applied to other multidimensional neighbor discovery problems.
we investigate the effects of compression of the trajectory coordinate tables with different options of data and index compression within ms sql server  <dig>
using page compression for the atomic coordinate tables and indexes saves ~36% of disk space without any significant decrease in calculation time and should be considered for other non-transactional databases in ms sql server  <dig>
the speed up enables on-the-fly calculation and visualization of contacts and rapid cross simulation analysis for knowledge discovery.
