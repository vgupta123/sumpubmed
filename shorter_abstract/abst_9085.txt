wild-type strains and their respective m <dig> mutants were indistinguishable with respect to the phenotypes of autoagglutination, serum resistance, iron acquisition from human lactoferrin, adherence to and invasion of respiratory tract epithelial cells, and proinflammatory stimulation of human monocytes.
the aim of this study was  to characterize the potential roles of m <dig> in the host-pathogen interactions considering the known multifunctionality of porins and  to characterize the degree of conservation in the phylogenetic older subpopulation  of m. catarrhalis.
however, immunoblot analysis of human saliva suggests the possibility of antigenic variation of immunoreactive epitopes, which warrants further analysis before m <dig> can be considered a potential vaccine candidate.
differences in the mic  between wild-type and mutant strains were found for eight antibiotics.
the presence of iga antibodies in healthy human donors indicates that m <dig> is expressed in vivo and recognized as a mucosal antigen by the human host.
