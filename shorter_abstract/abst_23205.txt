the sequences and expression levels of candidate lncrnas that shared conserved sequences among birds were validated by qpcr in both zebra finch and chicken.
these avian incrnas share similar characteristics with lncrnas in mammals, such as shorter transcript length, lower exon number, lower average expression level and less sequence conservation than mrnas.
to identify incrnas expressed during feather development, we analyzed single-stranded rna-seq  data from the anterior and posterior dorsal regions during zebra finch  embryonic development.

using published transcriptomic data, we further analyzed the evolutionary conservation of incrnas in birds and amniotes.
our study provides the first systematical identification of avian lncrnas using ssrna-seq analysis and offers a resource of embryonically expressed lncrnas in zebra finch.
