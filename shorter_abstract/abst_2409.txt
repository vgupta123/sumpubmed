finally, a set of  <dig> multiplex panels containing the  <dig> most informative markers was validated and proposed for b. ruziziensis genetic analysis.
brachiaria ruziziensis is one of the most important forage species planted in the tropics.
in this study, we present a first validated set of ssr markers for brachiaria ruziziensis, selected from a de novo partial genome assembly of single-end illumina reads.
the developed markers are readily suitable for genetic analysis and marker assisted selection of brachiaria ruziziensis.
recently, next-generation sequencing technologies have been applied to generate sequence data for the identification of microsatellite regions and primer design.
however, there is a complete lack of information about the b. ruziziensis genome.
the use of this approach for microsatellite marker development is promising for species with limited genomic information, whose breeding programs would benefit from the use of genomic tools.
a total of  <dig>  perfect microsatellite loci were detected in contigs with a minimum 10x coverage.
the application of genomic tools to aid the selection of superior genotypes can provide support to b. ruziziensis breeding programs.
we selected a set of  <dig> microsatellite loci identified in contigs with minimum 100x coverage for primer design and synthesis, and tested a subset of  <dig> primer pairs,  <dig> of which were polymorphic on  <dig> representative b. ruziziensis accessions.
descriptive statistics for these primer pairs are presented, as well as estimates of marker transferability to other relevant brachiaria species.
we show that the detection and development of microsatellite markers from genome assembled illumina single-end dna sequences is highly efficient.
also, the availability of genomic tools, such as molecular markers, to support b. ruziziensis breeding programs is rather limited.
to our knowledge, this is the first set of microsatellite markers developed for this important species.
