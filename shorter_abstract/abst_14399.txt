trb expression initiated during g <dig> in progenitor cells, concomitant with neurod and otx <dig>  which are expressed in early photoreceptor cells.
the first wave occurred as progenitor cells began to make photoreceptors, the second as some cell types adopted a more mature location and differentiation state, and the third as m√ºller glia were generated.
these dynamic patterns suggest that th is playing several roles in retinal development, both within the cycling progenitor cells and possibly with respect to the timing of differentiation of photoreceptor cells.
trb was expressed in photoreceptor cells for several days and then was reduced in expression level, as the expression of crx, a later photoreceptor gene, became more evident.
dio <dig> appeared transiently in a ventral  to dorsal gradient, likely in a subset of photoreceptor cells.
the cell types expressing the components, as well as the kinetics of expression within the cell cycle, were defined.
dio <dig> was expressed throughout the cell cycle in progenitor cells.
multiple th components were expressed in dynamic patterns in cycling progenitor cells and photoreceptors cells across the developing chick retina.
in the current work, the expression of these th components was examined in the chick retina over time.
