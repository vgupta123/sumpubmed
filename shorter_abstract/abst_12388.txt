nonetheless, constructing the 13c-mfa model and performing flux calculation are demanding for new learners, because they require knowledge of metabolic networks, carbon transitions, and computer programming.
to facilitate and standardize the 13c-mfa modeling work, we set out to publish a user-friendly and programming-free platform  for flux calculations in matlab®.
wuflux also offers several ways of visualizing the flux results with respect to the constructed network.
to validate our model’s applicability, we have compared and discussed the flux results obtained from wuflux and other mfa software.
we have also illustrated how model constraints of cofactor and atp balances influence fluxome results.
using guide  in matlab, we built a user interface that allows users to modify models based on their own experimental conditions.
flux analyses, including flux balance analysis  and 13c-metabolic flux analysis , offer direct insights into cell metabolism, and have been widely used to characterize model and non-model microbial species.
we will continue documenting curated models of non-model microbial species and improving wuflux performance.
wuflux is capable of directly correcting mass spectrum data of tbdms -derivatized proteinogenic amino acids by removing background noise.
