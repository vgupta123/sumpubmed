its principle advantages are modelling flexibility and computational efficiency.
it is open source and object-oriented.
because, unlike coalescent simulators, it works forwards through time, it allows complex scenarios of selection, demography, and recombination to be modelled simultaneously.
fregene simulates sequence-level data over large genomic regions in large populations.
fregene and the simulated datasets will be valuable for assessing the validity of models for selection, demography and population genetic parameters, as well as the efficacy of association studies.
