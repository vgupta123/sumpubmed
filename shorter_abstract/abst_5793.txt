polyadenylation is a key regulatory step in eukaryotic gene expression and one of the major contributors of transcriptome diversity.
by profiling polyadenylation events in  <dig> human tissues, we found that alternative cleavage and polyadenylation  is prevalent in both protein-coding and noncoding genes.
this study provides a comprehensive resource to uncover regulated polyadenylation events in human tissues and to characterize the underlying regulatory mechanism.
strikingly, the results showed that different tissues exhibit distinct patterns of shortening and/or lengthening of 3â€² untranslated regions, suggesting the intimate involvement of apa in establishing tissue or cell identity.
aberrant polyadenylation often associates with expression defects and leads to human diseases.
in addition, apa usage, similar to gene expression profiling, exhibits tissue-specific signatures and is sufficient for determining tissue origin.
