the prevalence of anatomic components of baos was: elongated soft palate , stenotic nares , everted laryngeal saccules  and tracheal hypoplasia .
the objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between anatomical components, clinical signs and several biomarkers, used to determine systemic inflammation and myocardial damage , in dogs with brachycephalic upper airway obstructive syndrome .
some degree of myocardial damage may occur in dogs with baos that can be detected by ctni concentration.
dogs with everted laryngeal saccules had more severe respiratory signs  and higher values of crp .
according to the low percentage of patients with elevated levels of crp and hp, baos does not seem to cause an evident systemic inflammatory status.
fifty brachycephalic dogs were included in the study and the following information was studied: signalment, clinical signs, thoracic radiographs, blood work, ecg, components of baos, and crp, hp and ctni levels.
no other statistical association between biomarkers levels and severity of clinical signs was found.
brachycephalic dogs have unique upper respiratory anatomy with abnormal breathing patterns similar to those in humans with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome .
