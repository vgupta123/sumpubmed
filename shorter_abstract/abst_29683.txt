however, it is still not trivial to identify lncrnas from the rna-seq data and it remains a challenge to uncover their functions.
we identified  <dig> novel lncrna candidates, which have shorter transcript length, fewer exons, shorter putative open reading frame, compared with known protein-coding transcripts.
we present a computational pipeline for detecting novel lncrnas from the rna-seq data.
after that, novel lncrnas are detected by further filtering known transcripts and those with high protein coding potential, using a newly developed program called lncrscan.
we applied our pipeline to a mouse klf <dig> knockout dataset, and discussed the plausible functions of the novel lncrnas we detected by differential expression analysis.
our method can predict a set of novel lncrnas from the rna-seq data.
some of the lncrnas are showed differentially expressed between the wild-type and klf <dig> knockout strains, suggested that those novel lncrnas can be given high priority in further functional studies.
the possible partial transcripts and artefacts are filtered according to the quantified expression level.
of the lncrnas,  <dig> large intergenic ncrnas  show lower expression level than the protein-coding ones and  <dig> lncrnas represent significant differential expression between the wild-type and klf <dig> knockout conditions.
study on long non-coding rnas  has been promoted by high-throughput rna sequencing .
first, the genome-guided transcriptome reconstruction is used to generate initially assembled transcripts.
