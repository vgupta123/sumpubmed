here, we tested the hypothesis that similar treatments would alter in vitro gene expression associated with neurological disorders  in human neuronal cells.
preliminary studies in our laboratory identified gene sets associated with neuronal systems and human neurological disorders that were significantly enriched after treating fish brains with psychoactive pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations.
moreover, we observed that altered expression profiles in human cells were similar to gene expression profiles previously identified in fish brains.
psychoactive pharmaceuticals have been considered as potential environmental contaminants as they are detected in the drinking water at very low concentrations.
genetic factors such as mutations, insertions, deletions and copy number variations  are responsible for only a small subset of cases, suggesting unknown environmental contaminants play a role in triggering neurological disorders like idiopathic autism.
these expression patterns were associated with potential neurological disorders including autism, suggested psychoactive pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations might mimic, aggravate, or induce neurological disorders.
we found that psychoactive pharmaceuticals and valproate significantly altered neuronal gene sets associated with human neurological disorders .
psychoactive pharmaceuticals at environmental concentrations altered in vitro gene expression profiles of neuronal growth, development and regulation.
a number of researchers have speculated that neurological disorders are mostly due to the interaction of common susceptibility genes with environmental, epigenetic and stochastic factors.
