furthermore, we confirmed these candidate ltbi-related mirnas in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with ltbi and in healthy control individuals.
the expression level of four mirnas  in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples from ltbi and healthy participants reflected the altered patterns observed in the microarray profile.
the results suggest that mirna expression may play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of ltbi, and this would increase our understanding of the molecular basis of hsp <dig> -facilitated mtb survival in macrophages.
functional annotation prediction of mirna target genes and pathway enrichment analyses were used to explore the putative links between these mirnas and ltbi.
the aim of this study was to delineate ltbi-related mirna expression in u <dig> macrophages expressing mtb hsp <dig>  protein.
analysis of the mirna expression profile identified  <dig> mirnas that were differentially expressed in u <dig> macrophages expressing mtb hsp <dig>  compared with the control expressing gfp.
