the ts score allows us to better investigate functional roles of different isoforms expressed in multi transcript genes.
from this analysis, we find that isoforms with high ts scores have sequence feature changes consistent with more deterministic splicing and functional changes and tend to gain domains or whole exons which could carry additional functions.
based on the ts score we develop a transcript annotations pipeline for alternative splicing  that identifies functional neighbourhoods of potentially interesting isoforms.
in complex metazoans a given gene frequently codes for multiple protein isoforms, through processes such as alternative splicing.
large scale functional annotation of these isoforms is a key challenge for functional genomics.
furthermore these functions appear to be particularly important for essential regulatory roles, establishing functional isoform switching as key for regulatory processes.
we have identified a subset of protein isoforms which appear to have high functional significance, particularly in regulation.
in this study we implement a time-course switch  score for ranking isoforms by their likelihood of producing additional functions based on their developmental expression profiles, as reported by modencode.
in turn the tools allow us to better characterise the regulatory functions of alternative splicing in more detail.
the methods and analyses we present here represent important first steps in the development of tools to address the near complete lack of isoform specific function annotation.
