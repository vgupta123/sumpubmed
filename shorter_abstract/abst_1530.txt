this study was planned to assess the discriminatory power of each mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit -variable number tandem repeats  locus and evaluate the most appropriate combination of miru-vntr loci for molecular epidemiological studies on sika deer in china.
of the loci tested, the four highly discriminative loci and eight moderately discriminative loci proved to be most appropriate for first line typing of m. bovis from sika deer, with the same resolving ability as all  <dig> loci .
the discriminatory power of miru-vntr typing based on  <dig> known loci  were assessed in 96 mycobacterium bovis strains collected sequentially from sika deer at a slaughterhouse in northeastern china.
bovine tuberculosis has led to serious economic losses for sika deer producers in china.
miru-vntr typing is quick and effective for typing bovine tuberculosis isolates from sika deer in china.
