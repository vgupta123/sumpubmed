we have previously shown that ep <dig> receptor deletion aggravates ich-induced brain injury and impairs functional recovery, thus the current study aimed to elaborate on these results by including a pharmacologic approach targeting the ep <dig> receptor.
in agreement with our previous results, selective antagonism of the ep <dig> receptor aggravated ich-induced brain injury.
inflammation following intracerebral hemorrhage  significantly contributes to secondary brain damage and poor outcomes.
following ich, mice treated with the antagonist displayed increased ferric iron  and cortical microgliosis , whereas treatment with the agonist decreased cortical  and striatal  astrogliosis, leukocyte transendothelial migratory potential , neutrophil infiltration , and blood brain barrier breakdown .
chronic post-treatment with the selective ep <dig> receptor antagonist, sc- <dig>  increased lesion volume by  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and treatment with the ep <dig> agonist, 17-pt-pge <dig>  improved neuromuscular functional recovery on grip strength  and hanging wire  behavioral testing.
inhibition of cox- <dig> activity has been reported to attenuate ich-induced brain injury; however, the clinical utility of such drugs is limited due to the potential for severe side effects.
to begin identifying the mechanisms involved in ep1-mediated neuroprotection after ich, histology was performed to assess ferric iron content, neuroinflammation, leukocyte transendothelial migratory potential, and peripheral neutrophil and immunoglobulin infiltration.
furthermore, ep <dig> receptor agonism improved anatomical outcomes and functional recovery.
prostaglandin e <dig>  is known to modulate neuroinflammatory responses and is upregulated in response to brain injury as a result of changes in inducible cyclooxygenase  <dig>  and the membrane-bound type of pge synthase.
