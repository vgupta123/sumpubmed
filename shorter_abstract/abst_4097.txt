the model can be used to simulate both spotted two-channel and oligonucleotide based single-channel microarrays.
as a result, a need for effective computational methods for data analysis has emerged.
we present a microarray simulation model which can be used to validate different kinds of data analysis algorithms.
all this makes the model a valuable tool for example in validation of data analysis algorithms.
the proposed microarray simulation model is modular and can be used in different kinds of applications.
it includes several error models that have been proposed earlier and it can be used with different types of input data.
to overcome this fundamental problem, the use of simulated microarray data for algorithm validation has been proposed.
the proposed model is unique in the sense that it includes all the steps that affect the quality of real microarray data.
after all these steps are taken into account, the simulated data has realistic biological and statistical characteristics.
these steps include the simulation of biological ground truth data, applying biological and measurement technology specific error models, and finally simulating the microarray slide manufacturing and hybridization.
