by contrast, there was no significant difference between the evolved lines and their ancestor in mortality during prolonged freezing.
in order to study the dynamics of evolutionary change,  <dig> populations of e. coli b were serially propagated for  <dig>  generations in minimal glucose medium at constant 37째c.
correlated changes in various other traits have been previously associated with the improvement in competitive fitness in the selective environment.
those lines that had evolved higher competitive fitness in the minimal glucose medium at 37째c also had higher mortality during freeze-thaw cycles.
this study examines whether these evolved lines changed in their ability to tolerate the stresses of prolonged freezing and repeated freeze-thaw cycles during adaptation to a benign environment.
all  <dig> lines that evolved in the benign environment for  <dig>  generations are more sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles than their ancestor.
the evolved lines have an average mortality rate of 54% per daily cycle, compared to the ancestral rate of 34%.
the consistency of the evolutionary declines in freeze-thaw tolerance, the correlation between fitness in glucose medium at 37째c and mortality during freeze-thaw cycles, and the absence of greater declines in freeze-thaw survival among the hypermutable lines all indicate a trade-off between performance in minimal glucose medium at 37째c and the capacity to tolerate this stress.
there was also some variability among the evolved lines in susceptibility to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
