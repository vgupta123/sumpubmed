our procedure showed high recall and precision with f-measures of  <dig>  for yeast and  <dig> / <dig>  for mouse in the biocreative assessment  and  <dig>  for fly in a post-evaluation.
we present a simple and efficient approach that identifies gene and protein names in texts and returns database identifiers for matches.
rule-based and support vector machine-based post filters were designed and applied to improve precision.
the lists were then extensively curated in largely automated procedure and matched against medline abstracts by exact text matching.
the results were close to the best over all submissions.
by automatically identifying gene and gene product  names and mapping these to unique database identifiers, it becomes possible to extract and integrate information from articles and various data sources.
our approach is based on the use of synonym lists that map the unique database identifiers for each gene/protein to the different synonym names.
for yeast and mouse, synonym lists were used as provided by the organizers who generated them from public model organism databases.
the synonym list for fly was generated directly from the corresponding organism database.
here, the support vector machine-based post filter proved to be very effective.
