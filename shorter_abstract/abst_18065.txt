the crystal structure of pvpnp is described and is seen to have many features in common with the previously reported structure of pfpnp.
the crystal structure of a complex of pfpnp co-crystallised with inosine and arsenate is also described, and is found to contain a mixture of products and reactants â€“ hypoxanthine, ribose and arsenate.
these reveal an unusual form of substrate activation by 2'-deoxyinosine of pvpnp, but not pfpnp.
most human malaria results from infection either by plasmodium falciparum , the deadliest form of the parasite, or by the widespread plasmodium vivax .
the ribose c1' in this hybrid complex lies close to the expected point of symmetry along the pnp reaction coordinate, consistent with a conformation between the transition and product states.
purine nucleoside phosphorylase  is central to purine salvage mechanisms in plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malaria.
however, despite these similarities, there are also small differences in the activities of the two plasmodium enzymes.
