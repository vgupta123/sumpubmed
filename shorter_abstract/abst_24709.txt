functional analysis of ge patterns is a daunting task as it requires often recourse to the public repositories of biological knowledge.
kpp provides fast and comprehensive visualization of the global ge changes by consolidating a list of the color-coded candidate genes into the kegg pathways.
kpp paints pathways from the kegg database using large sets of the candidate genes accompanied by "overexpressed" or "underexpressed" marks, for example, those generated by microarrays or mirna profilings.
high-throughput technologies became common tools to decipher genome-wide changes of gene expression  patterns.
on the other hand, in many cases researcher's inquiry can be served by a comprehensive glimpse.
rapid mapping of the differentially expressed genes to the kegg pathways may provide an idea about the functional relevance of the gene lists corresponding to the high-throughput expression data.
the kegg pathway database is a compilation of manually verified maps of biological interactions represented by the complete set of pathways related to signal transduction and other cellular processes.
