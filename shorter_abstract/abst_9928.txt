in contrast, pspa clade was not related to serotype, age or clinical origin of the isolates.
the aim of this study was to analyze the pspa family and clade distribution among  <dig> spanish pneumococci representatives of dominant clones among patients with invasive disease  and nasopharyngeal healthy carriage in children .
pspa family  <dig> was predominant among invasive  and carriage  pneumococcal isolates.
no pspa family  <dig> isolates were detected and only one strain was pspa negative.
pspa family  <dig> and family  <dig> were dominant among major spanish pneumococcal clones isolated from patients with invasive disease and nasopharyngeal carriage in children.
clades  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were associated with a wide variety of sequence types  related to multiresistant and antibiotic-susceptible worldwide-disseminated clones.
although four clonal complexes contained strains of different clades, a clear association between clade and multi locus sequence typing results was found.
pspa clades were associated with genotypes.
