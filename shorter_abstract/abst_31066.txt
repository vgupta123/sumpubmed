an array of experimental models have been developed in the small model organisms c. elegans, s. cerevisiae and d. melanogaster for the study of various neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, and expanded polyglutamine diseases as exemplified by huntington's disease  and related ataxias.
we carried out an integrated analysis using c. elegans as the baseline model organism since this is the most widely studied in this context.
of these  <dig> were separate genes with orthologues in c. elegans.
the published data covers distinct models in all three organisms and one important question is the extent to which shared genetic factors can be uncovered that affect several or all disease models.
we identified a significant number of overlapping regulators of neurodegenerative disease models.
of the common genetic regulators some such as chaperones, ubiquitin-related enzymes  and histone deacetylases were involved in expected pathways whereas others such as the peroxisomal acyl coa-oxidase suggest novel targets for neurodegenerative disease therapy
combination of data from  <dig> published studies using small to large scale screens in all three small model organisms gave a total of  <dig> identifications of genetic regulators.
in addition,  <dig> of these genes, which all had human orthologues, were found to overlap across studies.
since the diseases have, as an underlying feature, protein aggregation phenotypes it was not surprising that some of the overlapping genes encode proteins involved in protein folding and protein degradation.
genetic approaches to determine the nature of regulators of the disease phenotypes have ranged from small scale to essentially whole genome screens.
