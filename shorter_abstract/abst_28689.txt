in situ hybridization revealed that amitgα <dig>  amitgβ <dig>  and amitgβ <dig> are expressed in the presumptive endoderm during gastrulation.
during early development in acropora, the expression patterns of the three known integrins parallel those of amphibian and echinoderm integrins.
investigation of the integrin repertoire of anthozoan cnidarians such as the coral acropora millepora is required to test this hypothesis and may provide insights into the original roles of these molecules.
a second anthozoan, the sea anemone nematostella vectensis, has at least four β integrins, two resembling amitgβ <dig> and two like amitgβ <dig>  and at least three α integrins, based on its genomic sequence.
amitgα <dig> shows features characteristic of α integrins lacking an i-domain, but phylogenetic analysis gives no clear indication of its likely binding specificity.
it has been suggested that caenorhabditis elegans, which has a single β and two α integrins, might reflect the ancestral integrin complement.
adhesion mediated through the integrin family of cell surface receptors is central to early development throughout the metazoa, playing key roles in cell-extra cellular matrix adhesion and modulation of cadherin activity during the convergence and extension movements of gastrulation.
two novel integrins were identified in acropora.
first, the cnidarian integrin repertoire is more complex than predicted: at least two βs in acropora, and at least three αs and four βs in nematostella.
