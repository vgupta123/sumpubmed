analysis of epidermal cell surface structure of vegetative tissues and perianth organs using scanning electron microscopy revealed that in wild-type flowers the outer whorls of colored organs may be identified as sepals, while the inner ones may be identified as petals.
the uppermost whorl of green leaves represents bracts in both flower types.
in order to clarify basic questions of flower organ identity in general and stamen loss in detail, a study of the wild-type and the 'bud-flowering' flower type of c. vulgaris was initiated.
in addition, two mads-box genes  were identified in c. vulgaris using race-pcr.
organ identity in both wild-type and 'bud-flowering' c. vulgaris was clarified using a combination of microscopic and molecular methods.
our results for bract, sepal and petal organ identity are supported by the 'abcde model'.
the ornamental crop calluna vulgaris is of increasing importance to the horticultural industry in the northern hemisphere due to a flower organ mutation: the flowers of the 'bud-flowering' phenotype remain closed i.e.
however, loss of stamens in the 'bud-flowering' phenotype is an exceptional flower organ modification that cannot be explained by modified spatial expression of known organ identity genes.
both, petals and stamens, are completely missing in this flower type.
these experiments revealed an expression pattern supporting the organ classification based on morphological characteristics.
