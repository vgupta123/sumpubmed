in terms of above-ground biomass, the hybrid yield was not significantly different than that of n. tabacum in the field.
this hybrid system for biomanufacturing would optimally be used where n. glauca is not present and in physical isolation of n. tabacum production to provide total bioconfinement.
hybrid pollen was capable of germination in vitro, albeit with a very low frequency and with significant differences between plants.
similar conclusions about hybrid fertility were drawn from greenhouse crosses.
we genetically tagged hybrids with green fluorescent protein , which was used as a visual marker to enable gene flow tracking and quantification for field and greenhouse studies.
in two field experiments, one each in tennessee and kentucky, we detected outcrossing at only one location  at  <dig> %.
n. tabacum Ã— n. glauca hybrids show potential to contribute to a bioconfinement- and biomanufacturing host system.
analysis of dna content revealed significant genomic downsizing of the hybrid relative to that of n. tabacum.
hybrids exhibit extremely low fertility with no difference of green biomass yields relative to n. tabacum.
additionally, from  <dig> hybrid plants at each field site, formation of  <dig> and  <dig> seed was observed, respectively.
