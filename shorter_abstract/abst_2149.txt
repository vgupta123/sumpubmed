embedding in amber and pyritization are not always alternative modes of biological preservation during geological times, but double fossilization is possible under certain environmental conditions.
abundant pyritized vegetal debris have also been found inside the amber nuggets and the surrounding sediments.
microfossils are not only useful for elucidating biological macro- and microevolution but also the biogeochemical history of our planet.
this vegetal debris usually contained numerous pyrite framboids and very densely packed polycrystalline pyrite formations infilled with different elements of the secondary xylem.
permineralization was the main mode of pyritization.
entrapping in amber, a fossilized resin, is considered an alternative mode of biological preservation.
for the first time, the internal organization of 114-million-year-old microfossils entrapped in lower cretaceous amber is described and analyzed, using adapted scanning electron microscopy in backscattered electron mode in association with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy microanalysis.
anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria could play a crucial role in this microbial fossilization.
double fossilization of several protists included in diverse taxonomical groups and some vegetal debris is described and analyzed.
