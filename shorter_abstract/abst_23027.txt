the family member absent in melanoma  <dig>  binds cytosolic dna via its hin domain and initiates inflammasome formation via its pyrin domain.
phylogenetic analyses showed that aim <dig> hin-c and pyrin domains clearly diverge from the rest of the family, and it is the only pyhin protein with orthology across many species.
we hypothesise that defence of the genome against endogenous retroelements has been an additional evolutionary driver for pyhin proteins.
the role of aim <dig> in forming the inflammasome is relatively well understood, but molecular interactions of other pyhin proteins involved in defence against foreign dna remain to be defined.
the non-aim <dig> pyhin protein sequences are very distinct from aim <dig>  suggesting they vary in effector mechanism in response to foreign dna, and may bind different dna structures.
the other  <dig> mouse genes have arisen by duplication and rearrangement within the lineage, which has allowed some diversification in expression patterns.
the pyhin family has highly varied gene composition between mammalian species due to lineage-specific duplication and loss, which probably indicates different adaptations for fighting infectious disease.
a single hin domain appears to have evolved in the common ancestor of marsupials and placental mammals, and duplicated to give rise to three distinct forms  in the placental mammal ancestor.
placental mammals show variable family expansions, from one gene in cow to four in human and  <dig> in mouse.
proteins of the mammalian pyhin  family are involved in defence against infection through recognition of foreign dna.
to better understand the evolution, orthology and function of these genes, we have documented the range of pyhin genes present in representative mammalian species, and undertaken phylogenetic and expression analyses.
no pyhin genes are evident in non-mammals or monotremes, with a single member found in each of three marsupial genomes.
