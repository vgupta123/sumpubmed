with the exception of hek  <dig> cell transfection, nucleofection proved to be less toxic and more efficient at effectively delivering dna into the cells as determined by cell proliferation and gfp expression, respectively.
transient transfection efficiency in all the cell systems ranged from 40%-90%, with minimal toxicity and no apparent species specificity.
however, there are cell-type and species specific differences that need to be evaluated empirically to optimize the conditions for transfection efficiency and cell survival.
numerous chemical and physical approaches have been used to deliver the dna, but their efficacy has been variable and is highly dependent on the cell type to be transfected.
studies were undertaken to evaluate and compare the transfection efficacy of several chemical reagents to that of the electroporation/nucleofection system using both adherent cells  and cells in suspension .
