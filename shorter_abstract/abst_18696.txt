therefore, we investigated whether ptf1a promotes the fate of these two cell types or acts directly as a gabaergic subtype determination factor.
in ectodermal explant assays, ptf1a was found to be a potent inducer of the gabaergic subtype.
moreover, clonal analysis in the retina revealed that ptf1a overexpression leads to an increased ratio of gabaergic subtypes among the whole amacrine and horizontal cell population, highlighting its instructive capacity to promote this specific subtype of inhibitory neurons.
in this study, we examined the distribution of neurotransmitter subtypes following ptf1a gain and loss of function in the xenopus retina.
altogether, our results reveal for the first time in the retina a major player in the gabaergic versus glutamatergic cell specification genetic pathway.
in the spinal cord and cerebellum, the transcription factor ptf1a is essential for gabaergic neuron production.
finally, we also found that within bipolar cells, which are typically glutamatergic interneurons, ptf1a is able to trigger a gabaergic fate.
in recent years, considerable knowledge has been gained on the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal cell fate specification.
we found cell-autonomous dramatic switches between gabaergic and glutamatergic neuron production, concomitant with profound defects in the genesis of amacrine and horizontal cells, which are mainly gabaergic.
in particular, the molecular machinery governing the specification of the two most abundant neurotransmitter phenotypes in the retina, gabaergic and glutamatergic, is largely unknown.
in the mouse retina, ptf1a has been shown to be involved in horizontal and most amacrine neurons differentiation.
