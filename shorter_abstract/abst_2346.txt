midgut is the first barrier of xenobiotics peroral toxicity, in which coes may be involved in eliminating secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves and contaminants of insecticides in diet.
previous studies mainly used dipteran drosophila and mosquitoes as model organisms to investigate the roles of the insect coes in insecticide resistance.
sixty-one bmcoes were transcribed based on cdna/ests and microarray data.
generally, most of the coes showed tissue specific expressions and expression level between male and female did not display obvious differences.
b. mori has the largest number of insect coe genes characterized to date.
rt-pcr verified that the ode-like esterases were also highly expressed in larvae antenna and maxilla, and thus they may play important roles in degradation of plant volatiles or other xenobiotics.
our results provide some new insights into functions and evolutionary characteristics of coes in phytophagous insects.
midgut-, head and integument-, and silk gland-specific expressions.
it plays important roles in xenobiotic detoxification, and pheromone degradation, neurogenesis and regulating development.
expression evidence indicated that the expanded genes were specifically expressed in midgut, integument and head, implying that these genes may have important roles in detoxifying secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves, contaminants in diet, and odorants.
relative to other dipteran and hymenopteran insects, alpha-esterases were significantly expanded in the silkworm.
