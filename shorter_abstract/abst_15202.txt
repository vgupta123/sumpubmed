our  <dig> k del-mar chicken integrated systems microarray was used for transcriptional profiling in the hen's uterus during eggshell deposition.
many functional proteins are involved in calcium binding or biomineralization--prerequisites for interacting with the mineral phase during eggshell fabrication.
the eggshell constitutes a natural physical barrier against bacterial penetration if it forms correctly and remains intact.
a total of  <dig> transcripts were over-expressed in the uterus compared with the magnum or white isthmus across a wide range of abundance .
some of these uterine genes could prove useful as biological markers for genetic improvement of phenotypic traits .
a final group includes proteases and protease inhibitors that regulate protein activity in the acellular uterine fluid where eggshell formation takes place.
we have discovered a cache of about  <dig> functional genes and identified a large number of encoded proteins secreted into uterine fluid for fabrication of the eggshell and chemical protection of the egg.
the  <dig> highly-expressed uterine transcripts correspond to  <dig> unique genes, which encode  <dig> different proteins.
while another large group of proteins could be involved in proper folding of the eggshell matrix.
as uricoletic animals, chickens produce cleidoic eggs, which are self-contained bacteria-resistant biological packages for extra-uterine development of the chick embryo.
many secreted uterine proteins possess antibacterial properties, which would protect the egg against microbial invasion.
signal peptide sequence was found for  <dig> putative proteins secreted by the uterus during eggshell formation.
