this is in contrast to infection with the variant strain lcmvclone <dig>  which causes functional inactivation of effector t cells and viral persistence.
here we demonstrate that infection with lcmvclone <dig>  but not with lcmvarm, resulted in a steady increase in the serum levels of the immuno-inhibitory cytokine, il- <dig>  blockade of il- <dig> using neutralizing monoclonal antibody injections in lcmvclone13-infected mice led to dramatically enhanced effector t cell responses at  <dig> days post-infection.
infection of mice with the armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  leads to a robust immune response and efficient viral clearance.
our data suggest that il- <dig> plays an early role in lcmvclone13-induced tolerance, although other factors collaborate with il- <dig> to induce virus-specific tolerance.
even though il- <dig> blockade resulted in decreased viral titers, the generation and maintenance of memory t cells was still compromised.
the functional inactivation of cd8+ t cells in il-10-blocked, chronically infected mice  <dig> days post-infection was incomplete as potent ctl  could be generated by in vitro re-stimulation.
