we have compared the effective gene coverage in the mouse genome of different commercial and noncommercial oligonucleotide microarray platforms by performing an in-house gene annotation of probes.
gene coverage was estimated as the percentage of entrez genes with a unique position in the ucsc genome database that is tested by a given microarray platform.
arraygene allows easy comparisons of gene coverage between microarray platforms for any region of the genome.
the increasing use of dna microarrays for genetical genomics studies generates a need for platforms with complete coverage of the genome.
a mysql relational database was created to store the mapping information for  <dig>  mouse genes and for the probes in five microarray platforms : affymetrix <dig>  <dig>  , abi genome survey , agilent , codelink , sentrix ; and four array-ready oligosets: sigma , operon v. <dig> , operon v. <dig> , and meebo .
in order to make consistent comparisons between platforms, probes in each microarray were annotated with an entrez gene id and the chromosomal position for each gene was obtained from the ucsc genome browser database.
differences in the number of redundant and unspecific probes were also found among arrays.
the comparison presented here reveals that the commercial microarray sentrix, which is based on the meebo public oligoset, showed the best mouse genome coverage currently available.
