origins of fungus farming corresponded mainly with two periods of global warming in the cenozoic era, which were characterised by broadly distributed tropical forests.
phylogenetic analyses using bayesian or parsimony approaches placed the root of scolytinae close to the tribe scolytini and microborus, but otherwise indicated low resolution at older nodes.
sister group comparisons and test of independence between traits indicated that neither gregarious larval feeding nor regular inbreeding by sibling mating was strongly correlated with the origin of fungus farming.
