here, we report the construction of a porcine: human comparative map for pig  chromosome  <dig>  using the imnprh <dig> -rad porcine wg-rh panel, integrated with the imprh7000-rad wg-rh, genetic and bac fingerprinted contig  maps.
based on  <dig> porcine markers that have homologous sequences in the human genome, a detailed comparative map between ssc <dig> and human  chromosome   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was built.
this initial comparative rh map of ssc <dig> refines the syntenic regions between ssc <dig> and hsa <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it integrates the imnprh <dig> -rad and imprh <dig> -rad, genetic and bac fpc maps and provides a scaffold to close potential gaps between contigs prior to genome sequencing and assembly.
map vectors from the imnprh <dig> -rad and imprh <dig> -rad panels were merged to construct parallel framework  maps, within which fw markers common to both panels have an identical order.
a total of  <dig> markers, including  <dig> microsatellites ,  <dig> genes and ests, and  <dig> bac end sequences , were ordered within two linkage groups at two point  lod score of  <dig>  one linkage group covers ssc10p with accumulated map distances of  <dig>  cr <dig>  and  <dig>  cr <dig> , respectively.
the second group covers ssc10q at map distances of  <dig>  cr <dig>  and  <dig>  cr <dig> , yielding an overall average map resolution of  <dig>  kb/cr <dig>  or  <dig>  kb per marker on ssc <dig>  this represents a ~ <dig> -fold increase in map resolution over the imprh <dig> -rad panel.
