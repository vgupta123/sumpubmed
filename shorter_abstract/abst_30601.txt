the statistical significance for these feature selection results were comprehensively investigated.
the majority of ovarian cancer biomarker discovery efforts focus on the identification of proteins that can improve the predictive power of presently available diagnostic tests.
in this work, new approaches to automatic classification of metabolomic data produced from sera of ovarian cancer patients and benign controls are investigated.
utilizing lc/tof ms, sera from  <dig> ovarian cancer patients and  <dig> benign controls were studied.
optimum panels of spectral features observed in positive or/and negative ion mode electrospray  ms with the ability to distinguish between control and ovarian cancer samples were selected using state-of-the-art feature selection methods such as recursive feature elimination and l1-norm svm.
classification of the serum sample test set was over 90% accurate indicating promise that the above approach may lead to the development of an accurate and reliable metabolomic-based approach for detecting ovarian cancer.
three evaluation processes  were used to examine the svm models based on the selected panels in terms of their ability for differentiating control vs. disease serum samples.
