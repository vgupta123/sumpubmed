using an unsupervised consensus clustering method, we identified four major gene expression clusters, corresponding to central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, membrane integrity, immune function, and dna repair, all of which have dynamics which suggest regulation in a circadian manner.
because the liver is the primary regulator of metabolites within the mammalian body and the disruption of circadian rhythms in liver is associated with severe illness, circadian regulators would play a strong role in maintaining liver function.
however, the regulatory structure that governs circadian dynamics within the liver at a transcriptional level remains unknown.
all together, we were able to propose a regulatory structure for circadian regulation which represents alternative paths for circadian control of different functions within the liver.

furthermore, we also identified significant sets of clock tfs that are potentially transcriptional regulators of gene clusters.
the circadian clock is a critical regulator of biological functions controlling behavioral, physiological and biochemical processes.
with the assumption that transcription factors  that are differentially expressed and contain clock:bmal <dig> binding sites on their proximal promoters are likely to be clock-controlled tfs, we were able to use promoter analysis to putatively identify additional clock-controlled tfs besides parf and rora families.
