such analyses can be applied to several lists at once against many prior knowledge libraries of gene-lists associated with specific annotations.
to address this challenge it is desirable to compare the results from different related studies such as mrna expression microarrays, genome-wide chip-x, rnai screens, proteomics and phosphoproteomics experiments in a coherent global framework.
systems biologists are faced with the difficultly of analyzing results from large-scale studies that profile the activity of many genes, rnas and proteins, applied in different experiments, under different conditions, and reported in different publications.
lists2networks is a user friendly web-based software system expected to significantly ease the computational analysis process for experimental systems biologists employing high-throughput experiments at multiple layers of regulation.
the system includes web-based tools to manipulate lists with different set operations, to expand lists using existing mammalian networks of protein-protein interactions, co-expression correlation, or background knowledge co-annotation correlation, as well as to apply gene-list enrichment analyses against many gene-list libraries of prior biological knowledge such as pathways, gene ontology terms, kinase-substrate, microrna-mran, and protein-protein interactions, metabolites, and protein domains.
in addition, linking high-content multilayered experimental results with prior biological knowledge can be useful for identifying functional themes and form novel hypotheses.
