our results suggest that dzip <dig> is part of an rnp complex that occupies various subcellular locations.
dzip <dig>  has been described as a component of the hh signaling pathway with a putative regulatory role in ciliogenesis.
under oxidative stress conditions, dzip <dig> re-localized to stress granules.
polysomal profile analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation demonstrated the presence of dzip <dig> in the polysomal fraction.
the diversity of the mrnas associated with dzip <dig> suggests that this protein is a component of different rnps associated with translating polysomes and with rna granules.
dzip <dig> interacts with daz rna binding proteins in embryonic stem cells and human germ cells suggesting a role in mrna regulation.
dzip appears to be important for the formation of stress granules during the stress response.
we used immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies against dzip <dig> and microarray hybridization to identify mrnas associated with dzip <dig>  the genetic networks formed by the dzip1-associated mrnas were involved in cell cycle and gene expression regulation.
we investigated dzip <dig> function in hela cells and its involvement in ribonucleoprotein complexes.
the abundance of dzip1-associated mrnas increased with treatment; however, the silencing or overexpression of dzip <dig> in hela cells had no effect on the accumulation of the associated mrnas.
