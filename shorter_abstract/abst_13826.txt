little is known concerning the roles of rna structure in this important human pathogen.
this work identifies regions of the ebv genome likely to generate functional rnas and rna structures, provides structural models for these regions, and discusses potential functions suggested by the modeled structures.
this study provides the first comprehensive genome-wide survey of rna and rna structure in ebv.
novel ebv rnas and rna structures were identified by computational modeling and rna-seq analyses of ebv.
scans of the genomic sequences of four ebv strains  and of the closely related macacine herpesvirus  <dig> using the rnaz program discovered  <dig> regions with high probability of forming conserved rna structures.
enhanced understanding of the ebv transcriptome will guide future experimental analyses of the discovered rnas and rna structures.

epstein-barr virus  is a human herpesvirus implicated in cancer and autoimmune disorders.
the analysis of rna-seq data uncovered the first observation of a stable intronic sequence rna  in ebv.
