compared to the wgs results, the contiguity and quality of the fp assemblies were high, and they allowed us to fill wgs gaps resulting from repeats, low coverage, and allelic differences.
the software used for running the assembly process is available at http://research.scilifelab.se/andrej_alexeyenko/downloads/fpools/.
the fp contig sets were further merged with wgs data using a novel software package gam-ngs.
sampling genomes with fosmid vectors and sequencing of pooled fosmid libraries on the illumina platform for massive parallel sequencing is a novel and promising approach to optimizing the trade-off between sequencing costs and assembly quality.
in order to sequence the genome of norway spruce, which is of great size and complexity, we developed and applied a new technology based on the massive production, sequencing, and assembly of fosmid pools .
by exploiting fp technology, the first published assembly of a conifer genome was sequenced entirely with massively parallel sequencing.
