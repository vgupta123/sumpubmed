here we provide a comprehensive expression profile of b0at <dig> in mouse brain using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.
the vesicular b0at <dig> transporter , one of the members of the slc <dig> family, is a transporter for neutral amino acids and is exclusively expressed in brain.
this suggests that the b0at <dig> transporter have a role in regulation of monoaminergic as well as glutamatergic synapses.
b0at <dig> was highly expressed in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons.
