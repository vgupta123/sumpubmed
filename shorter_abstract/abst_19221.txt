antibody titers found in animals vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine based on bohv-1Δgeβgal was similar to the titers found for the control vaccine .
bohv-1Δgeβgal exhibited an evident attenuation when administered as a lav; no virus was detected in nasal secretions of vaccinated or sentinel animals during the post-vaccination period.
the aim of the present study was the development and evaluation of safety and efficacy of a glycoprotein e-deleted  bohv- <dig> marker vaccine strain  generated by homologous recombination, replacing the viral ge gene with the β-galactosidase  gene.
bohv-1Δgeβgal, when used in either formulation, elicited an efficient immune response that protected animals against challenge with virulent wild-type bohv- <dig>  also, the deletion of the ge gene served as an immunological marker to differentiate vaccinated animals from infected animals.
use of marker vaccines in ibr eradication programs is widely accepted since it allows for protection of the animals against the disease while adding the possibility of differentiating vaccinated from infected animals.
bohv-1Δgeβgal was highly immunogenic in both formulations, inducing specific humoral and cellular immune responses.
in the same way, titers of inactivated vaccine groups were significantly higher than any of the lav immunized groups, independently of the inoculation route .
