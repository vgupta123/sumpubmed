a cdna encoding a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids containing an n-terminal leucine zipper motif and a c-terminal eif5c domain was cloned from metamorphic larvae of helicoverpa armigera.
ha-eif5c expression was upregulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone .
quantitative real-time pcr  revealed a high expression of the mrna of ha-eif5c in the head-thorax, integument, midgut, and fat body during metamorphosis.
the orthologs of eukaryotic initiation factor 5c  are essential to the initiation of protein translation, and their regulation during development is not well known.
these results suggested that during metamorphosis of the cotton bollworm, ha-eif5c was upregulated by 20e through the ecr and usp transcription factors.
furthermore, the transcription of ha-eif5c was down regulated after silencing of ecdysteroid receptor  or ultraspiracle protein  by rnai.
immunohistochemistry suggested that ha-eif5c was distributed into both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the midgut, fat body and integument.
