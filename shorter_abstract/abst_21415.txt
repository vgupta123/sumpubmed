its function is mediated via the g-csf receptor, which was recently found to be expressed also in the central nervous system.
we found that the g-csf receptor is robustly expressed by rgcs in vivo and in vitro.
both routes of application reduced retinal ganglion cell death to a comparable extent.
here we used the retinal ganglion cell  axotomy model to compare effects of local and systemic application of neuroprotective molecules.
we thus show that g-csf neuroprotection is at least partially independent of potential systemic effects and provide further evidence that the clinically applicable g-csf could become a treatment option for both neurodegenerative diseases and glaucoma.
