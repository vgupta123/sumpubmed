mammalian antimicrobial peptides  are effectors of the innate immune response.
the results suggest a core set of transcription factors  that regulate the transcription of ampcg families in mouse, rat and human.
our large-scale computational analysis of promoters of  <dig> families of ampcgs across three mammalian species suggests that their key transcriptional regulators are likely to be tfs of the liver-, nervous system-specific and nhr groups.
we screened the promoter regions of ampcgs in the three species for motifs by an ab initio motif finding method and analyzed the derived promoter characteristics.
for many ampcgs the promoter elements and transcription factors that control their tissue cell-specific expression have yet to be fully identified and characterized.
the three most frequent core tfs groups include liver-, nervous system-specific and nuclear hormone receptors .
