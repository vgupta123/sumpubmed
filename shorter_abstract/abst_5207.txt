an enrichment test of biological processes  of differentially expressed genes  revealed that angiogenesis related bp categories significantly changed with cell passages.
developing a global functional association network among angiogenesis-related genes is much needed to facilitate holistic understanding of angiogenesis and to aid the development of more effective anti-angiogenesis therapeutics.
we constructed a comprehensive gene functional association network or interactome by transcript profiling an in vitro angiogenesis model, in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells  formed capillary structures when co-cultured with normal human dermal fibroblasts .
we established a comprehensive gene functional association network to model in vitro angiogenesis regulation.
huvec competence and nhdf supportiveness of cord formation were found to be highly cell-passage dependent.
simulated network perturbation correlated with observed anti-angiogenesis activity in a cord formation bioassay.
we developed a network walking algorithm to extract connectivity information from the interactome and applied it to simulate the level of network perturbation by three multi-targeted anti-angiogenic kinase inhibitors.
the present study provided a proof-of-concept pilot of applying network perturbation analysis to drug phenotypic activity assessment.
the interactome includes the involvement of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in angiogenesis.
disrupting one or even a few angiogenesis pathways is often insufficient to achieve sustained therapeutic benefits due to the complexity of angiogenesis.
tumor angiogenesis is a highly regulated process involving intercellular communication as well as the interactions of multiple downstream signal transduction pathways.
