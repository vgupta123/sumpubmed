these data thus suggest that, in contrast to which has been hypothesized for nucleotides, the lack of the r <dig> residue doesn't affect the binding of pranlukast a crucial role for r <dig> in binding of nucleotides to gpr <dig>  aromatic interactions are instead likely to play a predominant role in the recognition of pranlukast, suggesting that two different binding subsites are present on gpr <dig>
its exploitment as a target for novel neuro-reparative strategies depends on the elucidation of the molecular determinants driving binding of purinergic and leukotrienic ligands.
pulling forces developed to break polar and aromatic interactions of pranlukast were comparable.
in one of its preferential docking conformations, pranlukast tetrazole group is close to r <dig> and phenyl rings are placed into a subpocket highly conserved among gpcrs.
to support this hypothesis, steered md experiments showed that the energy required to unbind udp is higher for the wt receptor than for r255i.
no differences between the wt receptor and the r255i receptor were found for the unbinding of pranlukast.
md suggested that gpr <dig> nucleotide binding pocket is enclosed between the helical bundle and extracellular loop   <dig>  the driving interaction involves r <dig> and the udp phosphate moiety.
here, we applied docking and molecular dynamics simulations  to analyse the binding and the forced unbinding of two gpr <dig> ligands  receptor and a mutant model, where a basic residue hypothesized to be crucial for nucleotide binding had been mutated  to ile.
