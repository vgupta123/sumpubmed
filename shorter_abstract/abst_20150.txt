the analysis identifies situations: where a direct conversion is valid; where internal noise affecting the system needs to be taken into account; and where the propensity function must be mathematically adjusted.
indeed, efforts have been devoted to manipulating the chemical master equation  in order to achieve a proper propensity function for a reduced stochastic system.
the deterministic framework is assumed to be a generalized mass action system and the stochastic analogue is in the format of the chemical master equation.
we propose a rather general strategy for converting a deterministic process model into a corresponding stochastic model and characterize the mathematical connections between the two.
it would be valuable to adopt a similar reduction strategy to stochastic modelling.
the conversion from deterministic to stochastic models is illustrated with several representative examples, including reversible reactions with feedback controls, michaelis-menten enzyme kinetics, a genetic regulatory motif, and stochastic focusing.
the construction of a stochastic model for a biochemical network requires the utilization of information associated with an equation-based model.
the conversion strategy proposed here guides a model design process that ensures a valid transition between deterministic and stochastic models.
all other types of reaction processes, for instance those containing non-integer kinetic orders or following other types of kinetic laws, are assumed to be convertible to one of the three elementary kinds, so that ssa can validly be applied.
however, the conversion to elementary reactions is often difficult, if not impossible.
within deterministic contexts, a strategy of model reduction is often used.
