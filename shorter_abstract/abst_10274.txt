clinicians are using metagenomics to determine the role played by collection of microbial organisms within human body with respect to human health wellness and disease.
we also demonstrate practical significance of the developed algorithm by comparing bacterial diversity and structure across different skin locations.
we also compute different species diversity/richness metrics by utilizing otu assignment results to further extend our analysis.
we use lsh-based similarity function to cluster similar sequences and make individual groups, called operational taxonomic units .
advances in biotechnology have changed the manner of characterizing large populations of microbial communities that are ubiquitous across several environments.
