hammerhead ribozyme derivatives in which helix ii is reduced to a single g-c base pair cleave long rna substrates very efficiently in vitro.
a series of hammerhead ribozyme derivatives, varying in their hybridising arm length and size of helix ii, were tested in vitro for cleavage of rna derived from the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase ii gene of plasmodium falciparum.
against a 550-nt transcript the most efficient  was a miniribozyme with helix ii reduced to a single g-c base pair and with twelve nucleotides in each hybridising arm.
one derivative showed a 103-fold increase in serum stability and a doubling in cleavage efficiency compared to the unmodified miniribozyme.
miniribozymes of this general design were targeted to three further sites, and they demonstrated exceptional cleavage activity.
a series of chemically modified derivatives was prepared and examined for cleavage activity and stability in human serum.
using commonly available phosphoramidites and reagents, two patterns of nucleotide substitution in this derivative were identified which conferred both good cleavage activity against long rna targets and good stability in human serum.
despite having been extensively studied for  <dig> years or so, their wide application is hampered by their instability in biological media, and by the poor translation of cleavage studies on short substrates to long rna molecules.
hammerhead ribozymes are rna-based molecules which bind and cleave other rnas specifically.
