the three signatures had similar capabilities of predicting dmfs and added significant prognostic information to that provided by the classical parameters.
however, signatures were never compared on an independent population of untreated breast cancer patients, where risk assessment was computed using the original algorithms and microarray platforms.
we compared three gene expression signatures, the 70-gene, the 76-gene and the gene expression grade index  signatures, in terms of predicting distant metastasis free survival  for the individual patient.
during the last years, several groups have identified prognostic gene expression signatures with apparently similar performances.
despite the difference in development of these signatures and the limited overlap in gene identity, they showed similar prognostic performance, adding to the growing evidence that these prognostic signatures are of clinical relevance.
to this end, we used the previously published transbig independent validation series of node-negative untreated primary breast cancer patients.
when comparing the signatures two by two, the agreement in prediction was 71% for the 70- and 76-gene signatures, 76% for the 76-gene signature and the ggi, and 88% for the 70-gene signature and the ggi.
