the first library allowed residues to vary among a restricted set of six amino acids .
additional analysis of the d5-lib-ii functional population revealed position-specific biases for particular amino acids, many that differed from the identity of those side chains in d <dig>
here we explore side chain requirements for affinity and specificity in d <dig> using phage display.
together these results suggest that there is some permissiveness for alternative side chains in the lcdrs and hcdr <dig> of d <dig>  but that replacement with a minimal set of residues is not tolerated in this scaffold for 5-helix recognition.
we previously studied the interaction between antibody d <dig> and its target, a designed protein based on hiv- <dig> gp <dig> known as 5-helix, as a model system .
