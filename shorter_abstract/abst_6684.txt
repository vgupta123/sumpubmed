visualizing and analyzing large three dimensional images of intact tissue is a challenging task.
neural stem cells are motile and proliferative cells that undergo mitosis, dividing to produce daughter cells and ultimately generating differentiated neurons and glia.
there is a pressing need for 5-d image analysis and visualization tools to study cellular dynamics in the intact niche and to quantify the role that environmental factors play in determining cell fate.
understanding the mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation will play a key role in the emerging fields of regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics.
our application automatically segments, tracks, and lineages the image sequence data and then allows the user to view and edit the results of automated algorithms in a stereoscopic 3-d window while simultaneously viewing the stem cell lineage tree in a 2-d window.
we combine unsupervised image analysis algorithms with an interactive visualization of the results.
using the gpu to store and render the image sequence data enables a hybrid computational approach.
the image sequences show stem cells together with blood vessels, enabling quantification of the dynamic behaviors of stem cells in relation to their vascular niche, with applications in developmental and cancer biology.
we present an application that integrates visualization and quantitative analysis of 5-d  and large montage confocal fluorescence microscopy images.
by exploiting commodity computer gaming hardware, we have developed an application that can be run in the laboratory to facilitate rapid iteration through biological experiments.
