we introduce mrsrf , a multi-core algorithm to generate a t Ã— t robinson-foulds distance matrix between t trees using the mapreduce paradigm.
the problem of interest is generating the all-to-all robinson-foulds distance matrix, which has many applications for visualizing and clustering large collections of evolutionary trees.
our results also show that achieving top speedup on a multi-core cluster requires different cluster configurations.
our results show that mapreduce is a promising paradigm for developing multi-core phylogenetic applications.
in this paper, we evaluate the viability of the mapreduce framework for designing phylogenetic applications.
the results also demonstrate that different multi-core configurations must be tested in order to obtain optimum performance.
we conclude that rf matrices play a critical role in developing techniques to summarize large collections of trees.
our experiments show that mrsrf is a scalable approach reaching a speedup of over  <dig> on  <dig> total cores.
finally, we show how to use an rf matrix to summarize collections of phylogenetic trees visually.
we studied the performance of our mrsrf algorithm on two large biological trees sets consisting of  <dig>  trees of  <dig> taxa each and  <dig>  trees of  <dig> taxa each.
