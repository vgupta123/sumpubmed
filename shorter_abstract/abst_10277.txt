modern proteomes evolved by modification of pre-existing ones.
we have developed a method to cluster cognate proteins from multiple organisms beginning with only one sequence, through connectivity saturation with that seed sequence.
the method produced results that are as reliable as those produced by conventional clustering approaches.
unfortunately, relatively few organisms have had their genomes fully sequenced; accordingly, many proteins are ignored by the currently available databases of cognate proteins, despite the high amount of important genes that are functionally described only for these incomplete proteomes.
generating clusters based only on individual proteins of interest is less time consuming than generating clusters for whole proteomes.
