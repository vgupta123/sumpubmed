an initial list of differentially expressed genes was selected using criteria based upon p-value  and fold-change .
various adult aging-related clusters represented gene pathways related to xenobiotic metabolism, dna damage repair, and oxidative stress.
these results suggest an underlying role for genes in specific clusters in potentiating age- and sex-related differences in susceptibility to adverse health effects.
understanding the basal liver gene expression patterns is a necessary first step in addressing this hypothesis and will inform our assessments of adverse drug reactions as the liver plays a central role in drug metabolism and biotransformation.
age- and sex-related susceptibility to adverse drug reactions and disease is a key concern in understanding drug safety and disease progression.
