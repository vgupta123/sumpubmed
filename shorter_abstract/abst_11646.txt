continuous administration for  <dig> weeks via osmotic mini-pump of anti-asp or rasp was evaluated in wildtype mice on a high-fat diet  to examine their effects on body weight, food intake and energy expenditure.
mice treated with anti-asp showed elevated energy expenditure , increased skeletal muscle glucose oxidation , reduced liver glycogen  and glucose-6-phosphate content  compared to control mice.
interestingly, hfd mice treated with rasp showed the opposite phenotype with reduced energy expenditure  and increased body weight , cumulative food intake  and liver glycogen content .
therefore, asp is a potent anabolic hormone that may also be a mediator of energy expenditure.
previous studies have shown that asp-deficient c <dig> knockout mice are hyperphagic yet lean, as they display increased oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation compared to wildtype mice.
in the present study, antibodies against asp  and human recombinant asp  were tested in vitro and in vivo.
in vivo, anti-asp treatment increased whole body energy utilization while rasp increased energy storage.
in mature murine adipocytes, rasp significantly stimulated fatty acid uptake  while anti-asp neutralized the rasp response.
in vitro, anti-asp effectively neutralized asp stimulated fatty acid uptake.
there was no change in body weight, food intake, fasting insulin, adiponectin, crp or tg levels compared to controls.
acylation stimulating protein  is an adipogenic hormone that stimulates triglyceride  synthesis and glucose transport in adipocytes.
