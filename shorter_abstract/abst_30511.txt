in the sequential stage, probes are selected from sequence windows tiled alongside the genome.
in the gap-filling stage, additional probes are selected from the largest gaps between adjacent probes that have already been selected, until a predefined number of probes is reached.
the pipeline identifies every possible probe sequence from both forward and reverse-complement strands of all dna sequences in the target genome including circular or linear chromosomes and plasmids.
the probe selection pipeline evaluates global and local probe sequence properties and selects a set of probes dynamically and evenly distributed along the target genome.
current commercial high-density oligonucleotide microarrays can hold millions of probe spots on a single microscopic glass slide and are ideal for studying the transcriptome of microbial genomes using a tiling probe design.
this paper describes a comprehensive computational pipeline implemented specifically for designing tiling probe sets to study microbial transcriptome profiles.
optimal probes are then selected in two stages - sequential and gap-filling.
unique to other similar methods, an exact number of non-redundant probes can be designed to utilize all the available probe spots on any chosen microarray platform.
the pipeline can be applied to microbial genomes when designing high-density tiling arrays for comparative genomics, chip chip, gene expression and comprehensive transcriptome studies.
