cgp eliminates the tedious steps inherent in quantitative pcr and achieves moderate throughput.
cgp is a moderate throughput technique for analyzing changes in genomic copy numbers.
these adaptor-supplemented dnas are subjected to competitive pcr using an adaptor-primer and a locus-specific primer.
because cgp can measure any genomic locus using pcr primers, it is especially useful for detailed analysis of a genomic region of interest.
we describe a novel polymerase chain reaction -based technique, termed competitive genomic pcr .
assays with different x chromosome numbers showed that it can provide accurate quantification.
high-resolution analysis of neuroblastoma cell lines around the mycn locus revealed novel junctions for amplification, which were not detected by a commercial array.
the main characteristic of cgp is that different adaptors are added to the sample and control genomic dnas after appropriate restriction enzyme digestion.
changes in genomic copy number occur in many human diseases including cancer.
