the aim of the present work was to define the colonic epithelial response to an hpd.
the modifications of the luminal environment after an hpd were associated with maintenance of the colonic homeostasis that might be the result of adaptive processes in the epithelium related to the observed transcriptional regulations.
the hpd downregulated the expression of genes notably implicated in pathways related to cellular metabolism, nf-Îºb signaling, dna repair, glutathione metabolism and cellular adhesion in colonocytes.
these changes at the mrna level in colonocytes were not associated with detrimental effects of the hpd on dna integrity , epithelium renewal  and colonic barrier integrity .
in contrast, the hpd upregulated the expression of genes related to cell proliferation and chemical barrier function.
