we illustrate key concepts, vocabulary, and open problems in ms-omics, as well as provide invaluable resources such as open data sets and key search terms and references.
this paper will facilitate contributions from mathematicians, computer scientists, and statisticians to ms-omics that will fundamentally improve results over existing approaches and inform novel algorithmic solutions to open problems.
for decades, mass spectrometry data has been analyzed to investigate a wide array of research interests, including disease diagnostics, biological and chemical theory, genomics, and drug development.
despite interim successes, many data interpretation problems in mass spectrometry are still challenging.
this paper provides an introduction to the burgeoning field of computational mass spectrometry.
