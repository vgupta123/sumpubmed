the outcome leads to higher accuracy in prediction and more exhaustive description of the disease profile.
analysis of cerebrospinal fluid  samples holds great promise to diagnose neurological pathologies and gain insight into the molecular background of these pathologies.
the results are subsequently merged in order to be analyzed jointly.
the relevant information is extracted per platform using extended canonical variates analysis.
the biological interpretation of the involved variables validates our fusion approach.
proteomics and metabolomics methods provide invaluable information on the biomolecular content of csf and thereby on the possible status of the central nervous system, including neurological pathologies.
a novel fusion method is presented and applied to proteomics and metabolomics data from a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis: an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  model in rats.
fusion of proteomics and metabolomics data is possible.
the important variables  in this model are known to be linked to eae and/or multiple sclerosis.
