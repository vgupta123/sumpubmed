angptl <dig> message levels responded very rapidly to changes in the nutritional state.
lipoprotein lipase  hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins and makes fatty acids available for tissue metabolism.
this study demonstrates directly that angptl <dig> is necessary for rapid modulation of lpl activity in adipose tissue.
this was unexpected because gpihbp <dig> is known to stabilize lpl.
the activity of the enzyme is modulated in a tissue specific manner by interaction with other proteins.
we have studied how feeding/fasting and some related perturbations affect the expression, in rat adipose tissue, of three such proteins, lmf <dig>  an er protein necessary for folding of lpl into its active dimeric form, the endogenous lpl inhibitor angptl <dig>  and gpihbp <dig>  that transfers lpl across the endothelium.
studies with the transcription blocker actinomycin d showed that transcripts for angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig>  but not lmf <dig> or lpl, turn over rapidly.
in old, obese rats that showed signs of insulin resistance, the responses of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> mrna and of lpl activity were severely blunted  or almost abolished .
the plasticity of the lpl system is severely blunted or completely lost in insulin resistant rats.
the system underwent moderate circadian oscillations, for lpl in phase with food intake, for angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> in the opposite direction.
lpl activity always changed in the opposite direction.
in angptl4−/− mice adipose tissue lpl activity did not show these responses.
when food was withdrawn the expression of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> increased rapidly, and lpl activity decreased.
on re-feeding and after injection of insulin the expression of angptl <dig> and gpihbp <dig> decreased rapidly, and lpl activity increased.
increased on fasting when lpl activity decreased.
this did not happen in angptl4−/− mice.
