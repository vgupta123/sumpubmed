for the final prediction model, we used an ensemble methodology combining five distinct ppi prediction techniques, namely: literature mining, primary protein sequences, orthologous profiles, biological process similarity, and domain interactions.
the dataset used for training and validation, the predictions obtained and the network final network are available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/software/oralint.
the positive and negative datasets were merged and used for training and validation of a na√Øve bayes classifier.
the obtained ppis were used to create our positive dataset and, indirectly, our negative dataset.
after subjecting our dataset to the prediction model, the classified result was filtered for very high confidence ppis , leading to a set of  <dig>  ppis to be further explored.
the oral cavity is a complex ecosystem where human chemical compounds coexist with a particular microbiota.
in addition, it is known that the microbial colonization of the oral cavity is mediated by protein-protein interactions  between the host and microorganisms.
