however, we detected frequent recombination events in the mcyb and mcyc genes between strains within the same genus.
recombination and mutation rate ratios suggest that the diversification of mcyb and mcyc genes is driven by recombination events as well as point mutations in all three genera.
we provide the first clear evidence for positive selection acting on amino acid residues involved directly in the recognition and activation of amino acids incorporated into microcystin, indicating that the microcystin complement of a given strain may influence the ability of a particular strain to interact with its environment.
we found no decisive evidence for recombination between strains from different genera.
a comparative analysis of the adenylation domains from the first module of mcyb  and mcyc in the microcystin synthetase complex was performed on a large number of microcystin-producing strains from the anabaena, microcystis and planktothrix genera.
however, we found clear evidence for positive selection acting on a number of amino acid residues within these adenylation domains.
frequent interdomain recombination events were also observed between mcyb and mcyc sequences in anabaena and microcystis.
sequence analysis suggests that generally the adenylation domains of the first domain of mcyb and mcyc are under purifying selection.
these include residues important for active site selectivity of the adenylation domain, strongly suggesting selection for novel microcystin variants.
the notable diversity within some of the mcy modules is generated through various recombination events including horizontal gene transfer.
