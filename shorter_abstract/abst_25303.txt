upstream open reading frames  can down-regulate the translation of the main open reading frame  through two broad mechanisms: ribosomal stalling and reducing reinitiation efficiency.
we report that conserved uorfs are rare  in cereal transcriptomes, are generally short , highly conserved , position independent in their 5'-utrs, and their start codon context and the usage of rare codons for translation does not appear to be important.
our approach used a modified reciprocal best hit method to identify putative orthologous sequences that were then analysed by a comparative r-nomics program called uorfscan to find conserved uorfs.
