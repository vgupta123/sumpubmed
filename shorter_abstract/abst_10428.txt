on the other hand, mutations in splice sites cause exon skipping of the respective exon or activation of pre-existing cryptic sites.
the retained introns were significantly shorter than constitutive ones, and skipped exons are shorter than exons with cryptic sites.
the authentic acceptor sites affected by mutations were significantly weaker in exons with activated cryptic sites than in skipped exons.
the distance from a mutated splice site to the nearest equivalent site is significantly shorter in cases of activated cryptic sites compared to exon skipping events.
the density of exonic splicing enhancers was higher, and the density of exonic splicing silencers lower in retained introns compared to constitutive ones and in exons with cryptic sites compared to skipped exons.
thus the analysis of retained introns in human cdna, exons skipped due to mutations in splice sites and exons with cryptic sites produced results consistent with the intron definition mechanism of splicing of short introns, co-transcriptional splicing, dependence of splicing efficiency on the splice site strength and the density of candidate exonic splicing enhancers and silencers.
most retained introns found in human cdnas generated by high-throughput sequencing projects seem to result from underspliced transcripts, and thus they capture intermediate steps of pre-mrna splicing.
these results are consistent with other, recently published analyses.
both donor and acceptor splice sites of retained introns were weaker than splice sites of constitutive introns.
