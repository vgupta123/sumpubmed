we developed a hybrid approach and achieved a maximum mcc of  <dig>  with accuracy of  <dig> %, where svm model developed using selected dipeptide composition and information of four prosite domains.
there are twenty different types of aarss, unique for each amino acid.
aminoacyl trna synthetases  catalyse the first step of protein synthesis in all organisms.
we observed that 62% of trna synthetases contain one or more domains from amongst the following four prosite domains: ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig> and ps <dig>  an svm-based model was developed to discriminate between aarss, and non-aarss, and achieved a maximum mcc of  <dig>  with accuracy of  <dig> %, using selective dipeptide composition.
we were able to identify prosite domains that are preferred in aarss and their classes, providing interesting insights into trna synthetases.
they are responsible for the precise attachment of amino acids to their cognate transfer rnas.
the high accuracy achieved by our svm models using selected dipeptide composition demonstrates that certain types of dipeptide are preferred in aarss.
we have analyzed protein sequences of aarss  and non-aarss and identified interesting patterns.
we further developed an svm-based model for classifying the aarss into class- <dig> and class- <dig>  using selective dipeptide composition and achieved an mcc of  <dig> .
a hybrid method was developed using these domains as descriptor, along with selected dipeptide composition, and achieved an mcc of  <dig>  with a sensitivity of  <dig> % and an accuracy of  <dig> %.
it is important to predict and classify aarss in order to understand protein synthesis.
