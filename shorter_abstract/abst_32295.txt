the position weight matrices  of transcription factors from different structural classes have been determined using a knowledge-based statistical potential.
a novel algorithm was developed to calculate position weight matrices from protein-dna complex structures.
the scoring function calibrated against crystallographic data on protein-dna contacts recovered pwms of various members of widely studied transcription factor families such as p <dig> and nf-Îºb.
the newly computed p50p <dig> pwm recovered  <dig> more experimental binding sites than the corresponding transfac matrix, while both pwms showed comparable receiver operator characteristics.
where it was possible, extensive comparison to experimental binding affinity data and other physical models was made.
interestingly, about half of the p <dig> and p <dig> hits reported by the match algorithm in the altogether  <dig> promoters lay more than  <dig> kb upstream of the corresponding transcription start sites, which deviates from the common assumption that most regulatory sites are located more proximal to the tss.
knowledge of transcription factor-dna binding patterns is crucial for understanding gene transcription.
numerous dna-binding proteins are annotated as transcription factors in the literature, however, for many of them the corresponding dna-binding motifs remain uncharacterized.
the performance of pwms obtained in this work in comparison to traditionally constructed matrices demonstrates that the structure-based approach presents a promising alternative to experimental determination of transcription factor binding properties.
the proposed algorithm was extensively validated against experimental data.
the pwms of p <dig> and p <dig> were computed on the basis of homology modeling and their performance was studied using upstream sequences of  <dig> p53/p73-regulated human genes.
