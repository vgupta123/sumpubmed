does the c. elegans nervous system contain multi-neuron computational modules that perform stereotypical functions?
over-represented patterns  are candidates for computational modules that may perform stereotypical functions in the c. elegans nervous system.
we attempt to answer this question by searching for recurring multi-neuron inter-connectivity patterns in the c. elegans nervous system's wiring diagram.
our statistical analysis reveals that some inter-connectivity patterns containing two, three and four  neurons are significantly over-represented relative to the expectations based on the statistics of smaller inter-connectivity patterns.
