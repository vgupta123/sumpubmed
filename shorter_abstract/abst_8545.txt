the pmra gene  has been used for identification and analysis of the relationships among twenty nine pectobacterium carotovorum subsp.

numerous conventional methods were used to characterize pectobacterium spp., including biochemical assays, specific pcr-based tests, and construction of phylogenetic trees by using gene sequences.
phylogenetic analyses of pmra sequences compared to eric-pcr and 16s rdna sequencing, demonstrated that there is considerable genetic diversity in p. carotovorum subsp.
carotovorum and estimate their genetic diversity.
in morocco, approximately 95% of the p. carotovorum isolates from potato plants with tuber soft rot are p. carotovorum subsp.
this is especially true when different pathogen cause similar diseases on potato, citing as an example, p. carotovorum, p. atrosepticum and p. wasabiae.
pmra sequence analysis is likely to be a reliable tool to identify the subspecies pectobacterium carotovorum subsp.
carotovorum strains, which can be divided into two distinct groups within the same clade.
the species pectobacterium carotovorum includes a diverse subspecies of bacteria that cause disease on a wide variety of plants.
