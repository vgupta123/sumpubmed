about sixty genomes were analyzed by means of informational indexes based on genomic dictionaries, where a systemic view replaces a local sequence analysis.
we computed informational indexes, built the genomic dictionaries with different sizes, along with frequency distributions.
any set of words  occurring in a genome provides a genomic dictionary.
the software performed three main tasks: computation of informational indexes, storage of these in a database, index analysis and visualization.
