to explore further the possibility of probing alternative feedback mechanisms, we also coupled the model to sinusoidal signals with a wide range of strengths and frequencies.
first we analyse single-cell data from experiments in which the nf-kappa b system is forced by short trains of strong pulses of tnf-alpha.
many authors have suggested that this core oscillator should couple to other oscillatory pathways.
further simulations suggest that the nonlinearities of the nf-kappa b feedback oscillator mean that even sinusoidally modulated forcing can induce a rich variety of nonlinear interactions.
our results show that, at least in simulation, frequencies other than those of the forcing and the main nf-kappa b oscillator can be excited via sub- and superharmonic resonance, producing quasiperiodic and even chaotic dynamics.
our numerical results suggest that the entrainment phenomena observed in pulse-stimulated experiments is a consequence of the high intensity of the stimulation.
using a recent model of the nf-kappa b system due to caroline horton, we carried out extensive numerical simulations to analyze the response frequencies induced by trains of pulses of tnf-alpha stimulation having a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes.
