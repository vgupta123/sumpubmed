in this study, genes encoding putative enzymes from carbon metabolism were identified and their expression was studied in different growth stages of a. bisporus.
we correlated the expression of genes encoding plant and fungal polysaccharide modifying enzymes identified in the a. bisporus genome to the soluble carbohydrates and the composition of mycelium grown compost, casing layer and fruiting bodies.
the compost grown vegetative mycelium of a. bisporus consumes a wide variety of monosaccharides.
this suggests that only hexoses or their conversion products are transported from the vegetative mycelium to the fruiting body, while the other sugars likely provide energy for growth and maintenance of the vegetative mycelium.
in contrast, genes encoding fungal cell wall polysaccharide modifying enzymes were expressed in both fruiting bodies and vegetative mycelium, but different gene sets were expressed in these samples.
the major constituent monosaccharides of these polysaccharides are glucose, xylose, and arabinose, while smaller amounts of galactose, glucuronic acid, rhamnose and mannose are also present.
genes encoding plant cell wall polysaccharide degrading enzymes were mainly expressed in compost-grown mycelium, and largely absent in fruiting bodies.
