most genomic differences corresponded to the presence of regions unique to only one or two isolates, and were probably acquired by horizontal gene transfer .

new strains of vibrio parahaemolyticus that cause diarrhea in humans by seafood ingestion periodically emerge through continuous evolution in the ocean.
the evolutionary forces  acting on each isolate of the same population were found to differ to an extent that probably depended on the ecological scenario and life circumstances of each bacterium.
some dna gain was chromosomal but most was in plasmids.
influx and expansion in the southern chilean ocean of a highly clonal v. parahaemolyticus  population from south east asia caused one of the largest seafood-related diarrhea outbreaks in the world.
