based on molecular dynamics simulations, we developed force distribution analysis , a method that allows visualizing strain propagation in macromolecules.
the way mechanical stress is distributed inside and propagated by proteins and other biopolymers largely defines their function.
we provide an additional r-package providing functions for advanced statistical analysis and presentation of the fda data.
yet, determining the network of interactions propagating internal strain remains a challenge for both, experiment and theory.
by elucidating propagation of internal strain upon ligand binding, we previously also successfully revealed the functionality of a stiff allosteric protein.
the fda code comes with an easy-to-use command line interface and can directly be applied to every system built using gromacs.
fda thus has the potential to be a valuable tool in the investigation and rational design of mechanical properties in proteins and nano-materials.
