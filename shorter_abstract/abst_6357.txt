the definition of the alu element within the tif-ia gene as an exon is restricted to certain types of cancers; the element is not exonized in normal human cells.
this implies the existence of purifying selection against exonization in single copy genes, with duplicate genes free from such constrains.
the gene for tif-ia, an rna polymerase i transcription initiation factor, underwent a humanoid-specific triplication, all three copies of the gene are active transcriptionally, although only one copy retains the ability to generate the tif-ia protein.
we examined whether there is less selection against exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes than in single-copy genes.
genome-wide analysis of exonization of transposed elements revealed a higher rate of exonization within duplicated genes relative to single-copy genes.
gene duplication and exonization of intronic transposed elements are two mechanisms that enhance genomic diversity.
these results further our understanding of the delicate interplay between gene duplication and alternative splicing and of the molecular evolutionary mechanisms leading to genetic innovations.
however, this exonization was abundant in most leukemia cell lines evaluated, although the genomic sequence is unchanged in these cancerous cells compared to normal cells.
we identified a single point mutation leading to exonization in one of the gene duplicates.
prior to tif-ia triplication, an alu element was inserted into the first intron.
