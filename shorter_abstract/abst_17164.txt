moreover, the recombination events detected between the genes and the intermingled phylogenetic pattern indicate that interlocus recombination accounts for much of the allelic variation in ia <dig>  analysis of the population differentiation implied that homogenous balancing selection plays an important part in maintaining an even distribution of mhc variations.
here, we screened for polymorphisms in exons  <dig> and  <dig> of the ia <dig> and ia <dig> genes in  <dig> golden pheasant populations across the chinese mainland to characterize their genetic variation levels, to understand the effects of historical positive selection and recombination in shaping class i diversity, and to investigate the genetic structure of wild golden pheasant populations.
allele frequency analysis across  <dig> ia loci showed low levels of genetic differentiation among populations on small geographic scales; however, significant genetic differentiation was observed between pheasants from the northern and southern regions of the yangtze river.
the non-synonymous substitution rate was significantly greater than the synonymous substitution rate at sequences in the ia <dig> gene encoding putative peptide-binding sites but not in the ia <dig> gene; we also found more positively selected sites in ia <dig> than in ia <dig>  frequent recombination events resulted in at least  <dig> recombinant ia <dig> alleles, in accordance with the intermingling pattern of the phylogenetic tree.
the natural barrier of the yangtze river and heterogeneous balancing selection might help shape the nyr-syr genetic structure in golden pheasants.
both structure analysis and f-statistic  value comparison classified those populations into  <dig> major groups: the northern region of the yangtze river  and the southern region of the yangtze river .
mhc diversity may be directly associated with population resistance to infectious pathogens.
the major histocompatibility complex  genes are vital partners in the acquired immune processes of vertebrates.
