the complete image set is then visualized in two or three dimensions using the coordinates so determined.
here we introduce a novel methodology, icluster, for visualizing, clustering and comparing large sub-cellular localization image sets.
for each member of an image set, icluster generates statistics that have been found to be useful in distinguishing sub-cellular localization.
the methodology was tested on a set of  <dig> previously published images containing  <dig> known sub-cellular localizations.
even with tightly controlled experimental conditions, protein expression can vary widely between cells, and because of the difficulty in viewing and comparing large image sets this might not be observed.
there are many potential applications such as image database curation, semi-automated interactive classification, outlier detection and reference image comparison.
the result is images that are statistically similar are spatially close in the visualization allowing for easy comparison of images that are similar and distinguishment of dissimilar images into distinct clusters.
computational expense was found to be relatively low, and sets of up to  <dig> images visualized and interacted with in real time.
by allowing the observation of the full range of imaging data available using modern microscopes these methods will provide an invaluable tool for cell biologists.
the feasibility of automated spatial layout to allow comparison and discrimination of high throughput sub-cellular imaging has been demonstrated.
the statistics are mapped into two or three dimensions such as to preserve distances between the statistics vectors.
