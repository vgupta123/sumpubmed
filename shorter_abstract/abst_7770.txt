its action overlaps that of sox <dig>  though they are antagonistic in female vs male gonadal sex determination but conjoint in cartilage and skeletal development.
compared to wild-type, foxl <dig> null mice are smaller and show skeletal abnormalities and defects in cartilage and bone mineralization, with down-regulation of the gh/igf <dig> axis.
our results support foxl <dig> as a master transcription factor in a spectrum of developmental processes, including growth, cartilage and bone formation.
consistent with these effects, we find foxl <dig> expressed in embryos at  <dig>  dpc in neural tube epithelium, in head mesenchyme near the neural tube, and within the first branchial arch; then, starting at  <dig>  dpc, expressed in cartilaginous tissue; and at po and p <dig>  in hypothalamus.
body length and weight were measured and growth curves were created.
analysis of the gh/igf <dig> pathway was done evaluating the expression of several hypothalamic-pituitary-bone axis markers by rt-qpcr.
bone and cartilage formation was analyzed by von kossa staining and immunofluorescence using anti-foxl <dig> and anti-sox <dig> antibodies followed by confocal microscopy.
foxl2−/− male mice at different stages of development have been characterized and compared to wild type.
haploinsufficiency of the foxl <dig> transcription factor in humans causes blepharophimosis/ptosis/epicanthus inversus syndrome , characterized by eyelid anomalies and premature ovarian failure.
