the forest of hierarchical latent class models offers several advantages for genome-wide association studies: accurate modeling of linkage disequilibrium, flexible data dimensionality reduction and biological meaning borne by latent variables.
in addition, the data dimensionality can be reduced through the latent variables of the model which synthesize the information borne by genetic markers.
this model offers an adapted framework to deal with the fuzzy nature of linkage disequilibrium blocks.
discovering the genetic basis of common genetic diseases in the human genome represents a public health issue.
in order to tackle the learning of both forest structure and probability distributions, a generic algorithm has been proposed.
we present an accurate modeling of dependences between genetic markers, based on a forest of hierarchical latent class models which is a particular class of probabilistic graphical models.
however, the dimensionality of the genetic data  and its complexity make the statistical analysis a challenging task.
