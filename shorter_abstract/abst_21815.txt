functional analysis based on go enrichment demonstrates that the  <dig> compared technologies delivered very similar results and identified most of the relevant go categories enriched in the reference list.
our results show an important overlap of the illumina and affymetrix deg lists.
our results support the conclusion of the microarray quality control  project that the criteria used to constitute the deg lists strongly influence the degree of concordance among platforms.
in this study we assessed the respective ability of affymetrix and illumina microarray methodologies to answer a relevant biological question, namely the change in gene expression between resting monocytes and macrophages derived from these monocytes.
however the importance of prioritizing genes by magnitude of effect  rather than statistical significance  to enhance cross-platform reproducibility recommended by the maqc authors was not supported by our data.
in addition, a reference list of differentially expressed genes  was generated from a larger number of hybridizations  using the rng/mrc two-color platform.
in addition, more than 70% of the genes in these lists were also present in the reference list.
