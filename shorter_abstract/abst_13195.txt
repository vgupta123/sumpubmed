the advent of high-throughput experimentation in biochemistry has led to the generation of vast amounts of chemical data, necessitating the development of novel analysis, characterization, and cataloguing techniques and tools.
we conclude that the proposed methodology can ease the burden of chemical data annotators and dramatically increase their productivity.
compounding this, currently existing chemical classification and annotation systems are not amenable to automated classification, formal and transparent chemical class definition axiomatization, facile class redefinition, or novel class integration, thus further limiting chemical ontology growth by necessitating human involvement in curation.
to address this, we present a formal framework based on semantic web technologies for the automatic design of chemical ontology which can be used for automated classification of novel entities.
we demonstrate the automatic self-assembly of a structure-based chemical ontology based on  <dig> mesh and  <dig> chebi chemical classes.
finally, we discuss an iterative approach that we envision for future biochemical ontology development.
we anticipate that the use of formal logic in our proposed framework will make chemical classification criteria more transparent to humans and machines alike and will thus facilitate predictive and integrative bioactivity model development.
clearly, there is a need for the automation of this process, especially for novel chemical entities of biological interest.
