motif extraction is one way to address that task.
in addition, we studied the effect of the substitution matrices variation on the quality of our method and hence on the classification quality.
the experimental results showed that our encoding method outperforms other ones in terms of classification accuracy and number of generated attributes.
for this purpose, we propose a novel encoding method that uses amino-acid substitution matrices to define similarity between motifs during the extraction step.
we noticed that our method enables good classification accuracies with all the substitution matrices and that the variances of the obtained accuracies using various substitution matrices are slight.
results indicated that svm generally outperforms the other classifiers with any encoding method.
however, the number of generated features varies from a substitution matrix to another.
this paper deals with the preprocessing of protein sequences for supervised classification.
the outcomes of our comparative experiments confirm the efficiency of our encoding method to represent protein sequences in classification tasks.
