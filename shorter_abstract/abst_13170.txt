our studies highlight the prominence of dapk and pin1/pinn- <dig> as conserved mediators of cell death processes in diverse scenarios of neurodegeneration.
here we analyze a well-characterized model of excitotoxicity in the nematode c. elegans to show that dapk is an important mediator of excitotoxic neurodegeneration across a large evolutionary distance.
in contrast, pin1/pinn- <dig>  suppresses neurodegeneration in our excitotoxicity model.
we further show that some proposed mechanisms of dapkâ€™s action  do not have a major role in nematode excitotoxicity.
excitotoxicity  is a central process in widespread neurodegenerative conditions such as brain ischemia and chronic neurological diseases.
