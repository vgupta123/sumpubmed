as bacteria, motile archaeal species swim by means of rotating flagellum structures driven by a proton gradient force.
in all complete archaeal genomes, the genes coding for flagellum components are co-localized in one or two well-conserved genomic clusters showing two different types of organizations.
interestingly, experimental data have shown that the archaeal flagellum is non-homologous to the bacterial flagellum either in terms of overall structure, components and assembly.
these support a history of mainly vertical inheritance for the components of this unique motility system, and an interesting possible ancient horizontal gene transfer event  of a whole flagellum-coding gene cluster between euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota.
we report here an exhaustive phylogenomic analysis of the components of the archaeal flagellum.
we propose an evolutionary scenario for the evolution of the components of the archaeal flagellum.
moreover, we show that the components of the archaeal flagellar system have not been frequently transferred among archaeal species, indicating that gene fixation following hgt can also be rare for genes encoding components of large macromolecular complexes with a structural role.
