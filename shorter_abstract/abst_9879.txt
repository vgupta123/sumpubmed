the frequency of lof variants differed greatly across the genome, a hot spot with a strikingly high density was observed in a 6 mb region on bta <dig>  lof affected genes were enriched for functional categories related to olfactory reception and underrepresented for genes related to key cellular constituents and cellular and biological process regulation.
a comparison between sequencing-derived snps and genotyping from the bovinehd beadchip revealed a concordance rate of  <dig> – <dig>  % for homozygous snps and  <dig> – <dig>  % for heterozygous snps.
over the last few years, continuous development of high-throughput sequencing platforms and sequence analysis tools has facilitated reliable identification and characterization of genetic variants in many cattle breeds.
annotation of the snps discovered  <dig>  snps and  <dig> indels affecting coding sequences with  <dig> being lof mutations.
we sequenced four genetically unrelated danish holstein cows with a mean coverage of 27x using an illumina hiseq  <dig>  multi-sample snp calling identified  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig> , <dig> indels whereof  <dig>   snps and  <dig>   indels were novel.
a substantial number of the putative deleterious lof variants had a minor allele frequency > <dig>  in the  <dig> bull genomes data set.
this catalog of variants will be a resource for future studies to understand variation underlying important phenotypes, particularly recessively inherited lethal phenotypes.
here, we sequenced to a high coverage the danish holstein cattle breed to detect and characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms , insertion/deletions , and loss-of-function  variants in protein-coding genes in order to provide a comprehensive resource for subsequent detection of causal variants for recessive traits.
filtering using sequence derived genotype data for  <dig> holstein animals from the  <dig> bull genomes project removing variants containing homozygous individuals retained  <dig> of the lof variants as putatively deleterious.
an investigation into lof variants discovered a set of variants predicted to disrupt protein-coding genes.
