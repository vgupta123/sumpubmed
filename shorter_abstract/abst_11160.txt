the ensemble algorithm for clustering cancer data  by chen et al.
we compared the output of eaccd with the corresponding survival curves, investigated the effect of different settings in eaccd, and compared eaccd with alternative clustering approaches.
using the basic t and n definitions, eaccd generated a dendrogram that shows a graphic relationship among the survival curves of the breast cancer patients.
when m is large, the dendrograms depend on the linkage functions.
though results on using eaccd have been reported, there has been no study on the analysis of the algorithm.
the tnm staging system is based on three anatomic prognostic factors: tumor, lymph node and metastasis.
therefore, the tnm should be expanded to accommodate new prognostic factors in order to increase the accuracy of estimating cancer patient outcome.
furthermore, clustering only based on prognostic factors could generate misleading dendrograms, and direct use of partitioning techniques could lead to misleading assignments to clusters.
the statistical tests, however, employed in the learning step have minimal effect on the dendrogram for large m. in addition, if omitting the step for learning dissimilarity in eaccd, the resulting approaches can have a degraded performance.
the dendrograms from eaccd are robust for large values of m .
when only the partitioning around medoids  algorithm is involved in the step of learning dissimilarity, large values of m are required to obtain robust dendrograms, and for a large m eaccd can effectively cluster cancer patient data.
