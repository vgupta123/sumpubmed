results of this study indicate that male g. flavescens mate with multiple females and enjoy confidence of paternity.
overall, our investigation shows that g. flavescens is similar to other, related gobies in that the nests of care-giving males often contain eggs from multiple females.
however, g. flavescens differs from other gobies in displaying an extremely low rate of cuckoldry.
the study of ecological factors responsible for this important difference between g. flavescens and related species should be a fertile area for future work.
a major question in behavioural ecology concerns the relationship between genetic mating systems and the strength of sexual selection.
in this study, we investigated the genetic mating system of the two-spotted goby , a useful fish model for the study of sexual selection whose genetic mating system remains uncharacterized.
nests were nearly full and males that maintain larger nests have higher mating and reproductive success, irrespective of body size.
