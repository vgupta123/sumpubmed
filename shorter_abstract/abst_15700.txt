here, we presented a hybrid approach developed to take advantage of data generated using minion® device.
we described nas tool, a hybrid approach allowing the sequencing of microbial genomes using the minion® device.
in  <dig>  oxford nanopore released the minion® device, a small and low-cost single-molecule nanopore sequencer, which offers the possibility of sequencing long dna fragments.

our method, based ideally on 20x and 50x of nas and illumina reads respectively, provides an efficient and cost-effective way of sequencing microbial or small eukaryotic genomes in a very short time even in small facilities.
moreover, we demonstrated that although the oxford nanopore technology is a relatively new sequencing technology, currently with a high error rate, it is already useful in the generation of high-quality genome assemblies.
our hybrid strategy was able to generate nas  reads up to 60 kb that aligned entirely and with no error to the reference genome and that spanned highly conserved repetitive regions.
we sequenced a well-known bacterium, acinetobacter baylyi adp <dig> and applied our method to obtain a highly contiguous  and accurate genome assembly even in repetitive regions, in contrast to an illumina-only assembly.
the average accuracy of nas reads reached  <dig> % without losing the initial size of the input minion® reads.
