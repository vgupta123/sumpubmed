analyses of data of dna sequences  and sixteen microsatellite loci  were conducted in the species.
here, we assessed the genetic diversity, genetic structure and demographic history of this species.
we found high genetic diversity at the species level, low genetic diversity within each of the seven populations and high genetic differentiation among the populations.
of the  <dig> samples,  <dig> individuals from the seven populations were used for dna sequencing and  <dig> individuals from six populations were used for the microsatellite study.
there was a clear genetic structure within populations of c. simplicipinna.
some genetic features of c. simplicipinna such as having high genetic differentiation among the populations, a clear genetic structure and a recent population contraction could provide guidelines for protecting this endangered species from extinction.
the results derived from ssr data also showed that c. simplicipinna underwent past effective population contraction, likely during the pleistocene.
a demographic history inferred from dna sequencing data indicates that c. simplicipinna experienced a recent population contraction without retreating to a common refugium during the last glacial period.
