this study demonstrated the critical importance of the use of multilocus nuclear data for the unbiased assessment of cryptic diversity and for the delimitation of species in soil invertebrates.
although each population contained multiple mtdna lineages, subdivisions within the populations were not observed for the nuclear genome.
recently, several deeply divergent mtdna lineages were detected in mainland europe, but whether these earthworms also constitute cryptic species remains unclear.
because the clustering of the radseq data was according to the population of origin and not the mtdna lineage, reproductive isolation among the mtdna lineages was not likely.
the earthworm l. rubellus, which is represented by several mtdna lineages in continental europe, apparently is a single highly polymorphic species rather than a complex of several cryptic species.

in this study, we used genome-wide radseq data to assess the reproductive isolation of the divergent mitochondrial lineages of l. rubellus that occur in sympatry in multiple localities in central europe.
an unbiased assessment of the diversity, including the cryptic diversity, is of particular importance for the below ground fauna, a major component of global biodiversity.
the nucleotide diversity within the populations was high,  <dig> – <dig>  %.
the accurate delimitation of species is essential to numerous areas of biological research.
on the british isles, the epigeic earthworm lumbricus rubellus, which is a sentinel species in soil ecotoxicology, consists of two cryptic taxa that are differentiated in both the nuclear and the mitochondrial  genomes.
