here we identified cell type specific enhancers coupled with gene expression in two different types of breast epithelial cells, hmec  and mdamb <dig> .
we also identified response element motifs enriched at these enhancer sites that revealed key transcription factors  likely involved in regulating breast epithelial enhancer-mediated gene expression.
these findings facilitate the understanding of epigenetic regulation specifically, such as the relationships between regulatory elements and gene expression and generally, how breast epithelial cellular phenotypes are determined by cell type specific enhancers.

these expression levels were correlated with enhancer status , defined by surrounding histone marks.
histone modifications at enhancers were related to the expression levels of nearby genes up to 750 kb away.
these genes were involved in proteolysis, epidermis development, cell adhesion, mitosis, cell cycle, and dna replication.
the precise nature of how cell type specific chromatin structures at enhancer sites affect gene expression is largely unknown.
furthermore, about fifty percent of poised and active enhancers contained nucleosome-depleted regions.
by utilizing expression data, potential target genes of more than  <dig> active enhancers were identified.
enhancers were defined by modified neighboring histones  and nucleosome depletion .
