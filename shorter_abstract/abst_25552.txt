further qpcr analysis confirmed that the genes encoding the factors involved in major histocompatibility complex -i processing pathway were up-regulated, while those involved in mhc-ii pathway were down-regulated.
in this work, to clarify the host immune mechanisms underlying the protective effects of a putative vaccine and improve its immunogenicity in the future efforts, high-throughput rna sequencing technology was used to investigate the immunization-related gene expression patterns of zebrafish immunized with edwardsiella tarda live attenuated vaccine.
these data provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying zebrafish immune response to wed immunization and might aid future studies to develop a highly immunogenic vaccine against gram-negative bacteria in teleosts.
among those, functional classifications were found in the gene ontology database for  <dig> and in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database for  <dig>  several pathways involved in acute phase response, complement activation, immune/defense response, and antigen processing and presentation were remarkably affected at the early stage of wed immunization.
zebrafish  is a prominent vertebrate model of human development and pathogenic disease and has recently been utilized to study teleost immune responses to infectious agents threatening the aquaculture industry.
