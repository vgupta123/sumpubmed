inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccines were administered intramuscularly to five week old pigs in a dose titration experimental design, ranging from  <dig> - <dig>  log <dig> tissue culture infective dose , to evaluate immunogenicity using a fluorescent foci neutralization assay , fluorescent microsphere immunoassay , and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  on sera.
therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the humoral immune response to the selected inactivated pedv vaccine candidate in a dose-titration manner.
a future vaccination-challenge study would illustrate the efficacy of an inactivated vaccine and help evaluate protective ffn titers and elisa and fmia responses.
pedv was isolated from a pig with diarrhea and complete genome sequencing found >99% nucleotide identity to other u.s. pedv.
porcine epidemic diarrhea virus , a highly pathogenic and transmissible virus in swine, was first detected in the u.s. in may,  <dig>  and has caused tremendous losses to the swine industry.
these results demonstrate the immunogenicity of a pedv inactivated viral vaccine with a u.s. strain via dose-titration.
pigs vaccinated with  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml inactivated virus showed significantly higher ffn titers as well as fmia and elisa values than  <dig>  log <dig> tcid50/ml vaccinates and the negative controls.
due to the difficulty in isolating and growing this virus in cell culture, few vaccine studies using cell culture propagated pedv have been performed on u.s. strains in pigs.
