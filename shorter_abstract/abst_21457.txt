here, bacterial outer membrane proteins of the omp <dig> family have recently been discussed as evolutionary seeds for the development of translocation systems.
the phenylalanine in the n-terminal domain signs as a prerequisite for protein translocation across the outer membrane assisted by a "primitive" translocon.
however, the analysis of protein import into the primitive plastids of glaucocystophyte algae, revealed distinct features placing this system as a tool to understand the evolutionary development of translocation systems.
comparison to established import experiments, however, unveiled a major importance of the phenylalanine for recognition by omp <dig>  this finding is placed into the context of the evolutionary development of the plastid translocon.
the phenylalanine has subsequently been lost in the transit sequence, but can be found at the c-terminal position of the translocating pore.
to further explore the initial mode of protein translocation, the observed phenylalanine dependence for protein translocation into glaucophyte plastids was pursued in detail.
this process was paralleled by a massive gene transfer from symbiont to the host nucleus challenging the development of a retrograde protein translocation system to ensure plastid functionality.
at present, most information on protein translocation is obtained by the analysis of land plants.
