endogenous stat <dig> was shown to be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues both in salmon leukocytes and in to cells treated with recombinant type i and type ii ifns.
the ssstat1a had a domain-like structure with functional motifs that are similar to higher vertebrates.
type i and type ii interferons  exert their effects mainly through the jak/stat pathway, which is presently best described in mammals.
treatment with ifns led to nuclear translocation of stat <dig> within one hour.
the latter is also the transcriptional activation domain.
also ectopically expressed ssstat <dig> was phosphorylated in salmon cells upon in vitro stimulation by the ifns, confirming that the cloned gene was recognized by upstream tyrosine kinases.
