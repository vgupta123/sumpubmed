to evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we re-analyzed discarded contigs and singletons from several environments with different levels of complexity.
in other words, utilizing the conserved gene order as a criterion will reduce the amount of data discarded when analyzing metagenomes.
the pearson correlation coefficient revealed a high degree of similarity  between the proposed taxonomic binning approach and those reported in original studies.
in an attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of metagenomic data, we re-analyzed the discarded metagenomes by using less stringent cut-offs.
the improvement in sequencing technology, which yields a large amount of sequence data, has led to major breakthroughs in the field.
we also compared the consistency between our taxonomic binning and those reported in the original studies.
investigation of metagenomes provides greater insight into uncultured microbial communities.
