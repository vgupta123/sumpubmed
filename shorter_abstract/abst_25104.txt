the putative regulatory elements presenting some conservation level in the gmhsp <dig> promoters included hse, w-box, caat box, and ta-rich elements.
because of their apparent multifunctionality, these proteins are promising targets for developing crop varieties that are better adapted to biotic and abiotic stresses.
thus, in the present study an in silico identification of gmhsp <dig> gene family members was performed, and the genes were characterized and subjected to in vivo expression analysis under biotic and abiotic stresses.
the obtained expression profiles revealed that the majority of the  <dig> gmhsp <dig> candidates are induced under ht, but other members of this family could also be involved in normal cellular functions, unrelated to ht.
among the gmhsp <dig> genes that were potentials hsr, five were also cold-induced, and another five, in addition to one gmacd gene, were responsive to meloidogyne javanica infection.
some of the biotic stress-responsive gmhsp <dig> genes exhibited a divergent expression pattern between resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes under m. javanica infection.
these genes represent the most abundant class among the hsps in plants, but little is known about this gene family in soybean.
based on in vivo analysis, only  <dig> soybean hsp <dig> genes were responsive to heat shock stress.
furthermore, one predicted gmhsp <dig> was shown to be responsive only to nematode infection; no expression change was detected under other stress conditions.
some of these putative elements showed a unique occurrence pattern among genes responsive to nematode infection.
the hsp <dig> genes are associated with stress caused by hs and other abiotic factors, but have recently been found to be associated with the response to biotic stresses.
the  <dig> gmhsp <dig> genes were distributed across a total of  <dig> subfamilies where a specific predicted secondary structure was identified.
a search of the available soybean genome databases revealed  <dig> gene models as potential gmhsp <dig> candidates.
the evolution of hsp <dig> family in soybean genome has most likely involved a total of  <dig> gene duplications.
