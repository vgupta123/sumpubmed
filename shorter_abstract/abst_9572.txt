from e <dig>  until e <dig> , s100b was expressed in the primary radial glial scaffold involved in purkinje progenitor exit from the ventricular zone and in the sox9+ glial progenitors derived from it.
during the same period coinciding with the primary phase of granule neuron precursor genesis, transient egfp expression tagged the pax6+ forerunners of granule precursors born in the cerebellar rhombic lip.
in the present study, we have drawn on this observation to establish the precise spatio-temporal pattern of s100b gene expression in the embryonic cerebellum.
in the cerebellum of newborn s100b-egfp mice, we had previously noted the presence of a large population of s100b-expressing cells, which we assumed to be immature bergmann glial cells.
