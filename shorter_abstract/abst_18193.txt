we also performed assays with nccs isolated from p0-cre/cag-cat-egfp embryos on culture plates.
in this study, by embedding a p0-cre/cag-cat-egfp embryo at e <dig>  in collagen gel inside a culture glass slide, we were able to keep the embryo developing ex vivo for more than  <dig> hours; this development was with enough ncc fluorescent signal intensity to enable single-cell resolution analysis, with the accompanying ncc migration potential intact and with the appropriate ncc response to the extracellular signal maintained.
the neuromediator 5-hydroxytryptamine  has been known to regulate ncc migration.
we newly demonstrated that dopamine, in addition to 5-ht, stimulated ncc migration in vitro.
two ncc populations, with different axial levels of origins, showed unique distribution patterns regarding migration velocity and different dose-response patterns to both 5-ht and dopamine.
although avian species predominated over the other species in the ncc study, our novel system should enable us to use mice to assay many different aspects of nccs in embryos or on culture plates, such as migration, division, differentiation, and apoptosis.
