among the diploid species of a. millefolium agg., gene trees of the two nuclear loci, ncpgs and sbp, and the combined plastid fragments are incongruent with each other and with the aflp tree likely due to incomplete lineage sorting or secondary introgression.
while previous aflp data provide species trees congruent with earlier morphological classification and phylogeographic considerations, the present sequence data are not suited to recover the relationships of diploid species in a. millefolium agg.
furthermore, there is evidence for intragenic recombination in the ncpgs gene.
an analysis using a probabilistic model for population demographic history indicates large ancestral effective population sizes and short intervals between speciation events.
such a scenario explains the incongruence of the gene trees and species tree we observe.
to understand its evolutionary history, we study sequence variation at two nuclear genes and three plastid loci across the natural distribution of this species complex and compare the patterns of such variations to the species tree inferred earlier from aflp data.
the relationships are particularly complex in the polyploid members of a. millefolium agg.
the present study indicates that the diploid members of a. millefolium agg.
the n hemisphere achillea millefolium aggregate exhibits complex morphological and genetic variation and a broad ecological amplitude.
share a large part of their molecular genetic variation.
for the polyploid taxa many hybrid links and introgression from the diploids are suggested.
in spite of the large distributional range, no isolation by distance is found.
species complexes or aggregates consist of a set of closely related species often of different ploidy levels, whose relationships are difficult to reconstruct.
