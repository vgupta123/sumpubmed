the objective of the present study is to reveal the evolutionary history, including key genomic events, associated with the various regions of the mat chromosomes among ten strains representing all the nine known species  contained within the n. tetrasperma species complex.
comparative analysis of sequence divergence among alleles of  <dig> mat-linked genes  indicates that a large region of suppressed recombination exists within the mat chromosome for each of nine lineages of n. tetrasperma sensu latu.
we conclude that the region of suppressed recombination in the mat chromosomes has likely been subjected to independent contraction and/or expansion during the evolutionary history of the n. tetrasperma species complex.
we argue that gene conversions might provide an efficient mechanism of adaptive editing of functional genes, including the removal of deleterious mutations, within the young recombinationally suppressed region of the mat chromosomes.
genealogical analyses among lineages reveals that eight gene conversion events have occurred between homologous mat a and mat a-linked alleles of genes located within the region of restricted recombination during the evolutionary history of n. tetrasperma.
furthermore, we infer that gene conversion events are likely a common phenomenon within this recombinationally suppressed genomic region.
