recognition of  <dig> musical excerpts was investigated as a function of arousal, valence, and emotional intensity ratings of the music.
one week later, participants listened to the  <dig> old and  <dig> new musical excerpts randomly interspersed and were asked to make an old/new decision as well as to indicate arousal and valence of the pieces.
musical excerpts rated as very positive are remembered better.
in the first session the participants judged valence and arousal of the musical pieces.
musical pieces that were rated as very positive were recognized significantly better.
also, we examined the influence of musical structure on memory performance.
specific pieces of music can elicit strong emotions in listeners and, possibly in connection with these emotions, can be remembered even years later.
evidently, strong emotions related to the musical experience facilitate memory formation and retrieval.
