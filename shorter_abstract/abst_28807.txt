finally, western blotting showed an increase in organ of corti akt phosphorylation after simvastatin treatment in vitro.
while research about neuroprotective effects have been conducted in several systems, the effects of statins on the inner ear are largely unknown.
these results suggest a neuroprotective effect of statins in the inner ear, mediated by reduced 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase metabolism and akt activation.
furthermore, we evaluated whether simvastatin increases akt phosphorylation in the organ of corti.
we detected 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase mrna in organ of corti, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .
we evaluated whether the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase is present within the rat cochlea and whether simvastatin is able to protect auditory hair cells from gentamicin-induced apoptotic cell death in a in vitro mouse model.
during the past decade, evidence has emerged that statins also have neuroprotective effects.
research in the retina has shown that simvastatin, a commonly used statin, increases akt phosphorylation in vivo, indicating that the pi3k/akt pathway contributes to the protective effects achieved.
the protective effect of simvastatin was reversed by addition of mevalonate, a downstream metabolite blocked by simvastatin, demonstrating the specificity of protection.
