experimental results show that gecon can extract functionally enriched network modules from real expression data.
biological networks connect genes, gene products to one another.
gene pairs showing negative or positive co-regulation under a given number of conditions are used to construct such gene co-expression network.
we exploit a fast correlogram matrix based technique for capturing the support of each gene pair to construct the network.
a gene co-expression network describes inter-relationships among genes.
we propose an expression pattern based method called gecon to extract gene co-expression network from microarray data.
we apply gecon to both real and synthetic gene expression data.
we construct co-expression network with signed edges to reflect up- and down-regulation between pairs of genes.
in view of the results over several in-silico and real expression datasets, the proposed gecon shows satisfactory performance in predicting co-expression network in a computationally inexpensive way.
we further establish that a simple expression pattern matching is helpful in finding biologically relevant gene network.
we compare our results using the dream  challenge data with three well known algorithms, viz., aracne, clr and mrnet.
it has been observed that expression profiles are sharing local similarity rather than global similarity.
pair-wise supports are computed for each pair of genes based on changing tendencies and regulation patterns of the gene expression.
