drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species.
panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate mic values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.
ast results of the phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration  values measured by the etest method .
the mean time to results  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci.
small numbers of vme , me  and me  were obtained.
no very major errors  were produced.
two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: β-hemolytic streptococci , streptococcus pneumoniae , viridans group streptococci , enterococcus faecium , enterococcus faecalis , other catalase-negative cocci .
a few vme were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for e. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for e. faecium.
we evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent phoenix system .
the phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative ast.
automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing  have become recently available.
major  and minor errors  accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of isolates, respectively.
when needed, species id was determined using molecular methods.
streptococci: essential agreement  and categorical agreement  were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.
