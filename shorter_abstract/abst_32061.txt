these emerging types behave as different strains of bse and were named h-type and l-type according to the high and low molecular mass of the unglycosylated fragment of their proteinase k resistant prion protein .
these results shed some light on the worldwide prevalence of atypical bse.
this classical bse  was probably due to the contamination of the food chain by a single prion strain.
this study supports that, among the bse cases of  <dig> years and older identified in belgium, none was apparently of the h- or l- type.
however, due to the active surveillance and better techniques, two rare variants of bse have been recently reported in different continents without a clear correlation to the bse epidemic.
this is consistent with the very rare occurrence of atypical bse and the restricted dimension of belgium.
therefore, all cases have the features of c-type bse.
this study evaluated the presence of such types in bovine of  <dig> years and older in belgium.
the belgian bse archive contained  <dig> bovines of at least  <dig> years of age.
