a new microarray platform  has recently been developed by affymetrix .
this microarray platform changes the conventional view of transcript analysis since it allows the evaluation of the expression level of a transcript by querying each exon component.
our results point out that summarization methods  do not affect the efficacy of statistical tools in detecting ases.
the intersection of midas and rank product results efficiently moderates the detection of false ases.
to optimize the detection of ases we propose the following workflow: i) data pre-filtering, ii) statistical selection of ases using both midas and rank product, iii) intersection of results derived from the two statistical analyses in order to moderate family-wise errors .
this study was carried out using a semi-synthetic exon-skipping benchmark experiment embedding a total of  <dig> exon skipping events.
midas and rank product methods efficiently detect true ases but they suffer from the lack of multiple test error correction.
