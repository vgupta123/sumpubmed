the mechanisms that differentiate rabies infections into furious and paralytic forms remain undetermined.
these observations provide preliminary evidence that rabv antigen and rna levels are higher in the cerebrum in furious rabies compared to the paralytic form.
more rabv antigen was detected in furious rabies than paralytic in many of the cns regions studied.
there are no neuropathological features in human brains that distinguish furious and paralytic rabies.
a striking inflammatory response was found in paralytic rabies in the brainstem.
in addition, brainstem inflammation, more pronounced in paralytic rabies, may impede viral propagation towards the cerebral hemispheres.
caudal-rostral polarity of viral antigen distribution was found in both clinical forms in order from greatest to least: spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, midline structures , hippocampus, and cerebrum.
in contrast, rabv rna was most abundant in the cerebral midline structures.
in this study, postmortem examination of brain  and spinal cord  specimens was performed in  <dig> rabies-infected dogs, sacrificed shortly after developing the illness.
the rna levels in the spinal cord were comparable in both clinical forms.
this could be due to methodology and/or examination of specimens late in the disease course.
viral rna was found at significantly higher levels in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, midbrain and medulla of dogs with the furious subtype.
