statistical analysis of base variations in snps showed that base transitions accounted for  <dig> % of the total base variations and gene ontology indicated that cotton genes varied greatly in harboring snps ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  snps per gene.
in silico analysis is a double-edged blade to develop est-snp/indel markers.
sanger sequencing of three randomly selected snp markers revealed discrepancy between the in silico predicted sequences and the actual sequencing results.
a total of  <dig>  est-based snp and indel markers were developed by comparing ests between gossypium hirsutum and g. barbadense, mining g. hirsutum unigenes, and analyzing 3′ untranslated region  sequences.
on the one hand, the designed markers can be well used in tetraploid cotton genetic mapping.
and it plays a certain role in revealing transition preference and snp frequency of cotton genes.
availability of molecular markers has proven to be an efficient tool in facilitating progress in plant breeding, which is particularly important in the case of less researched crops such as cotton.
considering the obvious advantages of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion-deletion polymorphisms , expressed sequence tags  were analyzed in silico to identify snps and indels in this study, aiming to develop more molecular markers in cotton.
