we use an information theoretic approach to reconstruct phosphoprotein-cytokine networks in raw  <dig>  macrophage cells.
using the topology of the network derived, we develop a data-driven parsimonious inputâ€“output model of the phosphoprotein-cytokine network.
for the phosphoprotein-cytokine network, this approach not only captures most of the known signaling components involved in cytokine release but also predicts new signaling components involved in the release of cytokines.
reconstruction of biological networks from measured data of different components is a significant challenge in systems biology.
we demonstrate the applicability of our information theoretic approach to reconstruction of biological networks.
the information theoretic approach is based on estimation of mutual information of interactions by using kernel density estimators.
mutual information provides a measure of statistical dependencies between interacting components.
