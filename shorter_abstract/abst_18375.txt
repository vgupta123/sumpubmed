we assessed the gi microbiota composition in pediatric and adolescent patients with all during the course of chemotherapy by comparing stool samples taken before chemotherapy with stool samples collected at varying time points during the chemotherapeutic treatment.
all children and adolescent acute leukemia patients will undergo chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen.
in this study, using 16s rrna marker gene sequences we profile the gi microbial communities of pediatric and adolescent acute leukemia patients before and after chemotherapy treatment and compare with the microbiota of their healthy siblings.
this study provides significant information on gi microbiota populations in immunocompromised children and opens up the potential for developing novel diagnostics based on stool tests and therapies to improve the dysbiotic condition of the microbiota at the time of diagnosis and in the earliest stages of chemotherapy.
the observed microbiota changes are likely the result of several factors including a direct influence of therapeutic compounds on the gut flora and an indirect effect of chemotherapy on the immune system, which, in turn, affects the microbiota.
we elucidated and compared the gi microbiota profiles of patients and their healthy sibling controls via analysis of 16s rrna gene sequencing data.

the microbiota profiles of both patients and control sibling groups are dominated by members of bacteroides, prevotella, and faecalibacterium.
it was possible to distinguish between the patient and control groups based on their microbiota profiles.
at the genus level, both groups shareÂ many taxa in common, but the microbiota diversity of the patient group is significantly lower than that of the control group.
the top taxa include anaerostipes, coprococcus, roseburia, and ruminococcus <dig> with relatively higher abundance in the control group.
our study cohort consisted of  <dig> participants, made up of matched pediatric and adolescent patients with all and a healthy sibling.
the composition of gi microbiome and its changes upon chemotherapy in pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients is poorly understood.
intensive chemotherapy treatment coupled with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotic use could potentially have a long-term effect on the resident gastrointestinal  microbiome.
