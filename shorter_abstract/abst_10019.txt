we showed that high concentrations of iron accumulate in cells surrounding the provascular tissue of p. vulgaris and p. coccineus seeds.
using the perls' prussian blue method, we were able to detect iron in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells, cells near the epidermis, and cells surrounding the provascular tissue.
in contrast to p. vulgaris and p. coccineus, we did not observe iron accumulation in the cells surrounding the provascular tissues of p. lunatus cotyledons.
the presented results emphasize the importance of complementing research in model organisms with analysis in crop plants and they suggest that iron distribution criteria should be integrated into selection strategies for bean biofortification.
here we reveal the distribution of iron in seeds of three phaseolus species including thirteen genotypes of p. vulgaris, p. coccineus, and p. lunatus.
using the non-destructive micro-pixe  technique we show that the tissue in the proximity of the provascular bundles holds up to  <dig> Î¼g g- <dig> of iron, depending on the genotype.
knowledge of where and how iron accumulates in seeds of crop plants will increase the understanding of plant iron metabolism and will assist in the production of staples with increased bioavailable iron.
almost 25% of the world population is affected by iron deficiency, a leading cause of anemia.
a novel iron-rich genotype, nua <dig>  with a high concentration of iron both in the seed coat and cotyledons was bred from a cross between an andean and a mesoamerican genotype.
a sustainable way to reduce iron malnutrition in humans is to develop staple crops with increased content of bioavailable iron.
