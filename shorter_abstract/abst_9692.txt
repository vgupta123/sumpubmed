repeats associated with cenp-a, where the centromere is formed, are subjected to the same evolutionary mechanisms, but constitute minor subsets that exhibit subtle sequence differences from those of the bulk repeats.
on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which are more affected by the above evolutionary mechanisms than are chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  cenp-a associated repeats were also recovered from a second homogeneous array present on each chromosome.
in this paper, we show that the molecular mechanisms by which these arrays evolve are identical in multiple chromosomes: i) accumulation of crossovers that homogenise and expand the arrays into different domains and subdomains that are mostly unshared between homologues and ii) sporadic mutations and conversion events that simultaneously differentiate them from one another.
the mode of evolution of the highly homogeneous higher-order-repeat-containing alpha satellite arrays is still subject to discussion.
while the dna sequence per se is not essential for centromere localisation along an array, it appears that certain sequences can be selected against.
