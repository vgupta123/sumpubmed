for this purpose, we focused on genes whose responses are late when the breast cancer cells are treated with estradiol .
this network is constructed based on an integrated differential equation.
we propose a new model - the dynamic time order network - to distinguish and connect early and later drug responsive gene targets.
then a likelihood ratio test is implemented to infer the time order of any gene expression pair.
our approach has been validated by successfully finding time order relations between genes of the cell cycle system.
however, these genes would represent good candidate biomarkers.
spline regression is applied for an accurate modeling of the time variation of gene expressions.

typical analysis of time-series gene expression data such as clustering or graphical models cannot distinguish between early and later drug responsive gene targets in cancer cells.
more notably, we found late response genes potentially interesting as biomarkers of e <dig> treatment.
