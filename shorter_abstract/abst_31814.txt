one particular modification, cytoplasmic incompatibility, has previously been shown to be dependent on wolbachia density and inversely related to the titer of lytic phage.
woric is undergoing extrachromosomal replication in wri.
the results presented here suggest that woric is the lytic form of wo in d. simulans, is undergoing extrachromosomal replication in wri, and belongs to a conserved family of phages in wolbachia.
the density of phage particles was found to be consistent in individual larvae in a laboratory population.
in this study specific primers were designed to distinguish between these four prophage types in wri, and quantitative pcr was used to measure the titer of bacteriophages in testes, ovaries, embryos and adult flies.
the wri genome has four phage regions, two woribs, one woria and one woric.
