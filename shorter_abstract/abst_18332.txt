the fect/ <dig> vector expresses foreign genes at a very high level, and yet has a greatly reduced biohazard potential.
as well as n. benthamiana, infection of legumes was demonstrated.
in this study, both the coat protein  and triple gene block  genetic segments were eliminated from foxtail mosaic virus to create the "fect" vector series, comprising a deletion of 29% of the genome.
with agroinoculation, a full length, systemically moving virus is no longer necessary for excellent protein yield, since the viral transgene is transcribed and replicates in every infiltrated cell.
plant viral vectors offer high-yield expression of pharmaceutical and commercially important proteins with a minimum of cost and preparation time.
despite many attempts, expression of gfp via syringe agroinoculation of various grass species was very low, reflecting the low agrobacterium-mediated transformation rate of monocots.
the use of agrobacterium tumefaciens has been introduced to deliver the viral vector as a transgene to each plant cell via a simple, nonsterile infiltration technique called "agroinoculation".
viral genes may therefore be deleted to decrease the potential for accidental spread and persistence of the viral vector in the environment.
this viral vector is highly crippled and expresses little or no marker gene within the inoculated leaf.
