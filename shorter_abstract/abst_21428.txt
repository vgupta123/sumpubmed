we describe two higher-order patterns of domain organisation: clusters and bi-directionally associated domain pairs and explore their functional importance and phylogenetic conservation.
we found that all genomes have a higher than expected degree of clustering and more domain pairs in forward  and reverse orientation in different proteins relative to random graphs with identical degree distributions.
structural and genome-scale studies have shown that pairs or groups of domains observed together in a protein are almost always found in only one n to c terminal order and are the result of a single recombination event that has been propagated by duplication of the multi-domain unit.
previous studies of domain organisation have used graph theory to represent the co-occurrence of domains within proteins.
we consider  <dig> genomes across all three kingdoms of life and use domain and protein annotation to understand their functional significance.
in addition, the domains tended to be involved in protein-protein interaction and are able to function as independent structural units.
recognising these patterns and unravelling how they have arisen may allow us to understand the functional relationships between domains and understand how the protein repertoire has evolved.
this illustrated the importance of functional and structural constraints  on domain organisation.
most of the time, the linear order of domains is conserved.
to identify these features and assess their statistical significance, we represent the linear order of domains in proteins as a directed graph and apply graph theoretical methods.
looking in detail at the proteins involved, we found strong functional relationships within each cluster.
however, using the directed graph representation we have identified non-linear features of domain organization that are over-represented in genomes.
