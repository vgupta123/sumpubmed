for the statistical analysis we first fit several nonlinear mixed effect regression models to the longitudinal profiles and then used an anova likelihood ratio method in order to test for significant differences between the profiles.
anova and likelihood ratio tests suggest that there are significant differences between the glucose consumption rate profiles for cells that had been--or had not been--preconditioned by heat during growth.
furthermore, pair-wise t-tests reveal significant differences in the longitudinal profiles for glucose consumption rates between optimal conditions and heat stress, optimal and recovery conditions, and heat stress and recovery conditions .
in this work, we study longitudinal time series profiles of glucose consumption in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae under different temperatures and preconditioning regimens, which we obtained with methods of in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy.
the results are short time series consisting of relatively sparse data that cannot be analyzed effectively with standard time series techniques, such as autocorrelation and frequency domain methods.
among several nonlinear mixed-effects regression models tested, a three-parameter logistic function represents the data with highest accuracy.
