dna sequencing revealed fifty five open reading frames, including twenty five homologs to mu-like bacteriophage proteins: nlp, phage transposase-c-terminal, cog <dig>  gam-like protein, gp <dig>  mor, peptidoglycan recognition protein, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gpg, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gpl, phage tail tube protein, dna circulation protein, gpp, gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  cog <dig>  tail fiber protein gp37-c terminal, tail fiber assembly protein, and com.
characterization was done by genomic comparison to enterobacteriophage mu and proteomic identification of various homologs by mass spectrometry.
twenty protein homologs to bacteriophage proteins, including  <dig> structural proteins, one lysogeny-related and one lysis-related protein, and three dna replication proteins were identified by mass spectrometry.
haemophilus parasuis, the causative agent of glässer’s disease, is prevalent in swine herds and clinical signs associated with this disease are meningitis, polyserositis, polyarthritis, and bacterial pneumonia.
mu-like bacteriophages are related phyologenetically to enterobacteriophage mu and are thought to carry virulence genes or to induce host expression of virulence genes.
the last open reading frame was homologous to is <dig>  the g + c content of bacteriophage sumu was  <dig> % while its h. parasuis host genome’s g + c content was  <dig> %.
this is the first report of isolation and characterization of this bacteriophage from the myoviridae family, a double-stranded dna bacteriophage with a contractile tail, from a virulent field isolate of h. parasuis.
one of the tail proteins, gp <dig>  may be a virulence-related protein.
insufficient colostral antibody at weaning or the mixing of pigs with heterologous virulent h. parasuis strains from other farm sources in the nursery or grower-finisher stage are considered to be factors for the outbreak of glässer’s disease.
previously, a mu-like bacteriophage portal gene was detected in a virulent swine isolate of h. parasuis by nested polymerase chain reaction.
this study characterizes the mu-like bacteriophage, named sumu, isolated from a virulent h. parasuis isolate.
bacteriophage sumu was characterized by genomic and proteomic methods and compared to enterobacteriophage mu.
the genome size of bacteriophage sumu was  <dig>  bp.
