caver was primarily developed for proteins, but the algorithm is sufficiently robust to allow the analysis of any molecular system, including nucleic acids or inorganic material.
the main aim of this study was to develop and implement an algorithm for the rapid, accurate and automated identification of paths leading from buried protein clefts, pockets and cavities in dynamic and static protein structures to the outside solvent.
the program identifies and visualizes routes from the interior of the protein to the bulk solvent.
the algorithm to perform a skeleton search was based on a reciprocal distance function grid that was developed and implemented for the caver program.
the algorithm is sufficiently rapid and robust to enable routine analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories containing thousands of snapshots.
