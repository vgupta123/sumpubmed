to date, more than  <dig> million scientific papers can be found in pubmed, with many of them containing descriptions of a wide range of biological processes.
although the accuracy of andsystem is comparable to other well known text-mining tools, such as pathway studio and string, it outperforms them in having the ability to identify an increased number of interaction types.
sufficient knowledge of molecular and genetic interactions, which comprise the entire basis of the functioning of living systems, is one of the necessary requirements for successfully answering almost any research question in the field of biology and medicine.
the use of andsystem, in combination with pathway studio and string, can improve the quality of the automated reconstruction of molecular and genetic networks.
the andsystem package was developed for the reconstruction and analysis of molecular genetic networks based on an automated text-mining technique.
it provides a detailed description of the various types of interactions between genes, proteins, microrna's, metabolites, cellular components, pathways and diseases, taking into account the specificity of cell lines and organisms.
