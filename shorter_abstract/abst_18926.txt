activation of inflammasome contributes to the clearance of intracellular bacteria.
the bacterial counts of x <dig> in mice decreased, while those of x <dig> increased over the time after infection.
a recombinant s. typhimurium strain expressing fusion protein of the n-terminal ssph <dig>  and c-terminal esci was constructed and designated as x <dig>  in vitro assay showed that x <dig> significantly enhanced il-1Î² and il- <dig> secretion  and pyroptotic cell death of mouse peritoneal macrophages, compared with those infected with control strain, x <dig>  in vivo studies showed that colonization of x <dig> in both spleen and liver were significantly lower than that of x <dig> .
fusion protein ssph2-esci may be translocated into macrophages and activate nlrc <dig> inflammasome, which limits salmonella colonization in spleen and liver of mice.
c-terminus of e. coli esci protein can activate nlrc <dig>  inflammasome in macrophages.
