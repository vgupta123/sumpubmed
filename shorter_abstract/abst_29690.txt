this enhancement was neutralized if serum was digested with chondroinitase abc.
ccr <dig> downregulation on ccr5-transfected cho cells or human monocytes is increased by preincubation of ccl <dig> with serum or chondroitinsulfate a.
chemokines immobilized on endothelial cells play a central role in the induced firm adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes.
activation of platelets at sites of vascular injury is considered to support leukocyte adhesion and extravasation.
we therefore analyzed the impact of platelet derived glycosaminoglycans on the immobilization of the chemokine ccl <dig>  on human microvascular endothelial cells and their influence on ccl5-ccr <dig> interactions.
we confirm that undiluted serum in contrast to plasma decreases binding of ccl <dig> to endothelial cells.
however, when lower concentrations of serum were used, ccl5-presentation on endothelial cells was markedly enhanced.
using different chondroitinsulfate-subtypes we demonstrate that chondroitinsulfate a mediates the enhanced presentation of ccl <dig> on endothelial cells, whereas chondroitinsulfate b/c even at low concentrations block ccl <dig> binding.
we show that chondroitinsulfate a released from platelets increases the binding of chemokines to endothelial cells and supports receptor internalization in a dose dependent manner.
