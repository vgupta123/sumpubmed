given the inappropriate appearance of regions of heterochromatin in baz1b knockout cells, it is evident that wstf performs a critical role in maintaining chromatin and transcriptional states, a property that is likely compromised by wstf haploinsufficiency in wbs patients.
our results show that, while heterochromatin at the xi is unaltered, new inappropriate areas of heterochromatin spontaneously form and resolve throughout the nucleus, appearing as large dapi-dense staining blocks, defined by histone h <dig> lysine- <dig> trimethylation and association of the proteins heterochromatin protein  <dig> and structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing  <dig>  in three independent mutants, the expression of a large number of genes were impacted, both up and down, by wstf loss.
williams syndrome transcription factor  is a multifaceted protein that is involved in several nuclear processes, including replication, transcription, and the dna damage response.
to explore the function of wstf, we performed zinc finger nuclease-assisted targeting of the baz1b gene and isolated several independent knockout clones in human cells.
