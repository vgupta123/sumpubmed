we have tested the method also on synthetic data, where the injection location is known.
we have developed intacteye, a software package that uses two orthogonal images of the intact retina to locate focal injections of a dye.
intacteye allows the user to precisely specify the location and size of a retinal injection from two orthogonal images taken of the eye.
we are solving the abstract problem of locating a point on a spherical object from two orthogonal images, which might have applications outside the field of neuroscience.

this bypasses the dissection step, avoiding unnecessary damage to the retina, and speeds up data acquisition.
to study the mapping from the retina to the brain, typically a small region of the retina is injected with a dye, which then propagates to the retina’s target structures.
our method compares well to the projection method and to the retistruct package, which both use the flattened retina as a starting point.
