a second correlation analysis revealed a more complex relation between the differentiation stage in acute myeloid leukemia and p <dig> protein isoforms.
we validated this technique on a set of simulated 2de images, which revealed also correct working under the presence of normalization factors.
we developed an analysis technique to measure correlation between 2de images and biological variables on a pixel by pixel basis.
this was followed by an analysis of p <dig> 2de immunoblots from cancer cells, known to have unique signaling networks.
the presented analysis method measures relations between 2de images and external variables without requiring spot detection, thereby enabling the exploration of biosignatures of complex signaling networks in biological systems.
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  is a powerful technique to examine post-translational modifications of complexly modulated proteins.
since p <dig> is altered through these signaling networks, we expected to find correlations between the cancer type  and the p <dig> profiles.
