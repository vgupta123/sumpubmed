pig  is a major source of dietary proteins for human consumption and is becoming a valuable model in agricultural and biomedical research.
<dig> breed-deps were selected by go analysis, including  <dig> myofibrillar proteins.
thus,  <dig> myogenic breed-deps selected from last two stages were analyzed by string, which showed that some myofibrillar proteins  and functional proteins , together with candidate myogenic proteins , probably participate in the regulatory network of myofiber formation.
our itraq-based early embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle study of lr and wzs provides new data on the in vivo muscle development distinctions during early embryonic development, which contributes to the improved understanding in the regulation mechanism of early myogenesis in agricultural animals.
only myhci/iia mrna were detected due to early embryonic stages, and significantly higher expression of them were found in wzs during these  <dig> stages.
myhci was first found in wzs at  <dig> dpc and expressed in both breeds at later stages, while myhcii protein was not detected until  <dig> dpc in both breeds.
the itraq-based early embryonic longissimus dorsi muscle study of lr and wzs ranging from  <dig> to 42 days post coitus  identified a total of  <dig> proteins from <dig>  peptides, which were matched with  <dig>  spectra at a false discovery rate of 5 %.
