in the firmicutes, the majority of the phylotypes within the clostridiales were assigned to clostridium clusters xiva , xi  and i .
taxonomic analysis of 16s rrna gene clone libraries  revealed a microbiota dominated by firmicutes , followed by a minority of actinobacteria , proteobacteria  and fusobacteria .
thus, our results question the role of the domestic cat as the best available model for nutritional intervention studies in endangered exotic felids.

this marked underrepresentation is in contrast to data previously reported in domestic cats where bacteroidetes and bifidobacteriaceae are common residents of the faecal microbiota.
members of the bacteroidetes phylum and bifidobacteriaceae, two groups that can positively contribute in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, were absent in the clone libraries and detected in only marginal to low levels in real-time pcr analyses.
next to methodological differences, these findings may also reflect the apparent differences in dietary habits of both felid species.
we determined the phylogenetic diversity of the faecal microbiota of the only two cheetahs housed in an eaza associated zoo in flanders, belgium, to gain first insights in the relative distribution, identity and potential role of the major community members.
