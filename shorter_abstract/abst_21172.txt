our data indicated that ires-mediated translational activity was not linked to fmdv host range.
ires-mediated translation activity of fmdv was not predictive of its host range.
although, itafs are known to promote ires-mediated translation, these findings were confirmed only in cells derived from fmdv-insusceptible animals so far.
this process is facilitated by cellular factors known as ires trans-acting factors .
furthermore, we analyzed the effect of the cellular factors on ires-mediated translation by silencing the cellular factors using sirna in both fmdv-susceptible and -insusceptible animal cells.
we evaluated and compared the ires-mediated translation activities among cell lines derived from four different animal species using bicistronic luciferase reporter plasmid, which possesses an fmdv-ires element between renilla and firefly luciferase genes.
translation of the viral rna is initiated by internal entry of the 40s ribosome within the ires element.
foot-and-mouth disease  is host-restricted disease for cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle and pigs, but the factors determining the host range have not been identified yet.
thus, ptb and 4e-bp <dig> may influence the host range of fmdv.
itaf <dig> promoted ires-mediated translation in all cell lines, and the effects of poly-pyrimidine tract binding protein  and eukaryotic initiation factor 4e-binding protein  <dig>  were observed only in fmdv-susceptible cells.
itaf <dig> promoted ires-mediated translation in all cells, and the effects of ptb and 4e-bp <dig> were observed only in fmdv-susceptible cells.
foot-and-mouth disease virus  possess a positive sense, single stranded rna genome.
