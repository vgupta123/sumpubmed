despite the notable similarity in potential factors responsible for host invasion and antibiotic resistance, other factors including several crucial virulence factors and heat shock proteins were absent in the plant-associated dsm14405t.
we used comparative genomics as well as transcriptomic and physiological approaches to detect significant borders between the stenotrophomonas strains: the multi-drug resistant pathogenic s. maltophilia and the plant-associated strains s. maltophilia r551- <dig> and s. rhizophila dsm14405t .
instead, s. rhizophila dsm14405t possessed unique genes for the synthesis and transport of the plant-protective spermidine, plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, and high salinity tolerance.
in recent years, the number of human infections caused by opportunistic pathogens has increased dramatically.
we found an overall high degree of sequence similarity between the genomes of all three strains.
