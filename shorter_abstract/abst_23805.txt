here, a novel amino acid similarity matrix  is directly derived from the binding affinity data of combinatorial peptide mixtures.
a novel amino acid similarity matrix has been derived for peptide:mhc binding interactions.
one prominent feature of the matrix is that it disfavors substitution of residues with opposite charges.
experts in peptide:mhc binding studies are often able to estimate the impact of a single residue substitution based on a heuristic understanding of amino acid similarity in an experimental context.
given that the matrix was derived from experimentally determined peptide:mhc binding affinity measurements, this feature is likely shared by all peptide:protein interactions.
we also carried out a large-scale benchmark, and its results indicate that prediction performance of the new method is comparable to that of the best neural network based approaches for peptide:mhc class i binding.
to demonstrate its usefulness, we have developed a new peptide:mhc class i binding prediction method, using the matrix as a bayesian prior.
in addition, we have demonstrated the usefulness of the matrix as a bayesian prior in an improved scoring-matrix based peptide:mhc class i prediction method.
our aim is to quantify this measure of similarity to improve peptide:mhc binding prediction methods.
