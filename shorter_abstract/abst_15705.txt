our data supports the irano-caucasian origin of the moroccan apricots and their original introduction by phoenicians and arabs through the north african shore.
the genetic diversity in the s-locus of local apricots  from different oasis ecosystems in morocco and the comparison of the occurrence and frequency of s-alleles with other regions may allow testing the validity of previous theories on the origin and dissemination of north african apricots.
the loss of genetic diversity in apricot might be explained by the occurrence of self-compatibility and the length of time that apricot has spent with this breeding system in an environment without its wild relatives, such as the moroccan oases or central europe.
sc was the most frequent s-allele in this germplasm, followed by s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  new approaches  were designed for a reliable verification of the rare or unexpected alleles.
allelic diversity of the s-locus is attributed to the genetic relationships among genotypes and sexual reproduction strategy.
