the keratinocytes were cultured to a proliferative or a differentiated state mimicking basal or suprabasal layers of human epidermis.
to go further into the biological meaning of this mirna response, we over-expressed some of the responding mirna in proliferating cells: we observed a significant decrease of cell viability 72 hours after irradiation.
functional annotation of their predicted targets revealed that g-protein related pathways might be regulated by these responding mirnas.
we found that proliferative cells irradiated at 6 gy display a global fall of mirna expression whereas differentiated cells exposed to the same dose display a global increase of mirnas expression.
micrornas , a group of short non-coding rnas that negatively regulate gene expression, have recently emerged as potential modulators of cellular response to ionizing radiations both in vitro and in vivo in various cell types and tissues.
however, in epidermal cells, the involvement of the mirna machinery in the cellular response to ionizing radiations remains to be clarified.
our results reveal that human primary keratinocytes exposed to ionizing irradiation expressed a mirna pattern strongly related to the differentiation status of irradiated cells.
we also demonstrate that some mirnas play a role in the radiation response to ensure the short-term survival of irradiated keratinocytes.
we identified twenty mirnas weakly but significantly modulated after 6 gy irradiation, whereas only  <dig> mirnas were modulated after low-dose irradiation in proliferating cells.
