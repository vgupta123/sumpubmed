oas-tl enzyme isoforms are localised in the cytoplasm, the plastids and mitochondria but the contribution of individual oas-tl isoforms to plant sulphur metabolism has not yet been fully clarified.
consistent with its semi-dominant behaviour, wild type ler- <dig> plants transformed with the mutated old3- <dig> gene, displayed the early leaf death phenotype.
thus, the early leaf death phenotype depends on two semi-dominant loci.
the second locus that determines the old3- <dig> early leaf death phenotype is referred to as odd-ler  and is located on chromosome  <dig>  the early leaf death phenotype is temperature dependent and is associated with increased expression of defence-response and oxidative-stress marker genes.
o-acetylserine  lyase  catalyses the final step of cysteine biosynthesis.
the seedling lethal phenotype of the arabidopsis onset of leaf death3- <dig>  mutant is due to a point mutation in the oas-a <dig> gene, encoding the cytosolic oas-tl.
the cytosolic oas-tl is involved in maintaining organic sulphur levels.
independent of the presence of the odd-ler gene, oas-a <dig> is involved in maintaining sulphur and thiol levels and is required for resistance against cadmium stress.
cysteine is a component in organic compounds including glutathione that have been implicated in the adaptation of plants to stresses.
