fisher’s α measure of species diversity and second order jackknife estimate of species richness were not sensitive to number of individuals sampled.
fisher’s α for species diversity and second order jackknife for species richness were robust measures.
imperfect detection from less intensive sampling method results incorrect estimates of abundance of herpetofauna.
by combining traditional open quadrats used for sampling forest floor herpetofauna with intensive bounded quadrats, we explore the effect of sampling error on estimates of species richness, diversity, and density in the andaman islands.
it influenced relative abundance of individual species resulting in underestimation of abundance of small or camouflaged species; and also resulted in low precision in lizard species richness estimates.
