in this study, to obtain more detailed expression profiles of genes involved in the initial stages of the er stress response in rice, we performed rna sequencing of wild-type and transgenic rice plants produced by homologous recombination in which endogenous genomic osire <dig> was replaced by missense alleles defective in ribonuclease activity.
to understand the molecular mechanisms of the er stress response in rice , we previously analyzed the expression profile of stably transformed rice in which an er stress sensor/transducer osire <dig> was knocked-down, using the combination of preliminary microarray and quantitative rt-pcr.
therefore, rna sequencing-mediated expression profiling provided valuable information about the er stress response in rice plants and led to the discovery of new genes related to er stress.

at least  <dig>  transcripts were investigated by rna sequencing,  <dig> of which responded to er stress at a statistically significant level .
furthermore, we successfully identified  <dig> genes from the set of  <dig> er stress-responsive genes that were not included in the probe set of the currently available microarray chip in rice.
