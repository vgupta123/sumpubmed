here we performed a comprehensive database survey and identified a total of  <dig> cyp genes, located on  <dig> different chromosomes in the soybean genome , of which  <dig> are multi- and  <dig> are single-domain proteins.
overall, we have identified  <dig> cyp genes in the soybean genome, the largest cyp gene family known to date.
expression analysis of gmcyp genes in soybean tissues displayed their differential tissue specific expression patterns.
the expansion of gmcyp genes in soybean, and their distribution pattern on the chromosomes strongly suggest genome-wide segmental and tandem duplications.
studies have demonstrated the importance of many ppiases in plant biology, but no genome-wide analysis of the cyp gene family has been conducted for a legume species.
this is the first genome-wide study of the cyp gene family of a legume species.
