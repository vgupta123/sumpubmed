both positions have been proposed based on morphological data.
using mitochondrial genomic data, as well as data from the nuclear 18s, 28s rdna and elongation factor-1Î± genes, we revealed incongruence between mitochondrial and nuclear data regarding the placement of trichobranchidae.
mammalian studies provide one such case of conflict where mitochondrial data, which display compositional biases, support the marsupionta hypothesis, but nuclear data confirm the theria hypothesis.
mitochondrial data favored a sister relationship between terebellidae and trichobranchidae, but nuclear data placed trichobranchidae as sister to an ampharetidae/alvinellidae clade.
for instance, molecular data from different cellular components, such as the mitochondrion and nucleus, may be inconsistent with each other.
our investigation revealed that mitochondrial data of ampharetidae and alvinellidae exhibited strong compositional biases.
this situation is due to apparent symplesiomorphic characters and known as "the symplesiomorphy trap".
herein, we document that trichobranchidae was apparently caught in the symplesiomorphy trap suggesting that in certain situations even homologies can be misleading.
for phylogenetic reconstructions, conflict in signal is a potential problem for tree reconstruction.
most observations of compositional biases in tree reconstruction have focused on lineages with different composition than the majority of the lineages under analysis.
