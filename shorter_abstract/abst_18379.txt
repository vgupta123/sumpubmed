antimicrobial peptides represent a source of potential novel antibiotics to combat resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus .
furthermore, twenty-two novel virulence factors were inferred, while the vrars two-component system and phou-mediated persister formation were implicated in mrsa tolerance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.
we developed a systems-wide functional association network approach to integrate proteome and transcriptome profiles, enabling study of drug resistance and mode of action.
this work demonstrates a powerful integrative approach to study drug resistance and mode of action.
a promising antimicrobial peptide is ranalexin, which has potent activity against gram-positive bacteria, and particularly s. aureus.
the functional association network was constructed by bayesian logistic regression, providing a framework for identification of antimicrobial peptide  response modules from s. aureus mrsa- <dig> transcriptome and proteome profiling.
these signatures of ranalexin treatment revealed multiple killing mechanisms, including cell wall activity.
cell wall effects were supported by gene disruption and osmotic fragility experiments.
