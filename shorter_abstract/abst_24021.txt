this process is sub-optimal in that it can average out peaks from peptides that are present in low abundance or are unevenly distributed across the spot, particularly because the amount of noise varies considerably between sub-spectra.
this argues for analysing sub-spectra separately and combining results afterwards.
here, we propose to analyse these sub-spectra one-by-one and combine the results using a framework which includes a significance test.
moreover, our method provides an implicit deconvolution of peaks, yielding insight in the actual shape of a peak, potentially aiding in a deeper understanding of peak distribution.
the final spectrum is then constructed by summing over all these sub-spectra.
this allows one to, for the first time, attach a confidence measure to detected peaks, based on the signal strength of a peak across sub-spectra.
