the cobra toolbox for matlab is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology.
the opencobra project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software.
cobrapy is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression.
due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply cobra methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes.
here, we describe cobra for python , a python package that provides support for basic cobra methods.
cobrapy does not require matlab to function; however, it includes an interface to the cobra toolbox for matlab to facilitate use of legacy codes.
