amongst  <dig> identified proteins of the  <dig> kegg orthologues that correlated with methane emissions, only  <dig> showed 100 % identity with a publicly available protein sequence.
genes less abundant in high emitters included acetate kinase, electron transport complex proteins rnfc and rnfd and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.
the abundance of archaeal genes in ruminal digesta correlated strongly with differing methane emissions from individual animals, a finding useful for genetic screening purposes.
as individual animals produce consistently different quantities of methane, understanding the basis for these differences may lead to new opportunities for mitigating ruminal methane emissions.
four pairs of beef cattle were selected for extreme high and low methane emissions from  <dig> animals, matched for breed  and diet .
metagenomics is a powerful new tool for understanding the composition and function of complex microbial communities.
large numbers of predicted protein sequences differed between high- and low-methane-emitting cattle.
it has been estimated that ruminant livestock produce ca.
16s rrna gene abundances indicated that archaea, predominantly methanobrevibacter, were  <dig> × more numerous  in high emitters, whereas among bacteria proteobacteria, predominantly succinivibrionaceae, were 4-fold less abundant .
kegg analysis revealed that archaeal genes leading directly or indirectly to methane production were  <dig> -fold more abundant in high emitters.
community analysis was carried out by qpcr of 16s and 18s rrna genes and by alignment of illumina hiseq reads to the greengenes database.
here we have applied metagenomics to the rumen microbial community to identify differences in the microbiota and metagenome that lead to high- and low-methane-emitting cattle phenotypes.
