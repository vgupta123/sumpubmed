these qtl explaining a large proportion of the genotypic variance can be exploited in marker-assisted selection programs and are candidates for further genetic dissection.
in contrast, thousand-kernel weight, test weight, falling number and starch content were affected by several major qtl with a high frequency of occurrence in cross validation.
qtl analyses revealed a total of  <dig> qtl for pop-a and  <dig> for pop-b.
we used  <dig> f3: <dig> inbred lines from two biparental populations  fingerprinted with about  <dig> to  <dig> snp, ssr and/or dart markers and outcrossed them to a tester for phenotyping.
qtl mapping was successfully applied based on two segregating rye populations.
the resulting hybrids and their parents were evaluated for grain yield, single-ear weight, test weight, plant height, thousand-kernel weight, falling number, protein, starch, soluble and total pentosan contents in up to ten environments in central europe.
qtl underlying grain yield and several quality traits had small effects.
the quality of the phenotypic data was high reflected by moderate to high heritability estimates.
rye is an important european crop used for food, feed, and bioenergy.
profound knowledge of the genetic architecture of these traits is needed to successfully implement marker-assisted selection programs.
