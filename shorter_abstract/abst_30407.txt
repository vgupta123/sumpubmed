the transcriptomic response of c. jejuni nctc  <dig> to erythromycin  treatment was determined by competitive microarray hybridizations.
exposure to a sub-inhibitory dose of ery resulted in differential expression of much fewer genes.
following the treatment with an inhibitory dose of ery,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated.
up-regulation of motility and down-regulation of energy metabolism likely facilitate campylobacter to survive during ery treatment.
the mechanisms employed by campylobacter jejuni to adapt to erythromycin treatment remain unknown and are examined in this study.
these findings indicate that ery treatment elicits a range of changes in c. jejuni transcriptome and affects the expression of genes important for in vitro and in vivo adaptation.
although mutation of the two operons did not alter the susceptibility of c. jejuni to antimicrobials, it reduced campylobacter growth under high-level oxygen.
another notable finding is the consistent up-regulation of cj1169c-cj1170c, of which cj1170c encodes a known phosphokinase, an important regulatory protein in c. jejuni.
mutation of the cj1169c-cj1170c rendered c. jejuni less tolerant to atmospheric oxygen and reduced campylobacter colonization and transmission in chickens.
