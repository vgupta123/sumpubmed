we compared the tgf-β-related signalling properties in b-cell lymphoma cell lines that were sensitive or resistant to tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects.
tgf-β sensitive cell lines expressed higher cell surface levels of the activin receptor-like kinase  <dig> , a tgf-β receptor type  <dig>  the expression levels of the other tgf-β and bone morphogenetic protein receptors were comparable in the different cell lines.
alk- <dig> was highly expressed in the sensitive cell lines, and might be important for signalling through smad1/ <dig>  our results indicate a role for p <dig> mapk in the regulation of tgf-β-induced anti-proliferative effects.
we suggest that phosphorylation of smad1/ <dig> is important for the anti-proliferative effects of tgf-β in b-cell lymphoma.
in contrast, activation of smad1/ <dig> was restricted to cells that were sensitive to growth inhibition by tgf-β.
up-regulation of the tgf-β target genes id <dig> and pai- <dig> was identified in the tgf-β sensitive cell lines.
constitutive phosphorylation of mapk p <dig> was restricted to the tgf-β sensitive cell lines.
tgf-β-induced phosphorylation of smad <dig> was similar in tgf-β sensitive and resistant cell lines.
