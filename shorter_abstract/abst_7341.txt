this will facilitate high imputation accuracy, also for rare alleles.
genomic selection and diversity studies profited only marginally from imputing missing values.

the accuracy of marker imputation depended strongly on the linkage disequilibrium between the markers in the reference panel and the markers to be imputed.
the main goal of our study was to investigate the implementation, prospects, and limits of marker imputation for quantitative genetic studies contrasting map-independent and map-dependent algorithms.
our results clearly showed that imputation accuracy was substantially higher for map-dependent compared to map-independent methods.
for the decay of linkage disequilibrium present in european wheat, we concluded that around  <dig>  markers are needed for low cost, low-density marker profiling.
we used a diversity panel consisting of  <dig> european elite wheat  varieties, which had been genotyped with snp arrays, and performed intensive simulation studies.
