the supplementation of bglp significantly enhanced the glucose yield from sugarcane bagasse, especially in the presence of high concentrations of glucose or xylose.
so there is ongoing interest in searching for glucose- and xylose-stimulated β-glucosidases to increase the efficiency of hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass.
β-glucosidase is claimed as a key enzyme in cellulose hydrolysis.
the cellulosic fibers are usually entrapped with hemicelluloses containing xylose.
furthermore, bglp showed obvious advantages in the hydrolysis when initial concentrations of glucose and xylose are high.
the activity of bglp is dramatically stimulated by glucose or xylose at concentrations up to  <dig>  m. after bglp was added to celluclast®  <dig>  l, the conversion of sugarcane bagasse was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, which was much higher than of celluclast®  <dig>  l alone.
