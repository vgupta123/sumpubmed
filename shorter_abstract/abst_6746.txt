fish analysis shows a heterogeneous copy number of fut <dig> in yb2/ <dig> nuclei with  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  mean copy number.
the cdnas contain an open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding a  <dig> amino acid sequence showing 94% and 88% identity to human and pig orthologs, respectively.
however, important variations of the fucose content of recombinant mabs are observed in production culture conditions.
bioinformatics analysis of the minimal promoter regions upstream exons e- <dig> and e- <dig>  governing the transcription of t <dig> and t <dig> transcripts, respectively, evidenced several consensus sequences for potential transcriptional repressors.
the rat hybridoma cell line yb2/ <dig> appears a good candidate for the large-scale production of low fucose recombinant mabs due to its lower expression of fut <dig> gene than other commonly used rodent cell lines.
transient transfections of rat <dig> cells with transcription factor expression vectors allowed identifying klf <dig> as a putative repressor of t <dig> transcript in rat <dig> cells.
altogether, these data contribute to a better knowledge of fut <dig> expression in yb2/ <dig> that will be useful to better control the fucosylation of recombinant mabs produced in these cells.
luciferase assays allow defining the minimal promoting regions governing the initiation of the two transcripts, which are differentially expressed in yb2/ <dig> as shown by duplex taqman qpcr analysis.
