simulation with gemsim can help overcome this problem, by providing insights into the error profiles of individual sequencing runs and allowing researchers to assess the effects of these errors on downstream data analysis.
we demonstrate gemsim's value by deriving error models from two different illumina sequencing runs and one roche/ <dig> run, and comparing and contrasting the resulting error profiles of each run.
variation between error profiles interacted strongly with varscan's 'minumum average quality' parameter, resulting in different optimal settings for different sequencing runs.
next-generation sequencing has unprecedented potential for assessing genetic diversity, however analysis is complicated as error profiles can vary noticeably even between different runs of the same technology.
in general, snp-calling using varscan was only accurate for snps with frequency > 3%, independent of which error model was used to simulate the data.
