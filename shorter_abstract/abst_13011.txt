one key problem with the mass spectrometric analysis of peptides and proteins, however, is the fact that absolute quantification is severely hampered by the unclear relationship between the observed peak intensity and the peptide concentration in the sample.
thus, it would be a valuable tool towards label-free absolute quantification.
while there are numerous approaches to circumvent this problem experimentally , reliable prediction of the peak intensities from peptide sequences could provide a peptide-specific correction factor.
based on these features, two advanced machine learning methods  are shown to yield good results for this problem .
the techniques presented here are a useful first step going beyond the binary prediction of proteotypic peptides towards a more quantitative prediction of peak intensities.
in this work we present machine learning techniques for peak intensity prediction for maldi mass spectra.
mass spectrometry is a key technique in proteomics and can be used to analyze complex samples quickly.
these predictions in turn will turn out to be beneficial for mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics.
