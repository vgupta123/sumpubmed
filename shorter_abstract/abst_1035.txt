from wes data, we identified five distinct cnv loci from a nshl family, but they were not co-segregated among patients.
here, we present a multiphasic cnv, linkage, and snv analysis of wes data for the identification of a candidate mutation causing nshl.
we designed a multiphasic analysis of copy number variation , linkage, and single nucleotide variation  of whole exome sequencing  data for the efficient discovery of mutations causing nonsyndromic hearing loss .

our stepwise, multiphasic approach enabled us to expedite the discovery of disease-causing variants from a large number of patient variants.
