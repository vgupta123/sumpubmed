the use of growth-promoters in beef cattle, despite the eu ban, remains a frequent practice.
one cluster included negative controls and a subset of commercial samples, while a second cluster included part of the specimens collected at the slaughterhouse together with positives for corticosteroid treatment based on thymus histology and lc-ms. functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes  between the two groups provided further evidence that animals clustering with positive samples might have been treated with corticosteroids.
despite broad variation observed in gene expression profiles, the present study showed that dna-microarrays can be used to find transcriptomic signatures of putative anabolic treatments and that gene expression markers could represent a useful screening tool.
here, for the first time commercial samples were analyzed.
dna-microarray technology was used to obtain transcriptomic profiles of skeletal muscle in commercial samples and negative controls.
lc-ms confirmed the presence of low level of dex residues in the urine of the commercial samples suspect for histological classification.
principal component analysis  on microarray data identified two clusters of samples.
