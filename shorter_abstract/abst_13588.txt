the presence of one b-type haem in lcprr as a co-factor was confirmed by  metal analysis,  solvent extraction,  bipyridyl assay and  detection of haem-b specific m/z values via mass-spectrometry.
purified lcprr had a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg at 30 °c and degraded poly to a mixture of oligoisoprene molecules with terminal keto and aldehyde groups.
biodegradation of rubber  is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the polyisoprene backbone and is performed either by an extracellular rubber oxygenase  from gram-negative rubber degrading bacteria or by a latex clearing protein  secreted by gram-positive rubber degrading bacteria.
a gene of r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> that coded for a polyisoprene-cleaving latex clearing protein  was identified, cloned, expressed in escherichia coli and purified.

our data point to substantial differences in the active sites of lcp proteins obtained from different rubber degrading bacteria.
the ph optimum of lcprr was higher  than for other rubber-cleaving enzymes .
only little is known on the biochemistry of polyisoprene cleavage by lcp and on the types and functions of the involved cofactors.
