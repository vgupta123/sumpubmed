target function was predicted by comparison to arabidopsis proteins; the  <dig> targets  identified included transcription factors and other genes, most of which involved in the response to various stresses.
no mirnas from globe artichoke have been described to date.
the expression level of selected mirnas was monitored by quantitative real-time pcr.
some mirnas were differentially expressed according to tissue or condition, magnitude of variation after salt stress being more pronounced in roots.
plant micrornas  are involved in post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of several processes, including the response to biotic and abiotic stress, often contributing to the adaptive response of the plant to adverse conditions.
conserved and novel mirnas were discovered using accepted criteria.
the mirnaome from artichoke, including novel mirnas, was unveiled, providing useful information on the expression in different organs and conditions.
targets were predicted and validated for their cleavage site.
in addition to conserved mirnas, found in a wide range of plant species a number of novel species-specific mirnas, displaying lower levels of expression can be found.
we analyzed the mirnaome from artichoke by deep sequencing four srna libraries obtained from nacl stressed and control leaves and roots.
a total of  <dig> artichoke mirnas were identified,  <dig>  of which were conserved with other plant species, and  <dig> were novel.
