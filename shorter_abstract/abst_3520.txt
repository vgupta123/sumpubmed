our de novo assembly of rna-seq data produced a large set of sequences which included many duplicates and fragments.

additionally, the observed changes in a large set of transcript expression levels are indicative of a complex response to the varied petroleum components to which the fish were exposed.
to assess genomic changes, we quantified mrna expression using high throughput sequencing technologies  in f. grandis populations in the marshes and estuaries impacted by dh oil release.
this application of rna-seq to a non-model, wild, and ecologically significant organism is an important evaluation of the technology to quickly assess similar events in the future.
to better understand the effects on a vertebrate genome, we studied gene expression in the salt marsh minnow fundulus grandis, which is local to the northern coast of the gulf of mexico and is a sister species of the ecotoxicological model fundulus heteroclitus.
in addition a response to hypoxic conditions and an immune response are also indicated.
several genes in the choriogenin family were down-regulated in the exposed group; a response that is consistent with ah exposure.
these genes indicate a broad and complex genomic response to dh oil exposure including the expected ahr-mediated response and cyp genes.
