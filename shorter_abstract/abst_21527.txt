the documents were parsed and a weighted term-by-mirna frequency matrix was created, which was subsequently factorized via singular value decomposition to extract pair-wise cosine values between the term  and mirna vectors in reduced rank semantic space.

for approximately  <dig> human mirnas indexed in mirbase, text documents were created by concatenating titles and abstracts of medline citations which refer to the mirnas.
lsi modeling of medline abstracts provides a robust and automated method for mirna related knowledge discovery.
the latest collection of mirna abstracts and lsi model can be accessed through the web tool mirna literature network  at http://bioinfo.memphis.edu/mirlin.
the amount of scientific information about micrornas  is growing exponentially, making it difficult for researchers to interpret experimental results.
lsi enables derivation of both explicit and implicit associations between entities based on word usage patterns.
in this study, we present an automated text mining approach using latent semantic indexing  for prioritization, clustering and functional annotation of mirnas.
finally, term ranking by querying the lsi space with a group of mirnas enabled annotation of the clusters with functionally related terms.
