some identical its-types were even recovered from both marine and non-marine samples, habitats that generally harbour significantly different protist communities.
our results strongly suggest that geographic dispersal in macro-organisms and microbes is not fundamentally different: some taxa show restricted and/or patchy distributions while others are clearly cosmopolitan.
these results are concordant with the 'moderate endemicity model' of microbial biogeography.
