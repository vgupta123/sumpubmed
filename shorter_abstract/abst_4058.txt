the higher-level phylogeny of placental mammals has long been a phylogenetic gordian knot, with disagreement about both the precise contents of, and relationships between, the extant orders.
our results demonstrate the importance of minimising poor and redundant data when constructing supertrees.
the topology is highly congruent with recent  phylogenetic analyses of placental mammals, but is considerably more comprehensive, being the first phylogeny to include all  <dig> extant families without making a priori assumptions of suprafamilial monophyly.
subsidiary analyses reveal that the data selection protocol played a key role in the major changes relative to a previously published higher-level supertree of placentals.
we apply a stringent data selection protocol designed to minimise these problems to a much-expanded data set of morphological, molecular and combined source trees, to produce a supertree that includes every family of extant placental mammals.
the supertree should provide a useful framework for hypothesis testing in phylogenetic comparative biology, and supports the idea that biogeography has played a crucial role in the evolution of placental mammals.
