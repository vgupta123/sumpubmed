gambiae  genes were identified that, when silenced, have a different effect on p. berghei  and p. falciparum  infections.
however, some of the genes identified in these screens have no effect on the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum; raising the question of whether different mosquito effector genes mediate anti-parasitic responses to different plasmodium species.
functional screens based on dsrna-mediated gene silencing identified several anopheles gambiae genes that limit plasmodium berghei infection.
gambiae is infected with the same parasite, silencing these genes has a dramatic effect.
there is a broad spectrum of compatibility, the extent to which the mosquito immune system limits infection, between different plasmodium strains and particular mosquito strains that is mediated by tep1/lrim <dig> activation.

for five of the six genes tested, silencing had the same effect on infection in the p. falciparum-an.
