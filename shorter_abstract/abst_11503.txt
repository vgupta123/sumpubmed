following our original approach, in the present report we provide an updated classification of hla-a and -b class i alleles into supertypes.
however, despite this polymorphism, class i molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires.
the peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide.
as a result, over 80% of the  <dig> different hla-a and -b alleles examined to date can be assigned to one of the original nine supertypes.
as a result of this updated analysis, hla supertype associations have been defined for over  <dig> different hla-a and -b alleles.
this information is expected to facilitate epitope identification and vaccine design studies, as well as investigations into disease association and correlates of immunity.
class i major histocompatibility complex  molecules bind, and present to t cells, short peptides derived from intracellular processing of proteins.
a few alleles are expected to be associated with repertoires that overlap multiple supertypes.
in addition, the approach utilized has been made more transparent, allowing others to utilize the classification approach going forward.
