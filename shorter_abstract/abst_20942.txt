hes-nep cells express lpa and s1p receptors coupled to gi/o g-proteins that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and to gq-like phospholipase c activity.
the goal of this study was to determine if hes-nep cells express functional lysophospholipid receptors, and if activation of these receptors mediates cellular responses critical for neural development.
our results demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid  and sphingosine-1-phosphate  receptors are functionally expressed in hes-nep cells and are coupled to multiple cellular signaling pathways.
lysophospholipids regulate the morphology and growth of neurons, neural cell lines, and neural progenitors.
these findings establish human es cell-derived nep cells as a model system for studying the role of lysophospholipids in neural progenitors.
a stable human neural progenitor cell line is not currently available in which to study the role of lysophospholipids in human neural development.
we recently established a stable, adherent human embryonic stem cell-derived neuroepithelial  cell line which recapitulates morphological and phenotypic features of neural progenitor cells isolated from fetal tissue.
thus, lysophospholipids regulate neural progenitor growth and morphology through distinct mechanisms.
