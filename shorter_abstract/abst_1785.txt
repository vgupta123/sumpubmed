coding potential analysis revealed that 43% of total midgut transcripts appear to be long non-coding rna , and functional annotation of nits showed that 68% had no homology to current databases from other species.
reads were also analyzed using de novo assembly and predicted transcripts compared with genome mapping-based models.
gambiae pest genome, and 74% were new variants.
predicted models were validated for midgut expression using qrt-pcr and microarray analysis, and novel isoforms were confirmed by sequencing predicted intron-exon boundaries.
gambiae midgut transcriptome doubled the number of known transcripts and tripled the number of variants known in this mosquito species.
of these novel transcripts,  <dig> % aligned with annotated genes and appear to be isoforms or pre-mrnas of reference transcripts, while  <dig> % mapped to regions between annotated genes and represent novel intergenic transcripts .
genome sequencing of anopheles gambiae was completed more than ten years ago and has accelerated research on malaria transmission.
finally, variant analysis of g <dig> and l <dig> midgut transcripts detected  <dig>  variants with respect to the an.
intergenic transcripts had a higher frequency of variation compared with non-intergenic transcripts.
mosquitoes were infected with either plasmodium berghei or plasmodium falciparum, and midguts were collected after the first or second plasmodium infection.
high-throughput illumina sequencing of the midgut transcriptome was used to identify new genes and transcripts, contributing to the refinement of an.
it also revealed existence of a large number of lncrna and opens new possibilities for investigating the biological function of many newly discovered transcripts.
