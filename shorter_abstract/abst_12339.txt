the predictive power is improved by inclusion of additional nonlinear effects, in particular target gc content, when regression trees or anns are used.
the performance of our multiple multivariate models is compared with that of a recently proposed third-order polynomial regression method that uses percent identity as the sole predictor.
this is a pervasive problem for both oligonucleotide and cdna microarrays; it is considered particularly problematic for the latter.
this will allow future developments of generalized hybridization models that will be able to correct for false-positive cross-hybridization signals in expression experiments.
all multivariate models agree that the 'most contiguous base pairs between probe and target sequences,' rather than percent identity, is the best univariate predictor.
we validate this approach on a set of dna microarrays with cytochrome p <dig> family genes.
a systematic multivariate approach is provided to assess the importance of multiple sequence features for hybridization and of relationships among these features.
we propose a systematic search strategy using multiple multivariate models  to select an effective set of predictors for hybridization.
