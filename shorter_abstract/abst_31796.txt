published procedures to extract orthologous groups from phylogenetic trees do not allow identification of orthology at various levels of resolution, nor do they document the relations between the orthologous groups.
this is implemented in a program loft  that assigns hierarchical orthology numbers to genes based on a phylogenetic tree.
the resulting high-resolution orthologous groups are depicted in colour, facilitating visual inspection of  trees.
the "levels of orthology" concept offers high resolution, reliable orthology, while preserving the relations between orthologous groups.
a benchmark for orthology prediction, that takes into account the varying levels of orthology between genes, shows that the phylogeny-based high-resolution orthology assignments made by loft are reliable.
already in two-species gene-phylogenies, the complicated, non-transitive nature of phylogenetic relations results in inparalogs and outparalogs.
to decide upon speciation and gene duplication events in a tree loft can be instructed either to perform classical species-tree reconciliation or to use the species overlap between partitions in the tree.
we introduce "levels of orthology" to describe the multi-level nature of gene relations.
dividing the phylogenetic relations between genes into either orthologs or paralogs is however an oversimplification.
for situations with more than two species we lack semantics to specifically describe the phylogenetic relations, let alone to exploit them.
the hierarchical orthology numbers assigned by loft effectively summarize the phylogenetic relations between genes.
