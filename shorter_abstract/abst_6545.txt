we observed that  <dig> proteins were differentially expressed under high light treatment.
we demonstrate that t. pseudonana has efficient photoprotective mechanisms to deal with hl stress.
cells treated under high light  for 10 h were subjected to proteomic analysis.
light-harvesting complex proteins, ros scavenging systems, photorespiration, lipid metabolism and some specific proteins might be involved in light protection and acclimation of diatoms.
however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these acclimation responses of diaotms remain elusive.
under hl stress, levels of c14: <dig> and c16: <dig> increased while c20:5ω <dig> decreased.
non-photochemical quenching  and relative electron transport rate could respond rapidly to varying light intensities.
in this study, we investigated the mechanism of high light protection in marine diatom thalassiosira pseudonana using comparative proteomics in combination with biochemical analyses.
high-light treatment also resulted in increased diadinoxanthin + diatoxanthin content, decreased fv/fm, increased triacylglycerol and altered fatty acid composition.
de novo synthesis of ddx/dtx and lipid accumulation contribute to utilization of the excess energy.
