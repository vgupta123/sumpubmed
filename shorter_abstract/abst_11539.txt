at posttest, participants of the spatial training group showed lower activity than participants of the perceptual training group in a network of brain regions associated with spatial learning, including the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus.
the present study assessed the effects of cognitive training  and physical training  on spatial learning and associated brain activation in  <dig> adults .
functional changes in neural systems associated with spatial navigation can be induced by cognitive interventions and seem to be stronger than effects of physical exercise in middle-aged adults.
only the spatial training improved performance in the maze task.
spatial learning was assessed with a virtual maze task, and at the same time neural correlates were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging .
