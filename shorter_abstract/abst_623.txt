to address the question of how common this phenomenon could be, we searched for plant mirnas sequences in public srna datasets from various tissues of mammals, chicken and insects.
furthermore, all or nearly all  mir <dig> sequences were monocot derived for most datasets, including datasets for two insects reared on dicot plants in their respective experiments.
a recent paper reported that putative plant mirnas were detected in animal plasma and serum, presumably acquired through ingestion, and may have a functional impact in the consuming organisms.
our analyses revealed that plant mirnas were present in the animal srna datasets, and significantly mir <dig> was extremely over-represented.
our analyses suggest that the observed plant mirnas in animal srna datasets can originate in the process of sequencing, and that accumulation of plant mirnas via dietary exposure is not universal in animals.
previous analysis revealed that numerous srnas in corn, rice and soybean seeds have high sequence similarity to animal genes.
however, exogenous rna is considered to be unstable within the gastrointestinal tract of many animals, thus limiting potential for any adverse effects from consumption of dietary rna.
plants contain significant quantities of small rnas  derived from various srna biogenesis pathways.
