the file format stores genotype data together with any kind of additional data, using a flexible serialisation mechanism.
the new file format has been very useful for our own studies where it has significantly reduced the informatics burden in keeping track of various secondary data, and where the memory and io efficiency has greatly simplified analysis runs.
while spreadsheets and at text files were adequate solutions earlier, the increased data size mandates more efficient solutions.
we describe a new binary file format for snp data, together with a software library for file manipulation.
a main limitation with the file format is that it is only supported by the very limited set of analysis tools developed in our own lab.
the format is designed to be io efficient for the access patterns of most multi-locus analysis methods.
this vast improvement in data acquisition technology makes it an informatics challenge to efficiently store and manipulate the data.
