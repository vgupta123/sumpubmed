functional interpretations are then supported by a step-by-step sequence of graphical representations.
the common structures are underlined and graphical outputs are provided such that biological meaning becomes easily retrievable.
it is thus of great importance to provide useful integrative approaches dedicated to ease the interpretation of microarray data.
genomic analysis will greatly benefit from considering in a global way various sources of molecular data with the related biological knowledge.
gene ontology terms are used to build gene modules that are superimposed on the experimentally interpreted plots.
here, we introduce a data-mining approach, multiple factor analysis , to combine multiple data sets and to add formalized knowledge.
