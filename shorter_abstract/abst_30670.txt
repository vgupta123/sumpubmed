the genome content of l. rhinocerotis provides insights into the genetic basis of its reported medicinal properties as well as serving as a platform to further characterize putative bioactive proteins and secondary metabolite pathway enzymes and as a reference for comparative genomics of polyporoid fungi.
the de novo assembled  <dig>  mb l. rhinocerotis genome encodes  <dig>  putative genes with  <dig> % of them having detectable sequence similarities to others available in public databases.
phylogenetic analysis revealed a close evolutionary relationship of l. rhinocerotis to ganoderma lucidum, dichomitus squalens, and trametes versicolor in the core polyporoid clade.
the l. rhinocerotis genome encodes a repertoire of enzymes engaged in carbohydrate and glycoconjugate metabolism, along with cytochrome p450s, putative bioactive proteins  and laccases.
among them, the l. rhinocerotis genome is particularly enriched with sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis genes.
despite the increasing interest in this ethnobotanical mushroom, very little is known about the molecular and genetic basis of its medicinal and nutraceutical properties.
other genes annotated include those encoding key enzymes for secondary metabolite biosynthesis, including those from polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and triterpenoid pathways.
