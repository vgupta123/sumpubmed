the theory resolves several outstanding issues and furnishes a general methodology for designing future projects from the standpoint of a spectrum-wide constant risk.
increased read length has the counterintuitive effect of worsening insertion detection characteristics of short inserts.
deletion and insertion statistics both depend heavily on physical coverage, but otherwise differ dramatically, refuting a commonly held doctrine of symmetry.
we report the statistical theory characterizing the length-discrepancy scheme for gaussian libraries, including coverage-related effects that preceding models are unable to account for.
detection power is examined under a straightforward alternative hypothesis and found to be generally acceptable.
quantitative aspects underlying this method remain poorly understood, despite its importance and conceptual simplicity.
