as in primary plastids, for which no wealth of functional information about transit peptide features exists, the transit peptide-like regions used for import into secondary ones show some common features only, which are also poorly characterized.
moreover, we show that  the mature domain of the pre-protein can provide intrinsic transit peptide functions.
in addition, we show a self-targeting mechanism, in which the mature protein domain contributes to the transit peptide function.
we modified the bts  of the plastid precursor fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c binding protein d  fused to gfp as model substrate for the characterization of pre-protein import into the secondary plastids of diatoms.
positive net charge is necessary for transport across the plastid envelope, but not across the periplastid membrane.
thereby we show that  pre-protein import is highly charge dependent.
acidic net charge perturbs pre-protein import within the er.
our results indicate important characteristics of targeting signals of proteins imported into secondary plastids surrounded by four membranes.
in secondary plastids , transit peptide-like regions are an essential part of a bipartite topogenic signal sequence , and generally found adjacent to a n-terminally located signal peptide of the plastid pre-proteins.
in plastids surrounded by two membranes  targeting of these proteins is facilitated by an n-terminal targeting signal, the transit peptide.
