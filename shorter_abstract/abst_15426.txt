specifically, we produced lists of genes likely to be involved in cancer by relying on:  protein-protein interactions;  differential expression data; and  structural and functional properties of cancer genes.
our approach to identifying and prioritizing candidate cancer genes can be used to produce lists of genes likely to be involved in cancer.
our results suggest that differential expression studies yielding high numbers of candidate cancer genes can be filtered using protein interaction networks.
the integrative approach that combines multiple sources of data obtained positive predictive values ranging from 23%  to 73% , outperforming the use of any of the data sources alone.
experimental techniques such as microarrays are being used to characterize cancer, but validating their results can be a laborious task.
