this study presents a proof-of-concept that some properties of a dna sequence can be identified through sonification alone and argues for their inclusion within the toolkit of dna sequence browsers as an adjunct to existing visual and analytical tools.
lastly nucleotide pairs can be parsed as two separate frames or codons can be parsed as three reading frames giving rise to multiple streams of audio.
the most informative sonification algorithm reads the dna sequence as codons in three reading frames to produce three concurrent streams of audio in an auditory display.
using these methods, dna sequences such as open reading frames or repetitive dna sequences can be distinguished from one another.
dna sonification refers to the use of an auditory display to convey the information content of dna sequence data.
six sonification algorithms are presented that each produce an auditory display.
these sonification tools are available through a webpage interface in which an input dna sequence can be processed in real time to produce an auditory display playable directly within the browser.
the potential of this approach as an analytical tool is discussed with reference to auditory displays derived from test sequences including simple nucleotide sequences, repetitive dna sequences and coding or non-coding genes.

codons may also be parsed degenerately into  <dig> notes with respect to the genetic code.
