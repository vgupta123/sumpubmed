arginine methylation is a post-translational modification that expands the functional diversity of proteins.
this indicates that a large number of proteins whose functions are modulated by arginine methylation await discovery in trypanosomes.
it also indicates that tblpn functions may be modulated by arginine methylation.
several t. brucei proteins have been shown to serve as tbprmt substrates in vitro, and a great number of proteins likely to undergo methylation are predicted by the t. brucei genome.
we identified a protein containing n-lip and c-lip domains that we term tblpn.
in addition, we showed that, similar to mammalian and yeast proteins with n-lip and c-lip domains, recombinant tblpn exhibits phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity, and that two conserved aspartic acid residues present in the c-lip domain are critical for its enzymatic activity.
here, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the major t. brucei type i prmt, tbprmt <dig>  to identify potential substrates of this enzyme.
this study reports the characterization of a novel trypanosome protein and provides insight into its enzymatic activity and function in phospholipid biosynthesis.
these domains are usually present in a family of proteins known as lipins, and involved in phospholipid biosynthesis and gene regulation.
far western and co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the tbprmt1-tblpn interaction.
