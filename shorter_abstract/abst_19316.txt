we show here that loss of bp activity in as <dig> flowers is sufficient to restore the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones, the sepal-receptacle boundary of the medial sepals and the timing of their abscission.
the sepals, petals and stamens of arabidopsis flowers detach via abscission zones formed at their boundaries with the underlying receptacle.
here we show a unique role for as <dig> in establishing the positions of the sepal and petal abscission zones in arabidopsis flowers.
in as <dig> mutant flowers, the sepal abscission zones are displaced into inverted v-shaped positions, leaving behind triangular stubs of tissue when the organs abscise.
movement of the petal abscission zones is also apparent.
our results indicate that as <dig> activity is critical for the proper placement of the floral organ abscission zones, and influences the timing of organ shedding.
abscission of the medial sepals is delayed in as <dig> flowers; loss of chlorophyll in the senescing sepals contrasts with proximal zones that remain green.
