in vertebrates, the inner ear is comprised of the cochlea and vestibular system, which develop from the otic vesicle.
tbx <dig> is expressed in the otic epithelium and adjacent periotic mesenchyme , and both of these domains are required for inner ear formation.
conditional mutants  displayed malformed inner ears, including a hypoplastic otic vesicle and a severely shortened cochlear duct, indicating that tbx <dig> expression in the pom is necessary for proper inner ear formation.
to identify a potential signal from the pom to the otic epithelium, expression of retinoic acid  catabolizing genes was examined in both mutants.
these results indicate that tbx <dig> expression in the pom regulates cochlear outgrowth potentially via control of local retinoic acid activity.
tbx <dig>  the gene responsible for velo-cardio-facial syndrome/digeorge syndrome in humans, is required for ear development in mice.
to study the function of tbx <dig> in the pom, we have conditionally inactivated tbx <dig> in the mesoderm while keeping expression in the otic vesicle intact.
cyp26a <dig> expression was altered in the tcre-ko, while cyp26c <dig> showed reduced expression in both tcre-ko and brn4-;tbx1+/- embryos.
