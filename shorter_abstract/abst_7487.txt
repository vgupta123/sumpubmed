the loss of duplicate genes - fractionation - after whole genome doubling  is the subject to a debate as to whether it proceeds gene by gene or through deletion of multi-gene chromosomal segments.
we assume deletion events excise a geometrically distributed number of consecutive genes with mean µ ≥  <dig>  and these events can combine to produce single-copy runs of length l. if µ =  <dig>  the process is gene-by-gene.
in the latter case if deletions overlap, the later one simply extends the existing run of single-copy genes.
we explore aspects of the predicted distribution of the lengths of single-copy regions analytically, but resort to simulations to show how observing run lengths l allows us to discriminate between the two hypotheses.
