a total of  <dig> genome sequence scaffolds, covering about  <dig>  cm of the wild sacred lotus genome, were anchored on the genetic map, accounting for  <dig>  % of the genome assembly.
currently, the available genetic maps and molecular markers in lotus are too limited to be useful for molecular genetics based breeding programs.
however, the development of next-generation sequencing  technologies has enabled large-scale identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  for genetic map construction.
in this study, we constructed an snp-based high-density genetic map for cultivated lotus using double digest restriction site-associated dna sequencing .
from these reads,  <dig>  valid snp markers were used for genetic map construction.
these snps have been used to construct the first high-density genetic map for cultivated lotus that can serve as a genomic reference and will facilitate genetic mapping of important traits in the parental cultivars.

this study reports the large-scale discovery of snps between cultivars of rhizome and seed lotus using a ddradseq library combined with ngs.
the coverage of reads on a reference genome was  <dig>  % for the female parent,  <dig>  % for the male parent, and  <dig>  % for f <dig> individuals.
an f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals was derived from a cross between the rhizome lotus cultivar ‘juwuba’  and the seed lotus cultivar ‘mantianxing’ .
in total,  <dig>  gb of raw data containing  <dig> , <dig>  pair-end reads were obtained.
finally,  <dig> bin markers , consisting of  <dig>  snp markers, were sorted into  <dig> linkage groups  that spanned  <dig>  cm, with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm.
