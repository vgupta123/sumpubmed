moreover, a significant difference in tnf-Î± expression between monocytes stimulated with equimolar concentrations of lps from n. meningitides and e. coli, respectively, was identified when using the suggested combinations of reference genes for normalization, but stayed unrecognized when employing a single reference gene, actb or gapdh.
to investigate whether traditional reference genes are stably expressed in lps-stimulated monocytes or if rt-qpcr results are dependent on the choice of reference genes, we have assessed and evaluated gene expression stability of twelve candidate reference genes in this model system.
gene expression levels in lps-stimulated monocytes based on rt-qpcr results differ significantly when normalized to a single gene or a combination of stably expressed reference genes.
proper evaluation of reference gene stabiliy is therefore mandatory before reporting rt-qpcr results in lps-stimulated monocytes.
gene expression in lipopolysaccharide -stimulated monocytes is mainly studied by quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr  using gapdh  or actb  as reference gene for normalization.
expression of traditional reference genes has been shown to vary substantially under certain conditions leading to invalid results.
twelve candidate reference genes were quantified by rt-qpcr in lps-stimulated, human monocytes and evaluated using the programs genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper.
genorm ranked ppib , b2m  and ppia  as the best combination for gene expression normalization in lps-stimulated monocytes.
