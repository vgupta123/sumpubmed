this study evaluated the interaction between p. gingivalis and thp- <dig> cells, a widely used monocytic cell line, in vitro with a focus on cxcl <dig> at the gene and protein levels and its fate thereafter in cell culture supernatants.
elisa and qpcr results show an elevated cxcl <dig> expression and secretion in thp- <dig> cells in response to p. gingivalis, where the heat-killed atcc <dig> and w <dig> induced higher levels of cxcl <dig> in comparison to their viable counterparts.
of all tested p. gingivalis strains, adhesion and internalization in thp- <dig> cells was least conspicuous by rgp-deficient p. gingivalis , as demonstrated by confocal imaging.
thp- <dig> cells were stimulated with viable and heat-killed wild-type strains atcc  <dig> or w <dig> or viable isogenic gingipain mutants of w <dig>  e <dig>  or k1a , for  <dig> hours.
the wild-type strains secreted relatively more rgp during the co-culture with thp- <dig> cells.
furthermore, the kgp-deficient mutant k1a caused a higher cxcl <dig> response compared to the rgp-deficient e <dig>  chromogenic quantification of lipopolysaccharide  in supernatant showed no significant differences between viable and heat killed bacteria except that w <dig> shed highest levels of lps.
porphyromonas gingivalis is an important bacterial etiological agent involved in periodontitis.

the bacterium expresses two kinds of cysteine proteases called gingipains: arginine gingipains  and lysine gingipain .
