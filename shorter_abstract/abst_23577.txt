as protein domains are functional and structural units of proteins, a large proportion of protein-protein interactions  are achieved by domain-domain interactions , many computational efforts have been made to identify ddis from experimental ppis since high throughput technologies have produced a large number of ppis for different species.
in this work, we integrate this global point of view into the parsimony-based model.
results show that the proposed method has improved performance, which confirms the biological meanings of the extracted prior knowledge.
parsimony principle has been widely used in computational biology as the evolution of the nature is considered as a continuous optimization process.
this work provides us some clues for using these properties of complex networks in computational models and to some extent reveals the biological meanings underlying these general network properties.
we notice that existing methods just view ppi networks as simply assembled by single interactions, but there is now ample evidence that ppi networks should be considered in a global  point of view for it exhibits general properties of complex networks, such as 'scale-free' and 'small-world'.
particularly, prior knowledge is extracted from these global properties by plausible reasoning and then taken as input.
we investigate the role of the added information extensively through numerical experiments.
in deterministic methods, parsimony assumption has been utilized.
besides, researches have shown that they can detect specific ddis, which is often hard for many probabilistic methods.
