patch size is likely to affect mate and pollinator availabilities, thereby affecting pollination success and the rate of selfing.
we estimated fruit and seed set, reproductive assurance, self-compatibility, the multilocus patch selfing rate and lifetime inbreeding depression in natural patches of rhododendron ferrugineum , a mass-flowering species characterized by considerable patch size variation .
open seed set declined linearly with increasing patch size, whereas pollinator-mediated seed set  was not significantly affected.
progeny array analysis indicated that the selfing rate declined with increasing patch size, consistent with greater reproductive assurance in small sparse patches than in large, dense patches.
however, fruit set and adult fitness decreased with decreasing patch size, with an estimated mean lifetime inbreeding depression of  <dig>  .
this study highlights the need to estimate lifetime inbreeding depression, together with mating system and pollination parameters, if we are to understand the actual benefit of selfing and avoid the overestimation of reproductive assurance.
we investigated the potential for selfing to provide reproductive assurance over the lifetime of a long-lived perennial species and its variation between plant patches of various sizes.

lifetime inbreeding depression strongly counteracts the advantage of reproductive assurance due to selfing in this long-lived species.
an increase in self-fertilization may evolve to compensate for the negative effects of pollination failure.
