to understand the physiological processes responsible for ethylene-mediated changes in photosynthesis, stomatal and mesophyll effects on photosynthesis and ethylene biosynthesis in response to ethephon treatment in mustard  cultivars differing in photosynthetic capacity were studied.
also, the high photosynthetic capacity cultivar, varuna responded less to ethephon than the low photosynthetic capacity cultivar, rh <dig>  the photosynthetic capacity of rh <dig> increased with the increase in ethylene evolution due to  <dig>  mm ethephon application.
acs activity and ethylene evolution increased with increasing concentrations of ethephon.
in both the cultivars acs activity and ethylene increased up to  <dig>  mm ethephon, but  <dig>  mm ethephon caused maximum effects on photosynthetic parameters.
the corresponding changes in gs and ca activity suggest that the changes in photosynthesis in response to ethephon were triggered by altered stomatal and mesophyll processes.
studies on the effects of ethylene on co <dig> metabolism have shown conflicting results.
these results suggest that ethephon affects foliar gas exchange responses.
the stimulatory effect of co <dig> on ethylene evolution in plants is known, but the extent to which ethylene controls photosynthesis is not clear.
the effects of ethephon on photosynthetic rate , stomatal conductance , carbonic anhydrase  activity, 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid synthase  activity and ethylene evolution were similar in both the cultivars.
stomatal conductance changed in parallel with changes in mesophyll photosynthetic properties.
