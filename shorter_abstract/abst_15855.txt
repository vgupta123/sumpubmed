4- <dig> october  <dig> the second workshop on data mining of next-generation sequencing in conjunction with the  <dig> ieee international conference on bioinformatics and biomedicine philadelphia, pa, usa
the report documents information about various aspects of hts data, such as sequencing quality, mapping to a reference genome, sequencing coverage, and base frequency.
bamchop enables biomedical researchers to quickly and rigorously evaluate hts data by providing a convenient synopsis and user-friendly reports.
we developed bamchop, a robust program to efficiently summarize key statistical metrics of hts data stored in bam files, and to visually present the results in a formatted report.
a commonly adopted standard is to store sequencing reads aligned to a reference genome in sam  or bam  files.
quality control of sam/bam files is a critical checkpoint before downstream analysis.
processing and summarizing the large amount of data generated by hts presents a non-trivial challenge to bioinformatics.
bamchop's efficiency and robustness were tested on bam files generated by local sequencing facilities and the  <dig> genomes project.
bamchop uses the r language and bioconductor packages to calculate statistical matrices and the sweave utility and associated latex markup for documentation.
