the objectives of this study were to analyzed genome-wide gene expression profiles in the leaves of two tall fescue genotypes, heat tolerant ‘pi578718’ and heat sensitive ‘pi234881’ using high-throughput rna sequencing.
the assembled transcriptome of tall fescue could serve as a global description of expressed genes and provide more molecular resources for future functional characterization analysis of genomics in cool-season turfgrass in response to high-temperature.
increased cell division, lmw/hmw-hsp, dissimilation and antioxidant transcript amounts in tall fescue were correlated with successful resistance to high temperature stress.
cell division and cell cycle genes showed a massive increase in transcript abundance in heat-stressed plants and more activated genes were detected in pi  <dig> by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways analysis.
tall fescue  is major cool-season forage and turf grass species worldwide, but high-temperature is a major environmental stress that dramatically threaten forage production and turf management of tall fescue.
of these,  <dig>  unigenes showed different expression patterns in response to heat stress and were categorized into  <dig> gene ontology functional subcategories.
in addition, the variance of enrichment degree in each functional subcategory between pi <dig> and pi <dig> increased with increasing treatment time.
a total of  <dig> million high-quality paired-end reads were generated and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp.
