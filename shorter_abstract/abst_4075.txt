our data indicates that what has been called sctla- <dig> is not a direct product of the ctla- <dig> gene, and that the ctla- <dig> protein is not part of this molecule.
molecules isolated from blood using ctla- <dig> specific antibodies were analyzed with ligand binding assays, mass spectroscopy, and biochemical fractionation in an effort to increase our understanding of ctla- <dig> immunoreactive material.
mass spectroscopy analysis of the molecules recognized by multiple ctla-4-specific antibodies failed to identify any ctla- <dig> protein.
we have identified molecules in blood that are recognized by ctla- <dig> specific antibodies but also exhibit properties of immunoglobulins.
despite studies finding that people with autoimmune disease more frequently express high levels of sctla- <dig> in their blood than apparently healthy people, the significance of these findings is unclear.
these results may explain why the relationship of sctla- <dig> to immune system activity has been difficult to elucidate.
