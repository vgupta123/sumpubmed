then,  <dig> unigenes could be identified as putative homologues of color-related genes in other species, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes.
in petals,  <dig> flavonoids  were detected in different contents during the color development due to the different expression levels of color-related genes, and four flavonols were detected in waterlily for the first time.
furthermore, ua3gts were selected as the most important candidates involved in the flavonoid metabolic pathway, ua3gts induced blue petal color formation in nymphaea ‘king of siam’.
this study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of blue flowers in waterlily and provide the basis for molecular breeding of blue hardy waterlily cultivars.
although the hardy waterlily has no attractive blue flower cultivar, its adaptability is stronger than tropical waterlily because it can survive a cold winter.
thus, breeding hardy waterlily with real blue flowers has become an important target for breeders.
subsequently, de novo assembly generated  <dig>  unigenes, including  <dig>  unigenes annotated to seven public protein databases.
waterlily , a perennial herbaceous aquatic plant, is divided into two ecological groups: hardy waterlily and tropical waterlily.
in this study, six cdna libraries generated from the petals of two different coloring stages of blue tropical waterlily cultivar nymphaea ‘king of siam’ were sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform.
