the results of this study provide the first insights into the transcriptional regulation of the human msrb <dig> gene, including the discovery that the sp <dig> transcription factor may play a central role in its expression.
methionine sulfoxide reductases b  proteins codified by three separate genes, named msrb <dig>  msrb <dig>  and msrb <dig>  are included in the msrs system.
therefore, the msrb <dig> promoter is controlled by epigenetic modifications.
we also demonstrated that the msrb <dig> promoter activity appears to be controlled by epigenetic modifications such as methylation.
to date, the mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional regulation of msrb genes have not been reported.
the aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of msrb <dig> selenoprotein levels through transcriptional regulation of the msrb <dig> gene in mda-mb <dig> and mcf- <dig> breast carcinoma cell lines.
most organisms that were genetically modified to lack the msra gene have shown shortening of their life span.
it contains three sp <dig> binding sites which are sufficient for maximal promoter activity in transient transfection experiments.
high levels of msrb <dig> transcript, protein and promoter activity were detected in low metastatic mcf <dig> human breast cancer cells.
on the contrary, very low levels of both msrb <dig> transcript and promoter activity were detected in the highly metastatic counterpart mda-mb <dig> cells.
since sp <dig> is ubiquitously expressed, these sites, while necessary, are not sufficient to explain the patterns of gene expression of msrb <dig> in various human breast cancer cells.
methionine sulfoxide reductases  are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of oxidized methionine residues.
