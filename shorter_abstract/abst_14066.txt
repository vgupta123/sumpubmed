sv2a knockout mice start to display generalized seizures at a late developmental stage, around post-natal day  <dig> , and die around p <dig>  more recently, sv2a was demonstrated to be the molecular target of levetiracetam, an approved anti-epileptic drug .
sv2a, sv2b and sv2c are synaptic vesicle proteins that are structurally related to members of the major facilitator superfamily .
the purpose of this work was to precisely analyze and quantify the sv2a, sv2b and sv2c expression during brain development to understand the contribution of these proteins in brain development and their impact on epileptic seizures.
the observed alterations of sv2a expression in hippocampus are consistent with the appearance of seizures in sv2a−/− animals at early postnatal age and the hypothesis that sv2a absence favors epileptic seizures around p <dig>
first, we systematically analyzed by immunohistofluorescence, the sv2a, sv2b and sv2c expression during mouse brain development, from embryonic day  <dig>  to p <dig>  this semi-quantitative approach suggests a modulation of sv2a and sv2b expression in hippocampus around p <dig>  this is the reason why we used various quantitative approaches  indicating that sv2a and sv2b expression increased between p <dig> and p <dig> and remained stable between p <dig> and p <dig>  moreover, the increase of sv2a expression in the hippocampus at p <dig> was mainly observed in the ca <dig> region while sv2b expression in this region remains stable.
sv2a and sv2b exhibit broad expression in the central nervous system while sv2c appears to be more restricted in defined areas such as striatum.
