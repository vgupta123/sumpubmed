the comparison with the diploid and tetraploid maps shed new light on the evolutionary forces that contributed to the divergence of the a and b genome species and raised the question of the classification of the b genome species.
the genetic map developed, allowed the synteny analysis of the a and b genomes, the comparison with diploid and tetraploid maps and the analysis of the introgression segments from the wild synthetic into the background of a cultivated variety.
the synteny analysis between the a and b genomes revealed an overall good collinearity of the homeologous lgs.
we report here the development of a ssr based genetic map and the analysis of genome-wide segment introgressions into the background of a cultivated variety through the utilization of a synthetic amphidiploid between a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis.
the most probable hypothesis gave a. duranensis as the wild donor of the a genome and a. ipaënsis as the wild donor of the b genome.
the level of polymorphism observed between the parent of the amphidiploid and the cultivated variety is consistent with a. duranensis and a. ipaënsis being the most probable donor of the a and b genomes respectively.
the utilization of wild germplasm in breeding programs has received little attention due to the reproductive barriers between wild and cultivated species and to the technical difficulties encountered in making large number of crosses.
two hundred ninety eight  loci were mapped in  <dig> linkage groups , spanning a total map distance of  <dig>  cm with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers.
it is considered to be an allotetraploid  originated from a single hybridization event between two wild diploids.
a low level of molecular polymorphism is found in cultivated germplasm and up to date few genetic linkage maps have been published.
structural modifications such as chromosomal segment inversions and a major translocation event prior to the tetraploidisation of the cultivated species were revealed.
marker assisted selection of bc1f <dig> and then bc2f <dig> lines carrying the desirable donor segment with the best possible return to the background of the cultivated variety provided a set of lines offering an optimal distribution of the wild introgressions.
peanut  is widely used as a food and cash crop around the world.
