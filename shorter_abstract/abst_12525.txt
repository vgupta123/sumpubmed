confocal microscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry, gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence analyses revealed a distinct difference in cd accumulation and tolerance between the two contrasting barley genotypes: w6nk <dig>  and zhenong <dig> .
a dna microarray analysis detected large-scale changes of gene expression in response to cd stress with a substantial difference between the two genotypes.
quantitative rt-pcr confirmed our microarray data.
understanding the mechanism of low cd accumulation in crops is crucial for sustainable safe food production in cd-contaminated soils.
novel transporter genes such as zinc transporter genes were identified as being associated with low cd accumulation.
furthermore, suppression of the zinc transporter genes hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> by rnai silencing showed increased cd accumulation and reduced zn and mn concentrations in barley grains.
cd stress led to higher expression of genes involved in transport, carbohydrate metabolism and signal transduction in the low-grain-cd-accumulating genotype.
thus, hvzip <dig> and hvzip <dig> could be candidate genes related to low-grain-cd-accumulation.
