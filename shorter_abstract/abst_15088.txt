in the present study, we used peach  varieties with showy and non-showy flowers to investigate the role of ja  in floral display.
ppjaz <dig> transcript levels were higher in petals of the non-showy flowers than those of showy flowers at anthesis.
the promotion of autogamy under stress conditions suggests the potential involvement of a signaling pathway with a dual role in both flower development and stress response.
ppjaz <dig> inhibited ja-dependent processes in roots and leaves of transgenic plants, including induction of ja-response genes to mechanical wounding.
indeed, ja-related genes showed differential expression patterns in leaves and flowers of transgenic plants.
our results show that ppjaz <dig>  a component of the ja signaling pathway in peach, regulates petal expansion during anthesis and promotes self-pollination.
our results reveal that under stress conditions – for example, herbivore attacks -- stable jaz proteins such as ppjaz <dig> may alter ja signaling in different plant organs, resulting in autogamy as a reproductive assurance mechanism.
stability of ppjaz <dig> was confirmed in vivo using ppjaz1-gfp chimeric protein.
however, the inhibitory effect of ppjaz <dig> on ja-dependent fertility functions was weaker, indicating that ppjaz <dig> regulates the spatial localization of ja signaling in different plant organs.
the jasmonic acid  pathway is a plausible candidate to play such a role because of its involvement in many plant responses to environmental and developmental cues.
moreover, the ectopic expression of ppjaz <dig> in tobacco  converted the showy, chasmogamous tobacco flowers into non-showy, cleistogamous flowers.
variations in floral display represent one of the core features associated with the transition from allogamy to autogamy in angiosperms.
