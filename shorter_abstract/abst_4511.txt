the information flow from the global network to the temporal cortex correlated positively with the strength of tinnitus distress.
top-down influence from the global network on the temporal areas relates to the subjective strength of the tinnitus distress.
within a cortical network, hubs are brain structures that either influence a great number of other brain regions or that are influenced by a great number of other brain regions.
using magnetoencephalography, we investigated the long-range cortical networks of chronic tinnitus sufferers  and healthy controls  in the resting state.
subjective tinnitus is the perception of a sound in the absence of any physical source.
by mapping the cortical hubs in tinnitus and controls we report fundamental group differences in the global networks, mainly in the gamma frequency range.
with the present study we suggest that the hyperactivity of the temporal cortices in tinnitus is integrated in a global network of long-range cortical connectivity.
accompanying this hyperactivity, changes in non-auditory brain structures have also been reported.
a beamforming technique was applied to reconstruct the brain activity at source level and the directed functional coupling between all voxels was analyzed by means of partial directed coherence.
the prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the parieto-occipital region were core structures in this network.
it has been shown that tinnitus is associated with hyperactivity of the auditory cortices.
however, there have been no studies on the long-range information flow between these regions.
