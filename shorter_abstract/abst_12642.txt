the  <dig> outbreak was caused by a virus which was antigenically close to the  <dig> isolate, affecting mostly 2-year-old susceptible horses under epizootiological circumstances similar to those in  <dig>  the existence of 2-year-olds introduced from regions free from getah virus could continue to pose a potential risk of additional outbreaks in upcoming years.
vaccination on private farms and breeding farms would help to minimize the risk of outbreaks.
as we reported previously, getah virus infection occurred in horses at the miho training center of the japan racing association in  <dig>  this was the first outbreak after a 31-year absence in japan.
horse anti-sera raised against an isolate in  <dig> neutralized both the homologous strain and a  <dig> isolate at almost the same titers , suggesting that these viruses were antigenically similar.
thus, increased virus exposure due to the regional epizootic probably allowed the virus to spread in the center, similarly to the outbreak in  <dig>
here, we report a recurrent outbreak of getah virus infection in  <dig>  sequential to the  <dig> one at the same site, and we summarize its epizootiological aspects to estimate the risk of further outbreaks in upcoming years.
the outbreak occurred from mid-august to late october  <dig>  affecting  <dig> racehorses with a prevalence of  <dig>  % of the whole population .
among horses entering the training center from private surrounding farms in  <dig>  the seropositivity rate to getah virus increased gradually .
