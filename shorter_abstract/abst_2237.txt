chi square analysis found a statistically significant difference  between the incidence of this cnv in cancer and normal dna and a slightly increased incidence in cml with deletions in comparison to those cml without a detectable deletion.
real-time polymerase chain reaction  was used to determine the relative frequency of this cnv in dna from a series of  <dig> cml patients  deletion) together with dna derived from  <dig> paediatric solid tumors in comparison to the incidence of cnv in control dna.
in this study acgh was performed and identified a cnv  that was present as a genomic gain or loss in 10% of control dna samples derived from cytogenetically normal individuals.
furthermore, ~15â€“20% of cml patients also carry a microdeletion on the derivative  <dig> chromosome ) and these patients have a poor prognosis.
recently, it was proposed that duplicons located near the recurrent translocation break points on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in chronic myeloid leukemia  may facilitate this tumor-specific translocation.
advances made in the area of microarray comparative genomic hybridization  have enabled the interrogation of the entire genome at a previously unattainable resolution.
