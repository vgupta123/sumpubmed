arguments are produced for both sides - the statement is true and, the statement is false - then the most powerful argument is used.
additionally, the biological community must tackle the incongruity between overlapping and adjacent resources, thus facilitating the integration and modelling of biological information.
non-monotonic reasoning can help resolve such difficulties - one such form of reasoning is computational argumentation.
this paper examines the evolution of a system, argudas, which tests using computational argumentation in an in situ gene hybridisation gene expression use case.
throughout a number of issues shall be raised including the appropriateness of computational argumentation in biology and the challenges faced when integrating apparently similar online biological databases.
