genes whose expression was significantly enhanced/diminished during the time-course were identified, and classified to metabolic and regulatory pathways.
from the results, we conclude that most of the metabolic pathway mrnas required for the initial phases of germination were synthesized during the sporulation process and stably conserved in the spore.
bacterial spore germination is a developmental process during which all required metabolic pathways are restored to transfer cells from their dormant state into vegetative growth.
the classification into metabolic pathways revealed timing of the activation of specific pathways during the course of germination.

the analysis also identified remarkable changes in the expression of specific sigma factors over the course of germination.
from the analysis of sigma factors we conclude that conditions favoring germination evoke stress-like cell responses.
