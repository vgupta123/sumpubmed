each set of motifs corresponded to a gene group of  <dig> to  <dig> genes, with 42/ <dig>  gene groups independently validated by david, a gene ontology database, with fdr <  <dig> .
of all intersections of our  <dig> significant gene groups, 85% were significantly enriched, with 73% of the significant enrichments independently validated by gene ontology.
gene duplication and convergent evolution within a genome provide obvious biological mechanisms for replicating an rm near the tss that binds a particular tf subunit.
the proportion of tfbs positional preferences due to tfbs co-localization within rms is unknown, however.
the co-localization of tfbss within rms therefore likely explains much of the tight tfbs positional preferences near the tss.
motifs corresponding to two tfbss in a rm should co-occur more than by chance alone, enriching the intersection of the gene groups corresponding to the two tfs.
of the 903 = 43*42/ <dig> intersections of the  <dig> significant gene groups, we found 768/ <dig>  pairs of gene groups with significantly enriched intersections, with 564/ <dig>  intersections independently validated by david with fdr <  <dig> .
transcription factors  form complexes that bind regulatory modules  within dna, to control specific sets of genes.
some transcription factor binding sites  near the transcription start site  display tight positional preferences relative to the tss.

our statistics found  <dig> significant sets of human motifs in the jaspar tf database with positional preferences relative to the tss, with  <dig> preferences tight .
in contrast, sequence analysis can examine many tfs uniformly and methodically, broadly surveying the co-localization of tfbss with tight positional preferences relative to the tss.
thus, a gene-group intersection systematically enriched beyond chance alone provides evidence that the two tfs participate in an rm.
