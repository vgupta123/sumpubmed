finally, we use the ires-gfp fusion approach to identify specific domains of rncr <dig> that are required for repressing both amacrine and müller glial differentiation.
overexpression of rncr2-ires-gfp phenocopies the effects of shrna-mediated knockdown of rncr <dig>  implying that forced mislocalization of rncr <dig> induces a dominant-negative phenotype.
we further report that rncr <dig> rna, which is normally nuclear-retained, can be exported from the nucleus when fused to an ires-gfp sequence.
shrna-mediated knockdown of rncr <dig> results in an increase of both amacrine cells and müller glia, indicating a role for this lncrna in regulating retinal cell fate specification.
furthermore, we present a novel approach for generating dominant-negative constructs of lncrnas, which may be generally useful in the functional analysis of this class of molecules.
we find that the rncr <dig> is selectively expressed in a subset of both mitotic progenitors and postmitotic retinal precursor cells.
recent work has identified that many long mrna-like noncoding rnas  are expressed in the developing nervous system.
