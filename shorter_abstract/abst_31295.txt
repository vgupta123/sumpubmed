our results show that cop <dig> protein sequences from physcomitrella, rice and arabidopsis have been functionally conserved during evolution, while the spa proteins showed considerable functional divergence.
the spa <dig> ortholog from rice  rescued the spa mutant phenotype in dark-grown seedlings, but did not complement any spa mutant phenotype in light-grown seedlings or in adult plants.
this may - at least in part - reflect the fact that cop <dig> is a single copy gene in seed plants, while spa proteins are encoded by a small gene family of two to four members with possibly sub- or neofunctionalized tasks.
in contrast, expression of a spa ortholog from physcomitrella  in arabidopsis spa mutants did not rescue any facet of the spa mutant phenotype, suggesting that the ppspab protein is not functionally conserved or that the arabidopsis function evolved after the split of mosses and seed plants.
the cop1/spa complex is a key negative regulator of light signaling in the well-studied dicot arabidopsis thaliana.
cop <dig> and members of the four spa proteins are part of an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that acts in darkness to ubiquitinate several transcription factors involved in light responses, thereby targeting them for degradation by the proteasome.
while cop <dig> is also found in humans, spa proteins appear specific to plants.
here, we have functionally addressed evolutionary conservation of cop <dig> and spa orthologs from the moss physcomitrella, the monocot rice and the dicot arabidopsis.
plants have evolved light sensing mechanisms to optimally adapt their growth and development to the ambient light environment.
