we present the whole genome sequence of the first bacterium able to gain metabolic energy via phosphite oxidation.
autotrophic co <dig> assimilation proceeds through the wood-ljungdahl pathway.
sequencing of the genome of this bacterium was undertaken to elucidate the genomic basis of this so far unique type of energy metabolism.
additionally, we have found and confirmed the ability of the strain to couple phosphite oxidation to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which in itself is a new type of energy metabolism.
the unique for d. phosphitoxidans ptx-ptd cluster is involved in inorganic phosphite oxidation and an atypical c-p lyase-coding cluster  is involved in utilization of organophosphonates.

the delta-proteobacterium desulfotignum phosphitoxidans is a type strain of the genus desulfotignum, which comprises to date only three species together with d. balticum and d. toluenicum.
d. phosphitoxidans oxidizes phosphite to phosphate as its only source of electrons, with either sulfate or co <dig> as electron acceptor to gain its metabolic energy, which is of exclusive interest.
