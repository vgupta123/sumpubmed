the goal of this study is to identify gene pathways with predictive power for breast cancer prognosis.
first, it can assess the predictive power of gene pathways, whereas existing methods tend to focus on model fitting accuracy only.
biomedical studies suggest that genomic measurements may have independent predictive power for prognosis.
gene profiling studies have been conducted to search for predictive genomic measurements.
since our goal is fundamentally different from that of existing studies, a new pathway analysis method is proposed.
we analyze four breast cancer prognosis studies and identify  <dig> pathways with significant predictive power for prognosis.
second, it can account for the joint effects of multiple genes in a pathway, whereas existing methods tend to focus on the marginal effects of genes.
the proposed method provides a useful alternative to existing pathway analysis methods.
genes have the inherent pathway structure, where pathways are composed of multiple genes with coordinated functions.
important pathways missed by alternative methods are identified.
identified pathways can provide further insights into breast cancer prognosis.
