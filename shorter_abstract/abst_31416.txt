furthermore,  <dig> orfs were detected on the plasmid psgg <dig>  including tetracycline resistance genes tell and tet.
the analysis of the whole genome sequence of s. gallolyticus subsp.
gallolyticus isolates revealed one plasmid  homologous to psgg <dig>  we further predicted  <dig> surface proteins containing the cell wall-sorting motif lpxtg, which were shown to play a functional role in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells.
for the first time we detected the presence of the mobilizable psgg <dig> plasmid, which may play a functional role in lateral gene transfer and promote a selective advantage due to a tetracycline resistance.
gallolyticus promotes understanding of genetic factors concerning the pathogenesis and adhesion to ecm of this pathogen.
gallolyticus strain ucn <dig>  revealing significant differences.
to gain insight into the pathomechanisms and the underlying genetic elements for lateral gene transfer, we sequenced the entire genome of this pathogen.
we sequenced the whole genome of s. gallolyticus subsp.
screening of  <dig> s. gallolyticus subsp.
in addition, we performed a whole genome comparison to the recently sequenced s. gallolyticus subsp.
gallolyticus is an important causative agent of infectious endocarditis, while the pathogenicity of this species is widely unclear.
