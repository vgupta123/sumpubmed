to understand the transcriptomic basis of midgut escape and to reveal genes involved in the process, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of midgut samples from mosquitoes which had received a saline meal  or a protein meal   containing chikv.

chikv which was orally acquired by a mosquito along with a sm or pm productively infected the midgut epithelium and disseminated to secondary tissues.
by substituting a bloodmeal for sm, we identified midgut-expressed genes not involved in blood or protein digestion.
the presence of chikv in any of the ingested meals had relatively minor effects on the overall gene expression profiles in midguts.
the mosquito aedes aegypti is the primary vector for medically important arthropod-borne viruses, including chikungunya virus .
by comparison, pm feeding induced  <dig> de genes at day  <dig> and  <dig> genes at day  <dig>  twenty-three de genes encoding trypsins, metalloproteinases, and serine-type endopeptidases were significantly upregulated in midguts of mosquitoes at day  <dig> following sm or pm ingestion.
these included genes coding for trypsins, metalloproteinases, and serine-type endopeptidases, which could be involved in facilitating midgut escape for arboviruses in ae.
in vitro, recombinant aelt showed strong matrix metalloproteinase activity whereas recombinant aesp <dig> did not.
following oral acquisition, an arbovirus has to persistently infect several organs in the mosquito before becoming transmissible to another vertebrate host.
