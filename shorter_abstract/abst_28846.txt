then, along with conformational changes, it would pass through abcc <dig> and fix the second site , until the protein open itself to the extracellular space and allow substrate release.
taking advantage of molecular dynamics simulation, we also analysed their evolution under computational physiological conditions and during the time.
additionally, molecular dynamics simulation on our inward-facing model revealed for the first time conformation changes assumed to occur during transport process.
the multidrug resistance protein abcc11/mrp <dig> is expressed in physiological barriers and tumor breast tissues in which it secretes various substrates including cgmp  and 5fdump , the active metabolite of the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil .
since no experimental data about binding sites of abcc <dig> substrate are available, we decided to in silico localize putative substrate interaction sites of the nucleotide derivatives.
substrates likely first bind at the intracellular side of the transmembrane segment while abcc <dig> is open forward the cytoplasm .
