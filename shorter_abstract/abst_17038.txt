in addition, jasmonic acid seems to play a prominent role in bud dormancy in saffron.
csccd <dig> was highly expressed in quiescent axillary buds and decapitation dramatically reduced its expression levels, suggesting its involvement in the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth.
furthermore, in vitro experiments showed also the involvement of auxin, cytokinin and jasmonic acid on the sprouting of axillary buds from corms in which the apical bud was removed.
in addition, csccd <dig> expression, but not csccd <dig>  was higher in the newly developed vascular tissue of axillary buds compared to the vascular tissue of the apical bud.
we showed that production and transport of auxin in saffron corms could act synergistically with sls to arrest the outgrowth of the axillary buds, similar to the control of above-ground shoot branching.
in addition the expression results of csccd <dig> suggest that sls could positively regulate procambial activity and the development of new vascular tissues connecting leaves with the mother corm.
we focused on two of the genes within the sl pathway, ccd <dig> and ccd <dig>  encoding carotenoid cleavage enzymes required for the production of sls.
while cytokinins from roots promote bud outgrowth.
since the degree of bud sprouts influences the number and size of new corms, and strigolactones  suppress growth of pre-formed axillary bud, it was considered appropriate to investigate sl involvement in physiology and molecular biology in saffron.
