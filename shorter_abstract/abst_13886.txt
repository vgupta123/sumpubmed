here we report tangram, a computationally efficient mei detection program that integrates read-pair  and split-read  mapping signals to detect mei events.
mobile element insertions  have been associated with human genetic disorders, including crohnâ€™s disease, hemophilia, and various types of cancer, motivating the need for accurate mei detection methods.
using simulations and experimental datasets, we demonstrate that tangram has superior sensitivity, specificity, breakpoint resolution and genotyping accuracy, when compared to other, recently developed mei detection methods.
to understand the role of mei events in disease, it is essential to produce accurate individual genotypes in clinical samples.
mobile elements  constitute greater than 50% of the human genome as a result of repeated insertion events during human genome evolution.
tangram is able to determine sample genotypes with very high accuracy.
