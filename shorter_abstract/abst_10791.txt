the present study was conducted to determine the location, the morphology and distribution of nadph-diaphorase positive neurons in the cardiac nerve plexus of the atria of mice .
the total number of cardiac neurons  was  <dig> ±  <dig>  therefore, the nadph-diaphorase positive neurons of the heart represent 10% of the number of cardiac neurons stained by nadh.
the ganglion neurons were located in  <dig> distinct groups:  in the region situated cranial to the pulmonary veins,  caudally to the pulmonary veins, and  in the atrial groove.
the largest group of neurons was located cranially to the pulmonary veins .
the sizes  of the neurons ranged from about  <dig> μm2to about  <dig> μm <dig>  morphometrically, the three types of neurons were similar and there were no significant differences in their sizes.
nadph- diaphorase staining was performed on whole-mount preparations of the atria mice.
the majority of the nadph-diaphorase positive neurons were observed in the ganglia of the plexus.
the number of nadph-d positive neurons was  <dig> ±  <dig> .
the obtained data have shown that the nadph-d positive neurons in the cardiac plexus of the atria of mice are morphologically different, and therefore, it is possible that the function of the neurons may also be different.
the unipolar neurons predominated , whereas the multipolar were encountered less frequently .
three morphological types of nadph-diaphorase neurons could be distinguished on the basis of their shape: unipolar cells, bipolar cells and cells with three processes .
