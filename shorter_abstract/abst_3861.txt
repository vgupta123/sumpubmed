in order to allow principal component analysis  to be performed, the location of a chosen number of equally spaced boundary coordinates can optionally be returned.
such fields require measurement of large collections of leaves, with resulting conclusions being highly influenced by the accuracy of the phenotypic measurement process.
an increased understanding of leaf area development is important in a number of fields: in food and non-food crops, for example short rotation forestry as a biofuels feedstock, leaf area is intricately linked to biomass productivity; in paleontology leaf shape characteristics are used to reconstruct paleoclimate history.
we show that the software provides an efficient and accurate means of analysing leaf area in large datasets in an automated or semi-automated work flow.
we demonstrate the use of the software on a set of  <dig> scanned images, each containing multiple leaves, collected from a common garden experiment containing  <dig> clones of populus tremula  that are being used for association mapping, as well as examples of leaves from other species.
lamina has been designed to provide classical indicators of leaf shape  and size , which are typically required for correlation analysis to biomass productivity, as well as measures that indicate asymmetry in leaf shape, leaf serration traits, and measures of herbivory damage .
