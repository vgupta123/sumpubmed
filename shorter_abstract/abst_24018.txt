an analysis using the new method on the previously published gwas of lung cancer confirmed all significant interactions identified with slasso, and identified two additional interactions not reported with slasso analysis.
these techniques tend to be over-fitting, and are prone to false positives.
evidence suggests that common complex diseases may be partially due to snp-snp interactions, but such detection is yet to be fully established in a high-dimensional small-sample  study.
based on the results obtained in this study, sscad presents to be a powerful procedure for the detection of snp-snp interactions in large-scale genomic data.
a number of penalized regression techniques are gaining popularity within the statistical community, and are now being applied to detect interactions.
the simulation revealed higher power and lower false discovery rate  with sscad.
the recently developed stability least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  has been used to control family-wise error rate, but often at the expense of power .
