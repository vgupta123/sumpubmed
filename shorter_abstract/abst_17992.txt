differentiation of primordial germ cells into mature spermatozoa proceeds through multiple stages, one of the most important of which is meiosis.
these data should be a valuable resource for future studies of meiosis and spermatogenesis in mammals.
in order to characterize gene expression during spermatogenesis we sequenced eight mrna samples from testes of juvenile mice from  <dig> to  <dig> days post partum.
in addition, we detected  <dig>  novel alternative splicing events around 40% of which preserve an open reading frame, and found experimental support for  <dig> computational gene predictions.
a comparison of rna polymerase ii  chip-seq signals with rna-seq coverage shows that gene expression correlates well with pol ii signals, both at promoters and along the gene body.
meiotic recombination is in turn a key part of meiosis.
importantly, we find over a thousand of novel meiotic genes and over  <dig>  novel potentially coding isoforms.
using gene expression clustering we defined over  <dig>  novel meiotically-expressed genes.
we also developed a computational de-convolution approach and used it to estimate cell type-specific gene expression in pre-meiotic, meiotic and post-meiotic cells.
here we provide a comprehensive analysis of gene expression throughout mouse meiosis and spermatogenesis.
