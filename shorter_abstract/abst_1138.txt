this method allows the integration of multiple heterogeneous information sources for the identification of new interactions, and can also work with networks of arbitrary size.
different in silico approaches have been proposed for the identification of new drug-target interactions, many of which are based on kernel methods.
our analysis show that the proposed data integration strategy is able to improve the quality of the predicted interactions, and can speed up the identification of new drug-target interactions as well as identify relevant information for the task.
we propose kronrls-mkl, which models the drug-target interaction problem as a link prediction task on bipartite networks.
drug-target networks are receiving a lot of attention in late years, given its relevance for pharmaceutical innovation and drug lead discovery.
empirical analysis on four data sets using twenty distinct kernels indicates that our method has higher or comparable predictive performance than  <dig> competing methods in all prediction tasks.
despite technical advances in the latest years, these methods are not able to cope with large drug-target interaction spaces and to integrate multiple sources of biological information.
moreover, it automatically selects the more relevant kernels by returning weights indicating their importance in the drug-target prediction at hand.
