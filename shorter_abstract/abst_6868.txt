of these,  <dig> showed highly significant  blast similarity to gene sequences in public databases.
based on marker scores in  <dig> recombinant inbred lines,  <dig> new dart markers were used to saturate and improve the 'kanota' Ã— 'ogle' genetic map.
genomic discovery in oat and its application to oat improvement have been hindered by a lack of genetic markers common to different genetic maps, and by the difficulty of conducting whole-genome analysis using high-throughput markers.
these markers will provide a solid basis for future efforts in genomic discovery, comparative mapping, and the generation of an oat consensus map.
this study was intended to develop, characterize, and apply a large set of oat genetic markers based on diversity array technology .
results of this analysis confirmed that major clusters of oat diversity are related to spring vs. winter type, and to the presence of major breeding programs within geographical regions.
these were screened on three discovery arrays, with more than  <dig> polymorphic markers being identified for use in this study, and approximately  <dig> potentially polymorphic markers being identified for use in future studies.
approximately  <dig>  genomic clones were isolated from complexity-reduced genomic representations of pooled dna samples from  <dig> oat varieties of global origin.
dart markers provided map coverage approximately equivalent to existing markers.
they will also provide new opportunities for directed breeding of superior oat varieties, and guidance in the maintenance of oat genetic diversity.
