research has been focused on characterization of immunologic factors contributing to inflammatory responses, on genetic linkage analysis, and, more recently, on proteomic analysis of airway secretions from affected horses.
recurrent airway obstruction  is a severe chronic respiratory disease affecting horses worldwide, though mostly in the northern hemisphere.
the goal of this study was to investigate the interactions between eight candidate genes previously identified in a genetic linkage study and proteins expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  collected from healthy and rao-affected horses.
interleukin  <dig> receptor and chemokine  ligand  <dig> also showed a large number of interactions with the group of detected proteins.
the gene with the greatest number of indirect interactions with the set of proteins identified is interleukin  <dig> receptor , whose protein has also been detected in balf.
protein products of other genes like that of socs <dig>  revealed direct interactions with the il-4r protein.
the interacting proteins nod <dig>  rps6ka <dig> and foxp <dig> found in several pathways are reported regulators of the nfÎºb pathway.
