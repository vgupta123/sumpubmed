as such, we initiated two forward genetic screens in arabidopsis in order to identify mutants that exhibit altered sensitivity to sulfanilamide compounds.
the genes identified through our forward genetic screens represent novel mediators of arabidopsis responses to sulfanilamides and suggest that these responses extend beyond the perturbation of folate biosynthesis.
while there is evidence that sulfanilamides inhibit folate biosynthesis in both bacteria and plants, the complete network of plant responses to these compounds remains to be characterized.
these screens were based on the growth phenotype of seedlings germinated in the presence of the compound sulfamethoxazole .
