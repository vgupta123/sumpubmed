s. pneumoniae r6-socpr and r6-dp1r were highly resistant to the phage used for their selection and no cross-resistance between the two phages was detected.
resistance reconstruction in phage-sensitive s. pneumoniae confirmed that mutations in a gntr-type regulator, in a glycerophosphoryl phosphodiesterase and in a mur ligase were responsible for resistance to socp.
to gain further insights into the interactions between s. pneumoniae and its pneumophages, we characterized s. pneumoniae mutants selected for resistance to the virulent phages socp or dp- <dig>
