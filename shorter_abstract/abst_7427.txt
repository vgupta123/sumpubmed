to identify ligands for these receptors, we used a combination of profile hidden markov models and position-specific iterative blast, allowing us to detect new members of the clv3/esr  protein family from publicly available sequence databases.
the groupings based on the cle motifs correlate with known biological functions of cle signaling peptides and are analogous to groupings based on phylogenetic analysis and ectopic overexpression studies.
we tested the biological function of two of the predicted cle signaling peptides in the legume medicago truncatula.
we identified  <dig> new members of the cle protein family from various plant species, as well as five protein sequences containing multiple cle domains.
we were able to cluster the cle domain proteins into  <dig> distinct groups based on their pairwise similarities in the primary cle motif.
plants encode a large number of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases.
our analysis provides an identification and classification of a large number of novel potential cle signaling peptides.
these peptides inhibit the activity of the root apical and lateral root meristems in a manner consistent with our functional predictions based on other cle signaling peptides clustering in the same groups.
in addition, we identified secondary motifs that coincide with our sequence clusters.
