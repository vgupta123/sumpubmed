by refining model parameters we highlight the significance of heterogeneous intercellular interactions on tumor progression.
within this paper we present the implementation of the cellular potts model graphically presented through cytoscape.js within a web application.

research on tumor growth involves a plethora of models each emphasizing isolated aspects of benign and malignant neoplasms.
we aim to provide a comprehensive and expandable simulation tool to visualizing tumor growth.
this novel web-based application offers the advantage of a user-friendly graphical interface with several manipulable input variables to correlate different aspects of tumor growth.
we believe that biomedical research in general and research on tumor growth in particular will benefit from the systems biology perspective.
our visualization approach to simulation allows for more flexible usage and easy extension to facilitate understanding and gain novel insight.
fundamental cellular based studies as well as modeling provides insight into cancer biology and strategies to treatment of the disease.
in-silico methods overcome the lack of wet experimental possibilities and as dry method succeed in terms of reduction, refinement and replacement of animal experimentation, also known as the 3r principles.
biologists and clinical scientists are often overwhelmed by the mathematical background knowledge necessary to grasp and to apply a model to their own research.
