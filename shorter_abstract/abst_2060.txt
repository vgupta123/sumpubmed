in framework of the concept graphical objects representing metabolite concentrations and reactions change their volume and shape in accordance to simulation results.
we present mathematical simulation workbench dbsolve optimum which is significantly improved and extended successor of well known simulation software dbsolve <dig>  concept of "dynamic visualization" of simulation results has been developed and implemented in dbsolve optimum.
dbsolve optimum is a user friendly simulation software package that enables to simplify the construction, verification, analysis and visualization of kinetic models.
dbsolve optimum and built-in dynamic visualization module is free for both academic and commercial use.
systems biology research and applications require creation, validation, extensive usage of mathematical models and visualization of simulation results by end-users.
our goal is to develop novel method for visualization of simulation results and implement it in simulation software package equipped with the sophisticated mathematical and computational techniques for model development, verification and parameter fitting.
dynamic visualization tool implemented in the software allows user to animate simulation results and, thereby, present them in more comprehensible mode.
the use of the dynamic visualization is illustrated with kinetic model of the krebs cycle.
this technique is applied to visualize both kinetic response of the model and dependence of its steady state on parameter.
