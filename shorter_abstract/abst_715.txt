furthermore we found gaf orthologs in early branching insect orders, including zygentoma  and diplura .
we screened recently compiled insect transcriptomes from the 1kite project and genomic and transcriptomic data from public databases, aiming to trace the origin of ibps in insects and other arthropods.
mod is most likely a derived feature of neoptera, while pita is likely an evolutionary novelty of holometabolous insects.
our results suggest that a substantial number of ibps either pre-date the evolution of insects or evolved early during insect evolution.
zw <dig> appears to be restricted to schizophoran flies, whereas beaf- <dig>  zipic and the elba complex, are probably unique to the genus drosophila.
our study shows that the last common ancestor of insects  already possessed a substantial number of ibps.
