allele assignment including intronic sequences showed an improved resolution  of non-expressed hla alleles.
human leukocyte antigen matching at allelic resolution is proven clinically significant in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, lowering the risk of graft-versus-host disease and mortality.
the mean ambiguity reduction for the analysed loci was  <dig> %.
therefore, we have developed and validated a scalable automated hla class i and class ii typing approach suitable for diagnostic use.
the workflow was successfully validated according to the policies of the european federation for immunogenetics.
a validation panel of  <dig> clinical and proficiency testing samples was analysed, demonstrating 100% concordance to the reference method.
in light of the complexity and the high degree of allelic diversity, it has become increasingly difficult to define the classical transplantation antigens at high-resolution by using well-tried methods.
we provide a powerful hla typing protocol offering a short turnaround time of only two days, a fully integrated workflow and most importantly a high degree of typing reliability.
next-generation sequencing seems to become one of the new methods in the field of histocompatibility.
