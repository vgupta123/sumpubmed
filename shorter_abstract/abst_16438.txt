human frontal cortex and hippocampus from control and ad post-mortem samples were homogenised and analysed for apoe by western blotting under both reducing and non-reducing conditions.
the possible occurrence of apoe dimers in cortical tissues has not been examined and was therefore assessed.
the addition of the thiol trapping agent, iodoacetamide, to block reactive thiols during both human and rabbit brain sample homogenisation and processing did not reduce the amount of apoe homodimer recovered.
these data indicate that the apoe dimers we detected in the human brain are not likely to be post-mortem artefacts.
apolipoprotein-e  plays important roles in neurobiology and the apoe <dig> isoform increases risk for alzheimer's disease .
the identification of disulphide-linked apoe dimers in human cortical and hippocampal tissues represents a distinct structural difference between the apoe <dig> and apoe <dig> isoforms that may have functional consequences.
