sensitivity and the specificity of the padlock probes  with the ligation protocol with the best performance were also tested and the selected method was initially validated in a laboratory exchange study.
of the ligation protocols tested in this study, the best results were obtained with the pplmd i and pplmd ii protocols and no consistent differences between these two protocols were observed.
from the comparison of ligation protocols it can be concluded that two protocols perform equally well on the basis of the selected set of plps.
both protocols are based on padlock probe ligation combined with microarray detection.
the present study investigated with real-time pcr whether these different ligation methods have any influence on the performance of the probes.
the present study thus shows that specific and sensitive multidetection of gmo targets is now feasible.
during the interlaboratory exchange study similar results were achieved by the two participating institutes .
in the interlaboratory exchange study it was shown that the selected method meets the  <dig> % sensitivity criterion.
for the analysis of a single food or feed sample it is necessary to assess the sample for the presence of many gmo-targets simultaneously at a sensitive level.
