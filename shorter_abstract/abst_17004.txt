these findings demonstrate the stepwise accumulation of control mechanisms within imprinted domains and show that cdkn1c imprinting cannot be due to its synteny with igf <dig> or with its placental expression in mammals.
cdkn1c resides in synteny with igf <dig>  demonstrating that imprinting of the two genes did not occur concurrently to balance maternal and paternal influences on the growth of the placenta.
while the cpg island in intron  <dig> of kcnq <dig> and promoter elements could not be detected, the antisense transcript kcnq1ot <dig> that regulates cdkn1c imprinting in human and mouse is still expressed.
genomic imprinting occurs in both marsupial and eutherian mammals.
genomic analysis of the tammar region confirmed that cdkn1c is syntenic with igf <dig>  however, there are fewer ltr and dna elements in the region and in intron  <dig> of kcnq <dig>  in addition there are fewer lines in the tammar compared with human and mouse.
the expression of kcnq1ot <dig> in the absence of cdkn1c imprinting suggests that antisense transcription at this locus preceded imprinting of this domain.
