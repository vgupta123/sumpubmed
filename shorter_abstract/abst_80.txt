batch fermentations were carried out in  <dig>  l, 42 l and 150 l bioreactors.
the values of effectivity parameters for  <dig> -pd synthesis in batch fermentations carried out in  <dig>  l, 42 l and 150 l bioreactors were similar.
the analysis of cell proteins demonstrated that a number of multifunctional stresses occurred during fed-batch fermentations in the 150 l bioreactor, which suggests the possibility of identifying the key stages in the biochemical process where inhibition of  <dig> -pd synthesis pathways can be observed.
the parameters obtained during fed-batch fermentations in the 150 l bioreactor differed in the rate and percentage of substrate utilization.

the kinetic parameters of  <dig> -pd synthesis from crude glycerol established for batch fermentation were similar regarding all three bioreactor capacities.
it was observed that cultivation of c. butyricum on a pilot scale did not decrease the efficiency of  <dig> -pd production.
the highest concentrations of  <dig> -pd, 37 g/l for batch fermentation and 71 g/l for fed-batch fermentation, were obtained in the  <dig>  l bioreactor.
during fed-batch fermentation, the concentration of  <dig> -pd in the 150 l bioreactor was lower and the substrate was not completely utilized.
the study investigated the scale-up of  <dig> -pd synthesis from crude glycerol by clostridium butyricum.
that suggested the presence of multifunctional environmental stresses in the 150 l bioreactor, which was confirmed by protein analysis.
