accordingly, regulation of caspase activity and degradation of active caspases is essential for a cell’s response to apoptosis stimuli.

the ability of living cells to respond appropriately to apoptosis signals is crucial for the proper development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms.
furthermore, the activation efficiencies of caspases - <dig> and - <dig> that are essential to a cell’s response to extracellular apoptosis stimuli are defined.
based on the simulations performed, it is observed that activation efficiencies must be sufficiently sensitive to appropriately compromise a cell’s resistance and effectiveness in response to apoptosis stimuli.
in this model, rapid degradation of the active forms of caspases - <dig> and - <dig> are included, and tnf-signaling is found to induce a pulse of caspase- <dig> activation and trigger an irreversible death program.
our results suggest that bistability may not be a necessary condition for the induction of apoptosis by tnf signaling.
in this study, apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor  signaling is investigated, and a mathematical model without the requirement for bistability is proposed.
for example, viable cells must be stable enough to appropriately respond to apoptosis signaling so that an irreversible death program is only induced when apoptosis signaling reaches a certain threshold.
previous studies have introduced bistability models in which signaling by caspase- <dig> activity represents a key regulator of cell fate in response to apoptosis stimuli.
the ability of a cell to respond to, or resist, apoptosis stimuli is also discussed.
this result agrees with experimental observations.
