in summary, by exploring exome sequencing data, exome-assistant can provide researchers with detailed biological insights into genetic variation events and permits the identification of potential genetic causes of human diseases and related traits.
compared with whole-genome sequencing of complex samples, exome sequencing serves as an alternative option because of its dramatically reduced cost.
in this study, exome-assistant , a convenient tool for submitting and annotating single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion/deletion variations , was developed to rapidly detect candidate disease-related genetic variations from exome sequencing projects.

exome-assistant consists of four modules: the single case module, the two cases module, the multiple cases module, and the reanalysis module.
the two cases and multiple cases modules allow users to identify sample-specific and common variations.
the multiple cases module also supports family-based studies and mendelian filtering.
however, there remain great challenges in handling the huge data generated by exome sequencing and in identifying potential disease-related genetic variations.
the identified candidate disease-related genetic variations can be annotated according to their sample features.
