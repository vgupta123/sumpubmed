cells with a cd44+/cd24- phenotype were detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> samples with an advantage of high grade tumors  and metastases among tubular, papillary and carcinomas in mixed tumors.
using flow cytometry, cscs were detected in canine mammary tumors as cells cd44+ and cd24-.
studies using flow cytometry have found csc frequencies similar to those found in our study.
published reports usually correlate grade iii tumors with the expression of cd <dig> but not with cd <dig> expression.
immunohistochemistry was found to be a reliable technique for the detection of cscs in canine mammary neoplasms, and the frequency of these cells positively correlates with grades ii and iii tumors .
cancer stem cells  are able to self-renew and to form metastases.

these samples were composed by adenomas, lymph node metastases, solid carcinomas grades ii and iii, tubular, papillary and carcinomas in mixed tumor grades i, ii and iii.
