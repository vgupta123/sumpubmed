the correlation was strongest on macrochromosomes, probably due to a lower recombination rate.
there was a positive correlation between the observed between-line snp variation from the  <dig> k chip analysis and our proposed fsv score computed from the genome resequencing data.
the snp density was around 5% lower on the microchromosomes, most likely because of their higher gene content.
in this study, we investigated the sensitivity of snp detection and introduced the flanking snps value  as a novel measure for predicting snp-variability using ~5x genome resequencing with abi solid and dna pools from two chicken lines divergently selected for juvenile bodyweight.
genome resequencing with limited coverage  using pooled dna samples and three non-reference reads as a threshold for snp detection, identified  <dig> - 67% of the  <dig> k snps with a non-reference allele frequency larger than  <dig> .
snp detection using resequencing was more powerful for positions with larger differences in allele frequency between the lines.
the fsv scores showed higher correlations for snps with a larger difference in allele frequency between the populations.
genotyping with a  <dig> k snp chip revealed polymorphisms within or between two divergently selected chicken lines for  <dig>  <dig> snps, 48% of which were also detected using resequencing of dna pools.
this information is useful for composing subsets of highly informative snps for region-specific or genome-wide analysis and to identify mutations regulating phenotypic differences within or between populations.
