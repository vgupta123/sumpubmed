we found out that there was inhibition that occurred to the immobilized enzyme when substrate concentration exceeded 60 mm.
we prepared two fusion constructs of the γ-lactamase gene gla, which was from sulfolobus solfataricus p <dig>  these two constructs had cbd  fused at amino or carboxyl terminus of the γ-lactamase.
the apparent kinetic parameters revealed that carboxyl terminus fused protein  was a better catalyst.
the absorption between cbd domain and cellulose is a bio-green process.
the cellulose binding domain  of cellulose is often used as the bio-specific affinity matrix for enzyme immobilization.
after optimization, the immobilized enzyme concentration in transformation was set as 200 mg/ml.
cellulose is the most abundant and renewable material on the earth.
the cellulose immobilized fusion gla exhibited good catalytic characters, therefore we think the cellulose immobilized gla is a promising catalyst for the industrial preparation of  - γ-lactam.
in some cases, enzymatic method is the most utilized method because of its high efficiency and productivity.
these two constructs were heterogeneously expressed in e. coli rosetta  as two fusion proteins.
finally a 10 ml-volume transformation was conducted, in which  <dig>  m substrate was hydrolyzed and the resolution was completed within 9 h with a  <dig> % ee value.
cellulose is cheap and it has excellent chemical and physical properties.
the vmax and kcat value of avicel immobilized gla-linker-cbd were  <dig> u mg- <dig> and  <dig>  × 105 s- <dig> respectively.
