rnasel cdna sequences were determined for  <dig> mammals and utilized in a phylogenetic analysis.
mutations in either the oas <dig> or rnasel genes may also modulate the outcome of wnv-induced disease or other viral infections in horses.
no polymorphisms have yet been identified in either the equine oas <dig> or rnasel genes for use in similar case-control studies.
the chromosomal location of the rnasel gene was assigned by fish to eca5p17-p <dig> using two selected chori- <dig> bac clones.
specific amplification of regions of the rnasel gene from  <dig> horses identified  <dig> snps.
in this report, two dinucleotide microsatellites and  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms within the equine oas <dig> and rnasel genes were identified.
a premature stop-codon within the murine oas1b gene results in the increased susceptibility of mice to a number of flaviviruses, including west nile virus .
genomic sequence for equine oas <dig> was obtained from a contig assembly generated from a shotgun subclone library of chori- <dig> bac 100i <dig>  specific amplification of regions of the oas <dig> gene from  <dig> horses of various breeds identified  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  and two microsatellites.
polymorphisms in the human oas gene cluster have been previously utilized for case-control analysis of virus-induced disease in humans.
