assuming that the kd value for hcii 1- <dig> of 330- <dig> nm faithfully predicts that of this region in intact hcii, and that 1- <dig> binding to exosite  <dig> is gag-dependent, our results support a model in which thrombin first binds to gags, followed by hcii addition to the ternary complex and release of hcii 1- <dig> for exosite  <dig> binding and serpin mechanism inhibition.
deletion of hcii 1- <dig> greatly reduces the ability of glycosaminoglycans  to accelerate the inhibition of thrombin, and abrogates hcii binding to thrombin exosite  <dig>  while a minor portion of hcii 1- <dig> can be visualized in a crystallized hcii-thrombin s195a complex, the role of the rest of the extension is not well understood and the affinity of the hcii 1- <dig> interaction has not been quantitatively characterized.
heparin cofactor ii  is a circulating protease inhibitor, one which contains an n-terminal acidic extension  unique within the serpin superfamily.
hcii 1- <dig> competed thrombin binding to chip-immobilized hcii 1- <dig> more effectively than hcii 54- <dig> but less effectively than the c-terminal dodecapeptide of hirudin .
to address these issues, we expressed hcii 1- <dig> as a small, n-terminally hexahistidine-tagged polypeptide in e. coli.
biotinylated hcii 1- <dig> immobilized on streptavidin chips bound Î±-thrombin and fpr-ck-thrombin with similar kd values of 330- <dig> nm.
