in a context of specific cell depletion and conditioned medium,in vitro induction of human abs against a conserved self ag was successfully acquired and a relatively basic mab, γ4λhucd <dig>  with high affinity to cdr <dig> of cd <dig> was thus obtained.
here we developed an optimized protocol for site-directed in vitro immunizing peripheral blood mononuclear cells  by using a selected epitope of human cd <dig>  an essential receptor involved in down-regulation of t cell activation.
application of such a human igg4λ mab with designated cdr <dig> specificity may impact upon and prefer for cd <dig> labeling both in situ and ex situ, as it does not affect the binding of endogenous b <dig> ligands and can localize into the confined immunological synapse which may otherwise prevent the access of whole igg <dig> molecules.
interestingly, γ4λhucd <dig> has a basic pi not commonly found in myeloid monoclonal igg4λs as revealed by the isoelectric focusing  analysis.
