regulation of sit <dig> upon bap treatment was also confirmed at the gene expression level.
in order to investigate the mechanism of action of pahs, we exposed the diatoms for  <dig> h to  <dig>  Î¼g/l of bap which inhibits the growth by about 30%, and analysed the relative protein expression profile by a quantitative proteomics approach based on itraq labels.
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  are environmental pollutants ubiquitously distributed.
the proteomics profile analysis showed that around 10% of the identified proteins were regulated and one fourth of them confirmed the gene expression changes seen by dna microarray.
particularly interesting was the down regulation of the silicon transporter  <dig> , an enzyme that is responsible for the uptake of silicon from the media into the diatom cells.
