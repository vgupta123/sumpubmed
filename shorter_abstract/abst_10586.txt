using comparative genomic and phylogenetic approaches, we showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> known apc/c subunits, adaptors/co-activators and main targets, were already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor  and were well conserved to a few exceptions in all present-day eukaryotic lineages.
apc/c is made of a dozen subunits that assemble into a large complex of ~ <dig>  mda, which interacts with various cofactors and targets.
it plays a crucial role in the control of the cell cycle and cell proliferation by mediating the proteolysis of key components by the proteasome.
taken together our analyses indicated that leca had a complex and highly controlled modern-like cell cycle.
the phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> components inferred to be present in leca showed that they contain a reliable phylogenetic signal to reconstruct the phylogeny of the domain eucarya.
