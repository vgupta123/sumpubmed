our results show that ntca has a much wider role in the physiology of the cell than it has been previously thought, acting both as a global transcriptional regulator and possibly also as a factor influencing the superstructure of the chromosome .
interestingly, only a small proportion of those genes are involved in n assimilation and metabolism, and 65% of the binding regions were located intragenically.
the distribution of ntca-binding sites identified here reveals the largest bacterial regulon described to date.
