identification of susceptible wildlife of maio island is of upmost importance to evaluate the risk of pathogen spill over from domestic to wild animals in cape verde and to evaluate the associated threat to the wild susceptible species.
in addition, these animals can act as disease reservoirs for wild animal populations by occasional contact.
virus transmission and spreading occurs easily in large dog populations leading to high mortality rates particularly in unvaccinated susceptible animals.
infections caused by canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus are an important cause of mortality and morbidity in dogs worldwide.
to provide information regarding the health status of the canine population in vila do maio, maio island, cape verde,  <dig> rectal swabs were collected from  <dig> stray dogs during  <dig> and  <dig> rectal swabs and  <dig> blood samples were collected from  <dig> stray dogs in  <dig>  all rectal swabs  were analysed for the presence of canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus nucleic acids by quantitative pcr methods.
specific antibodies against canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus were also assessed .
from the  <dig> sampling,  <dig> %  were positive for canine parvovirus dna,  <dig> %  for canine distemper virus rna and  <dig> %  for canine coronavirus rna.
in  <dig>  the prevalence values for canine parvovirus and canine coronavirus were quite similar to those from the previous year, respectively  <dig> % , and  <dig> % , but canine distemper virus was not detected in any of the samples analysed .
antibodies against canine parvovirus were detected in  <dig> %  blood samples and the seroprevalence found for canine distemper virus was  <dig> % .
