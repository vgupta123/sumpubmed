we subsequently constructed a cd147-specific scfv, scfv-m6-1b9-intrabody, in 293a cells.
the results suggest that our approach can generate antibody fragments suitable for decreasing the expression of cd <dig> on 293a cells.
phage display technology was introduced to generate the functional antibody fragment to cd <dig>  and we subsequently constructed a cd147-specific scfv that was expressed intracellularly and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by adenoviral gene transfer.
the expression of cd <dig> on 293a cell surface was monitored at  <dig> h after transduction by flow cytometry and demonstrated remarkable reduction.
