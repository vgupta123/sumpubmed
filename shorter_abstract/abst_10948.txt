such traits include juvenile growth rates, age at sexual maturity, adult body size, age-specific fecundity/mortality, total reproduction, mean and maximum lifespan, and intrinsic population growth rates.
we found no evidence that adaptation to the laboratory altered the life history traits of c. elegans strain n <dig>  our results, discussed in the light of earlier studies on c. elegans, demonstrate certain advantages of the hanging drop method in investigations of nematode life cycles.
for strain n <dig> , the intrinsic rate of natural increase , calculated according to the lotka equation, was  <dig> , the net reproductive rate   <dig>  the mean generation time   <dig> h, and the minimum generation time   <dig>  h. the corresponding values for strain my <dig>  were rm =  <dig> , r <dig> =  <dig>  t =  <dig> h, and tmin =  <dig>  h. peak egg-laying rates in both strains exceeded  <dig> eggs d- <dig>  juvenile and early adulthood mortality was negligible.
though isolated  <dig> km and  <dig> years apart from each other, the two strains barely differed in life-cycle parameters.
here, the life cycles of wild-type c. elegans strains n <dig>  and my <dig>  were compared at 20°c with  <dig> ×  <dig> escherichia coli ml- <dig> as food source.
many researchers have evaluated life-history traits of c. elegans in investigations covering quite different aspects such as ecotoxicology, inbreeding depression and heterosis, dietary restriction/supplement, mutations, and ageing.
in this fast and yet precise approach, single individuals are maintained within hanging drops of semi-fluid culture medium, allowing the simultaneous investigation of various life-history traits at any desired degree of accuracy.
high-resolution life tables and fecundity schedules of the two strains are presented.
strain n <dig> lived, on average, for  <dig>  d, while strain my <dig> died  <dig> days earlier; however, differences in survivorship curves were statistically non-significant.
the free-living nematode caenorhabditis elegans is the predominant model organism in biological research, being used by a huge number of laboratories worldwide.
assuming that its reproducibility is validated in further studies, the method will reduce the inter-laboratory variability of life-history estimates and may ultimately prove to be more convenient than the current standard methods used by c. elegans researchers.
