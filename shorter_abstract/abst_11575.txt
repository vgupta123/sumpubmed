despite their importance, little is known about sesame ap2/erf genes.
one hundred thirty-two ap2/erf genes were identified in the sesame genome.
the number of sesame ap2/erf genes was relatively few compared to that of other relatives, probably due to gene loss in erf and dreb subfamilies during evolutionary process.
in general, the ap2/erf genes were expressed differently in different tissues but exhibited the highest expression levels in the root.
this study provides insights into the classification, evolution and basic functional analysis of ap2/erf genes in sesame which revealed their putative involvement in multiple tissue-/developmental stages.
out of  <dig> genes which were significantly up- /down-regulated under drought stress, the gene ap2si <dig> may be considered as potential candidate gene for further functional validation as well for utilization in sesame improvement programs for drought stress tolerance.
sesame is an important oilseed crop mainly grown in inclement areas with high temperatures and frequent drought.
thus, drought constitutes one of the major constraints of its production.
this constitutes a limitation for drought-tolerance candidate genes discovery and breeding for tolerance to water deficit.
mostly all dreb genes were responsive to drought stress.

the ap2/erf is a large family of transcription factors known to play significant roles in various plant processes including biotic and abiotic stress responses.
based on the number of domains, conserved motifs, genes structure and phylogenetic analysis including  <dig> relatives species, they were classified into  <dig> ap <dig>   <dig> dreb,  <dig> erf,  <dig> rav and  <dig> soloist.
