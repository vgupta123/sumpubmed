to make the classification as a ncrna, the total free energy change of an input sequence pair can either be compared with the total free energy changes of a set of control sequence pairs, or be used in combination with sequence length and nucleotide frequencies as input to a classification support vector machine.
additionally, both dynalign-based methods are more sensitive than rnaz and qrna at low sequence pair identities.
the dynalign-computed optimal total free energy change, which scores the structural alignment and the free energy change of folding into a common structure for two rna sequences, is shown to be an effective measure for distinguishing ncrna from randomized sequences.
here, dynalign, a program for predicting secondary structures common to two rna sequences on the basis of minimizing folding free energy change, is utilized as a computational ncrna detection tool.
however, it is difficult to detect novel ncrnas in biochemical screens.
the increasing number of genomic sequences provides a rich dataset for computational comparative sequence analysis and detection of novel ncrnas.
significant improvements in dynalign runtime have also been achieved.
dynalign can be used as a comparable or more accurate tool than rnaz or qrna in genomic screens, especially for low-identity regions.
the dynalign-based support vector machine method is more sensitive for known ncrnas in the test genomic screens than rnaz and qrna.
