surprisingly, this approach is hindered by lack of appropriate nuclear gene markers for many taxonomic groups especially at high taxonomic level, partially due to the lack of tools for efficiently developing new phylogenetic makers.
our method is an improvement over traditional approaches  because it uses genomic information and automates the process to identify large numbers of candidate makers.
this approach is shown here to be successful for fishes, but also could be applied to other groups of organisms for which two or more complete genome sequences exist, which has important implications for assembling the tree of life.
we report here a genome-comparison strategy to identifying nuclear gene markers for phylogenetic inference and apply it to the ray-finned fishes â€“ the largest vertebrate clade in need of phylogenetic resolution.
experimental tests of  <dig> of these  markers on  <dig> taxa  demonstrate the feasibility of amplifying by pcr and directly sequencing most of these candidates from whole genomic dna in a vast diversity of fish species.
we present a practical approach that systematically compares whole genome sequences to identify single-copy nuclear gene markers for inferring phylogeny.
