drug impact on the akt and erk1/ <dig> signalling axes is mirrored by effects on rb and rps <dig>  relating to phenotypic events like cell growth or proliferation.
we used longitudinal proteomic data of erbb receptors and downstream targets in the erbb- <dig> amplified breast cancer cell lines bt <dig>  skbr <dig> and hcc <dig> treated with erlotinib, trastuzumab or pertuzumab, alone or combined, up to  <dig> minutes and  <dig> hours, respectively.
in a boolean modelling approach, signalling networks were reconstructed based on these data in a cell line and time course specific manner, including prior literature knowledge.
the networks pointed to cell line specific activation patterns of the mapk and pi3k pathway.
for example, we uncovered feedback loops amplifying pi3k signalling, in line with the known trastuzumab resistance of this cell line.
we derived protein interaction models for three breast cancer cell lines.

the results indicated a pathway specific drug response, driven by the type of growth factor stimulus.
therefore, we additionally analysed rb and rps <dig> in the long-term networks.
in the perturbation simulations on the short-term networks, we analysed erk1/ <dig>  akt and p70s6k.
our intention is to reconstruct the erbb network to reveal resistance mechanisms.
changes compared to the common reference network hint towards individual characteristics and potential drug resistance mechanisms.
simulation of perturbations were consistent with the experimental data, confirming our combined reverse and forward engineering approach as valuable for drug discovery and personalised medicine.
the monoclonal antibody drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab as well as the small molecule inhibitor erlotinib were designed to prevent erbb- <dig> and erbb- <dig> receptor induced deregulated protein signalling, contributing to tumour progression.
despite promising progress in targeted breast cancer therapy, drug resistance remains challenging.
in bt <dig>  the pi3k signal route was favoured, while in skbr <dig>  novel edges highlighted mapk signalling.
the oncogenic potential of erbb receptors unfolds in case of overexpression or mutations.
