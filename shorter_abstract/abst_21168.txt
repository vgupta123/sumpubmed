the purpose of this research was to develop a novel information theoretic method and an efficient algorithm for analyzing the gene-gene  and gene-environmental interactions  associated with quantitative traits .
the method is built on two information-theoretic metrics, the k-way interaction information  and phenotype-associated information .
in addition, both metrics showed strong concordance with the results of the two different qtl mapping data sets.
the chorus algorithm was tested using the simulated gaw <dig> data set and two real ggi data sets from qtl mapping studies of high-density lipoprotein levels/atherosclerotic lesion size and ultra-violet light-induced immunosuppression.
