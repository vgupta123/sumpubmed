a cryptic promoter in the pvx vector was discovered with rt-pcr.
it is widely used to express foreign genes.
in molecular manipulation, the foreign genes need to be sub-cloned into the vector.
usually, during amplification stage, the foreign genes are not expressed.
potato virus x has been developed into an expression vector for plants.
however, if the foreign gene is expressed, the construction work could be interrupted.
two different viral genes were sub-cloned into the vector, but only one foreign gene was successfully sub-cloned.
the other foreign gene, canine parvovirus type  <dig>  vp <dig> could not be sub-cloned into the vector and amplified without mutation .
it is important to recognize the homologous promoter sequences in the vector when a virus is developed as an expression vector.
the promoter activity was studied with northern blots and real-time rt-pcr.
during the plasmid amplification stage, an unexpected expression of the cpv- <dig> vp <dig> gene  can interrupt the downstream work.
