the large sensitivity, high reproducibility and essentially unlimited dynamic range of real-time pcr to measure gene expression in complex samples provides the opportunity for powerful multivariate and multiway studies of biological phenomena.
the data are analyzed by matrix-augmented pca, which is a generalization of pca for 3-way data, and the results are confirmed by hierarchical clustering and clustering by kohonen self-organizing map.
multiway real-time pcr gene expression profiling is a powerful technique which can be utilized to characterize functions of new genes by, for example, comparing their temporal response after perturbation in different genetic variants of the studied subject.
of particular interest is our finding that adh <dig> and adh <dig> show a behavior typical of glucose-induced genes, while adh <dig> and adh <dig> are repressed after glucose addition.
in multiway studies samples are characterized by their expression profiles to monitor changes over time, effect of treatment, drug dosage etc.
