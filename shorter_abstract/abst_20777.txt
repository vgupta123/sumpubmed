we found that, although these  <dig> kits had equal performances in extracting mirnas from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the macherey-nagel kit presented several advantages when isolating mirnas from sera.
in that context, we performed an independent cross-comparison of three commercially available rna extraction kits for mirnas isolation from human blood samples .
besides, our results have indicated that, depending on the quantity of the biological samples used, the extraction procedure directly impacted on the g/c composition of the mirnas detected.
however, the application of circulating mirnas in clinical practices still requires the identification of highly efficient, robust and reproducible methods for their isolation from biological samples.
mirnas were further profiled using the taqman low density array technology.
