the drip-flow apparatus may represent the better in vitro model to investigate biofilm formation of a. pleuropneumoniae.
cross-referencing of differentially transcribed genes in the different assays revealed that drip-flow biofilms shared few differentially expressed genes with static biofilms  but shared several differentially expressed genes with natural or experimental infections in pigs.
the formation of a static biofilm by a. pleuropneumoniae strain s <dig> is a rapid process and transcriptional analysis indicated that dispersal observed at  <dig> h is driven by nutritional stresses.
biofilm bacteria cultured using the drip-flow apparatus differentially expressed  <dig> genes  compared to the effluent bacteria.
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the gram-negative bacterium responsible for porcine pleuropneumonia.
furthermore, a. pleuropneumoniae can form a biofilm under low-shear force in a drip-flow apparatus and analyses indicated that the formation of a biofilm under low-shear force requires a different sub-set of genes than a biofilm grown under static conditions.
this biofilm reactor is a system with an air-liquid interface modeling lung-like environment.
the objectives of our study were to study the transcriptome of a. pleuropneumoniae biofilms at different stages and to develop a protocol to grow an a. pleuropneumoniae biofilm in a drip-flow apparatus.
labelled cdna was hybridized to a microarray to compare the expression profiles of planktonic cells and biofilm cells.
among the genes identified in the  <dig> h vs 6h biofilm experiment, several regulators of stress response were down-regulated and energy metabolism associated genes were up-regulated.
