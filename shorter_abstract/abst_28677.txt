to determine if cfad is necessary for the ability of apra to slow proliferation, whether apra binds to cells, and if so whether the binding requires the presence of cfad, we examined the binding and effect on proliferation of recombinant apra.
when added to wild-type or apra- cells, recombinant apra  significantly slows proliferation at  <dig>  μg/ml and higher concentrations.
we previously found that crla- cells are sensitive to cfad.
together, the data suggest that apra functions as an autocrine proliferation-inhibiting factor by binding to cell surface receptors.
the proliferation-inhibiting activity of rapra is roughly the same as that of native apra in conditioned growth medium.
native apra inhibits the binding of rapra to apra- cells with a ki of  <dig>  μg/ml, suggesting that the binding kinetics of rapra are similar to those of native apra.
combined with the results presented here, this suggests that crla is not the apra or cfad receptor, and may be the receptor for an unknown third factor that is required for apra and cfad activity.
proliferating apra- cells show saturable binding of rapra to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cell-surface receptors with a kd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml.
although apra requires cfad for activity, it does not require cfad to bind to cells, suggesting the possibility that cells have an apra receptor and a cfad receptor, and activation of both receptors is required to slow proliferation.
we find that the extracellular accumulation of apra increases with cell density and reaches a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml near a stationary cell density.
cells lacking either apra or cfad proliferate faster than wild type, while apra or cfad overexpressor cells proliferate slowly, indicating that apra and cfad are autocrine factors that repress proliferation.
cfad interacts with apra and requires the presence of apra to slow proliferation.
surprisingly, both cell types still bind rapra.
