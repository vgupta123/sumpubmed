isolates originated from humans, companion animals  and horses.
isolates from human, companion animals and horses shared several characteristics regarding presence of esbl, pmqr and combination of different resistance genes.
the most frequent species in this study was escherichia coli , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae , and enterobacter cloacae .
in this study  <dig>  of the human isolates  and  <dig>  of the animal isolates  were confirmed as esbl producers by pcr and subsequent sequencing of the pcr amplicons.
the results indicate active transmission and dissemination of multi-resistant enterobacteriaceae among human and animal populations.
the carbapenemase oxa- <dig> was detected in  <dig> ertapenem-resistant companion animal isolates in this study.
investigation of escherichia coli phylogenetic groups revealed underrepresentation of group b <dig> within the animal isolates.
subtype blactx-m- <dig> was found almost exclusively in equine and was absent from human isolates.
this study focused on comparative molecular characterization of Î²-lactamase and esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae isolates from central hesse in germany.
predominant esbl subtypes in human and animal samples were ctx-m- <dig>  and ctx-m- <dig>  respectively.
