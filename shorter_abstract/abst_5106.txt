metaspades excelled in diverse sets, idba-ud performed well all around, metavelvet had high accuracy in high abundance organisms, and megahit was able to accurately differentiate similar organisms within a community.
however, in order to obtain the best metagenomic assemblies, it is important to choose the proper assembler.
we tested five metagenomic assemblers: omega, metaspades, idba-ud, metavelvet and megahit on known and synthetic metagenomic data sets.
it is important to choose the appropriate assembler, and thus clearly define the biological problemÂ of an experiment, as different assemblers will give different answers to the same question.
furthermore, the truth sets used to compare these methods are either too simple  or complex , yielding results that are hard to interpret.
due to the rapidly evolving nature of metagenomics, new assemblers are constantly created, and the field has not yet agreed on a standardized process.
by correctly determining the relation between human health and the human associated microbial communities, novel mechanisms of health and disease can be found, thus enabling the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.
due to the diversity of the microbial communities, strategies developed for aligning human genomes cannot be utilized, and genomes of the microbial species in the community must be assembled de novo.
