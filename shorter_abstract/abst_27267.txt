we also developed a rule-based model to automatically extract such plant–chemical relationships.
the corpus contains  <dig> plant entities,  <dig> chemical entities, and  <dig>  plant–chemical relationships , which are drawn from  <dig> sentences in  <dig> pubmed abstracts.
we expect that the corpus for plant–chemical relationships will be a useful resource for enhancing plant research.
with the accumulation of a large volume of biomedical literature in various databases such as pubmed, it is possible to automatically extract relationships between plants and chemicals in a large-scale way if we apply a text mining approach.
the simple percent agreement scores for entities and trigger words for the relationships were  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, and the overall kappa score for the classification of positive and negative relationships was  <dig>  %.
when we evaluated the rule-based model using the corpus and randomly selected biomedical articles, overall f-scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % were achieved, respectively.
plants are natural products that humans consume in various ways including food and medicine.
