since similar migration patterns were found for q80k and other lineages, no clear differentiation of the risk for failing simeprevir can be made between patients based on their migration and travel history.
the patient migration and travel history cannot be used to target only part of the hcv1a infected population for drug resistance testing before start of antiviral therapy.
our results showed that both immigration and local circulation fuel the current italian hcv1a epidemic.
importantly, since hcv only occasionally recombines, these results are readily transferable to the genetic sequencing policy concerning ns5a ravs.
here, as a model, we focused on the provenance, in the current italian hcv subtype 1a epidemic, of the ns <dig> resistance-associated variant  q80k, known to interfere with the action of ns3/4a protease inhibitor simeprevir.
