among experimental studies, 73% yielded positive results, and  <dig> % yielded negative results.
although the majority of equine clinical studies yielded positive results, the human clinical trials’ results failed to corroborate these findings.
we searched medline, pubmed, embase, bireme and google scholar without restrictions until july  <dig>  randomized trials, human cohort clinical studies or case series with a control group on the use of prp in tendons, ligaments or articular lesions were included.
equine clinical studies on the same topics were included independently of their design.
prp’s beneficial effects were observed in  <dig> % of the clinical studies, while the absence of positive effects was observed in  <dig> %.
in both species, beneficial results were more frequently observed in studies with a high risk of bias.
the use of prp in musculoskeletal lesions, although safe and promising, has still not shown strong evidence in clinical scenarios.
the most frequent flaws in the clinical trials’ designs were the lack of a true placebo group, poor product characterization, insufficient blinding, small sampling, short follow-up periods, and adoption of poor outcome measures.
poor study design was a common feature of equine clinical trials.
this systematic review aimed to present and critically appraise the available information on the efficacy of platelet rich plasma  in equine and human orthopedic therapeutics and to verify the influence of study design and methodology on the assumption of prp’s efficacy.

the methods employed for prp preparation and administration and the selected outcome measures varied greatly.
most experimental studies revealed positive effects of prp.
experimental studies relevant to the clarification of prp’s effects and mechanisms of action in tissues of interest, conducted in any animal species, were selected.
