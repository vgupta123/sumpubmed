the development of digital imaging technology is creating extraordinary levels of accuracy that provide support for improved reliability in different aspects of the image analysis, such as content-based image retrieval, image segmentation, and classification.
this paper presents the development and evaluation of a novel content-based image retrieval  framework.

the cbir algorithms that were developed can reliably retrieve the candidate image patches exhibiting intensity and morphological characteristics that are most similar to a given query image.
by aggregating the computational power of high performance computing  and cloud resources, we demonstrated that the method can be successfully executed in minutes on the cloud compared to weeks using standard computers.
by integrating a newly developed dual-similarity relevance feedback module into the cbir framework, the cbir results were improved substantially.
comparative experimental results demonstrate excellent performance throughout the course of a set of systematic studies.
the methods were tested extensively using both peripheral blood smears and renal glomeruli specimens.
in this paper, we present a set of newly developed cbir algorithms and validate them using two different pathology applications, which are regularly evaluated in the practice of pathology.
we show how parallel searching of content-wise similar images in the dataset significantly reduces the overall computational time to ensure the practical utility of the proposed cbir algorithms.
in this context, a new generation of data/information driven applications must be developed to take advantage of the national advanced cyber-infrastructure  which enable investigators to seamlessly and securely interact with information/data which is distributed across geographically disparate resources.
