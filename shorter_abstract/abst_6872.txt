the c. botulinum strain a genome was examined for potential homologues of cnts.
this flagellin sequence displayed the strongest sequence similarity to the neurotoxin and ntnh homologue out of all proteins encoded within c. botulinum strain a. the cbo <dig> gene contains a unique hypervariable region, which in closely related flagellins encodes a collagenase-like domain.
a key link was identified between the neurotoxin and the flagellin gene  located immediately upstream of the bont/a neurotoxin gene cluster.
duplication, reshuffling and assembly of neighboring genes within the bont/a neurotoxin gene cluster may have lead to the neurotoxin's unique architecture.
despite considerable progress in understanding cnt structure and function, the evolutionary origins of cnts remain a mystery as they are unique to clostridium and possess a sequence and structural architecture distinct from other protein families.
clostridial neurotoxins  are the most deadly toxins known and causal agents of botulism and tetanus neuroparalytic diseases.
additional links to collagenase-related sequences and functions were detected by further analysis of cnts and surrounding genes, including sequence similarities to collagen-adhesion domains and collagenases.
furthermore, the neurotoxin's hcrn domain was found to exhibit both structural and sequence similarity to eukaryotic collagen jelly-roll domains.
