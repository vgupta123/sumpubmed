to construct exact <dig> we manually inspected hundreds of published and commercial biomedical protocols from several areas of biomedicine.
in this exact <dig> is used as a reference model for text mining tools to identify terms pertinent to experimental actions, and their properties, in biomedical protocols expressed in natural language.
it can serve as a reference model for for the translation of biomedical protocols in natural language into a semantically-defined format.
there is a pressing technological need for the better representation of biomedical protocols to enable other agents  to better reproduce results.
we have developed the ontology exact <dig>  that is designed to capture the full semantics of biomedical protocols required for their reproducibility.
the paper reports on a fundamentally new version exact <dig> that supports the semantically-defined representation of biomedical protocols.
an exact2-based framework for the translation of biomedical protocols to a machine amenable format is proposed.
the exact <dig> ontology is sufficient to record, in a machine processable form, the essential information about biomedical protocols.
exact <dig> defines explicit semantics of experimental actions, and can be used by various computer applications.
the ability of exact <dig> to capture the semantics of biomedical procedures was verified through a text mining use case.
the reliability and reproducibility of experimental procedures is a cornerstone of scientific practice.
after establishing a clear pattern for extracting the required information we utilized text-mining tools to translate the protocols into a machine amenable format.
a framework that ensures that all information required for the replication of experimental protocols is essential to achieve reproducibility.
