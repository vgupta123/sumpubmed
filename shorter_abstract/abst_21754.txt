these analyses also indicated that hescs exhibit several features of polarized epithelia, including expression of tight junction proteins.
these analyses are only partly predictive of protein expression however, and do not shed light on post-translational regulation, leaving a large gap in our knowledge of the biology of pluripotent stem cells.
here we describe the use of two large-scale western blot assays to identify over  <dig> proteins expressed in undifferentiated hescs, and highlight over  <dig> examples of multiple gel mobility variants, which are suspected protein isoforms and/or post-translational modifications.
much of our current knowledge of the molecular expression profile of human embryonic stem cells  is based on transcriptional approaches.
twenty-two phosphorylation events in cell signaling molecules, as well as potential new markers of undifferentiated hescs were also identified.
