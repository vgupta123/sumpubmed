microarray analysis of seedling roots expressing spcdc <dig> reveals that expression of  <dig> genes is changed by > 2-fold.
seedlings expressing spcdc <dig> produced 2-fold more ethylene than wt and exhibited a significant reduction in hypocotyl length both in darkness or when exposed to  <dig> ppm ethylene.
we suggest that the reduction in root width and change to a more isodiametric cell phenotype in the ram in spcdc <dig> expressing plants is a response to ethylene over-production.
overall, our data reveal important cross talk between cell division and plant growth regulators leading to developmental changes.
amongst these was the up-regulation of genes associated with ethylene synthesis and signaling.
expressing spcdc <dig> in arabidopsis results in increased formation of lateral and adventitious roots, a reduction of primary root width and more isodiametric cells in the root apical meristem  compared with wild type.
expression of spcdc <dig> in tobacco by- <dig> cells accelerates entry into mitosis and depletes cytokinins; in whole plants it stimulates lateral root production.
the increased rooting phenotype in spcdc <dig> expressing plants is due to an increase in the ratio of endogenous auxin to cytokinin that is known to stimulate an increased rate of lateral root production.
furthermore it stimulates root morphogenesis from hypocotyls when cultured on two way grids of increasing auxin and cytokinin concentrations.
