concerns are rising about possible effects of this contaminated feed on resistance selection in the intestinal microbiota.
however, future research is needed to confirm our results and to evaluate the effects of these detected concentrations on resistance selection in the intestinal microbiota of pigs.
the relation between the oral bioavailability and intestinal concentrations of the tested antimicrobials, may be of help in assessing the risks of cross-contaminated feed.
the poor oral bioavailability of tetracyclines resulted in rather high concentrations in cecal and colonic content and feces at steady-state conditions.
on the other hand, lower mean levels of sdz  and trim  were found in the feces, corresponding with the high oral bioavailability of sdz and trim in pigs.

therefore, an experiment with pigs was set up, in which intestinal and fecal concentrations of chlortetracycline , doxycycline  and sulfadiazine-trimethoprim  were determined after administration of feed containing a 3 % carry-over level of these antimicrobials.
a mean concentration of 10 mg/kg ctc and 4 mg/kg dox in the feces was reached, which is higher than concentrations that were shown to cause resistance selection.
