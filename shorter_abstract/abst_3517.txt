discrepancies between the two methods were resolved by using the api system, e-test or microbroth dilution.
in order to obtain results of id and ast up to  <dig> hours earlier, we evaluated the accuracy of direct inoculation of the phoenix system from positive blood cultures  by using serum separator tubes to harvest bacteria from positive blood cultures.
ast with the direct method showed a categorical agreement for gram-negative rods  of  <dig> %, with  <dig> % minor errors,  <dig> % very major errors and no major errors.
the direct method for ast of staphylococcus  and enterococcus  species showed a categorical agreement of  <dig> %, with a minor error rate of  <dig> %, a major error rate of  <dig> % and a very major error rate of  <dig> %.
rapid identification  and antibiotic susceptibility testing  of the causative micro-organism of bloodstream infections result in earlier targeting of antibiotic therapy.
results were compared to those of standard phoenix procedure.
inoculation of phoenix panels directly from positive blood cultures can be used to report reliable results of ast of gnr a day earlier, as well as id-results of enterobacteriaceae.
for staphylococcus and enterococcus species, results of ast can also be reported a day earlier for all antibiotics, except for erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
id with the direct method was correct for  <dig> % of all tested enterobacteriaceae  and  <dig> % of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains .
