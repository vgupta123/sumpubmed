cci <dig> grown under different conditions, complete transcriptomes were determined using high throughput rna deep sequencing.
heat map analysis organized genes into groups that were expressed or repressed under the various conditions compared to median expression values.
significantly higher expression of transposase orfs was found in the five-day and n2-fixing cultures, suggesting that n starvation and culture aging provide conditions for on-going genome modification.
strains are actinobacteria that form n2-fixing root nodules on angiosperms.
these studies also sound a cautionary note when comparing the transcriptomes of frankia grown in root nodules, where cell heterogeneity would be expected to be quite high.
samples varied by time  and by culture conditions .
several reference genome sequences are available enabling transcriptome studies in frankia sp.
strains differ markedly in size, a consequence proposed to be associated with a high number of indigenous transposases, more than  <dig> of which are found in frankia sp.
this study focuses on the behavior of the frankia sp.
to study global transcription in frankia sp.
the detection of abundant transcription of nif  genes likely reflects the presence of anaerobic, n-depleted microsites in the growing mycelium of the culture, and the presence of significantly elevated transposase transcription during starvation indicates the continuing evolution of the frankia sp.
because frankia exhibits a high degree of cell heterogeneity as a consequence of its mycelial growth pattern, its transcriptome is likely to be quite sensitive to culture age.
strain cci <dig> transcriptome as a function of nitrogen source and culture age.
