the conservation of alternative transcription of the pdcd <dig> gene in mouse, human and chicken suggests the biological importance of such truncated protein.
our results also suggest that some cdnas in databases labeled as noncoding are incomplete alternative cdnas of neighboring protein-coding genes.
analogous alternative pdcd <dig> forms truncating the c-terminal domain were also detected in human and chicken.
the ratio of the constitutive and alternative pdcd <dig> mrnas differs in the tissues, suggesting a developmental role.
new mouse transcripts were identified at this locus: an alternative pdcd <dig> mrna skipping the last two coding exons and two classes of antisense rnas.
the antisense rnas are alternative transcripts of the neighboring tata-binding protein gene  that are located mainly in the cell nucleus.
one class of the antisense rna overlaps the alternative exon and the other the entire pdcd <dig> gene.
the identified tbp-alternative pdcd2-antisense transcripts may interfere with the transcription of the pdcd <dig> gene, as they are transcribed at a comparable level.
alternative transcripts of the chicken pdcd <dig> and tbp genes also overlap.
the conservation of the pdcd2/tbp sense-antisense overlap in the mouse and chicken points out its biological relevance.
the biological function of the alternative pdcd <dig> is likely to be opposite to that of the constitutive form.
