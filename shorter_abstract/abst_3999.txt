this study aimed to investigate genetic polymorphisms of cyp2d <dig> among healthy uygur individuals.
genetic polymorphisms of cyp2d <dig> could greatly affect cyp2d <dig> activity and lead to differences among individuals in drug efficacy or side effects.
to investigate genetic polymorphisms of cyp2d <dig> in the uygur population, we directly sequenced the whole gene in  <dig> unrelated, healthy uygur volunteers from the xinjiang uygur autonomous region and screened for genetic variants in the promoter, intron, exons, and 3’utr.
we detected  <dig> genetic polymorphisms of cyp2d <dig>   <dig> of which were novel snp with three novel non-synonymous mutations detected for the first time.

our results provided basic information about cyp2d <dig> polymorphisms, suggested that the enzymatic activities of cyp2d <dig> might be different within the uygur ethnic group, and provide a basis for safer drug administration and better therapeutic treatment of uygur individuals.
the allelic frequencies of cyp2d6* <dig>  * <dig>  * <dig>  and * <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.
