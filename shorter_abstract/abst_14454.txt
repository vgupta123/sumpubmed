the assay is rapid  and can be used, as described in this paper, to measure bmp activity in complex solutions and in cell culture in a simple and efficient way.
two cells lines, c2c <dig> and hepg <dig> were stably transfected with a reporter plasmid consisting of bmp-responsive elements from the id <dig> promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene.
however, the alp assay is not rapid and not sensitive enough to measure bmp activity at physiological concentrations.
an alkaline phosphatase -based assay is the most widely used assay to evaluate bmp activity.
in this paper, we describe a highly sensitive, rapid, and specific cell-based assay for the quantification of bmp activity.
