in the wild-type strain, the strand bias was reversed.
to investigate the mechanisms of aid-induced mutagenesis in a model system, we studied the genetic consequences of aid expression in yeast.
we constructed a yeast vector with an artificially synthesized human aid gene insert using codons common to highly expressed yeast genes.
the results are consistent with the hypothesis that aid-mediated deamination of dna is a major cause of mutations at g-c base pairs in immunoglobulin genes during shm.
this indicates that the intrinsic substrate specificity of aid itself is a primary determinant of mutational hotspots at g-c base pairs during shm.
the dna sequence context of mutation hotspots at g-c pairs during shm is dgyw/wrch .
a majority of mutations were at g-c pairs.
the sequence contexts of mutations in yeast induced by aid and those of somatic mutations at g-c pairs in immunoglobulin genes are significantly similar.
we found that expression of the artificial haidsc gene was moderately mutagenic in a wild-type strain and highly mutagenic in an ung <dig> uracil-dna glycosylase-deficient strain.
in the ung <dig> strain, c-g to t-a transitions were found almost exclusively, while a mixture of transitions with 12% transversions was characteristic in the wild-type strain.
according to a dna deamination model of shm, aid converts cytosine to uracil in dna sequences.
antibody genes are diversified by somatic hypermutation , gene conversion and class-switch recombination.
