this kinase is involved in the cell wall integrity signalling pathway of a. fumigatus and essential for maintaining an intact cell wall in response to stress.
the comparison of the transcriptome and proteome of an a. fumigatus wild-type strain with an mpka null mutant strain revealed that  <dig> % of the genome was found to be expressed and that mpka plays a significant role in the regulation of many genes involved in cell wall remodelling, oxidative stress and iron starvation response, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
it also provides additional information in a. fumigatus studies and as a result is more suitable for the creation of extensive datasets.
we comprehensively matched up our data to published transcriptome studies and were able to show an improved data comparability of mrna-seq experiments independently of the technique used.
high-throughput analysis of mpka-dependent gene expression confirmed many previous findings that this kinase is important for regulating many genes involved in metabolic pathways.
moreover, absence of the mpka gene also strongly affects the expression of genes involved in primary metabolism.

the filamentous fungus aspergillus fumigatus has become the most important airborne fungal pathogen causing life-threatening infections in immuno-compromised patients.
the data were further processed to evaluate the potential of the mrna-seq technique.
analysis of transcriptome and proteome data revealed only a weak correlation between mrna and protein abundance.
