we set out to develop a quantitative pcr assay for ot- <dig> cells in order to assess the distribution of ot- <dig> cd8+ t cells in tissues that are either intrinsically difficult to dissociate for flow cytometric analysis or rendered incompatible with flow cytometric analysis through freezing or fixation.
in addition, the non-quantitative pcr using the ot-1-specific primers without the real-time probe is a valuable tool for ot- <dig> genotyping, obviating the need for peripheral blood collection and subsequent flow cytometric analysis.
ot- <dig> qpcr to determine cell signal is a valuable adjunct to the standard flow cytometric analysis of ot- <dig> cell number, particularly in experimental settings where tissue disaggregation is not desirable or in tissues which are not readily disassociated
we show excellent correlation between flow cytometric assessment of ot- <dig> cells and ot- <dig> signal by qpcr assays in cell dilutions as well as in in vivo adoptive transfer experiments.
one of the most widely used transgenic tcr models is the ot- <dig> transgenic mouse in which the cd8+ t cells express a tcr specific for the siinfekl peptide of ovalbumin presented on kb.
