protein sequence mutations of the aÎ² precursor protein  account for a small proportion of ad cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene  may play a more important role in ad etiology.
emsa probed with the pre showed dna-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner.
this pre contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies.
we propose that puf may regulate the app gene promoter and that ad risk may be increased by interference with puf regulation at the pre.
emsa and elisa results correlated by meta-analysis.
emsa with pre mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated puf in cells and extracts.
functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by elisa of reporter protein levels.
we identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the pre, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: activator protein  <dig> , nm <dig> nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein , and specificity protein  <dig> .
we examined pre-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay  and pre mutant emsa.
