adam <dig>  well recognized for participation in cell-to-cell fusion especially in osteoclast formation, is up-regulated upon formation of multinuclear giant cells after hpiv <dig> induction in hsy cells.
hsg cells were not susceptible to hpiv <dig> virus infection.
moreover, adam <dig> positive cells formed bi-  and multinuclear cells  on day one and the corresponding percentages on day three were  <dig> % for binuclear and  <dig> % for multinuclear cells.
in contrast, in human parotid gland hsy cells, a natural host cell for paramyxoviruses, hpiv <dig> induced adam <dig> expression.
induction of host cell adam <dig> was observed in gmk cells, but the applicability of this model was restricted by lack of cross-reactivity of the anti-human adam <dig> antibodies with the corresponding green monkey antigens.
