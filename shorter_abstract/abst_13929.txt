our findings are concordant with the changes seen in skeletal muscle with altitude hypoxia.
the distance along this line coincided with the classic markers of diabetes risk, namely obesity and insulin resistance, but did not follow the accepted clinical diagnosis of dm <dig> as defined by the presence or absence of hyperglycemia.
genes implicated in this expression pattern are those controlling skeletal muscle fiber type and glycolytic metabolism.
this suggests that hypoxia and shift to glycolytic metabolism may also drive insulin resistance.
using multi-dimensional unsupervised forel  algorithm we have re-analyzed three public datasets of skeletal muscle gene expression in connection with insulin resistance and type  <dig> diabetes .
our analysis revealed the major line of variation between expression profiles of normal, insulin resistant, and diabetic skeletal muscle.
additionally myoglobin and hemoglobin were upregulated and ribosomal genes deregulated in insulin resistant patients.
