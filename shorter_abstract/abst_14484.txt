one important class of models, which treats a nucleosome sequence as a markov chain, has been applied with success when informed with experimentally measured nucleosomal sequence preferences.
we find that models presented in the literature should perform well, but this performance depends on factors such as the order of the markov model, the preprocessing of the probability distributions on which the model is based, and the size and quality of the sequence ensemble from which those distributions are calculated.
