taurolidine’s cytotoxic effect appears dependent on cell specific factors which may be explained, in part, by the functional status of p <dig>  taurolidine initiates apoptosis in canine os cells and this occurs to a greater extent at lower concentrations.
the disease usually arises in the appendicular skeleton and metastasizes to the lung.
tests for p <dig> protein status and caspase activity were used to elucidate mechanisms of taurolidine-induced cell death.
mechanisms of cell death induced by higher concentrations were not elucidated here.
this cell line was the most sensitive to single agent taurolidine treatment and had a taurolidine-dependent reduction in accumulated p <dig> protein suggesting taurolidine’s effects may depend on the functional status of p <dig> in canine os.
taurolidine cytotoxicity appeared caspase-dependent in one cell line; with apparent mutant p <dig> protein.
the following in vitro studies tested taurolidine as a candidate for adjuvant therapy for canine os.
