mapped qtl may serve as markers for genomic selection to enhance heat tolerance in poultry.
heat stress in poultry results in considerable economic losses and is a concern for both animal health and welfare.
the results of this study contribute to our knowledge of levels and heritabilities of several blood components of chickens under thermoneutral and heat stress conditions.
the gwas revealed  <dig> qtl for all traits, located on gga   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  12– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  21– <dig>  and z. a functional analysis of the genes in these qtl regions identified the angiopoietin pathway as significant.
a highly advanced intercross line, created from a broiler  by fayoumi  cross, was exposed to daily heat cycles for seven days starting at 22 days of age.
blood components measured pre-heat treatment and on the seventh day of heat treatment included ph, pco <dig>  po <dig>  base excess, hco <dig>  tco <dig>  k, na, ionized ca, hematocrit, hemoglobin, so <dig>  and glucose.
there were significant increases in ph, base excess, hco <dig>  tco <dig>  ionized ca, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and so <dig>  and significant decreases in pco <dig> and glucose after 7 days of heat treatment.
heritabilities ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  for pre-heat measurements,  <dig> - <dig>  for measurements taken during heat, and  <dig> - <dig>  for the calculated change due to heat treatment.
most components responded to heat treatment.
several candidate genes were identified, giving additional insight into potential mechanisms of physiologic response to high ambient temperatures.
physiological changes occur during periods of heat stress, including changes in blood chemistry components.
the qtl that co-localized for three or more traits were on gga <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and z and revealed candidate genes for birds’ response to heat stress.
the angiopoietin pathway is likely involved in the response to heat stress in chickens.
a genome-wide association study  for these traits and their calculated changes was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci  using a 600 k snp panel.
all blood components were highly correlated within measurement days, but not correlated between measurement days.
