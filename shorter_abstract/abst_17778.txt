comparison of chromosome-wide dna methylation patterns in normal and malignant prostate cells revealed significant methylation of gene-proximal and conserved intergenic sequences.
the hypermethylated intragenic regions were highly enriched for overlap with intron-exon boundaries, suggesting a possible role in regulation of alternative transcriptional start sites, exon usage and/or splicing.
examining this data using computational methods that were designed specifically for dna methylation tiling array data revealed widespread methylation of both gene promoter and non-promoter regions in cancer and normal cells.
this mbd-chip approach was used to characterize dna methylation patterns across all non-repetitive sequences of human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> at high-resolution in normal and malignant prostate cells.
in addition to identifying several novel cancer hypermethylated 5' gene upstream regions that mediated epigenetic gene silencing, we also found several hypermethylated 3' gene downstream, intragenic and intergenic regions.
the hypermethylated intergenic regions showed significant enrichment for conservation across vertebrate species.
dna methylation has been linked to genome regulation and dysregulation in health and disease respectively, and methods for characterizing genomic dna methylation patterns are rapidly emerging.
