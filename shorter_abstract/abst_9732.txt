moreover, injection of lps resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of liver stat <dig>  a downstream transcription factor in il- <dig> signaling.
the fat mass and obesity associated gene  is widely investigated in humans regarding its important roles in obesity and type  <dig> diabetes.
lipopolysaccharide challenge increased the c/ebp beta binding to fto promoter in the liver , although the protein content of c/ebp beta was not altered.
the 5′-flanking sequence of the chicken fto gene contains nine predicted binding sites for ccaat/enhancer binding protein beta  and one for signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> .
in this study, male chickens on day  <dig> posthatching were injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharide  or saline to investigate whether the fto gene is involved in lps-induced inflammation.
our results reveal that fto expression in liver, but not in hypothalamus, is affected by the i.p.
we detected significant down-regulation of fto mrna in the liver , but not in the hypothalamus,  <dig> and 24 h after lps challenge.
il-1β was dramatically up-regulated  in both liver and hypothalamus 2 h after lps challenge, while activation of il- <dig> was observed in the liver , but not in hypothalamus.
significant elevation of c/ebp beta was detected in the liver , but not in the hypothalamus, 2 h after lps challenge.
