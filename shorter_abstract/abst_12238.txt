to explore the response to infection more broadly, we employ mass spectrometry-based proteomics in a quantitative analysis of honey bee larvae infected with the bacterium paenibacillus larvae.
furthermore, mass spectrometry evidence suggests that healthy larvae have significant levels of catalytically inactive propo in the hemolymph that is proteolytically activated upon infection.
we propose a model for the host response to infection where energy stores and metabolic enzymes are regulated in concert with direct defensive measures, such as the massive enhancement of po activity.
using quantitative proteomics, we compared the hemolymph  of five-day old healthy and infected honey bee larvae and found a strong up-regulation of some metabolic enzymes and chaperones, while royal jelly  and energy storage proteins were down-regulated.
