cl is not essential for s. aureus growth under conditions of high salinity, but is necessary for survival under prolonged high-salt stress and for the generation of l-form variants.
in this study, we aimed to clarify the role of cardiolipin  in the adaptation of staphylococcus aureus to high salinity.
using an improved extraction method, the analysis of phospholipid composition suggested that cl levels increased slightly toward stationary phase, but that this was not induced by high salinity.
in a cls <dig> deletion mutant, cls <dig> functioned under stress conditions, including high salinity.
the ability of staphylococci to grow in a wide range of salt concentrations is well documented.
using these mutants, cl was shown to be unnecessary for growth in either basal or high-salt conditions, but it was critical for prolonged survival in high-salt conditions and for generation of the l-form.
