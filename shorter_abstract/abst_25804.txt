in order to understand the biofilm forming abilities of these microbes in a simulated wound environment we used a microtiter plate assay to assess the ability of these two organisms to bind to proteins that are typically found at wound sites: collagen and hyaluronan.

p. aeruginosa and mrsa were inoculated as mono- and co-cultures .
we also noted that the fold-change increase for mrsa upon coating was greater than for p. aeruginosa.
our study suggests that the presence of collagen and/or hyaluronan at wound sites may be an important factor that influences the attachment and subsequent biofilm formation of notorious biofilm-formers, such as mrsa and p. aeruginosa.
pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  are two of the organisms most prevalently isolated from wound sites, and are of particular concern due to their elevated levels of antibiotic resistance, rapid growth, and exotoxin production.
we determined that coating the wells with collagen and/or hyaluronan significantly increased the biofilm biomass of attached cells compared to an uncoated control, although no one coating formulation showed a significant increase compared to any other combination.
