interestingly, coexpression analysis revealed that the gln <dig>  which encodes a chloroplastic glutamine synthetase, has the highest mutual rank in the coexpressed gene network connected to acr <dig>  we used rna gel blot analysis to confirm that the expression pattern of acr <dig> is similar to that of gln <dig> in various organs from 6-week-old arabidopsis.
we have previously identified a novel type of act domain-containing protein family, the act domain repeat  protein family, in arabidopsis.
the act domain, named after bacterial aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase and tyra , is a regulatory domain that serves as an amino acid-binding site in feedback-regulated amino acid metabolic enzymes.
members of the acr family, acr <dig> to acr <dig>  contain four copies of the act domain that extend throughout the entire polypeptide.
here, we describe the identification of four novel act domain-containing proteins, namely acr <dig> to acr <dig>  in arabidopsis.
the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins contain three copies of the act domain, whereas the acr <dig> and acr <dig> proteins have a putative transit peptide followed by two copies of the act domain.
this study reports the identification of four novel act domain repeat proteins, acr <dig> to acr <dig>  in arabidopsis.
these results suggest that the acr <dig> and gln <dig> genes may belong to the same functional module.
analysis of an acr <dig> promoter-Î²-glucuronidase  fusion in transgenic arabidopsis revealed that the gus activity was mainly detected in mature leaves and sepals.
the arabidopsis acr <dig> protein may function as a regulatory protein that is related to glutamine metabolism or signaling in the chloroplast.
we used protoplast transient expression assay to demonstrate that the arabidopsis acr11- and acr12-green fluorescent fusion proteins are localized to the chloroplast.
