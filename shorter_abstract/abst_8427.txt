here we have introduced pvt  where we take up a modular approach by breaking tophat’s serial execution into a pipeline of multiple stages, thereby increasing the degree of parallelization and computational resource utilization.
with this basic information, we designed pvt, a pipelined version of tophat that removes the redundant computational steps during ‘spliced alignment’ and breaks the job into a pipeline of multiple stages ) to improve its resource utilization, thus reducing the execution time.
spliced alignment is one such fundamental step in ngs data analysis which is extremely computational intensive as well as time consuming.
pvt provides an improvement over tophat for spliced alignment of ngs data analysis.
tophat is one such widely used spliced alignment tools which although supports multithreading, does not efficiently utilize computational resources in terms of cpu utilization and memory.
<dig> to analyse these datasets and noted the cpu usage, memory footprint and execution time during spliced alignment.
pvt thus resulted in the reduction of the execution time to ~23% for the single end read dataset.
further, pvt designed for paired end reads showed an improved performance of ~41% over tophat  with respect to execution time.
further, for the different types of ngs data, there are certain common challenging steps involved in analysing those data.
thus we address the discrepancies in tophat so as to analyze large ngs data efficiently.
