thus it would be efficient to use the information of structure-unknown proteins in order to avoid training data sparseness.
to examine robustness against training data sparseness, we investigated the correlation between two results obtained when the method was trained on different datasets and tested on the same dataset.
the proposed method, which utilizes the information of structure-unknown data, predicts disordered proteins more accurately than other methods and is less affected by training data sparseness.
we propose a novel method for predicting which proteins are mostly disordered by using spectral graph transducer and training with a huge amount of structure-unknown sequences as well as structure-known sequences.
when the proposed sgt-based method was compared with four per-residue predictors ), its sensitivity was  <dig>  for disordered proteins, which is  <dig> – <dig>  higher than that of the per-residue predictors, and its specificity was  <dig>  for ordered proteins, which is  <dig> – <dig>  higher than that of the per-residue predictors.
we know many more protein sequences than we do protein structures, and many of the known sequences can be expected to be those of disordered proteins.
it resulted in a matthews correlation coefficient  <dig>  points higher than that obtained using foldindex,  <dig>  points higher than that obtained using the method based on plotting hydrophobicity against the number of contacts and  <dig>  points higher than that obtained using support vector machines .
the correlation coefficient for the proposed method is  <dig>  higher than that for the method using svms.
the structural distribution of proteins in nature can therefore be inferred to differ from that of proteins whose structures have been determined experimentally.
