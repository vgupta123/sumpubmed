quantitative models of gene expression generate parameter values that can shed light on biological features such as transcription factor activity, cooperativity, and local effects of repressors.
an important element in such investigations is sensitivity analysis, which determines how strongly a model's output reacts to variations in parameter values.
extracted parameter values have been interpreted biologically, but until now little attention has been given to parameter sensitivity in this context.
our results emphasize the need for sensitivity analysis to examine model construction and forms of biological data used for modeling transcriptional processes, in order to determine the significance of estimated parameter values for thermodynamic models.
here, we focus on the analysis of thermodynamic models, which have been used extensively to analyze gene transcription.
parameters of low sensitivity may not be accurately estimated, leading to unwarranted conclusions.
knowledge of parameter sensitivities can provide the necessary context to determine how modeling results should be interpreted in biological systems.
we apply local and global sensitivity analyses to two recent transcriptional models to determine the sensitivity of individual parameters.
low sensitivity may reflect the nature of the biological data, or it may be a result of the model structure.
