protein microarrays represent an emerging class of proteomic tools to investigate multiple protein-protein interactions in parallel.
we have achieved sensitive, specific and reproducible detection of immobilized cd200r with different antibodies and mapped antigenic epitopes for two mab in the vicinity of the ligand binding site using protein microarrays.
in order to establish protein array technology for the characterization of the weak interactions between leukocyte membrane proteins, we selected the human leukocyte membrane protein cd <dig>  and its cell surface receptor  as a model system.
our results demonstrate the quantitative aspects of protein arrays and their potential use in detecting simultaneously multiple protein-protein interactions and in particular the weak interactions found between leukocyte membrane proteins.
