from genome comparisons, it appeared that genes encoding novel functions have contributed to the metabolic enrichment of the environmental lineages within the genus francisella.
pairwise blast comparisons indicated that strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> contained  <dig>  protein coding genes in common.
to understand the genetic relationships and evolutionary contexts among different lineages within the genus francisella, the genome of francisella spp.
using the genome sequence data and comparative analyses with other members of the genus francisella , several strain-specific genes were identified.
sequencing and comparison of the genomes of more isolates are required to obtain further insights into the ecology and evolution of different species within the genus francisella.
francisella philomiragia, a distant relative of f. tularensis, is thought to constitute an environmental lineage along with francisella novicida.
nucmer analyses revealed that the chromosomes of strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> were mostly collinear except for a few gaps, translocations, and/or inversions.
strains tx07- <dig> and atcc  <dig> contained an operon with six open reading frames encoding proteins related to enzymes involved in thiamine biosynthesis that was absent in f. novicida strain u <dig> and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  strain atcc  <dig> contained an operon putatively involved in lactose metabolism that was absent in strain tx07- <dig>  f. novicida strain u <dig>  and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  in contrast, strain tx07- <dig> contained an operon putatively involved in glucuronate metabolism that was absent in the genomes of strain atcc  <dig>  f. novicida strain u <dig>  and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>  the polymorphic nature of polysaccharide biosynthesis/modification gene clusters among different francisella strains was also evident from genome analyses.
the inability to acquire new genes coupled with the loss of ancestral traits and the consequent reductive evolution may be a cause for, as well as an effect of, niche selection of f. tularensis.
nevertheless, both f. philomiragia and f. novicida have been associated with human disease, primarily in immune-compromised individuals.
strain tx07- <dig> was sequenced and compared to the genomes of f. philomiragia strains atcc  <dig> and  <dig>  f. novicida strain u <dig>  and f. tularensis strain schu s <dig>
