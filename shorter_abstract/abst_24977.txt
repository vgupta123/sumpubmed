a total of  <dig> putative phac pcr fragments were amplified from the whole genome amplified seawater dna.
functional evaluation of these in silico-based phacs via genome walking has provided new insights into the polymerizing ability of these enzymes.
this study is the first to examine the diversity of class i and ii pha synthases  in dna samples from pelagic seawater taken from the japan trench and nankai trough from a range of depths from 24 m to 5373 m. phac is the key enzyme in microorganisms that determines the types of monomer units that are polymerized into polyhydroxyalkanoate  and thus affects the physicochemical properties of this thermoplastic polymer.
a new functional phac that has close identity to marinobacter sp.
phylogenetic classification for all the phac genes isolated from uncultured bacteria has revealed that seawater and other environmental resources harbor a great diversity of phacs with activities that have not yet been investigated.

special features of the japanese ocean include its ranges of latitude and depth.
eleven genetic groups have undisclosed phac activity based on their distinct phylogenetic lineages from known pha producers.
of these  <dig> clones contained conserved phac domains and were classified into  <dig> genetic groups depending on their sequence similarity.
