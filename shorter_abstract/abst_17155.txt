the presence of intraspecific color polymorphism can have multiple impacts on the ecology of a species; as a consequence, particular color morphs may be strongly selected for in a given habitat type.
for example, the asp viper  shows a high level of color polymorphism.
nevertheless, we found in a restricted treeless area of the french alps, a population containing a high proportion  of such specimens.
a blotched morph  is common throughout its range , while a melanistic morph is frequently found in montane populations, presumably for thermoregulatory reasons.
the aim of the study is to bring insight into the presence and function of this color morph by  studying the genetic structure of these populations using nine microsatellite markers, and testing for  a potential local diversifying selection and  differences in dispersal capacity between blotched and non-blotched vipers.
we hypothesize that, in this population, the non-blotched phenotype possess an advantage over the typical one, a phenomenon possibly due to a better background matching ability in a more open habitat.
in addition, color-biased dispersal might be partly associated with the observed local diversifying selection, as it can affect the genetic structure of populations, and hence the distribution of color morphs.
