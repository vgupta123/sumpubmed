osclpc <dig> and osclpc <dig> are predicted to be chloroplast-localized as is the case with all known plant clpc proteins.
osclpb-cyt transcript is shown to be enriched at milk and dough stages of seed development.
previous studies have shown that clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> gene belongs to the group class i clp atpase proteins and clpb-cyt/hsp <dig> transcript is regulated by heat stress and developmental cues.
of these  <dig>  only  <dig> belonging to clpb group are heat stress regulated.
using the respective signal sequences cloned upstream to gfp/cfp reporter proteins and transient expression studies with onion epidermal cells, evidence is provided that rice clpb-m and clp-c proteins are indeed localized to their respective cell locations mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively.
however, the fact that osclpc <dig> protein appears mitochondrial/chloroplastic with equal probability and osclpc <dig> a plasma membrane protein reflects functional diversity of this class.
associated with their diverse cell locations, domain structures of osclpb-c, osclpb-m and osclpb-cyt proteins are noted to possess a high-level conservation.
nine orfs were noted to constitute rice class i clp atpases in the following manner:  <dig> clpb proteins ,  <dig> clpc proteins  and  <dig> clpd proteins .
while expression of osclpb-m was significantly less as compared to its cytoplasmic and chloroplastic counterparts in different tissues, this transcript showed highest heat-induced expression amongst the  <dig> clpb proteins.
distribution of clpb proteins to different cell organelles indicates that their functioning might be critical in different cell locations.
