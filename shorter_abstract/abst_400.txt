univariable analysis using one-way anova and tukey’s post-hoc test, kruskal wallis with dunn’s post-hoc test and chi squared analysis were used to compare between different outcome categories.
the aim of this study was to describe the presentation, diagnostic approach and treatment at the primary assessment of horses with large colon impactions.
data were collected prospectively from veterinary practitioners on the primary assessment of equine colic cases over a  <dig> month period.
data recorded for each case included history, signalment, clinical and diagnostic findings, treatment on primary assessment and final case outcome.
large colon impactions typically presented with mild signs of colic; heart rate and gut sounds were the most useful parameters to distinguish between simple and critical cases at the primary assessment.
veterinary practitioners currently use a wide range of different treatment combinations for large colon impactions.
mean heart rate was 43bpm  and most cases showed mild signs of pain  and reduced gut sounds .
heart rate was significantly increased and gut sounds significantly decreased in critical compared to simple medical cases .
there are no scientific reports on the clinical presentation, diagnostic tests and treatments used in first opinion practice for large colon impaction cases.
the findings of seasonal incidence and associated management factors are consistent with other studies.
<dig> colic cases were submitted by veterinary practitioners:  <dig> cases met the inclusion criteria for large colon impaction.
inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of primary large colon impaction and positive findings on rectal examination.
fifty different treatment combinations were used, with nsaids  and oral fluids  being administered most often.
large colon impactions are a common cause of colic in the horse.
