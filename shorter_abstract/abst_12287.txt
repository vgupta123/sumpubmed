so far the contribution of p <dig> mapk to the regulation of ttp expression and function has been best described.
egf activates ttp expression via elk- <dig> and egr- <dig> transcription factors.
transcripts modulated by ttp encode proteins such as cytokines, pro-inflammatory agents and immediate-early response proteins.
our results demonstrate the induction of the gene coding ttp  by egf through the erk1/2-dependent pathway and implicates the transcription factor elk- <dig> in this process.
