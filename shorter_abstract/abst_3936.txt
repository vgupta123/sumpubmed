escherichia coli infections known as colibacillosis constitute a considerable challenge to poultry farmers worldwide, in terms of decreased animal welfare and production economy.
the aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity among e. coli isolates collected on poultry farms with colibacillosis issues, using whole genome sequencing.
in the nordic countries, poultry farmers depend on import of swedish broiler breeders which are part of a breeding pyramid.
the isolates in this clade were collected from broiler chickens and breeders with colibacillosis in multiple nordic countries.
the investigation revealed a lineage of st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates collected in different nordic countries from diseased broilers and breeders.
the data indicate that the closely related st <dig> o78:h <dig> strains have been transferred vertically through the broiler breeding pyramid into distantly located farms across the nordic countries.
apec strains are extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli and have in general been characterized as being a genetically diverse population.
colibacillosis is caused by avian pathogenic e. coli .
they clustered together with a human st <dig> isolate and all carried virulence genes that previously have been associated with human uropathogenic e. coli.
however, the phylogenetic analyses revealed a major clade of  <dig> closely related st <dig> o78:h <dig> isolates.
in general, the characterized poultry isolates constituted a genetically diverse population.
hundred and fourteen bacterial isolates from both broilers and broiler breeders were whole genome sequenced.
this included in silico typing , identification of virulence and resistance genes and phylogenetic analyses based on single nucleotide polymorphisms.
