our implementation has a strict modular structure, which allows to swap different components of the alignment process and, thus, to investigate their contribution to the alignment quality and computation time.
third, triplet library extension, with introduction of new edges, is the most efficient consistency transformation of those compared.
our results indicate the optimal alignment strategy based on the choices compared.
second, single linkage clustering is almost invariably the best algorithm to build a guiding tree for progressive alignment.
first, we show that pairwise global and local alignments contain sufficient information to construct a high quality multiple alignment.
we systematically varied information sources, guiding trees, score transformations and iterative refinement options, and evaluated the resulting alignments on balibase and sabmark.
this is the first time multiple protein alignment strategies are comprehensively and clearly compared using a single implementation platform.
in particular, we showed which of the existing consistency transformations and iterative refinement techniques are the most valid.
here, we present a novel mpsa program based on the seqan sequence alignment library.
alternatively, one can apply tree dependent partitioning as a post processing step, which was shown to be comparable with the best consistency transformation in both time and accuracy.
