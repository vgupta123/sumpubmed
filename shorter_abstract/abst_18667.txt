after assembling the high quality sequencing reads into  <dig>  unigenes, biochemical pathways were predicted and  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways.
among them,  <dig> unigenes were identified to be involved in triterpene saponin biosynthesis.
in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were predicted to encode cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively, based on the annotation results, some of which encode enzymes responsible for the conversion of the triterpene saponin backbone into different ginsenosides.
candidate genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis, including putative cytochrome p450s and glycosyltransferases were obtained.
hence, genomic and transcriptomic details about p. notoginseng, especially its biosynthetic pathways and gene expression in different parts of the plant, have remained largely unknown until now.
the transcriptomes in different plant tissues also provide invaluable resources for future study of the differences in physiological processes and secondary metabolites in different parts of p. notoginseng.
in this study, rna sequencing of three different p. notoginseng tissues was performed using next generation dna sequencing.
in particular, one unigene predominately expressed in the root was annotated as cyp716a53v <dig>  which probably participates in the formation of protopanaxatriol from protopanaxadiol in p. notoginseng.
we have established a global transcriptome dataset for p. notoginseng and provided additional genetic information for further genome-wide research and analyses.
the major bioactive molecules are triterpene saponins, which are also known as ginsenosides.
the differential expression of this gene was further confirmed by real-time pcr.
