the mixturetree program written in c++ is a linux based package.
mixturetree v <dig>  is a linux based program  which implements an algorithm based on mixture models for reconstructing phylogeny from binary sequence data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms .
the efficiency of the mixture algorithm is relatively higher than some classical methods, such as neighbor-joining method, maximum parsimony method and maximum likelihood method.
the shortcoming of the mixture tree algorithms, for example timing consuming, can be improved by implementing other revised expectation-maximization algorithms instead of the traditional em algorithm.
in addition to the mixture algorithm with three different optimization options, the program also implements a bootstrap procedure with majority-rule consensus.
