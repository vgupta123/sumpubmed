a total of  <dig>  primer pairs were designed for est-ssr markers from the computational data.
functional categorization of est sequences containing ssrs revealed that  <dig>   of such ests had homology with known proteins.
the motif ag  was most abundant in dinucleotides, while motifs agg , aag , and agc  were most common among trinucleotides.
date palm  is an important tree in the middle east and north africa due to the nutritional value of its fruit.
however, the lack of molecular markers in date palm restricts the application of molecular breeding.
in this study, we analyzed  <dig>  est sequences from the date palm genome database to identify simple-sequence repeats  and to develop gene-based markers, i.e.
in a follow up laboratory study, we tested a sample of  <dig> random selected primer pairs for amplification and polymorphism detection using genomic dna from date palm cultivars.
nearly one-third of these primer pairs detected dna polymorphism to differentiate the twelve date palm cultivars used.
date palm est sequences exhibits a good resource for developing gene-based markers.
these genic markers identified in our study may provide a valuable genetic and genomic tool for further genetic research and varietal development in date palm, such as diversity study, qtl mapping, and molecular breeding.
we identified  <dig>  ests as containing ssrs, among which, trinucleotide motifs  were the most common, followed by tetranucleotide  and dinucleotide motifs .
