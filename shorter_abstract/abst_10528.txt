viral gene expression may be regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, including cytosine methylation at cpg dinucleotides.
there are significant correlations between complete genome pcs and a lack of correlations between several genomic region pairs, especially those involving lcr and e <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> orf behavior is opposite to that of oncogenes e <dig> and e <dig>  the first pair possesses relatively low numbers of cpg sites clustered in cgis while the oncogenes possess a relatively high number of cpg sites not associated to cgis.
in all hpvs, e2/e <dig> is the only region with at least one cgi and shows a higher content of cpg sites in every hpv type with an identified e <dig>  the mucosal hr-hpvs show either the shortest cgi size, followed by the mucosal lr-hpvs and lastly by the cutaneous viral subgroup, and a trend to the lowest cgi number, followed by the cutaneous viral subgroup and lastly by the mucosal lr-hpvs.
the distribution of cpg islands/clusters among hpv groups is heterogeneous and mucosal hr-hpv types exhibit both lower number and shorter island sizes compared to cutaneous and mucosal low-risk  hpvs .
we have analyzed the distribution of cpg sites and cpg islands/clusters  among  <dig> different hpv genomes grouped in function of their preferential tropism: cutaneous or mucosal.
we calculated the proportion of cpg sites  for each orf and calculated the expected cpg values for each viral type.
we found a positive correlation between cpg observed and expected values, with mucosal high-risk  virus types showing the smallest o/e ratios.
the human papillomavirus  genome is divided into early and late coding sequences, including  <dig> open reading frames  and a regulatory region .
we found positive correlations between pcs for each viral orf when compared with the others, except for the lcr against four orfs and e <dig> against three other orfs.
cpgs are underrepresented in viral genomes.
