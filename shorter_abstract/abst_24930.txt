in previous works, we have reported that in several autoimmune diseases the * <dig> allele of hs <dig>  is genetically associated to high level of igm in peripheral blood.
human hs <dig>  has four different variants with unique binding sites for transcription factors  and shows variable allelic frequencies in populations with immune disorders.
we have correlated the allelic frequencies of hs <dig>  with igm, igg and iga serum concentrations in two cohorts of healthy people of different age and after three years follow-up in children homozygous for the allele.
during ageing there is a physiological increase of ig concentrations in the serum.
instead, when the ig expression levels are high, there is a significantly higher frequency of the allele * <dig>  the follow-up of children homozygous for * <dig> and * <dig> alleles showed that the increase or decrease of circulating ig was not dependent on the number of circulating mature b cells.
in the immune system, the serum levels of immunoglobulin  increase gradually during ageing.
through b cell development, the ig heavy chain expression is modulated by a regulatory region at the 3â€™ of the constant alpha gene , in single copy in rodents and, due to a large duplication, in two copies in apes.
