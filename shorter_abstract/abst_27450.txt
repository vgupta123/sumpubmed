the bayesian ancestral reconstruction of the emergence habits from the mummified hosts weakly recovered an anterior emergence as the ancestral condition for the subfamily.
the rogadinae is estimated to have originated during the mid to late eocene,  <dig> â€“ <dig>  mya.
a clade comprising all aleiodes species and some other taxa is not nested within the tribe rogadini as previously supposed, but instead is recovered as sister to the yeliconini, with the remaining rogadini genera being recovered as sister to the stiropiini.
producing a hard mummy has evolved at various times independently, though most of the species with this biology belong to the aleiodes clade.
based on our results, we erect the tribe aleiodini nov. to include aleiodes and heterogamus stat.
molecular dating gives a more recent origin for the aleiodes clade  compared to the origins proposed for two of its principal lepidopteran host groups .
the molecular dating of clades and the ancestral reconstruction of host ranges support the hypothesis that radiation within aleiodes s. s. was due to host recruitment leading to host range expansion followed by speciation, and not to parasitoid-host coevolution.
