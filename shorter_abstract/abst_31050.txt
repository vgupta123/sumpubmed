disease resistance  genes play an important role in responding to pathogen infections in plants.
a dramatic diversity of r-genes with structural variances indicated a rapid birth-and-death rate during the r-gene evolution in legumes.
our results provide insights into the dynamic evolution of r-genes in the legume family, which will be valuable for facilitating genetic improvements in the disease resistance of legume cultivars.
the number of r-genes transiently expanded and then quickly contracted after whole-genome duplications, which meant that r-genes were sensitive to subsequent diploidization.
in this study, we developed a robust pipeline and identified a total of  <dig>  r-genes in the genomes of seven sequenced legume species.
to further increase the yield of legume crops, we need a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of r-genes in the legume family.
meanwhile, other types of legume r proteins with only one or two typical domains were subjected to higher rates of loss during evolution.
r proteins with the coiled-coil  domain are more conserved than others in legumes.
in addition, domestication events in some legume species preferentially selected for the genes directly involved in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway while suppressing those r-genes with low occurrence rates.
although r-genes evolved quickly in legumes, they tended to undergo purifying selection instead of positive selection during evolution.
