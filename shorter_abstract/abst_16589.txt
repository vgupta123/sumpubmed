in contrast to previous measures such as the 'selectivity score', gini score, or partition index, the entropy score is non-arbitary, fully exploits ic <dig> data, and is not dependent on a reference enzyme.
in addition, through analyzing profiles of clinical compounds, we show quantitatively that a more selective kinase inhibitor is not necessarily more drug-like.
designing maximally selective ligands that act on individual targets is the dominant paradigm in drug discovery.
poor selectivity can underlie toxicity and side effects in the clinic, and for this reason compound selectivity is increasingly monitored from very early on in the drug discovery process.
it is valuable for studying the molecular mechanisms of selectivity, and to steer compound progression in drug discovery programs.
we apply the new score to kinase and nuclear receptor profiling data, and to high-throughput screening data.
