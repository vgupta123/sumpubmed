in addition, we illustrate its comparatively good performance on multi-parameter inference for groups using a data-based simulation.
sequencing data for such studies are produced more and more often, implying challenges for the analysis, such as excess of zeros, presence of random effects and multi-parameter inference.
finally, in the small sample size setting, we demonstrate its high power and improved fdr estimation by use of gaussian mixture priors that include a point mass.
complex designs are common in  clinical studies.
shrinkbayes is a versatile software package for the analysis of count-based sequencing data, which is particularly useful for studies with small sample sizes or complex designs.
moreover, when sample sizes are small, inference is likely to be too liberal when, in a bayesian setting, applying a non-appropriate prior or to lack power when not carefully borrowing information across features.
