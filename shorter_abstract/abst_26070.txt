although its control is based on insecticides, b. tabaci has developed resistance against almost all classes of insecticides, including neonicotinoids.
we employed an rna-seq approach to generate genome wide expression data and identify genes associated with neonicotinoid resistance in mediterranean  b. tabaci .
eight p <dig> unigenes belonging to clades cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> were highly up-regulated  including cyp6cm <dig>  a gene already known to confer imidacloprid resistance in b. tabaci.
using quantitative qpcrs, a larger screening of field med b. tabaci from crete with known neonicotinoid phenotype was performed to associate expression levels of p450s with resistance levels.
our work has generated new toxicological data and genomic resources which will significantly enrich the available dataset and substantially facilitate the molecular studies in med b. tabaci.
eight p <dig> unigenes, including cyp6cm <dig>  were found significantly over-expressed in resistant b. tabaci.
this study suggests at least two novel p450s  as candidates for their functional characterization as detoxification mechanisms of neonicotinoid resistance in b. tabaci.
no nachr polymorphism potentially related with the resistant phenotypes, was observed among the studied strains.
bemisia tabaci is one of the most damaging agricultural pests world-wide.

a reference transcriptome was built by de novo assembly and functionally annotated.
however, a significant correlation was found only in cyp <dig> and cyp6cx <dig>  with imidacloprid and acetamiprid respectively.
ten unigenes encoding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , the target of neoinicotinoids, were identified and phylogenetically classified.
expression levels of five p450s, including cyp6cm <dig>  were found associated with neonicotinoid resistance.
no evidence of target site neonicotinoid resistance has been found.
