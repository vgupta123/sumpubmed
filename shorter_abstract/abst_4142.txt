computational analysis of c. albicans genome enabled us to identify  <dig> potential mfs proteins which clustered into  <dig> families using saier's transport commission  system.
the in silico characterisation of mfs transporters in candida albicans genome revealed a large complement of mfs transporters with most of them showing expression.
family designations in c. albicans were validated by subjecting saccharomyces cerevisiae genome to tc system.
based on the published available genomics/proteomics data,  <dig> of the putative mfs genes of c. albicans were found to express either at mrna or protein levels.
considering the clinical relevance of c. albicans and role of mfs members in antifungal resistance and nutrient transport, this analysis would pave way for identifying their physiological relevance.
we report here the complete transportome of mfs proteins of a human pathogenic yeast candida albicans.
