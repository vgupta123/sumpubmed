these mature biofilms were made up of numerous viable bacteria, even after extended culture, and contained up to 50% of proteins and accumulated 3%  calcium, suggesting an important role for the divalent metal in biofilm formation.
the principal architectural elements observed by electron microscopy may represent useful morphological clues for identifying bacterial biofilms in vivo.
limited reports on environmental isolates have revealed highly ordered, three-dimensional organization of the extracellular matrix, which may hold important implications for biofilm physiology in vivo.
the complexity and reproducibility of the structural motifs observed in bacterial biofilms appear to be the result of organized assembly, suggesting that this environmental isolate may possess ecological advantages in its natural habitat.
these sessile communities typically consist of stratified, morphologically-distinct layers of extracellular material, where numerous metabolic processes occur simultaneously in close proximity.
ultrastructurally, the mature biofilms contained structural motifs consisting of dense, fibrillary clusters, nanofibers, and ordered, honeycomb-like chambers enveloped in thin sheets.
mature biofilms contained living bacteria and were structurally, chemically, and physiologically heterogeneous.
isolated from a natural soil environment produced flocculent, nonmucoidal biofilms in vitro with unique structural features.
