the results obtained with aide on a set of decoy structures were evaluated using statistical indicators such as pearson correlation coefficients, znat, fraction enrichment, as well as roc plots.
in particular, the method is based on neural networks that use as input  <dig> structural parameters, which include energy, solvent accessible surface, hydrophobic contacts and secondary structure content.
the development and improvement of reliable computational methods designed to evaluate the quality of protein models is relevant in the context of protein structure refinement, which has been recently identified as one of the bottlenecks limiting the quality and usefulness of protein structure prediction.
in this contribution, we present a computational method  which is able to consistently discriminate between correct and incorrect protein models.
in light of the results obtained with aide, as well as its comparison with available learning-based methods, it can be concluded that aide can be successfully used to evaluate the quality of protein structures.
