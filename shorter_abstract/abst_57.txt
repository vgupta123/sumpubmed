the main goal of this study was to evaluate tissue specific changes in the tbp distribution in barley genes and chromosomes in different phases of shoot and seed development.
in the amy32b gene transition from watery ripe to the milky ripeness stage of seed development was followed by the decrease of tbp binding along the whole gene, especially in the promoter region and intron ii.
we have:  <dig>  investigated the tbp distribution along amy32b and bmy <dig> genes encoding low pi α-amylase a and endosperm specific β-amylase correspondingly using oligonucleotide dna arrays;  <dig>  characterized the polypeptide spectrum of tbp and proteins with affinity to tbp-associated dna;  <dig>  localized the distribution of dna complexes with tbp  on barley 1h and 7h chromosomes using mapped markers;  <dig>  compared the chromosomal distribution of tbp-dna complexes to the distribution of the nuclear matrix attachment sites.
tight dna-protein complexes of the nuclear matrix and those detected by npc-chromatography were revealed as also involved in tissue- and development-dependent transitions, however, in sites different from tbp-dna interactions.
marker analysis revealed changes in the association of chromosome 1h and 7h sites with tbps between first leaf and coleoptile and at zadoks  <dig> and zadoks  <dig> stages of barley shoot development.
it was demonstrated that a nuclear protein of low molecular weight similar to the described tbps possessed a high affinity to the dna involved in tbp-dna complexes.
the tightly bound to dna proteins  is a protein group that remains attached to dna with covalent or non-covalent bonds after its deproteinisation.
plant development is followed by redistribution of tbp along individual genes and chromosomes.
