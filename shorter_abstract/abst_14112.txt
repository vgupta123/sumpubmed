the obtained results demonstrated the efficiency of exome capture for genotyping species such as loblolly pine with a large and complex genome.
as a valid and more feasible alternative, entire exome sequencing was hence employed to identify the gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms  and to genotype the sampled trees.
the probes covered  <dig>  % of the target regions.
capture efficiency was high; on average, 67 % of the sequence reads generated for each tree could be mapped to the capture target regions, and more than 70 % of the captured target bases had at least 10x sequencing depth per tree.
oligonucleotide probes were designed based on  <dig>  exons  partitioned from the loblolly pine reference genome .
however, whole genome resequencing in loblolly pine is hampered by its large size and complexity and a lack of a good reference.
the highly diverse genetic variation reported in this study will be a valuable resource for future genetic and genomic research in loblolly pine.
the exons were captured in the adept <dig> association mapping population of  <dig> clonally-propagated loblolly pine trees using nimblegen oligonucleotide hybridization probes, and then exome-enriched genomic dna fragments were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform.
