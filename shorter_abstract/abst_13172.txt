this proceeds in two steps:  improved estimation of var regression coefficients using an analytic shrinkage approach, and  subsequent model selection by testing the associated partial correlations.
however, learning these networks is challenging due to the low sample size and high dimensionality of genomic data.
in simulations this approach outperformed for small sample size all other considered approaches in terms of true discovery rate .

we present a novel and highly efficient approach to estimate a var network.
