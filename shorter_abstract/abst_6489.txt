upon reaching maximal extension, fcγr microclusters depart from the leading edge and are transported to the center of the cellular contact region to form a synapse-like structure, analogous to the process observed for t-cell receptors.
time-lapse multicolor total internal reflection microscopy was used to capture the formation of fcγr-igg microclusters and their assembly into signaling complexes on the plasma membrane of murine bone marrow derived macrophages.
recent evidence indicates that in addition to the t-cell receptor, microclustering is an important mechanism for the activation of the b-cell receptor and the mast cell fcε-receptor.
additionally, imaging of fluorescent btkph domains indicated that 3′-phosphoinositides propagated laterally away from the fcγr microclusters.
we demonstrate that surface-associated but mobile igg induces the formation of fcγr microclusters at the pseudopod leading edge.
upon antibody binding, macrophages formed fcγr-igg complexes at the leading edge of advancing pseudopods.
in macrophages and neutrophils, particles opsonized with immunoglobulin g  antibodies activate the phagocytic fcγ-receptor  leading to rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.
