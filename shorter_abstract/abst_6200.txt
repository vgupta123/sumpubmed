sorghum genotypes used for grain production in temperate regions are photoperiod insensitive and flower early avoiding adverse environments during the reproductive phase.
quantitative trait loci  that modify flowering time in sorghum were identified by screening recombinant inbred lines  derived from btx <dig> and tx <dig> in long days, short days, and under field conditions.
sbprr <dig> and sbghd <dig> contribute to photoperiod sensitivity in sorghum by repressing expression of sbehd <dig> and ft-like genes, thereby delaying flowering in long days with minimal influence in short days .
genetic analysis characterized sorghum constans as a floral activator that promotes flowering by inducing the expression of early heading date  <dig>  and sorghum orthologs of the maize ft genes zcn <dig>  and zcn <dig> .
the floral repressor pseudoresponse regulator protein  <dig>  inhibits sorghum constans activity and flowering in long days.
sorghum constans is an activator of flowering that is repressed post-transcriptionally in long days by the floral inhibitor prr <dig>  contributing to photoperiod sensitive flowering in sorghum bicolor, a short day plant.
in rice, a short day flowering plant, hd <dig>  the ortholog of constans, activates flowering in short days and represses flowering in long days.
in contrast, energy sorghum hybrids are highly photoperiod sensitive with extended vegetative phases in long days, resulting in enhanced biomass accumulation.
in long day flowering plants, such as arabidopsis and barley, constans activates ft expression and flowering in long days.
analysis of the flowering time qtl on sbi- <dig> revealed that btx <dig> encodes a recessive constans allele containing a his106tyr substitution in b-box  <dig> known to inactivate constans in arabidopsis thaliana.
