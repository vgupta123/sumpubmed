flow cytometry based adherence assay is a potentially powerful but little used method in the study of bacterial binding to host structures.
in the present paper, we investigated the use of flow cytometry as a method to study the binding of rgg, speb and pula knock-out strains to cultured human epithelial cells.
streptococcal mutants were readily labelled with cfda-se and their binding to epithelial cells could be effectively studied by flow cytometry.
we have identified surface-associated pullulanase  and cysteine protease  as carriers of strepadhesin activity.
we have previously characterized a glycoprotein-binding activity in streptococcus pyogenes called 'strepadhesin' binding to thyroglobulin, submaxillar mucin, fetuin and asialofetuin.
a strain deficient in rgg expression showed increased binding to the analyzed epithelial cell lines of various origin.
inactivation of speb had no effect on the adhesion, while pula knock-out strains displayed decreased binding to the cell lines.
these results suggest that the flow cytometric assay is a valuable tool in the analysis of s. pyogenes adherence to host cells.
the results also suggest a role for rgg regulated surface molecules, like pula, in the adhesion of s. pyogenes to host cells.
