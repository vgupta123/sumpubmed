strong support was recovered for the basal position and monophyly of the subfamily anophelinae and the tribes aedini and sabethini of subfamily culicinae.
we carried out maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, including bayesian, analyses on a data set consisting of six nuclear genes and  <dig> morphological characters to assess their ability to resolve relationships among  <dig> genera.
we also estimated divergence times based on sequence data and fossil calibration points, using bayesian relaxed clock methods.
phylogenetic analyses provide a framework for examining the evolution of morphological and molecular diversity, interpreting patterns in biogeography, and achieving a stable classification.
divergence times for major culicid lineages date to the early cretaceous.
our results support the notion of rapid radiations early in the diversification of mosquitoes.
