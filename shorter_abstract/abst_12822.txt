there are two major forms of honeybee venom used in pharmacological applications: manually  extracted glandular venom , and venom extracted through the use of electrical stimulation .
here, the proteomes of gv and esv were compared using both gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches and the phosphoproteome of esv was determined through the use of tio <dig> enrichment.
moreover, two novel proteins  and three novel phosphorylation sites , phospholipase a- <dig> , and apamin ) were identified.
the three newly identified phosphorylated venom proteins in esv may elicit a different immune response through the specific recognition of antigenic determinants.
the two novel venom proteins extend our proteome coverage of honeybee venom.
esv may be more efficient than gv as a potential pharmacological source because of its higher venom protein content, production efficiency, and without the need to kill honeybee.
honeybee venom is a complicated defensive toxin that has a wide range of pharmacologically active compounds.
of the  <dig> proteins identified in gv, < 40% were venom toxins, and >â€‰60% of the proteins were non-toxic proteins resulting from contamination by gland tissue damage during extraction and bee death.
