phylogenetic tree constructed of catalytic domains coincided well with the domain structures of prxs and the phylogenies based on 16s rrna.
peroxiredoxin  is an important protein that plays essential roles in protecting own cells against reactive oxygen species .
overall  <dig> putative prx genes were identified, which were abundant in filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria, acaryochloris marina mbic  <dig>  and unicellular cyanobacteria inhabiting freshwater and hot-springs, while poor in all prochlorococcus and marine synechococcus strains.
among these putative genes,  <dig> open reading frames  encoding hypothetical proteins were identified as prx gene family members and the others were already annotated as prx genes.
classical motif  of thioredoxin was detected in protein sequences from the prx-like subfamily.
cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic prokaryotes with wide variations in genome sizes and ecological habitats.
however, knowledge on cyanobacterial prxs still remains obscure.
the catalytic motifs of the cyanobacterial prxs were similar to those of eukaryotic prxs and highly conserved in all but the prx-like subfamily.
all  <dig> putative prxs were classified into five major subfamilies  according to their domain structures.
the distribution of genes encoding prxs in different unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria especially those sub-families like prx-like or 1-cys prx correlate with the genome size, eco-physiology, and physiological properties of the organisms.
all cyanobacterial prx proteins share highly similar structures, implying that these genes may originate from a common ancestor.
