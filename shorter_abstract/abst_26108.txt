a simulation model based on the distribution of real microarray data plus two real data sets were used to assess the methods.
six published methods for estimating the proportion unchanged genes are reviewed, two alternatives are presented, and all are tested on both simulated and real data.
the new method had a very low error.
the new methods provide the scientist with more options to choose a suitable method for any particular experiment.
the focus of this article is how to estimate the proportion unchanged and the false discovery rate  and how to make inferences based on these concepts.
the concept of the q-value or false discovery rate is useful in practical research, despite some theoretical and practical shortcomings.
