gene ontology  enrichment results showed that cell adhesion, signal transduction, and protein phosphorylation gene categories were augmented soon after transfer, indicating a rapid reorganization of cellular components and functions.
our results revealed important interactions among transcription factors and offer a multifactorial perspective of genes involved in seawater acclimation.
among > <dig> transiently up-regulated transcription factors selected via co-expression correlation and go selection, five transcription factors, including cebpb and cebpd, were confirmed by quantitative pcr to be specific to hyperosmotic stress, while others were also up-regulated after freshwater control transfer, including some well-known osmotic-stress transcription factors such as sgk <dig> and tsc22d3/ostf <dig>  protein interaction networks suggest a high degree of overlapping among the signaling of transcription factors that respond to osmotic and general stresses, which sheds light on the interpretation of their roles during hyperosmotic stress and emergency.
teleost intestine is crucial for seawater acclimation by sensing osmolality of imbibed seawater and regulating drinking and water/ion absorption.
