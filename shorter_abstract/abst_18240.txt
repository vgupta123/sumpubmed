however, no systemic analysis of the bhlh transcription factor family has yet been reported in tomatoes.
distribution mapping results showed bhlh genes were localized on the  <dig> tomato chromosomes.
among the  <dig> bhlh genes from the tomato genome,  <dig> bhlh genes were detected in the tylcv-susceptible and resistant tomato breeding line before  and after tylcv  infection.
as anticipated, gene ontology  analysis indicated that most bhlh genes are related to the regulation of macromolecule metabolic processes and gene expression.
only four bhlh genes were differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.
virus-induced gene silencing  of one bhlh genes slybhlh <dig> in resistant lines can lead to the cell death.
one of which bhlh genes, slybhlh <dig>  was found to be involved in the tylcv infection through qrt-pcr expression analysis and vigs validation.
a total of  <dig> bhlh transcription factors were identified from the entire tomato genome.
the isolation and identification of these bhlh transcription factors facilitated clarification of the molecular genetic basis for the genetic improvement of tomatoes and the development of functional gene resources for transgenic research.
in addition, these findings may aid in uncovering an unexplored mechanism during the tylcv infection in tomatoes.
phylogenetic analysis of bhlh domain sequences from arabidopsis and tomato facilitated classification of these genes into  <dig> subfamilies.
in the present study,  <dig> bhlh transcription factor genes were identified.
tomato yellow leaf curl virus  threatens tomato production worldwide by causing leaf yellowing, leaf curling, plant stunting and flower abscission.
