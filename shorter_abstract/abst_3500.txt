it is challenging, therefore, to identify important associations between drugs and molecular entities â€“ particularly genes and gene variants, and thus these critical connections are often lost.
availability of full text articles as input into text mining engines is key, as literature abstracts often do not contain sufficient information to identify these pharmacogenomic associations.
thus, building on a tool called textpresso, we have created the pharmspresso tool to assist in identifying important pharmacogenomic facts in full text articles.
it presents these as a series of marked-up text fragments, in which key concepts are visually highlighted.
the field is rapidly gaining importance: it promises drugs targeted to particular subpopulations based on genetic background.
the pharmacogenomics literature has expanded rapidly, but is dispersed in many journals.
pharmspresso parses text to find references to human genes, polymorphisms, drugs and diseases and their relationships.
