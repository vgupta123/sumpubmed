scanning electron microscopy revealed subtle differences between genetic groups that may have been overlooked previously as taxonomic characters.
this study demonstrates that the coral skeleton can be remarkably evolutionarily plastic, which may explain some taxonomic difficulties, and obscure underlying patterns of endemism and diversity.
we examined the evolution of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer  and mitochondrial markers  in porites, one of the most taxonomically challenging and ecologically important genera of reef-building corals.
nuclear and mitochondrial markers were congruent, clearly resolving many traditionally recognized species; however, branching and mounding varieties were genetically indistinguishable within at least two clades, and specimens matching the description of 'porites lutea' sorted into three genetically divergent groups.
corallite-level features were generally concordant with genetic groups, although hyper-variability in one group  overlapped and obscured several others, and synarea  was closely related to congeners despite its unique morphology.
