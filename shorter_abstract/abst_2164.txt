the present study was performed to directly explore the effects of collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis  on amyloid plaque formation, microglial activation, and microvascular pathology in the cortex and hippocampus of the double transgenic app/ps <dig> mouse model for ad.
in contrast, cia reduced vessel density and length with features of microvascular pathology, including vascular segments, thinner vessels, and atrophic string vessels.
the present findings suggest that ra may exert beneficial effects against aÎ² burden and harmful effects on microvascular pathology in ad.
cia reduced levels of soluble and insoluble amyloid beta  peptides and amyloid plaque formation in the cortex and hippocampus of app/ps <dig> mice, which correlated with increased blood brain barrier disruption, iba-1-positive microglia, and cd45-positive microglia/macrophages.
wild-type or app/ps <dig> mice that received type ii collagen  in complete freund's adjuvant  at  <dig> months of age revealed characteristics of ra, such as joint swelling, synovitis, and cartilage and bone degradation  <dig> months later.
