therefore, the aim of this study was to identify rna changes in the ventral tegmental area following methamphetamine self-administration.
we performed microarray analyses on rna extracted from the ventral tegmental area of sprague–dawley rats following methamphetamine self-administration training  and 14 days of abstinence.
while many studies have investigated the effects of high-dose methamphetamine, and identified neurotoxic effects, few have looked at the role that persistent changes in gene regulation play following methamphetamine self-administration.
alterations to mrna and mirna expression within the mesolimbic system can affect addiction-like behaviors and thus play a role in the development of drug addiction.
we identified  <dig> mirna and  <dig> mrna transcripts that were differentially expressed ; these included genes not previously associated with addiction , loci encoding receptors related to drug addiction behaviors and genes with previously recognized roles in addiction such as mir- <dig>  mir-181a, dat and ret.
this study provides insight into the effects of methamphetamine on rna expression in a key brain region associated with addiction, highlighting the possibility that persistent changes in the expression of genes with both known and previously unknown roles in addiction occur.
