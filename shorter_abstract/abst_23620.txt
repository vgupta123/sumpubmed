computational analysis of gene regulatory regions is important for prediction of functions of many uncharacterized genes.
application of these methods to several datasets suggested that the number of the ifn-inducible genes is approximately 1500– <dig> in the human genome.
four regulatory factors, isgf <dig>  stat <dig>  irf <dig>  and nf-κb, are essential for the function of the ifn system.
the aim of this work is the development of computational approaches for the recognition of dna binding sites for these factors and computer programs for the prediction of the ifn-inducible regions.
we analyzed  <dig> sequences of the ifn-inducible genes compiled using microarray data analyses and also about  <dig>  human gene sequences from the epd and refseq databases;  <dig> of  <dig>  human genes annotated in epd were significantly ifn-inducible.
