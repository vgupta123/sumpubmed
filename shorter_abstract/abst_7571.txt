for calcium signaling at different levels of activation and different particle numbers in the system.
in systems with only few particles, faithful information transfer is hampered by random fluctuations.
it has been suggested that specific information is encoded in the amplitude, frequency and waveform of the oscillatory ca2+-signal.
transfer entropy is an asymmetric and dynamic measure of the dependence of two  stochastic processes.
we found that, most of the time, the transfer entropy increases with increasing particle numbers.
we could quantify the information transferred from simulated/experimentally measured calcium signals to a target enzyme under different cellular conditions.
using the information-theoretic measure transfer entropy, we studied the properties of information transfer in an example case, namely calcium signaling under different cellular conditions.
our approach, comprising stochastic coupling and using the information-theoretic measure transfer entropy, could also be a valuable tool for the analysis of other signaling pathways.
we stochastically coupled simulated and experimentally measured calcium signals to simulated target proteins and used kernel density methods to estimate the transfer entropy from these bivariate time series.
