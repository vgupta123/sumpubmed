we undertook an ivet screen to identify pf0- <dig> genes induced during growth in arid nevada desert soil, to expand our understanding of growth in soil environments, and examine whether pf0- <dig> uses general or soil type-specific mechanisms for success in soil environments.
consistent with previous studies, these genes cluster in metabolism, information storage/processing, regulation, and ‘hypothetical’, but there was no overlap with pf0- <dig> genes induced during growth in loam soil.
in contrast, the pfl01_ <dig> mutant was not impaired in persistence in sterile soil, but showed a significant reduction in competitive fitness.
a previous study using in vivo expression technology  identified  <dig> genes in p. fluorescens pf0- <dig> which are up-regulated during growth in massachusetts loam soil, a subset of which are important for fitness in soil.
in addition to potential applications in biocontrol and bioremediation, p. fluorescens is of interest as a model for studying bacterial survival and fitness in soil.
these data support the conclusion that numerous genes are specifically important for survival and fitness in natural environments, and will only be identified using in vivo approaches.
the implication of type  <dig> secretion underscores the importance of microbial interactions in natural environments.
when examined in sterile loam soil, mutation of pfl01_ <dig> had no discernible impact.
