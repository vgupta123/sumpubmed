we consider the problem of reconstructing a gene regulatory network structure from limited time series gene expression data, without any a priori knowledge of connectivity.
the method provides a guarantee on how well the inferred graph structure represents the underlying system, reveals deficiencies in the data and model, and suggests experimental directions to remedy the deficiencies.
we demonstrate that it is possible to use the coherence distribution to guide biological experiment design effectively.
in both cases, coherence of the model is used to assess the ability to reconstruct the network and to design new experiments.
by collecting a more informative dataset, the proposed method helps reduce the cost of experiments.
for the case in which all genes are accessible for measurement, and there is no measurement noise, we show that our method can be used to exactly reconstruct the network.
for the more general problem, in which hidden genes exist and all measurements are contaminated by noise, we show that our method leads to reliable reconstruction.
for each problem, a set of numerical examples is presented.
