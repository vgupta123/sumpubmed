genetic effects, expression patterns and historic changes of haplotypes at three homoeologous genes of tagw <dig> influencing yield were dissected in wheat cultivars.
three molecular markers including caps, dcaps and acas, were developed to distinguish the tagw2-6b haplotypes.
however, clear geographic distribution differences for tagw2-6a haplotypes were found; hap-6a-a was favored in chinese, australian and russian cultivars, whereas hap-6a-g was preferred in european, american and cimmyt cultivars.
tagw2-6a, cloned in earlier research, strongly influences wheat grain width and tkw.
haplotype association analysis indicated that tagw2-6b has a stronger influence than tagw2-6a on tkw, and hap-6b- <dig> was a favored haplotype increasing grain width and weight that had undergone strong positive selection in global wheat breeding.
relative expression analysis of the three tagw <dig> homoeologous genes in  <dig> cultivars revealed that tagw2-6a underwent the highest expression.
this research also provides a valuable case for understanding interaction of genes that control complex traits in polyploid species.
strong and constant selection to favored haplotypes has been found in global wheat breeding during the past century.
haplotype interaction analysis between tagw2-6a and tagw2-6b showed additive effects between the favored haplotypes.
tagw2-6d was the least expressed during grain development and tagw2-6b was intermediate.
eleven snps were detected in the promoter region of tagw2-6b, forming  <dig> haplotypes, but no divergence was detected in the tagw2-6d promoter or coding region.
