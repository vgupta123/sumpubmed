these differences were corroborated by qpcr measurements.
however, there are a few mirnas whose levels do not correlate between the microarray and qpcr measurements, or between different sample prep methods.
we measured the expression of  <dig> human mirnas in nine human tissues using agilent microarrays, and compared these results to qpcr profiles of  <dig> mirnas in the same tissues.
two common methods for measuring mirnas in a total rna sample are microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr .
since both methods use total rna as a starting material, it is also critical to understand how measurement of mirnas might be affected by the particular method of total rna preparation used.
we also tested three widely-used total rna sample prep methods using mirna microarrays.
the correlations between agilent mirna microarray results and qpcr results are generally excellent, as are the correlations between different total rna prep methods.
determining the expression levels of micrornas  is of great interest to researchers in many areas of biology, given the significant roles these molecules play in cellular regulation.
to understand the results of studies that use these two different techniques to measure mirnas, it is important to understand how well the results of these two analysis methods correlate.
researchers should therefore take care when comparing results obtained using different analysis or sample preparation methods.
we found that while almost all mirna levels correspond between the three methods, there were a few mirnas whose levels consistently differed between the different prep techniques when measured by microarray analysis.
using spiked-in synthetic mirnas, we further examined the two mirnas with the lowest correlations, and found the differences cannot be attributed to differential sensitivity of the two methods.
