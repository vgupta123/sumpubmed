both osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> are core components of the ejc, and participate in regulating of plant height, pollen, and seed development in rice.
the exon junction complex , which contains four core components, eukaryotic initiation factor 4aiii , mago/nashi , y14/tsunagi/rna-binding protein 8a, and barentsz/metastatic lymph node  <dig>  is formed in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and plays important roles in gene expression.
amino acid sequence analysis indicated that osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> had 99 % identity and 100 % similarity, and their gene expression patterns were similar in various rice tissues, but the level of osrh <dig> mrna was about 58-fold higher than that of osrh <dig> mrna in seedlings.
from bimolecular fluorescence complementation results, osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> interacted physically with osmago <dig> and osy14b, respectively, which indicated that both of osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> were core components of the ejc in rice.

this study investigated two dead box rna helicases, osrh <dig> and osrh <dig>  which are homologous to eif4aiii, in rice.
genes encoding core ejc components have been found in plants, including rice.
the phenotypes of three independent osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> double-knockdown transgenic lines included dwarfism, a short internode distance, reproductive delay, defective embryonic development, and a low seed setting rate.
to study the biological roles of osrh <dig> and osrh <dig> in rice, transgenic rice plants were generated by rna interference.
these phenotypes resembled those of mutants with gibberellin-related developmental defects.
currently, the functional characterizations of mago and y <dig> homologs have been demonstrated in rice.
