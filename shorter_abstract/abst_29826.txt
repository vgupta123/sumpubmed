using combined staining with a fluorescence brightener and propidium iodide, the mean rate of phagocytosis was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and the killing rate  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for a. fumigatus after  <dig> h. the phagocytosis rate did not differ between the two fungal species for a given primary culture.
infection occurs by inhalation of airborne conidia, which are first encountered by airway epithelial cells.
confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and anti-lamp <dig> antibody labeling studies showed that conidia of both species were phagocytosed and trafficked into a late endosomal-lysosomal compartment as early as  <dig> h post-infection.
we used an in vitro model of primary cultures of human nasal epithelial cells  at an air-liquid interface.
invasive aspergillosis, which is mainly caused by the fungus aspergillus fumigatus, is an increasing problem in immunocompromised patients.
a. fumigatus conidia were compared to penicillium chrysogenum conidia, a mould that is rarely responsible for invasive disease.
in double immunolabeling experiments, the mean percentage of a. fumigatus conidia undergoing phagocytosis  <dig> h post-infection was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %.
other immune cells or mechanisms are required to kill a. fumigatus conidia and to avoid further invasion.
this phagocytosis does not seem to be specific to a. fumigatus.
