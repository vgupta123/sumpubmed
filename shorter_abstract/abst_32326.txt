the species of t. harzianum are well known for their biocontrol activity against many plant pathogens.
functional annotation of these genes identified diverse biological processes and molecular functions required during t. harzianum growth on fscw or glucose.
we identified various genes of biotechnological value encoding to proteins which function such as transporters, hydrolytic activity, adherence, appressorium development and pathogenesis.
in this study, we have used subtractive library hybridization  and quantitative real-time pcr  techniques in order to explore changes in t. harzianum genes expression during growth on cell wall of f. solani  or glucose.
rt-qpcr was also used to examine the regulation of  <dig> genes, potentially involved in biocontrol, during confrontation between t. harzianum and f. solani.
fifteen genes were up-regulated and sixteen were down-regulated at least at one-time point during growth of t. harzianum in fscw.
this study demonstrates that t. harzianum expressed different genes when grown on fscw compared to glucose.
it provides insights into the mechanisms of gene expression involved in mycoparasitism of t. harzianum against f. solani.
however, there is a lack of studies concerning its use as a biological control agent against f. solani, a pathogen involved in several crop diseases.
during the confrontation assay most of the genes were up-regulated, mainly after contact, when the interaction has been established.
