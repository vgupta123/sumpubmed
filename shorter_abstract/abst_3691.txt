developing suitable methods for the identification of protein complexes remains an active research area.
in this paper, we propose prorank+, a method which detects protein complexes in protein interaction networks.
it was able to detect more protein complexes with higher quality scores.
the experimental results achieved by prorank + show its ability to detect protein complexes in protein interaction networks.
eventually, the method could potentially identify previously-undiscovered protein complexes.

the presented approach is mainly based on a ranking algorithm which sorts proteins according to their importance in the interaction network, and a merging procedure which refines the detected complexes in terms of their protein members.
it is important since it allows better understanding of cellular functions as well as malfunctions and it consequently leads to producing more effective cures for diseases.
