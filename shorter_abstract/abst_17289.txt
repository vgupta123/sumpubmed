functionally overexpression of hdgf represses a reporter gene which is controlled by an sv- <dig> promoter containing the  <dig> bp dna element.
hdgf exerts its transcription repressive effect through binding to a conserved dna element in the promoter of target genes.
moreover, chip and dnase i footprinting analysis revealed that hdgf binds this  <dig> bp dna fragment specifically.
recently we demonstrated that hdgf is a transcriptional repressor, but whether hdgf binds dna, the specificity of dna binding and what protein domain is required are still unknown.
hepatoma derived growth factor  is a nuclear protein with nuclear targeting required for mitogenic activity.
homology analysis identified the binding sequences as a motif within the promoter of the smyd <dig> gene, a hdgf target gene.
hdgf is a dna binding protein, binds dna specifically, and prefers a minimum of  <dig> bp long dna fragment.
using serial truncations of gst-hdgf, we mapped the dna binding domain of hdgf to the n-terminal pwwp domain.
the n-terminal pwwp domain of hdgf is required for dna binding.
