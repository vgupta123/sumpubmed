the results identify a novel receptor-binding epitope and demonstrate that virtual elimination of binding to cadherin br- <dig> does not completely remove toxicity in the case of b. mori.
substitution of a phenylalanine residue  by alanine reduced binding to the bombyx mori cadherin by 23-fold, reduced biological activity against b. mori by 4-fold, while retaining activity against lymantria dispar.
surface exposed hydrophobic residues over domains ii and iii were targeted for site-directed mutagenesis.
