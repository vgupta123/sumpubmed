pipiens f. molestus than by females, and that a wide range of physiological pathways may be affected by alan at the molecular level.
light is one of the most important environmental cues that organisms use to regulate their activities.
of these,  <dig> genes  showed reduced expression in the low-light treatment, most of which were related to gametogenesis, lipid metabolism, and immunity.
of the  <dig> genes  with increased expression, only five had any functional annotation.
mosquitoes in the culex pipiens complex  are widespread and abundant in urban areas where they are potential disease vectors.
pipiens f. molestus laboratory population that was exposed to near-natural light conditions  and alan conditions with 3Â h of constant low-level light at night .
there was a pronounced sex-bias in gene expression regardless of treatment, with  <dig>  genes  differentially expressed between males and females, including  <dig> genes of the circadian clock.
artificial light at night  is a typical feature of urban areas and most organisms living in urban or suburban habitats are exposed to low levels of alan.
our data suggest a stronger response to artificial light by males of cx.
the fact that differences in gene expression appear to be sex-specific may have a strong influence at the population level.
studies have begun to quantify the influence of alan on the behavior and ecology of organisms, but research on the effects at the molecular level remains limited.
