since these pathways are regulated by serpins that have basic residues at their p <dig> sites, we speculate that i. scapularis may utilize some of the serpins reported in this study to manipulate host defense.
given their importance in the biology of many organisms, the concept that ticks might utilize serpins to evade host defenses and immunizing against or disrupting their functions as targets for tick control is an appealing option.
although the paper is descriptive, this study provides the first step toward a comprehensive understanding of serpins in tick physiology.
based on consensus amino acid residues in the reactive center loop  and signal peptide scanning, 93% are putatively inhibitory while 82% are putatively extracellular.
ticks must overcome inflammation, complement activation and blood coagulation to complete feeding.
we have discussed our data in the context of advances on the molecular physiology of i. scapularis.
given the diversity among tick species, sizes of tick serpin families are likely to be variable.
nine of the intron-containing serpins occur in a cluster of  <dig> genes that span  <dig> kb of dna sequence.
serine proteinase inhibitors  are a large superfamily of structurally related, but functionally diverse proteins that control essential proteolytic pathways in most branches of life.
