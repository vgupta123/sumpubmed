to test whether co-translational association with liposomes is observed in the synthesis of other mps, we used  <dig> mammalian mps having one to  <dig> transmembrane domains  and five soluble proteins as a control.
there were no significant differences in association rate among mps regardless of the number of tmds and synthesis yield.
using the optimized accudenz dgu condition, p2rx4/lipid complexes were partially purified and detected as a major band by coomassie brilliant blue -staining after sds-page.
these results indicate that the wheat cell-free system is a highly productive method for lipid/mp complex formation and is suitable for large-scale preparation.
recently, some groups have reported on cell-free synthesis of functional membrane proteins  in the presence of exogenous liposomes .
formation of lipid/atppt <dig> complex during the cell-free synthesis reaction is critical for synthesis of a functional mp.
mps synthesized by this method form lipid/mp complexes, which could be readily partially purified by accudenz dgu.
however, it is unclear whether or not lipid/mp complex formation is common to all types of mps in the wheat cell-free system.
atppt <dig> was synthesized using a wheat cell-free system with or without liposomes.
the association rate of all  <dig> mps into liposomes was more than 40% , while that of the five soluble proteins was less than 20% .
the liposome association of green fluorescent protein -fusion mps were also tested and recovered as lipid/mp complex after floatation by accudenz density gradient ultracentrifugation .
