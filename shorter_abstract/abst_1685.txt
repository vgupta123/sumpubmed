finally, we demonstrated that tubulin interferes with rna:yb- <dig> complexes.
we show here that yb- <dig> interacts with tubulin and microtubules and stimulates microtubule assembly in vitro.
these results suggest that yb- <dig> may regulate microtubule assembly in vivo and that its interaction with tubulin may contribute to the control of mrna translation.
yb- <dig> is a major regulator of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.
