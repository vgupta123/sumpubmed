information based on transcript and functional similarity was used to update a previously-predicted whole-genome operon map and further applied to predict transcriptional networks constituting modules enriched in diverse functions such as secondary metabolism, and sigma factor.
the availability of genomic tools and access to a large warehouse of transcriptome data for the model organism, streptomyces coelicolor, provides incentive to decipher the intricacies of the regulatory cascades and develop biologically meaningful hypotheses.
in this study, more than  <dig> samples of genome-wide temporal transcriptome data, comprising wild-type and more than  <dig> regulatory gene mutants of streptomyces coelicolor probed across multiple stress and medium conditions, were investigated.
we present an integrated analysis of transcriptome data and genomic features to refine a whole-genome operon map and to construct regulatory networks at the cistron level in streptomyces coelicolor.
the predicted network displays a scale-free architecture with a small-world property observed in many biological networks.
