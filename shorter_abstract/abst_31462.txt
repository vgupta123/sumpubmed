this will provide opportunities to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying stress response of plants.
the potential roles of gene products associated with stress related ests were discussed.
as a first step towards the characterization of genes that contribute to combating salinity stress, we constructed a full-length cdna library of glycine soja  leaf treated with  <dig> mm nacl, using the smart technology.
the glycine soja ests will be used to mine salt tolerance gene, whose full-length cdnas will be obtained easily from the full-length cdna library.
we compared the est sequences of glycine soja to that of glycine max by using the blastn algorithm.
these ests were assembled using the phrap program to generate  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets.
comparison of glycine soja ests with those of glycine max revealed the potential to investigate the wild soybean's expression profile using the soybean's gene chip.
wild soybean  can survive in highly saline conditions, therefore provides an ideal candidate plant system for salt tolerance gene mining.
most expressed sequences from wild soybean exhibited similarity with soybean.
