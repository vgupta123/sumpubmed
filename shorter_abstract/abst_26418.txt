a total of  <dig>  genes were expressed in transition lactation,  <dig>  genes were expressed in peak lactation and  <dig>  genes were expressed in late lactation.
the results revealed that 69% of ncbi btau  <dig>  annotated genes are expressed in bovine milk somatic cells.
genes encoding caseins, whey proteins and enzymes in lactose synthesis pathway showed higher expression in early lactation.
cow milk is a complex bioactive fluid consumed by humans beyond infancy.
even though the chemical and physical properties of cow milk are well characterized, very limited research has been done on characterizing the milk transcriptome.
gene ontology  and pathway analysis were performed using the blast2go program and genego application of metacore program.
however, a fraction of the milk transcriptome has genes devoted to specific functions unique to the lactation stage.
milk samples were collected from holstein cows at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days of lactation, and rna was extracted from the pelleted milk cells.
this indicates the ability of milk somatic cells to adapt to different molecular functions according to the biological need of the animal.
the majority of genes in the fat metabolism pathway had high expression in transition and peak lactation milk.
most of the genes encoding for endogenous proteases and enzymes in ubiquitin-proteasome pathway showed higher expression along the course of lactation.
regardless of the lactation stage approximately  <dig>  genes showed ubiquitous expression.
gene expression analysis was conducted by illumina rna sequencing.
this is the first study to describe the comprehensive bovine milk transcriptome in holstein cows.
this study performs a comprehensive expression profiling of genes expressed in milk somatic cells of transition , peak  and late  lactation holstein cows by rna sequencing.
