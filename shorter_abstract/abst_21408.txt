this paper also presents necessary and sufficient conditions for  <dig> l-mers to have a common d-neighbor.
pms <dig> introduces novel ideas for generating common neighborhoods.
we want to find all sequences of length l that appear in each of the input sequences with at most d mismatches.
we have also implemented a parallel version for this algorithm.
in pms we are given two integers l and d and n biological sequences.
pms algorithms are typically evaluated on certain instances considered challenging.
despite ample research in the area, a considerable performance gap exists because many state of the art algorithms have large runtimes even for moderately challenging instances.
