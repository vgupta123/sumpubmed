buchneri was found to be the dominant species harbouring histaminogenic potential.
in contrast to previous studies in which the decarboxylase genes of specific isolates were studied, in this instance amplifications were performed using total metagenomic dna extracts.
the aim of this study was to employ high-throughput dna sequencing to assess the incidence of bacteria with biogenic amine  producing potential from among  <dig> different cheeses varieties.
in this study, high-throughput dna sequencing successfully identified populations capable of amine production in a variety of cheeses.
high-throughput sequencing resulted in generation of a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequencing reads and revealed that lactobacillus curvatus, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were the dominant species with tyramine producing potential, while lb.
amplicons were initially cloned to facilitate sanger sequencing of individual gene fragments to ensure that a variety of hdc and tdc genes were present.
