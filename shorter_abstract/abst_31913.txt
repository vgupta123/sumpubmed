when genotype data are available for case-parent triads, a likelihood-based approach using log-linear modeling can be used to assess both the maternal and inherited genotypes.
mi-gwas uses sas and lem software in combination to appropriately format data, perform the log-linear analyses and summarize the results.
the mi-gwas platform provides a valuable tool for the analysis of association of a phenotype or condition with maternal and inherited genotypes using genome-wide data from case-parent triads.
an integrated platform, maternal and inherited analyses for genome-wide association studies  for log-linear analyses of maternal and inherited genetic effects in large, genome-wide datasets, is described.
this platform was evaluated using existing genome-wide data and was shown to perform accurately and relatively efficiently.
however, available software packages for log-linear analyses are not well suited to the analysis of typical genome-wide association data .
