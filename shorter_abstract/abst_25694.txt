we demonstrate the method on several test cases including samples with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia  and diamond-blackfan anemia .
these terms are then used to search a variety of public databases including ncbi gene summaries, pubmed abstracts, and gene ontology terms, and protein-protein interactions in string-db to determine a relevance score.
however, several ad-hoc and subjective decisions must be made, and the results of such analyses are likely to depend on the researcher and the state of the literature and databases involved.
identification of the genetic alterations responsible for human disease is a central challenge facing medical genetics.
automated searching of public literature and online databases may substantially decrease the amount of time required to identify the mutations underlying human disease.
the overall ranking is determined by the product of the functional damage score and the relevance score, such that highly ranked variants are likely to be damaging and in genes of interest.
here, we describe an algorithm and web-based application which take into account both the probability that a variant damages the function of a gene as well as the relevance of the gene to a given phenotype.
