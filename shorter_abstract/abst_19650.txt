in some species, the expressed gene set changes slowly, either retaining the larval pattern or progressing only from larval to juvenile gene sets .
in addition to differences in color pattern, lake malawi cichlids also show some of the largest known shifts in visual sensitivity among closely related species.
differences in visual sensitivities among species of lake malawi cichlids arise through heterochronic shifts relative to the ontogenetic pattern of the tilapia outgroup.
cichlid fishes have radiated into hundreds of species in the great lakes of africa.
to test this, we compared the developmental pattern of cone opsin gene expression of the nile tilapia, oreochromis niloticus, with that of several cichlid species from lake malawi.
in contrast, lake malawi species showed one of two developmental patterns.
in tilapia, quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that opsin gene expression changes dynamically from a larval gene set through a juvenile set to a final adult set.
these shifts result from modulated expression of seven cone opsin genes.
in this work, we ask whether these differences might result from changes in developmental patterning of cone opsin genes.
we found that altering developmental expression patterns is also an important mechanism for altering sensory systems.
strong discrimination by females causes differential male mating success, rapid evolution of male color patterns and, possibly, speciation.
heterochrony has previously been shown to be a powerful mechanism for change in morphological evolution.
