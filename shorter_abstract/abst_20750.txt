we combined microarray profiling of several tissues with genome-scale bioinformatics and bisulfite sequencing of selected genes to study the honey bee methylome.
it provides a source for the switching of gene activities, the maintenance of stable phenotypes and the integration of environmental and genomic signals.
we find that around 35% of the annotated honey bee genes are expected to be methylated at the cpg dinucleotides by a highly conserved dna methylation system.
epigenetic modification of dna via methylation is one of the key inventions in eukaryotic evolution.
our data suggest that honey bees use cpg methylation of intragenic regions as an epigenetic mechanism to control the levels of activity of the genes that are broadly expressed and might be needed for conserved core biological processes in virtually every type of cell.
in addition, the evolutionary origins of dna methylation in multicellular organisms remain enigmatic.
we discuss the implications of our findings for genome-scale regulatory network structures and the evolution of the role of dna methylation in eukaryotes.
we show that one unifying feature of the methylated genes in this species is their broad pattern of expression and the associated 'housekeeping' roles.
