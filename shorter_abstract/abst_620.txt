the mirna expression patterns in tomato in response to b. cinerea stress were investigated by high-throughput sequencing.
results of srna high-throughput sequencing revealed that the upregulation of mirnas may be implicated in the mechanism by which tomato respond to b. cinerea stress.
analysis of the expression profiles of b. cinerea-responsive mirnas and their targets strongly suggested that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mirn <dig> may be involved in the tomato leaves’ response to b. cinerea infection.
moreover, five of these eight differentially expressed mirnas could hit  <dig> coding sequences  via cleaveland pipeline and psrnatarget program.
among those, one novel and  <dig> known mirnas were differentially expressed in b. cinerea-infected leaves, and  <dig> of these were further confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription pcr .
is an important pathogen causing stem rot in tomatoes grown indoors for extended periods.
in total,  <dig> known mirnas and seven novel mirnas were identified and their corresponding expression was detected in mock- and b. cinerea-inoculated leaves.
micrornas  have been reported as gene expression regulators related to several stress responses and b. cinerea infection in tomato.
however, the function of mirnas in the resistance to b. cinerea remains unclear.
