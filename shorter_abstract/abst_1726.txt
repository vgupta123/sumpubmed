finally, the mg <dig> strain was no longer able to consume oxygen in the stationary growth phase, leading to a drastic loss of culturability as a consequence of cumulative stresses and the absence of gene adaptation at this stage.
in carbon metabolism, the presence of oxygen led to an early shift at the gene level in the pyruvate pathway towards the acetate/ <dig> -butanediol pathway confirmed by the kinetics of metabolite production.

kinetics of growth and acidification were not affected by the presence of oxygen, indicating a high resistance to oxygen of the l. lactis mg <dig> strain.
the efficient consumption of oxygen by the l. lactis mg <dig> strain was supported by a coherent and early adaptation to oxygen after 1 hour of culture at both gene expression and metabolic levels.
combining metabolic and transcriptomic profiling, together with oxygen consumption kinetics, yielded new insights into the whole genome adaptation of l. lactis to initial oxidative stress.
an early and transitional adaptation to oxidative stress was revealed for l. lactis subsp.
cremoris mg <dig> at the transcriptional and metabolic levels in relation to acidification kinetics and growth conditions, especially at an early stage of growth.
its resistance was explained by an efficient consumption of oxygen within the first 4 hours of culture, leading to a drop of the redox potential.
this enables the cells to maintain key traits that are of great importance for industry, such as rapid acidification and reduction of the redox potential of the growth media.
its ability to adapt to technological stresses, such as oxidative stress encountered during stirring in the first stages of the cheese-making process, is a key factor to measure its technological performance.
