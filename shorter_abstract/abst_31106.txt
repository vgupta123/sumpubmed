the expression profiles of  <dig> genes in  <dig> gene knockdown experiments were obtained from the gene expression omnibus  .
cells use intragenic l1s as cis-regulatory elements within gene bodies to modulate gene expression.
there may be several mechanisms by which l1s mediate gene expression.
furthermore, in addition to cancer, intragenic l1s may alter gene expression in a variety of diseases and abnormalities.
the expression levels of the genes with and without l1s were compared using pearsonâ€™s chi-squared test.
moreover, the sirna-regulating genes containing l1s possess a variety of molecular functions, are responsible for many cellular phenotypes and are associated with a number of diseases.
intragenic l1s may be involved in the regulation of several biological processes, including dna damage and repair, inflammation, immune function, embryogenesis, cell differentiation, cellular response to external stimuli and hormonal responses.
after a permutation based statistical analysis and a multiple hypothesis testing,  <dig> genes were found to induce significant regulatory changes  in genes with l1s.
these regulations sometimes differed depending on the cell type and the orientation of the intragenic l1s.
when l <dig> methylation is decreased, either through chemical induction or in cancer, the intragenic l <dig> transcription is increased.
these intragenic l <dig> sequences are conserved and regulate the expression of their host genes.
