using an in silico approach, an epithelial-specific molecular signature of gene expression was identified in bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes comprising of family members of keratins, small proline-rich proteins and proteinase inhibitors.
comparative analysis of genome-wide expression profiles generated by means of serial analysis of gene expression  is a powerful approach to yield further insight into epithelial host defense mechanisms.
these data sets were used to elucidate a common denominator in epithelial host defense.
we performed an extensive comparative analysis of previously published sage data sets of two types of epithelial cells, namely bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes, in which the response to pro-inflammatory cytokines was assessed.
bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes were found to have a high degree of overlap in gene expression.
our comparative analysis of gene transcription reveals that bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes both express a subset of genes that is likely to be essential in epithelial barrier formation in these cell types.
the expression of these genes is specific for bronchial epithelial cells and keratinocytes and is not seen in non-epithelial cells.
we show that bronchial epithelial cells, similar to keratinocytes, express components that are able to form a cross-linked protein envelope that may contribute to an effective barrier against noxious stimuli and pathogens.
using polymerase chain reaction, presence of expression of selected tissue-specific genes was validated.
whereas some of the identified genes were known to be involved in inflammation, the majority of the signature represented genes that were previously not associated with host defense.
