hence, we conducted a two-season qtl study of parthenocarpy based on the cucumber genome with 145 f2: <dig> families derived from a cross between ec <dig>  and 8419 s- <dig>  in order to map novel qtls.
seven novel qtls were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  parthenocarpy  <dig>  , a qtl on chromosome  <dig>  was a major-effect qtl with a logarithm of odds  score of  <dig>  and phenotypic variance explained  of  <dig>  % in the spring season and with a lod score of  <dig>  and pve of  <dig>  % in the fall season.
whole genome re-sequencing was also performed both to develop effective linked markers and to predict candidate genes.
whole genome re-sequencing enhances the efficiency of polymorphic marker development and prediction of candidate genes.
a major-effect qtl parth <dig>  and six minor-effect qtls mainly contribute to the genetic architecture of parthenocarpy in cucumber.
cucumber  is a typical parthenocarpic plant but the qtls controlling parthenocarpy in cucumber were not mapped on chromosomes, and the linked markers were neither user-friendly nor confirmed by previous studies.
based on further combined analysis with transcriptome data between two parents, csarf <dig>  cswd <dig>  csein <dig>  csppr, cshexo <dig>  csmdl, csdjc <dig> and cssmax <dig> were predicted as potential candidate genes controlling parthenocarpy.
