many researchers use various computational intelligence methods to analyzed gene expression data.
these genes provide a high discrimination power on cancer classification.
further, the housekeeping genes with various expression patterns and tissue-specific genes are identified.
based on statistical analysis, our proposed method outperforms other popular classifiers for all test datasets, and is compatible to svm for certain specific datasets.
