the animals were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital and their brains excised, coronally dissected and subjected to quantitative autoradiography to derive the regional incorporation coefficient, k*, a marker of dha signaling.
the incorporation coefficient  for dha did not differ significantly between quinpirole-treated and control rats in any of  <dig> identified brain regions.
the polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid , participates in neurotransmission involving activation of calcium-independent phospholipase a <dig> , which is coupled to muscarinic, cholinergic and serotonergic neuroreceptors.

the present study used this approach to address whether a dha signal is produced following dompaminergic 2-like receptor activation with quinpirole in rat brain.
drug induced activation of ipla <dig> can be measured in vivo with quantitative autoradiography using 14c-dha as a probe.
plasma labeled and unlabeled unesterified dha concentrations were measured.
plasma labeled dha concentration over the 20-minute collection period  and unlabeled unesterified dha concentration did not differ significantly between the two groups.
