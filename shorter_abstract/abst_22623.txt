gelling kinetics, elastic and youngâ€™s moduli were investigated for selected parameters with regard to soluble alginate guluronate content, molecular weight, calcium or strontium gelling ions and alginate gelling ion particle sizes in the range between  <dig> and  <dig> micrometers.
through selection of the alginate type and molecular weight, particle sizes and the concentration of non-gelling ions.
formulations of the injectable and moldable alginate system presented have recently been used within specific medical applications and may have potential within regenerative medicine or other fields.
final gel elasticity depended on alginate type, concentration and gelling ion.
this work investigates a general method for producing alginate gel matrices using an internal mode of gelation that depends solely on soluble alginate and alginate/gelling ion particles.
the method involves the formulation of two-component kits comprised of soluble alginate and insoluble alginate/gelling ion particles.
