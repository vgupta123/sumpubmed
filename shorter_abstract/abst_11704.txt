in addition, implementation details of these methods as well as their computational performance have not been provided.
because of the high computational complexity of this task, reported methods for peptide enumeration were restricted to cover limited mass ranges .
the computational complexity of the subtasks is compared with the computational complexity of the whole task.
the increasing availability of parallel  computers in all fields of research makes the development of parallel methods for peptide enumeration a timely topic.
enumeration of all theoretically possible amino acid compositions is an important problem in several proteomics workflows, including peptide mass fingerprinting, mass defect labeling, mass defect filtering, and de novo peptide sequencing.
we present recursive procedures which are at the core of the method, and show that a single task of enumeration of all peptide compositions can be divided into smaller subtasks that can be executed in parallel.
our method has been implemented as a 32- and 64-bit windows application using microsoft visual c++ and the message passing interface.
we present computational times for our method executed on a computer cluster with  <dig> intel xeon x <dig> cpus  running windows hpc server.
we describe implementation of a parallel method for generating mass distributions of all theoretically possible amino acid compositions.
we describe a parallel method for enumerating all amino acid compositions up to a given length.
