molecular pathway analysis showed enrichment for complement/coagulation cascades and metabolism of xenobiotics.
this study characterizes the global transcriptional response in mouse brain to a symptomatic dose of the highly toxic pacific ciguatoxin p-ctx- <dig> and additionally compares this data to transcriptional profiles from liver and whole blood examined previously.
anti-inflammatory processes were at work not only in the brain but were also seen in whole blood and liver of these animals, creating a systemic anti-inflammatory environment to protect against the initial cellular damage caused by the toxin.
rt-pcr was used to independently validate gene expression and the web tool david was used to analyze gene ontology  and molecular pathway enrichment of the gene expression data.
pathologic activity of the complement/coagulation cascade has been shown in patients suffering from a chronic form of ciguatera poisoning and is of particular interest in this model.
ciguatoxins  are polyether marine neurotoxins and potent activators of voltage-gated sodium channels.
real time pcr confirmation was performed on  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a correlation of  <dig>   with microarray results.
many immediate early genes such as fos, jun and early growth response isoforms were down-regulated although others associated with stress such as glucocorticoid responsive genes were up-regulated.
