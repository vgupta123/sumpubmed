to establish the number of pr-10/bet v  <dig> genes and the isoform diversity within a single tree, pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of pr- <dig> genes was performed on two diploid b. pendula cultivars and one interspecific tetraploid betula hybrid.
forty-four different pr- <dig> sequences were recovered from b. pendula and assigned to thirteen putative genes.
the present characterization of the bet v  <dig> genes provides a framework for the screening of specific bet v  <dig> genes among other b. pendula cultivars or betula species, and for future breeding for trees with a reduced allergenicity.
investigations towards sensitization and immunotherapy should anticipate that patients are exposed to a mixture of bet v  <dig> isoforms of different ige-reactivity, even if pollen originates from a single birch tree.
pollen of the european white birch  is an important cause of hay fever.
pcr-cloning of multigene families is accompanied by a high risk for the occurrence of pcr recombination artifacts.
the main allergen is bet v  <dig>  member of the pathogenesis-related class  <dig>  multigene family.
isoforms with high and low ige-reactivity are encoded by different genes and one birch pollen grain has the genetic background to produce a mixture of isoforms with varying ige-reactivity.
in total, fourteen different bet v 1-type isoforms were identified in the three cultivars, of which nine isoforms were entirely new.
