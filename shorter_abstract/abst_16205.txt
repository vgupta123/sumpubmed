the gk protein acts in pancreatic islets as a “glucose sensor” that couples fluctuations in the blood glucose concentration to changes in cellular function and insulin secretion.
glucokinase  is a metabolic enzyme encoded by the gck gene and expressed in glucose-sensitive tissues, principally pancreatic islets cell and hepatocytes.
the study was undertaken to determine the nucleotide sequence of feline pancreatic gk cdna, predict the amino acid sequence and structure of the feline gk protein, and perform comparative bioinformatic analysis of feline cdna and protein.
molecular analysis predicts that feline pancreatic gk functions similarly to other mammalian gk proteins.
feline pancreatic gk is highly conserved at nucleotide and protein levels.
the deduced  <dig> amino acid feline protein has  <dig> amino acid substitutions not found in other mammalian gk proteins but maintains high structural homology with human gk.
residues crucial for substrate binding and catalysis are completely conserved in the feline protein.
full-length feline pancreatic gk cdna contains a  <dig> nucleotide coding sequence with high identity to other pancreatic gk cdnas.
routine pcr techniques were used with cdna from feline pancreas.
