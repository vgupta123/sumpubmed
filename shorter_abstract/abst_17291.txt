in the present study, high-throughput rna sequencing data of liver biopsies from  <dig> dairy cows were used to identify differentially expressed genes  between high- and low-fe groups of cows .
the analyses showed that degs act through certain pathways to affect or regulate fe, including steroid hormone biosynthesis, retinol metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and drug metabolism cytochrome p <dig>
on average,  <dig> million reads  were sequenced,  <dig> million reads were mapped, and  <dig>  known transcripts were quantified according to the bovine reference genome.
subsequently, a profile of the pathways connecting the degs to fe was generated, and a list of candidate genes and biomarkers was derived for their potential inclusion in breeding programmes to improve fe.
the degs that were identified were the cypâ€™s and gimap genes for the holstein and jersey cows, respectively, which are related to the primary immunodeficiency pathway and play a major role in feed utilization and the metabolism of lipids, sugars and proteins.
the interaction analysis  showed no interaction effects in the holstein cows, while two genes showed interaction effects in the jersey cows.
a comparison of the high- and low-rfi groups revealed  <dig> and  <dig> significantly degs in holstein and jersey cows, respectively.
