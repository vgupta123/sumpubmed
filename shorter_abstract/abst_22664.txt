information solicited by scientists on its biological entities  is scattered within several data sources like sgd, yeastract, cygd-mips, biogrid, phosphogrid, etc.
in this paper, we present our approach in developing this system which takes advantage of sb-kom to perform the query transformation needed and a set of data services to reach the integrated data sources.
user queries are expressed in terms of a domain ontology through a simple form-based web interface.
yeastmed is the first mediation-based system specific for integrating yeast data sources.
because of the heterogeneity of these sources, querying them separately and then manually combining the returned results is a complex and time-consuming task for biologists most of whom are not bioinformatics expert.
it was conceived mainly to help biologists to find simultaneously relevant data from multiple data sources.
the system is composed of a set of modules that depend heavily on xml and semantic web technologies.
saccharomyces cerevisiae is recognized as a model system representing a simple eukaryote whose genome can be easily manipulated.
