our model is based on both canonical seed matching and non-canonical seed pairing, which discovers targets that allow one bit gu wobble.
a simple but powerful computational mirna target prediction method is developed that is solely based on canonical and non-canonical seed matches without requiring evolutionary conservation of the target sites.
currently available microrna  target prediction algorithms require the presence of a conserved seed match to the 5' end of the mirna and limit the target sites to the 3' untranslated regions of mrnas.
we have developed targets, a novel computational approach for predicting mirna targets with the target sites located along entire gene sequences, which permits finding additional targets that are not located in the 3' un-translated regions.
our method also expands the target search space to different gene regions, rather than limiting to 3'utr only.
compared to well-known mirna target prediction tools, including targetscans, pictar and microt_cds, our method yields the highest sensitivity, while achieving a comparable level of accuracy.
it does not rely on evolutionary conservation, so it allows the detection of species-specific mirna-mrna interactions and makes it suitable for analyzing un-conserved gene sequences.
