apolipoprotein b  is an integral component of the chylomicron and the atherogenic lipoproteins ldl and lp.

due to its length, exon  <dig> contains multiple pseudo splice sites which are not spliced, but which conform to the degenerate splice site consensus.
we demonstrate that these pseudo splice sites are repressed by multiple, tandem splicing silencers distributed along the length of exon  <dig>  the distribution of these elements appears to be heterogeneous, with a greater frequency in the middle  <dig>  nt of the exon.
repression of these splice sites is key to maintaining the integrity of exon  <dig> during rna splicing and therefore the correct expression of both isoforms of apob.
