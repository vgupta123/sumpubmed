we used two highly-specific mutation screening methods, mismatch-specific endonuclease and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, to identify mutations in the hbb gene.
we successfully distinguished mutations in the hbb gene by the mismatch-specific endonuclease method without need for further assay.
this technique had 100% sensitivity and specificity for the study sample.
compared to the dhplc approach, the mismatch-specific endonuclease method allows mutational screening of a large number of samples because of its speed, sensitivity and adaptability to semi-automated systems.
these findings demonstrate the feasibility of using the mismatch-specific endonuclease method as a tool for mutation screening.
