in particular, they send out multiple pseudopods that radiate at a broader distribution of angles relative to the chemoattractant gradient.
dynacortin enriches with the actin, particularly at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells.
we studied the effect of dynacortin on cell motility during chemotaxis and on actin dynamics in vivo and in vitro.
dynacortin, an actin cross-linking protein, localizes to the cell cortex and contributes to cortical resistance, thereby helping to define the cell shape changes of cytokinesis.
dynacortin contributes to cell polarization during chemotaxis.
though dynacortin-deficient cells show normal bulk  actin assembly upon chemoattractant stimulation, dynacortin can promote actin assembly in vitro.
by cross-linking and possibly stabilizing actin polymers, dynacortin also contributes to cortical viscoelasticity, which may be critical for establishing cell polarity.
by fluorescence spectroscopy, co-sedimentation and transmission electron microscopy, dynacortin acts as an actin scaffolder in which it assembles actin monomers into polymers with a stoichiometry of  <dig> dyn2: <dig> actin under salt conditions that disfavor polymer assembly.
dynacortin also becomes highly enriched in cortical protrusions, which are sites of new actin assembly.
cells devoid of dynacortin do not become as polarized as wild-type control cells but move with similar velocities as wild-type cells.
wild-type cells typically only send out one pseudopod at a time that does not diverge much from 0Â° on average relative to the gradient.
