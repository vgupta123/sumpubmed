at present, the functional explanation for the diversity generated by both conventional protein evolution in the n terminal domain, as well as alternative splicing, remains unexplained.
to gain insight into cenh <dig> evolution, we characterized patterns of nucleotide and protein diversity among diploids and allopolyploids within three diverse angiosperm genera, brassica, oryza, and gossypium , with a focus on evidence for diversifying selection in the various domains of the cenh <dig> gene.
since the n terminus is subject to diversifying selection but the dna binding domains do not appear to be, rapidly evolving centromere sequences are unlikely to be the primary driver of cenh <dig> sequence diversification.
in addition, we compare expression profiles and alternative splicing patterns for cenh <dig> in representatives of each genus.
centromeric dna sequences alone are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere specification.
the centromere specific histone, cenh <dig>  evolves rapidly in many species, perhaps as a coevolutionary response to rapidly evolving centromeric dna.
