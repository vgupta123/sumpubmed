we propose a computationally efficient â„“1-penalization approach extending the lasso algorithm to this context, and compare it to other procedures in a simulation study.
we develop methods to perform model selection and parameter estimation in log-linear models for the analysis of sparse contingency tables, to study the interaction of two or more factors.
it is challenging to extend these to the high dimensional and potentially sparse data arising in computational biology.
the joint analysis of several categorical variables is a common task in many areas of biology, and is becoming central to systems biology investigations whose goal is to identify potentially complex interaction among variables belonging to a network.
we then illustrate these algorithms on contingency tables arising from full-length cdna libraries.
we propose regularization methods that can be used successfully to detect complex interaction patterns among categorical variables in a broad range of biological problems involving categorical variables.
interactions of arbitrary complexity are traditionally modeled in statistics by log-linear models.
an important example, which provides the motivation for this article, is the analysis of so-called full-length cdna libraries of alternatively spliced genes, where we investigate relationships among the presence of various exons in transcript species.
