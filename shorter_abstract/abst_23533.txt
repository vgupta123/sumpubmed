we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify co-expression modules that correlated to meat quality phenotypes and were highly enriched for genes involved in glucose metabolism, response to wounding, mitochondrial ribosome, mitochondrion, and extracellular matrix.
the integration of mirna and mrna expression analyses, as well as network analysis, enabled us to interpret the differentially-regulated genes from a systems perspective.
linking co-expression networks of transcripts and hierarchically organized pairs of mirnas and mrnas to meat properties yields new insight into several biological pathways underlying phenotype differences.
physiological processes aiding the conversion of muscle to meat involve many genes associated with muscle structure and metabolic processes.
negative correlation of mirna with mrna and target prediction were used to select transcripts out of the modules of trait-associated mrnas to further identify those genes that are correlated with post mortem traits.
porcine muscle co-expression transcript networks that correlated to post mortem traits were identified.
