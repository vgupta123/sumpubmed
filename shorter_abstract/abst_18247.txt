here, we characterize a group of genes responsible for toxin production and antibiotic resistance of s. aureus strains isolated from skin, soft tissue, and bone related infections.
this study provides new insight into the prevalence of toxin and antibiotic resistance genes in s. aureus strains responsible for skin, soft tissue, and bone infections.
panton-valentine leukocidin  was the most commonly produced virulence factor , followed by staphylococcal enterotoxin b .
a total of  <dig> s. aureus strains were collected from five different types of infection: furuncles, pyomyositis, abscesses, buruli ulcers, and osteomyelitis, from hospital admissions and out-patients in benin.
staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic commensal bacterium that mostly colonizes the skin and soft tissues.
exfoliative toxin b was produced by  <dig> % of the strains, and was only found in isolates from buruli ulcers.
our results showed that pvl was strongly associated with pyomyositis and osteomyelitis, and that there is a high prevalence of pvl-mrsa skin infections in benin.
all strains were resistant to benzyl penicillin, while 25% were resistant to methicillin, and all showed sensitivity to vancomycin.
the pathogenicity of s. aureus is due to both its ability to resist antibiotics, and the production of toxins.
