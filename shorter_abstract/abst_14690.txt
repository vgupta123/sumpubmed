the critical question as to whether the rumen microflora might constitute a protective shield is unresolved.
the ability of rumen microorganisms to degrade certain important cyanotoxins  was studied in vitro by incubating with rumen fluid at three different concentrations  for 3 h. the degradation efficiencies were determined by lc-ms  positive mode.
in conclusion the present results suggest that the rumen microbial flora may protect ruminants from being intoxicated by cyanotoxins.
no degradation was observed in higher concentrations for entire 3 h. the present results reveal that the degradation was both dose and time dependent.
in countries around the baltic sea grazing ruminants have access to and drink, surface water from lakes, rivers and in several coastal regions.
in the baltic sea both microcystin  and nodularin  occurs as cyclic peptides and have hepatotoxic effects.
degradation was observed in the following order mc-rr 36%, nod 35%, mc-rr 25% and mc-lr  <dig> % at lower concentrations within 3 h. however, average degradation was observed at concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml.
