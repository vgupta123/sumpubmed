the factor mediates the stress-induced expression of heat shock or stress proteins .
heat shock factor  not only is the transcription factor primarily responsible for the transcriptional response of cells to physical and chemical stress but also coregulates other important signaling pathways.
phosphoser <dig> also contributes to activation of hsf <dig> by chemical stress.
an alanine scan of all ser, thr and tyr residues of human hsf <dig> was carried out using a validated transactivation assay, and residues phosphorylated in hsf <dig> were identified by mass spectrometry and sequencing.
several previous studies on human hsf <dig> were concerned with phosphorylation on ser <dig>  ser <dig> and ser <dig>  which phosphorylation appears to be related to factor deactivation subsequent to stress, and one study reported stress-induced phosphorylation of ser <dig> contributing to factor activation.
however, no previous study attempted to fully describe the phosphorylation status of an hsf/hsf <dig> in stressed cells and to systematically identify phosphoresidues involved in factor activation.
hsf <dig> activated by heat treatment was phosphorylated on ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  ser <dig>  and ser <dig>  phosphorylation of ser <dig> but none of the other ser residues was found to contribute significantly to activation of the factor by heat stress.
twelve ser residues but no thr or tyr residues were identified that were phosphorylated in heat-activated hsf <dig>  mutagenesis experiments and functional studies suggested that phosphorylation of hsf <dig> residue ser <dig> plays a critical role in the induction of the factor's transcriptional competence by heat stress.
phosphorylation on ser <dig> increased rapidly during heat stress as shown by experiments using a pser <dig> phosphopeptide antibody.
heat stress-induced dna binding and nuclear translocation of a s326a substitution mutant was not impaired in hsf1-negative cells, but the mutant stimulated hsp <dig> expression several times less well than wild type factor.
to date, no functional role could be ascribed to any of the other newly identified phosphoser residues.
