our results suggest that although mirna-seq has superior specificity, it may not detect low abundant mirnas in urine samples.
on the other hand, the qrt-pcr analysis was not able to detect the mirna isoforms, which made up the majority of mirna changes detected by ngs.
our aim is to compare rna sequencing and qpcr based mirna profiling in urine specimen from control and rats with confirmed tubular injury.
our preliminary examination of the concordance between mirna-seq and qrt-pcr in urine specimen suggests minimal agreement between platforms probably due to the differences in sensitivity.
to our knowledge, this is the first time that mirna profiling platforms including ngs have been compared in urine specimen.
recent studies have reported significant levels of mirnas in a variety of body fluids, raising the possibility that mirnas could serve as useful biomarkers.
here we describe the changes in mirna expression patterns in a rodent model of renal tubular injury .
