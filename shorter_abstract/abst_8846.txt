heparin-anticoagulated peripheral blood was collected from ms-patients and healthy controls followed by isolation of t-cells.
by kolmogorov-smirnov test,  <dig> of  <dig> differentially expressed microrna were shown to affect the expression of their target genes, many of which were involved in the immune system.
tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member  <dig>  was a microrna target gene significantly decreased in ms. the differential expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and the predicted microrna target gene tnfsf <dig> was verified by real-time pcr and elisa.
to investigate the role of microrna in multiple sclerosis , we performed genome-wide expression analyses of mrna and microrna in t-cells from ms patients and controls.
we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes and  <dig> differentially expressed microrna between ms patients and controls.
these findings indicate that microrna may be important regulatory molecules in t-cells in ms.
microrna are small noncoding rna molecules that are involved in the control of gene expression.
