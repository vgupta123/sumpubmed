in analyzing these loci to determine their potential regulatory functions, areas of signal enrichment must be considered relative to proximal genes and regulatory elements annotated throughout the target genome regions of chromatin association by transcriptional regulators should be distinguished as individual binding sites in order to enhance downstream analyses, such as the identification of known and novel consensus motifs.
the programs can accurately subdivide multimodal regions of signal enrichment into distinct subpeaks corresponding to binding sites or chromatin modifications, retrieve genomic sequences encompassing the computed subpeak summits, and identify positional features of interest such as intersection with exon/intron gene components, proximity to up- or downstream transcriptional start sites and cis-regulatory elements.
high-performance implementations are provided for unix pipeline integration along with a gui version for interactive use.
functional genomic studies involving high-throughput sequencing and tiling array applications, such as chip-seq and chip-chip, generate large numbers of experimentally-derived signal peaks across the genome under study.
peakanalyzer is a set of high-performance utilities for the automated processing of experimentally-derived peak regions and annotation of genomic loci.
the software can be configured to run either as a pipeline component for high-throughput analyses, or as a cross-platform desktop application with an intuitive user interface.
