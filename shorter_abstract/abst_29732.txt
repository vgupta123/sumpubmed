about 80% of the current sequences were assigned into  <dig> subfamilies in a global analysis of all publicly available gh <dig> sequences and associated biochemical data.
furthermore, twenty subfamilies presently have no characterization whatsoever and many others have only limited structural and biochemical data.
the analysis also uncovered a number of gh <dig> proteins which have lost their catalytic machinery, indicating evolution towards novel functions.
mapping of functional knowledge onto the gh <dig> phylogenetic tree revealed that the sequence space of this historical and industrially important family is far from well dispersed, highlighting targets in need of further study.
the long and complex evolution of this family of enzymes and its broad sequence diversity limits functional prediction.
