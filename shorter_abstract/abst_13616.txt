the main advantage of the proposed algorithm over previously proposed methods is its flexibility to accommodate any kind of intervention design, including partial or multiple knock-out experiments.
in recent years, there has been great interest in using transcriptomic data to infer gene regulatory networks.
in the present work, we seek to improve the estimation of causal effects among genes by jointly modeling observational transcriptomic data with arbitrarily complex intervention data obtained by performing partial, single, or multiple gene knock-outs or knock-downs.
finally, the simulation study confirmed that it is not possible to estimate the causal ordering of genes from observational data alone.
in addition, multiple knock-outs proved to contribute valuable additional information compared to single knock-outs.
in all cases, we found that the inclusion of intervention experiments enabled more accurate estimation of causal regulatory relationships than the use of wild-type data alone.
using the framework of causal gaussian bayesian networks, we propose a markov chain monte carlo algorithm with a mallows proposal model and analytical likelihood maximization to sample from the posterior distribution of causal node orderings, and in turn, to estimate causal effects.
using simulated data as well as data from the dialogue for reverse engineering assessments and methods   <dig> challenge, the proposed method was compared to two alternative approaches: one requiring a complete, single knock-out design, and one able to model only observational data.
