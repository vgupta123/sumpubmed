heterologous complementation experiments showed that the idiosyncratic properties of the 4e and iso4e proteins create a major checkpoint for viral infection of different hosts.
a complementation system was set up in arabidopsis to test the restoration of systemic infection by tev.
here, we investigated how tev exploits different translation initiation factor isoforms to infect these two plant species.
using this system, arabidopsis susceptibility to tev was complemented with a susceptible pepper eif4e <dig> allele but not with a resistant allele.
the eif4e allelic series is associated with specific resistance spectra in crops such as capsicum annum.
lastly, we show that the resistant eif4e <dig> allele is similarly overcome by a resistance-breaking tev strain as in pepper, confirming that this arabidopsis tev-susceptibility complementation system is allele-specific.
we report here a complementation system in arabidopsis that makes it possible to assess the role of pepper pvr2-eif4e alleles in susceptibility to tev.
