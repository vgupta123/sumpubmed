the analyses show that neighbouring genes are significantly coexpressed in the zebrafish genome, and the coexpression level is influenced by the intergenic distance and transcription orientation.
there is a positive correlation between gene coexpression and positional clustering in the zebrafish genome.
this fact is further supported by examining the coexpression level of genes within positional clusters in the neighbourhood model.
this paper analyzes correlation between the proximity of eukaryotic genes and their transcriptional expression pattern in the zebrafish  genome using available microarray data and gene annotation.
