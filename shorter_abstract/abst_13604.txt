secondly, this is one of the first studies on the crop from the low-lignin plants from the field trail which demonstrates that such plants could be successfully cultivated in a field.
cad down-regulation had an effect in the reduced lignin amount in the flax fibre cell wall and as ft-ir results suggests, disturbed lignin composition and structure.
one of the reasons for this is unpredictable quality and properties of flax fibre, because they depend on environmental factors, retting duration and growing conditions.
therefore, in this study we evaluated composition and properties of flax fibre from plants with silenced cad  gene, which is key in the lignin biosynthesis.

moreover, cad down-regulation did not disturb at all or has only slight effect on flax plants’ development in vivo, however, the resistance against flax major pathogen fusarium oxysporum decreased slightly.
phylogenetic analysis revealed that flax cad belongs to the “bona-fide” cad family.
however, to conclude that all observed changes are trustworthy and correlated exclusively to cad repression, further analysis of the modified plants genome is necessary.
moreover introduced modification activated a compensatory mechanism which was manifested in the accumulation of cellulose and/or pectin.
there is evidence that cad is a useful tool to improve lignin digestibility and/or to lower the lignin levels in plants.
the major finding of our paper is that the modification targeted directly to block lignin synthesis caused not only reduced lignin level in fibre, but also affected amount and organization of cellulose and pectin.
