vesiculation is a ubiquitous secretion process of gram-negative bacteria, where outer membrane vesicles  are small spherical particles on the order of  <dig> to 250 nm composed of outer membrane  and lumenal periplasmic content.
in addition, the characterization of an nlpa deletion in backgrounds lacking either lpp- or ompa-mediated envelope crosslinks demonstrated a novel role for nlpa in envelope architecture.
in this study, we found that subtle modifications of pg remodeling and crosslinking modulate omv production, inversely correlating with bound lpp levels.
based on the envelope architecture and prior characterization of the hypervesiculation phenotypes for mutants lacking the lipoprotein, lpp, which is involved in the covalent om-peptidoglycan  crosslinks, it is expected that an inverse relationship exists between omv production and pg-crosslinked lpp.
however, this inverse relationship was not found in strains in which omv production is driven by an increase in “periplasmic pressure” resulting from the accumulation of protein, pg fragments, or lipopolysaccharide.
vesicle functions have been elucidated in some detail, showing their importance in virulence factor secretion, bacterial survival, and biofilm formation in pathogenesis.
from this work, we conclude that omv production can be driven by distinct lpp concentration-dependent and lpp concentration-independent pathways.
furthermore, omvs serve as an envelope stress response, protecting the secreting bacteria from internal protein misfolding stress, as well as external envelope stressors.
