we have previously reported the expression and cellular localization of a type a response regulator, zmtcrr- <dig>  in the transfer cells of the maize seed, a tissue critical for seed filling and development, and described its regulation by a tissue specific transcription factor.
the discovery of a new type a response regulator, zmtcrr- <dig>  specifically expressed in the transfer cells and controlled by a tissue specific transcription factor suggests a previously unknown role for tcs in the biology of transfer cells.
in this work we investigate the expression and localization of other components of the tcs signalling routes in the maize seed and initiate the characterization of their interactions.
they play a central role in cytokinin mediated functions in plants, affecting processes such as meristem growth, phyllotaxy, seed development, leaf senescence or tissue differentiation.
its possible role in integrating external signals with seed developmental processes is discussed.
two component systems  are phosphotransfer-based signal transduction pathways first discovered in bacteria, where they perform most of the sensing tasks.
a more complex framework is usually found in plants and fungi, in which a third component transfers the phosphate group from the receptor to the response regulator.
furthermore, zmtcrr- <dig> expression in an heterologous system  is directed to xylem parenchyma cells, probably involved in transport processes, one of the major roles attributed to the transfer cell layer.
