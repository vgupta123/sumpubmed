our results suggest that judicious resource management may allow to solve at least some bioinformatics problems with massive data on a commodity personal computer.
our solution also belongs to memory-frugal ones; most competitive algorithms cannot efficiently work on a pc with  <dig> gb of memory for such massive data.
in particular, it is capable of counting the statistics for short-read human genome data, in input gzipped fastq file, in less than  <dig> minutes on a pc with  <dig> gb of ram and  <dig> cpu cores, and for long-read human genome data in less than  <dig> minutes.
