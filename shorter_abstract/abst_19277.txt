several of the conserved genes were identified as candidates for vaccine development, and we conclude that m-cgh is a valuable tool for reverse vaccinology.
our goal was to identify conserved genes, especially those predicted to encode outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins because of their potential for the development of more effective vaccines.
fifty-eight conserved genes predicted to encode for outer membrane proteins or lipoproteins were identified.
as well, there were several clusters of diverged or absent genes including those associated with capsule biosynthesis, toxin production as well as genes typically associated with mobile elements.
not surprisingly, these included genes associated with capsule biosynthesis as the capsule is associated with sero-specificity.
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes severe losses to the swine industry worldwide.
although a. pleuropneumoniae strains are essentially clonal, m-cgh analysis of the reference strains of the fifteen serovars and representative field isolates revealed several classes of genes that were divergent or absent.
current commercially-available vaccines are of limited value because they do not induce cross-serovar immunity and do not prevent development of the carrier state.
using hierarchical clustering, our m-cgh results showed that the majority of the genes in the genome of the serovar  <dig> a. pleuropneumoniae l <dig> strain were conserved in the reference strains of all  <dig> serovars and in representative field isolates.
microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations  were used to estimate whole genomic diversity of representative actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strains.
