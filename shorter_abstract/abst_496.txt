the clade includes other important crops  as well as a sequenced model legume .
the availability of the genomic and derived molecular marker resources presented here will help change lentil breeding strategies and lead to increased genetic gain in the future.
an estimate for the time divergence of l. culinaris from l. ervoides and of both from m. truncatula was also calculated.
extensive collinearity with m. truncatula was evident on the basis of sequence homology between mapped markers and the model genome and large translocations and inversions relative to m. truncatula were identified.
the generation of data in multiple cultivated  and wild  genotypes together with the utilization of a bioinformatics workflow enabled the identification of a large collection of snps and the subsequent development of a genotyping platform that was used to establish the first comprehensive genetic map of the l. culinaris genome.
