gpcrs can regulate cell physiology via pathways originating with heterotrimeric g-proteins or β-arrestins.
when expressed in fibroblasts, both native jellyop and the f112a arrestin-biased mutant drove light-dependent phase resetting in the circadian clock.
our data imply separable g-protein and arrestin inputs to the mammalian circadian clock and establish a pair of optogenetic tools suitable for manipulating gαs- and β-arrestin-biased signalling in live cells.
we applied an optogenetic approach to determine the contribution of these two signalling modes on circadian phase.
shifts induced by the two opsins differed in their circadian phase dependence and the degree to which they were associated with clock gene induction.
endogenous circadian oscillators distributed across the mammalian body are synchronised among themselves and with external time via a variety of signalling molecules, some of which interact with g-protein-coupled receptors .
