sequence comparisons between homeologous bacs shows that the soybean genome is a mosaic of retained paleopolyploid regions.
what remains relatively under characterized is the level of sequence identity in retained homeologous regions of the genome.
one of the initial concerns is to what extent sequence identity in homeologous regions would have on whole genome shotgun sequence assembly.
large-scale "batch" reassembly of all  <dig> bacs combined showed that even the most homeologous bacs with upwards of 95% sequence identity resolve into their respective homeologous sequences.
recently, the department of energy joint genome institute and united states department of agriculture jointly announced the sequencing of the soybean genome.
seventeen bacs representing ~ <dig>  mb were sequenced as representative potential homeologous regions from the soybean genome.
this analysis investigated both the structure of the paleopolyploid soybean genome and the potential effects retained homeology will have on assembling the whole genome shotgun sequence.
potential assembly errors were generated by tandemly duplicated pentatricopeptide repeat containing genes and long simple sequence repeats.
based upon these results, homeologous regions similar to those characterized here will not cause major assembly issues.
