automated segmentation pipelines can ensure efficient and reproducible evaluation and analysis with constant high quality for all images of an experiment.
nevertheless, manual annotations are prone to errors and display inter- and intra-observer variability which influence the validation results of automated cell segmentation pipelines.
the simulated data is suited to evaluate image segmentation pipelines more efficiently and reproducibly than it is possible on manually annotated real micrographs.
an automated segmentation pipeline on the simulated fluorescent cell micrographs reproduces segmentation performances of that pipeline on real fluorescent cell micrographs.
we present a new approach to simulate fluorescent cell micrographs that provides an objective ground truth for the validation of cell segmentation methods.
the proposed simulation approach produces realistic fluorescent cell micrographs with corresponding ground truth.
