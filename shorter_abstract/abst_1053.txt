the neuroprotective effect of ret is controlled by glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alphas .
our structural characterization indicates that gas <dig> differs from gfrα’s significantly also in its conformation, which probably reflects the functional differences between gas <dig> and the gfrαs.
in addition, gas <dig> has an extended loop in the n-terminal domain that is conserved in vertebrates after the divergence of fishes and amphibians.
we conclude that gas <dig> most likely differs from gfrαs functionally, based on comparative structural analysis, while it is able to bind the extracellular part of ret in a neurotrophic factor independent manner, although with low affinity in solution.
gas <dig> is known to signal through two different cell membrane receptors: rearranged during transformation , and the sonic hedgehog receptor patched- <dig>  sonic hedgehog signalling is important in stem cell renewal and ret mediated signalling in neuronal survival.
the low resolution solution structure reveals that gas <dig> is more elongated and flexible than the gfrαs, and the homology modelling of the individual domains show that they differ from gfrαs by lacking the amino acids for neurotrophic factor binding.
disorders in both sonic hedgehog and ret signalling are connected to cancer progression.
