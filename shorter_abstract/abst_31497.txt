our findings suggest that francisella has a differential tissue tropism depending on the route of entry and that the virulence of francisella by the pulmonary route is associated with a rapid bacteremia and an early preferential tropism to the lung.
novicida administered intranasally or intratracheally were visualized in the respiratory tract and stomach at  <dig>  hours post infection.
micropet images correlated with the biodistribution of isotope and bacterial burdens in analyzed tissues.
adult mice were inoculated intranasally with f. tularensis subsp.
in contrast, the images of radiolabeled f. tularensis subsp.
in addition, the use of the micropet device allowed us to identify the cecum as a novel site of colonization of francisella tularensis subsp.
novicida, which is an equally virulent subspecies in mice, was used in concert with a micropet scanner to better understand its temporal dissemination in vivo upon intranasal infection and how such dissemination compares with other routes of infection.
