a total of  <dig> putative palmitoylation substrates were identified, more than  <dig> of which have not been previously suggested to be palmitoylated in past proteomic studies.
inhibition of tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation pharmacologically or by cysteine mutagenesis led to decreased cell surface expression and a decreased inflammatory response to microbial ligands.
here we sought to identify and compare the palmitoylated proteins in murine fibroblasts and dendritic cells.
here we validate the palmitoylation of several new proteins including toll-like receptors   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and nedd <dig>  palmitoylation of tlr <dig>  which was uniquely identified in dendritic cells, was mapped to a transmembrane domain-proximal cysteine.
