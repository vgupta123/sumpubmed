models from over  <dig>  <dig> organisms are encoded consistently in sbml, and are made freely available through biomodels database at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/path2models.
however, the majority of these models are still created de novo, based on literature mining and the manual processing of pathway data.
to increase the efficiency of model creation, the path2models project has automatically generated mathematical models from pathway representations using a suite of freely available software.
