the effect of vaccination against pcv <dig> with ingelvac circoflex vaccine was also investigated.
viruses were detected by pcr, rt-pcr and real-time pcr in the pooled tissue samples  of pigs with pmws  which were divided into three groups: suckling piglets, post-weaning pigs and fattening pigs.
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is an etiological agent of porcine circovirus diseases .
no healthy pig was found to be infected with prrsv, ptv or pbov <dig>  vaccination against pcv <dig> did not influence the prevalence of ttsuvs, but significantly protected pigs against multiple viral infections.
studies of viral co-infections in pmws pigs led often to controversial results.
simultaneous infection with ttsuv <dig> and pbov <dig> was frequently confirmed in pigs with pmws.
post-weaning pmws pigs were more often co-infected with viral pathogens than suckling or fattening pigs.
post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome  as the most important pcvd is considered a multifactorial disease.
co-infection with prrsv enforces clinical signs of pmws, the influence of other viral co-infections is not clear.
vaccination against pcv <dig> significantly reduced viral co-infections in pigs.
the impact of vaccination against pcv <dig> and the influence of age on the occurrence of single and multiple viral infections in pigs were also investigated.
between non-vaccinated pigs, the highest prevalence of individual viruses and multiple viral infections were found in diseased post-weaning and fattening animals with pmws.
