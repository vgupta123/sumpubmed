these results enable more accurate genome alignment, with reliability measures for local alignments and for individual aligned bases.
as our gold-standard of accuracy, we used genome alignments implied by multiple alignments of proteins and of structural rnas.
higher values of the x-drop parameter are not always better.
genome alignment depends on various mundane but critical choices, such as how to mask repeats and which score parameters to use.
we have assessed  <dig> combinations of score parameters for alignment of animal, plant, and fungal genomes.
surprisingly, there has been no large-scale assessment of these choices using real genomic data.
moreover, rigorous procedures to control the rate of spurious alignment have not been employed.
e-values accurately indicate the rate of spurious alignment, but only if tandem repeats are masked in a non-standard way.
