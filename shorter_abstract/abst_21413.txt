the isp has been well described in vertebrates and in a few invertebrate model organisms but remains largely unexplored in non-model invertebrates.
dappu_inr- <dig> has undergone extensive evolutionary divergence and lacks the conserved site of the catalytic domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase.
genes encoding for the dappu_inr are likely the result of three duplication events and bear some unusual features.
this domain is also absent in dappu_inr- <dig>  dappu_inr- <dig> is characterized by the absence of the cystein-rich region.
duplications of the insulin receptor genes might represent an important evolutionary innovation in daphnia as they are known to exhibit extensive phenotypic plasticity in body size and in the size of defensive structures in response to predation.
est analyses of cdna libraries revealed that the four receptors were differently expressed under various conditions.
this study is the first detailed genomic study of this pathway in a crustacean species, daphnia pulex.
the daphnia pulex draft genome sequence assembly was scanned for major components of the isp with a special attention to the insulin-like receptor.
major findings include a lower number of insulin-like peptides in daphnia as compared to other invertebrates and the presence of multiple insulin-like receptors , with four genes as opposed to a single one in other invertebrates.
dappu_inr- <dig> has a large insert and lacks the transmembranal domain in the Î²-subunit.
