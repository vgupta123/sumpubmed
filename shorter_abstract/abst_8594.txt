similarly, a high correlation was found between ireg <dig> expression and the rate of iron efflux from sh-sy5y cells.
in this work we characterized the response of sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons to a model of progressive iron accumulation.
although most of the components of the iron homeostasis machinery have been described in neurons, little is known about the particulars of their iron homeostasis.
we found that iron accumulation killed a large proportion of cells, but a sub-population became resistant to iron.
the surviving cells evoked an adaptative response consisting of increased synthesis of the iron-storage protein ferritin and the iron export transporter ireg <dig>  and decreased synthesis of the iron import transporter dmt <dig>  increased expression of ireg <dig> was further substantiated by immunocytochemistry and iron efflux experiments.
