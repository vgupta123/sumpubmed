remarkably, the mirna-star  of four mirnas are expressed at much higher levels than their corresponding mirnas, and their expression profiles are distinct from their corresponding mirna profiles during different developmental stages.
we identified  <dig> homologs of conserved mirnas,  <dig> species-specific and two antisense mirnas in the silkworm.
the silkworm  is one of the most suitable lepidopteran insects for studying the molecular aspects of metamorphosis because of its large size, availability of mutants and genome sequence.
most novel mirnas are preferentially expressed in pupae, whereas more than 95% of the conserved mirnas are dynamically regulated during different developmental stages.
deep sequencing of small rnas isolated from different stages of silkworm is a powerful tool not only for measuring the changes in mirna profile but also for discovering novel mirnas.
we generated small rna libraries from feeding larvae, spinning larvae, pupae and adults of b. mori and obtained ~ <dig>  million reads of 18- <dig> nt.
our results provided deeper insights into changes in conserved and novel mirna and mirna* accumulation during development.
sequence analysis identified  <dig> novel and  <dig> conserved mirnas.
in eukaryotes, micrornas  have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression.
