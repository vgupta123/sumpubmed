here we perform a large scale study over multiple data sets in order to demonstrate that the major reason for conflict between previous studies is the use of different but overlapping datasets.
does a relationship exist between a protein's evolutionary rate and its number of interactions?
we show that lack of correlation, between evolutionary rate and number of interactions in a data set is related to the error rate.
a correlation between number of interactions and evolutionary rate is observed but is dependent on the accuracy of the dataset being used.
we also demonstrate that the correlation is not an artifact of the underlying distributions of evolutionary distance and interactions and is therefore likely to be biologically relevant.
further to this, we consider the claim that the dependence is due to gene expression levels and find some supporting evidence.
a strong and positive correlation between the number of interactions and the age of a protein is also observed and we show this relationship is independent of expression levels.
