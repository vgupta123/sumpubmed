peritoneal sheath contractions  move over the ovary, from tip to base or vice versa, propagating down the oviduct.
neither affects the frequency of peritoneal sheath contractions.
we propose a new model of tissue-specific actions of octopamine, in which strengthening of peritoneal sheath contractions, coupled with relaxation of the oviduct, eases ovulation.
individual ovarioles are contained within a contractile epithelial sheath.
the common oviduct and uterus are innervated by two classes of neurons, one with similar morphology to those of the peritoneal sheath and another with repeated branches and axon endings similar to type i neuromuscular junctions.
no longitudinal muscle fibres are seen.
they all express tyrosine decarboxylase  and drosophila vesicular monoamine transporter .
despite a large number of drosophila mutants that cannot lay eggs, the way that the egg is moved along the reproductive tract from ovary to uterus is less well understood.
we remedy this with an integrative study on the reproductive tract muscles  in female flies.
the muscle fibres of the reproductive tract are circular and have complex bursting myogenic rhythms under octopaminergic neuromodulation.
neurons that innervate the peritoneal sheath and lateral oviduct have many varicosities and terminate in swellings just outside the muscles of the peritoneal sheath.
each ovary, consisting of 15– <dig> ovarioles, is surrounded by a contractile meshwork, the peritoneal sheath.
the amplitude of contractions of the peritoneal sheath increase in octopamine  but  <dig> μm tyramine has no effect.
each genital tract organ exhibits its own endogenous myogenic rhythm.
the oviduct and uterine walls contain a circular striated muscle layer.
both sheaths contain striated muscle fibres.
