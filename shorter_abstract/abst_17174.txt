functional annotations reveal that genes involved in informational processes are particularly prone to degradation.
we conclude that, although the majority of eukaryote lgts are single gene occurrences, they may be acquired in clusters of several genes that are subsequently cleansed of evolutionarily less advantageous genes.
the proposed donor is a close relative to the firmicute bacterium peptoniphilus harei.
high nucleotide sequence similarity between t. vaginalis strains, as well as to p. harei, and the absence of homologs in other trichomonas species, suggests that the transfer event took place after the radiation of the genus trichomonas.
a unique  <dig> kbp long fragment with  <dig> clustered genes  of prokaryote origin was identified in the sequenced genome of the protozoan parasite trichomonas vaginalis.
using a pcr based approach we confirmed the presence of the orthologous fragment in four additional t. vaginalis strains.
