lineage divergence dates implied that  <dig> blocks found in all three plant families were of cretaceous antiquity, while other family-specific blocks were much younger.
evolutionary processes in gene regulatory regions are major determinants of organismal evolution, but exceptionally challenging to study.
the blocks occurred in arrays whose relative order was absolutely conserved, confirming the existence of 'conserved modular arrays' in promoters.
dicot 5'-ncs contain conserved modular arrays of recurrent sequence blocks, which are coincident with functional elements.
dendrograms of evolutionary relations of the 5'-ncs were produced by several methods, including: cluster analysis using pairwise clz values; evolutionary trees of dialign sequence alignments; and cladistic analysis of conserved blocks.
identities of half of the blocks confirmed past rbcs research, including versions of the i-box, g-box, and gt- <dig> sites such as box ii.
blocks were also dated by formation of multigene families, using genome and coding sequence information.
sequences of up to  <dig> bp encompassing proximal promoter and 5'-untranslated regions were analyzed.
these blocks are amenable to evolutionary interpretation as hierarchies in which ancient, taxonomically widespread blocks can be distinguished from more recent, taxon-specific ones.
blocks could be assigned to evolutionary hierarchies based on taxonomic distribution and estimated age.
we explored the possibilities of evolutionary analysis of phylogenetic footprints in 5'-noncoding sequences  from  <dig> ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit  genes, from three dicot families .
we conducted phylogenetic footprinting by several alternative methods: generalized lempel-ziv complexity , multiple alignments with dialign and align-m, and the motif sampler gibbs sampling algorithm.
