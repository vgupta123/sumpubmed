the transcription gene regulatory network  for  <dig> orfs had a modular topology comprising five communities of highly interconnected nodes that separated key genes that are functionally related on different communities, possibly maximizing redundancy and grn robustness by compartmentalization of important functions.
core conserved functions showed expression synchronicity, distinct grn features and significantly less genetic diversity, consistent with evolutionary constraints imposed in key elements of biological systems.
the anticarsia gemmatalis multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  is a large double-stranded dna virus, whose genome may encode for  <dig> open reading frames .
this reduced genetic diversity also had a positive correlation with the importance of the gene in our estimated grn, supporting a relationship between phylogenetic data of baculovirus genes and network features inferred from expression data.
the structure of regulatory networks remains an open question in our understanding of complex biological systems.
genes with more than one copy in the genome had distinct expression profiles, which could indicate the acquisition of new functionalities.
we observed an earlier onset of the expression than previously reported for other baculoviruses, especially for genes involved in dna replication.
