these proteins were classified into following categories: sulfur metabolism, stress and defense response, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, nucleic acid metabolism, protein metabolism, cell transport, biological regulation and signal transduction, cell wall and cytoskeleton metabolism, and jasmonic acid  biosynthesis.
our results demonstrated that metabolic flexibility was more remarkable in c. sinenis than in c. grandis roots, thus improving the al-tolerance of c. sinensis.
the aims of this work were to determine the molecular mechanisms of plants to deal with al-toxicity and to identify differentially expressed proteins involved in al-tolerance.
the higher al-tolerance of c. sinensis may be related to several factors, including:  activation of sulfur metabolism;  greatly improving the total ability of antioxidation and detoxification;  up-regulation of carbohydrate and energy metabolism;  enhancing cell transport;  decreased  abundances of proteins involved in protein synthesis ;  keeping a better balance between protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation; and  increasing ja biosynthesis.
this provided the most integrated view of the adaptive responses occurring in al-toxicity roots.
we isolated  <dig> differentially expressed proteins from + al citrus roots.
c. sinensis was more tolerant to al-toxicity than c. grandis.
among these proteins,  <dig>  proteins only presented in c. sinensis , and  <dig> proteins were shared by the two species.
thereafter, we investigated citrus root protein profiles using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification .
seedlings of ‘xuegan’  and ‘sour pummelo’  were treated for 18 weeks with nutrient solution containing  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm alcl3 · 6h2o .
