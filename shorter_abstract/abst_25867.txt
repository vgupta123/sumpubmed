we re-analyzed two publically available small intestinal tumor transcriptomes using stringent quality control parameters and network-based approaches and validated expression of core secretory regulatory elements e.g., cpe, pcsk <dig>  secretogranins, including genes involved in depolarization e.g., scn3a, as well as transcription factors associated with neurodevelopment  and glucose homeostasis .
the candidate metastasis-associated transcription factor, st <dig>  was highly expressed .
further refinement of these analyses by rnaseq studies of large-scale databases will enable definition of individual master regulators and facilitate the development of novel tissue and blood-based tools to better understand diagnose and treat tumors.
an integrated cellular transcriptomic analysis of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors identified that they are regulated at a developmental level, have key activation of hypoxic pathways  as well as activation of genes involved in apoptosis and proliferation.
qpcr validation in an independent dataset , confirmed up-regulated expression of 87% of genes .
we hypothesized that stringent analysis of expression profiles as well as regulatory networks of the neoplastic cell would provide novel information that facilitates further delineation of the genomic basis of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors.
