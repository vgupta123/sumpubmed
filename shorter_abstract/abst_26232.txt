the symbiosis between corals and the dinoflagellate alga symbiodinium is essential for the development and survival of coral reefs.
two distinct symbiodinium its <dig> sequences  were retrieved from all p. damicornis colonies analysed.
our results are consistent with the occurrence of sexual recombination between symbiodinium types c <dig> and c <dig>  while the multiple-copy nature of the its <dig> dictates that the observed pattern of intra-genomic co-dominance may be a result of incomplete concerted evolution of intra-genomic polymorphisms, this is a less likely explanation given the occurrence of homogeneous cells of the c <dig> type.
conclusive evidence for inter-lineage recombination and introgression in this genus will require either direct observational evidence or a single-cell genotyping approach targeting multiple, single-copy loci.
using quantitative single-cell pcr, we enumerated dna polymorphisms in the symbionts of the reef-building coral pocillopora damicornis, and applied a model selection approach to explore the potential for recombination between coexisting symbiodinium populations.
however, the symbiont assemblage consisted of three distinct symbiodinium populations: cells featuring pure arrays of its <dig> type c <dig>  near-homogeneous cells of type c <dig> , and those with co-dominant c <dig> and c <dig> its <dig> repeats.
