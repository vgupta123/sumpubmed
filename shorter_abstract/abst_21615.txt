previous studies were successful in distinguishing several tumor types in binary problems.
the overall prediction accuracies were competitive in comparison to the most accurate results obtained by several previous studies on the same datasets and with other methods.
a jackknife-based supervised learning method called paired-samples test algorithm , coupled with a binary classification model based on linear regression, was proposed and applied to two well known and challenging datasets consisting of  <dig>  and  <dig>  tumor types.
the results showed that the proposed method improved the prediction accuracy of the test samples for the gcm dataset, especially when t-statistic was used in the primary feature selection.
for the nci <dig> dataset, the application of pst improved prediction accuracy when the numbers of used genes were relatively small .
the strengths were demonstrated in the application to two bench datasets.
furthermore, the relative confidence r provided a unique insight into the sources of the uncertainty shown in the statistical classification and the potential variants within the same tumor type.
as there are over a hundred types of cancers, and potentially even more subtypes, it is essential to develop multi-category methodologies for molecular classification for any meaningful practical application.
the use of gene expression profiling for the classification of human cancer tumors has been widely investigated.
we proposed a novel bagging method for the classification and uncertainty assessment of multi-category tumor samples using gene expression information.
