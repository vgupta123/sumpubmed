combined analysis of the genomic and transcriptomic data provides a comprehensive understanding of the responding mechanisms to the most abundant natural polysaccharides in a. fumigatus.
various saprotrophic microorganisms, especially filamentous fungi, can efficiently degrade lignocellulose that is one of the most abundant natural materials on earth.
it consists of complex carbohydrates and aromatic polymers found in the plant cell wall and thus in plant debris.
transcriptional responses of a. fumigatus z <dig> induced by sucrose, oat spelt xylan, avicel ph- <dig> and rice straw were compared.
aspergillus fumigatus z <dig> was isolated from compost heaps and showed highly efficient plant biomass-degradation capability.
this study provides a basis for further analysis of genes shown to be highly induced in the presence of polysaccharide substrates and also the information which could prove useful for biomass degradation and heterologous protein expression.
there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significantly differently expressed genes in xylan, cellulose and rice straw, respectively, when compared to sucrose as a control condition.
genome analysis revealed an impressive array of genes encoding cellulases, hemicellulases and pectinases involved in lignocellulosic biomass degradation.
