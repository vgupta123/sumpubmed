the switch occurs for a branch of the phylogenetic tree containing  <dig> species , while the remaining  <dig> species  are regulated by tbf <dig>
for each branch of the phylogenetic tree and each gene module, our algorithm finds a sub-group of co-regulated genes and a team of transcription factors that substitutes for another team of transcription factors.
that rap <dig> in saccharomyces cerevisiae substitutes for tbf1/cbf <dig> in candida albicans for ribosomal rp genes.
we have created a method  for detecting more complicated rewirings, where several transcription factors can substitute for one or more transcription factors in the regulation of a family of co-regulated genes.
many transcription factors can regulate a gene and our algorithm finds that in this example a “team”  of three transcription factors including rap <dig> substitutes for tbf <dig> for  <dig> genes.
there one transcription factor substitutes for another on some collection of genes.
