although both the receptor and the g protein generally maintain a fully functional state in such polypeptides, original observations made using a chimera between the β2-adrenergic receptor  and gαs indicated that the fusion to the α-subunit resulted in a marked reduction of receptor desensitization and down-regulation.
chimeric proteins obtained by the fusion of a g protein-coupled receptor  sequence to the n-terminus of the g protein α-subunit have been extensively used to investigate several aspects of gpcr signalling.
we conclude that the physical separation between receptor and gα is not necessary for the transit to early endosomes, but is an essential requirement for the correct post-endocytic sorting and recycling of the two proteins.
while most of the internalized β2ar returned rapidly to the plasma membrane, β2ar-gαs did not recycle, and the observed slow recovery for the fusion protein immunofluorescence was entirely accounted for by protein synthesis.
