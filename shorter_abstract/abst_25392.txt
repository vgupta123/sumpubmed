we speculate that cell cycle regulated phosphorylation of hdgf may play an important role in vascular cell proliferation.
wild type hdgf was phosphorylated in asynchronous cells and substitution of s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> to alanine each demonstrated a decrease in hdgf phosphorylation.
hepatoma-derived growth factor  is a nuclear protein that is a mitogen for a wide variety of cells.
hdgf-s103a was not mitogenic and facs analysis demonstrated a g2/m arrest in hdgf-s103a expressing cells, whereas cells expressing hdgf-s103d showed cell cycle progression.
a phospho-s <dig> hdgf specific antibody was developed and demonstrated mitosis-specific phosphorylation.
mass spectrometry based methods have identified hdgf as a phosphoprotein without validation or a functional consequence of this post-translational modification.
we found that hdgf in primary mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells  was phosphorylated.
