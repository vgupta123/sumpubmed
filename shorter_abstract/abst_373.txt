this contribution describes new extensions to the package, including a library of c++ classes for incorporation into other programs, a user-friendly graphical user interface written in java, and new unix-style text interfaces.
rna secondary structure prediction, using thermodynamics, can be used to develop hypotheses about the structure of an rna sequence.
rnastructure is a software package for rna secondary structure prediction and analysis.
it includes methods for secondary structure prediction , prediction of base pair probabilities, bimolecular structure prediction, and prediction of a structure common to two sequences.
the extensions to rnastructure serve to make rna secondary structure prediction user-friendly.
it uses thermodynamics and utilizes the most recent set of nearest neighbor parameters from the turner group.
the original graphical user interface for microsoft windows is still maintained.
