the top ranked canonical pathway contained signalling molecules common to various inflammatory/fibrotic pathways such as the transforming growth factor-β and tumour necrosis factor-α pathways.
these networks also contain molecules which are present in the canonical pathways of hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation and transforming growth factor-β signalling and were up regulated.
principal component analysis  and hierarchical classification of the signal intensity plots for the arrays showed primary clustering into two groups, healthy and atretic.
the two most significant networks also reflect this pattern of tissue remodelling/fibrosis gene expression.
oocytes mature in follicles surrounded by nurturing granulosa cells and all are enclosed by a basal lamina.
during growth, granulosa cells replicate and a large fluid-filled cavity  develops in the centre.
to better understand the molecular basis of follicular atresia, we undertook transcriptome profiling of granulosa cells from healthy  and atretic  bovine follicles at early antral stages .
these analyses and size-frequency plots of coefficients of variation of signal intensities revealed that the healthy follicles were more heterogeneous.
examining the differentially-expressed genes the most significantly affected functions in atretic follicles were cell death, organ development, tissue development and embryonic development.
in mammals, the number of primordial follicles far exceeds the numbers that ever ovulate and atresia or regression of follicles is a mechanism to regulate the number of oocytes ovulated and to contribute to the timing of ovulation.
atresia, on the other hand, not only involves cell death but clearly is an active process similar to wound healing.
small healthy antral follicles, which have a number of growth outcomes, exhibit greater variability in gene expression, particularly in genes associated with cell division and other growth-related functions.
