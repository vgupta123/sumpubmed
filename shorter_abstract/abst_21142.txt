we provide examples of how phush has been successfully employed to study the function of target genes in a number of cell types within in vitro and in vivo assays, including conditional gene knockdown in a murine model of brain cancer.
both pol ii and pol iii promoters have been successfully combined with a second expression cassette containing a codon-optimized tetracycline repressor and selectable marker.
these studies demonstrate the broad application potential of phush for conditional genetic engineering in mammalian cells.
we have therefore developed phush, an inducible expression system that allows regulated expression of shrna, mirna or cdna cassettes on a single viral vector.
