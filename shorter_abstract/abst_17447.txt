model analysis suggests that a conversion of graded inputâ€“output responses in single cells to digital responses at the population level is caused by a broad distribution of erk pathway activation thresholds brought about by cell-to-cell variability in protein expression.
surprisingly, we find that a simple mapk/erk-cascade model with negative feedback that displays graded, analog erk responses at a single cell level can explain the experimentally observed bimodality at the cell population level.
our results show that bimodal signaling response distributions do not necessarily imply digital  single cell signaling, and the interplay between protein expression noise and network topologies can bring about digital population responses from analog single cell dose responses.
thus, cells can retain the benefits of robustness arising from negative feedback, while simultaneously generating population-level on/off responses that are thought to be critical for regulating cell fate decisions.
cell-to-cell variability in protein expression can be large, and its propagation through signaling networks affects biological outcomes.
