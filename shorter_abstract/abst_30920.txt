however, because of keratinization and terminal differentiation it is not clear that these cells have an mrna profile representative of cervical tissue, and that the profile can distinguish the lesions targeted for early detection.
we used whole genome microarrays  to compare the transcription profiles from seven samples of normal exfoliated cells and one cervical tissue.
we also compared microarray results of samples from women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade  <dig>  to those from age and race matched women without significant abnormalities .
we used three microarray-adapted statistical packages to identify differential gene expression.
the findings encourage further exploration of gene expression using exfoliated cells to identify and validate applicable biomarkers.
we conclude that the gene expression profile of exfoliated cervical cells partially represents that of tissue and is complex enough to provide potential differentiation between disease and non-disease.
exfoliated cervical cells are used in cytology-based cancer screening and may also be a source for molecular biomarkers indicative of neoplastic changes in the underlying tissue.
