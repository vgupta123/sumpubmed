a pfam domain enrichment analysis revealed that protease- and transporter-related genes were enriched in the root + ovisac specific genes compared with the total transcriptome.
genes encoding various types of transporters, including amino acid, oligopeptide, bicarbonate, and sulfate/carboxylate transporters, were also expressed in root epidermal cells.
in addition, amino acid and other metabolite transporter genes were expressed in bacteriocytes.
twelve of these osedax mmp genes were expressed in the root epidermal cells.
expression of transporter genes in the host bacteriocytes suggests the presence of metabolic interaction between osedax and symbiotic bacteria.
the expression of various proteinase and transporter genes in the root epidermis supports the theory that the root epidermal cells are responsible for bone digestion and subsequent nutrient uptake.
the worms lack a digestive tract and mouth opening, and it has been suggested that osedax degrade vertebrate bones and uptake nutrients through acidification and secretion of enzymes from the root.
however, the molecular mechanisms and cells responsible for bone digestion and nutrient uptake are still unclear, and information on the metabolic interaction between osedax and symbiotic bacteria is limited.
these protease and transporter genes were first expressed in root tissues at the juvenile stage, when the root starts to develop.
symbiotic bacteria in the root tissue may have a crucial role in the metabolism of osedax.
