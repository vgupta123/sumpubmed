psi-blast divides a given msa into multiple blocks, for which sequence weights are calculated.
when the block width becomes very narrow, the sequence weight calculation can be odd.
our results demonstrate that the generation of narrow-width blocks during the sequence weight calculation is a critically important factor that restricts the psi-blast search performance.
psi-blast, an extremely popular tool for sequence similarity search, features the utilization of position-specific scoring matrix  constructed from a multiple sequence alignment .

we demonstrate that psi-blast indeed generates a significant fraction of blocks having width less than  <dig>  thereby degrading the psi-blast performance.
by preventing narrow blocks, psi-blastexb upgrades the psi-blast performance remarkably.
pssm allows the detection of more distant homologs than a general amino acid substitution matrix does.
we revised the code of psi-blast to prevent the blocks from being narrower than a given minimum block width .
an accurate estimation of the weights for sequences in an msa is crucially important for pssm construction.

when mbw is  <dig>  psi-blastexb notably outperforms psi-blast consistently for three independent benchmark sets.
