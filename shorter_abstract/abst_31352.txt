the average amino acid identity among salivary proteins is  <dig> %, while that for housekeeping proteins is  <dig> % , and the codon volatility of secreted proteins is significantly higher than those of housekeeping proteins.
comparison of the c. tarsalis sialotranscriptome with that of c. quinquefasciatus reveals accelerated evolution of salivary proteins as compared to housekeeping proteins.
mosquito saliva also potentiates the transmission of vector borne pathogens, including arboviruses.
culex tarsalis is a bird feeding mosquito vector of west nile virus closely related to c. quinquefasciatus, a mosquito relatively recently adapted to feed on humans, and the only mosquito of the genus culex to have its sialotranscriptome so far described.
a total of  <dig>  clones randomly selected from an adult female c. tarsalis salivary glands  cdna library were sequenced and used to assemble a database that yielded  <dig> clusters of related sequences,  <dig> of which were singletons.
several protein families previously found exclusive of mosquitoes, including only in the aedes genus have been identified in c. tarsalis.
interestingly, a protein family so far unique to c. quinquefasciatus, with  <dig> genes, is also found in c. tarsalis, indicating it was not a specific c. quinquefasciatus acquisition in its evolution to optimize mammal blood feeding.
saliva of adult female mosquitoes help sugar and blood feeding by providing enzymes and polypeptides that help sugar digestion, control microbial growth and counteract their vertebrate host hemostasis and inflammation.
