in a multivariable negative binomial regression model the number of seropositive animals in a flock decreased with increasing flock size  =  <dig> ; 95% ci:  <dig> ,  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) and was greater on farms where stray cats had access to animals’ water .
control and prophylactic measures must be adopted to improve the rearing system and the implementation of health promoting programmes in a joint effort between sheep farmers, farmers’ associations and veterinarians to inform about the means of transmission of the infection and for a better understanding of the disease.
sheep could be an important source of t. gondii infection in humans, since we estimate that between 25% and 43% of sheep in the district were seropositive.
small flock size and access of cats to water are potential risk factors for toxoplasma infection in sheep in the grosseto district in tuscany, italy.
overall animal-level seroprevalence, adjusted for sampling weights and test sensitivity and specificity, was  <dig> % .
in the positive flocks, median seroprevalence was  <dig> % .
serum samples from  <dig> milk sheep, in  <dig> dairy flocks representative of the southern area of the tuscany region, were tested for the presence of antibodies to toxoplasma gondii using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test .
at least one seropositive animal was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> flocks tested .
