gap junctions  are intercellular channels through which molecules smaller than 1 kda can diffuse, and they have been suggested as drug targets.
to develop chemical drugs acting on this target, a high-throughput screening  system for gj modulators is necessary.
we developed a new hts system for gj modulators.
when iodide was added, it was transported into donor cells by slc26a <dig>  diffused through the gjs to acceptor cells, and quenched the yfpql fluorescence.
the fluorescence of ln215-yfpql acceptor cells, when cultured alone, was not quenched by iodide.
this assay system consisted of donor and acceptor cells from ln <dig> glioma cells that expressed slc26a <dig> and yellow fluorescent protein-h148q/i152l , respectively.
this assay system also worked well in hos osteosarcoma cells with a z’ factor at 10 s of  <dig> .
however when donor and acceptor cells, or ln215-yfpql and ln215-i− cells, were mixed and plated, they formed gjs.
the quenching rate was optimal at a 2: <dig> mixture of donor and acceptor cells.
