based on characterizations of the genomic contexts of the lncrnas, we further showed that there were  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas acted via cis mechanisms, including sense intronic , overlapping , natural antisense transcripts , long intergenic non-coding rnas , and bidirectional .
taken together, our results suggest that meth can elicit global changes in lncrna expressions in the nac of sensitized mice that might be involved in meth-induced locomotor sensitization and addiction.
using high-throughput strand-specific complementary dna sequencing technology , here we examined the alterations in the lncrnas expression profile in the nucleus accumbens  of meth-sensitized mice.
we found that the expression levels of  <dig> known lncrnas  and  <dig> novel lncrna candidates  were significantly altered in the meth-sensitized mice.
gene ontology  and kegg pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the predicted cis- and trans- associated genes were significantly enriched during neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, learning and memory, and reward and addiction.
it has been reported that the aberrant expression of long non-coding rnas  is involved in cocaine and heroin addiction, yet the expression profile of lncrnas and their potential effects on methamphetamine -induced locomotor sensitization are largely unknown.
