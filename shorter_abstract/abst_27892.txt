aging increased p <dig> and samhd <dig> expression, gut microbiota lps production, and nf-κb activation; thereby, signifying that gut microbiota lps may accelerate inflamm-aging and samhd <dig> may be an inflamm-aging marker.
the lipopolysaccharide fraction of fecal lysates  from young or aged mice increased p <dig> and samhd <dig> expression and nf-κb activation in peritoneal macrophages from wild-type mice, in a tlr4-dependent manner.
however, lfls did not induce nf-κb activation and samhd <dig> expression in peritoneal macrophages from tlr4-deificent mice, whereas they significantly induced p <dig> expression.
nevertheless, p <dig> expression was induced more potently in macrophages from wt mice than in macrophages from tlr4-deficient mice.
a taxonomy-based analysis showed that aging resulted in increased prevalence of the phyla firmicutes and actinobacteria and a reduced prevalence of bacteroidetes and tenericutes, resulting in an increase in the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio.
this process is associated with age-related changes to immune homeostasis and gut microbiota.
we investigated the relationship between aging and gut microbiota lipopolysaccharide -inducible inflammation.
interestingly, the expression level of sterile α-motif domain- and hd domain-containing protein  <dig>  in the colon was higher in aged mice than in young mice, while cyclin-dependent kinase- <dig> and cyclin e levels were lower in aged mice than in young mice.
