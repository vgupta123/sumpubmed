we also show that the use of aspect plays an important role in the model.
in the biomedical domain, the desired information of a question  asked by biologists usually is a list of a certain type of entities covering different aspects that are related to the question, such as genes, proteins, diseases, mutations, etc.
hence it is important for a biomedical information retrieval system to be able to provide comprehensive and diverse answers to fulfill biologistsâ€™ information needs.
the proposed combination model which models aspects, terms, topic relevance and document novelty as potential functions is demonstrated to be effective in promoting ranking diversity as well as in improving relevance of ranked lists for genomics search.
moreover, the proposed model can integrate various different relevance and novelty measures easily.
in this paper, we propose a relevance-novelty combined model, named relnov model, based on the framework of an undirected graphical model.
it consists of two component models, namely the aspect-term relevance model and the aspect-term novelty model.
however, traditional retrieval models assume that the relevance of a document is independent of the relevance of other documents.
