biofilm production was detected in two non-clinical st <dig> and three st <dig> isolates from different origins showing variable virulence profiles.
biofilm production seems not to be directly correlated with their epidemiological success.
this study highlights the circulation of highly transmissible st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> variants among different settings.
high virulence scores were observed among st <dig>  and st <dig>  clones, particularly enriched in pap alleles, iha, kpsmtii-k <dig> and ompt, in contrast with st <dig>  isolates, exhibiting frequently fyua, malx and trat.
we aim to characterize inter- and intraclonal diversity of a broad sample  and their ability to adhere and form biofilm by both a modified quantitative biofilm producing assay and field emission scanning electron microscopy .
