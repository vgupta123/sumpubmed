rna interference  is a powerful tool to study gene function in organisms that are not amenable to classical forward genetics.
hence, together with the ease of comprehensively identifying genes by new generation sequencing, rnai is expanding the scope of animal species and questions that can be addressed in terms of gene function.
here we show in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum that rnai against tc-importin α <dig> leads to different phenotypes depending on the injected strain.
this is especially important for the increasing number of emerging model organisms that are being functionally investigated using rnai.
in the case of genetic mutants, the genetic background of the strains used is known to influence the phenotype while this has not been described for rnai experiments.
these results show that in rnai experiments strain specific differences have to be considered and that a proper documentation of the injected strain is required.
by quantitatively comparing phenotypes elicited by rnai knockdown of four different genes we show that there is no general difference in rnai sensitivity between these strains.
finally, we show that in case of tc-importin α <dig> the difference depends on the maternal genotype.
