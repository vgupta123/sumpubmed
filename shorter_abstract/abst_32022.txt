drp <dig> is the primary protein responsible for mitochondrial fission.
in hek-293t cells, inhibitors of autophagy increase total drp <dig> and levels of drp <dig> in the mitochondrial cellular fraction.
additionally these data suggest a mechanism, through drp <dig> downregulation, which may partly explain the ability of autophagy to have a neuroprotective effect.
perturbations of mitochondrial morphology and increased fission are seen in neurodegeneration.
these pharmacological and genetic approaches indicate that autophagy targets drp <dig> for lysosomal degradation.
we are able to decrease drp <dig> levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner with the potent neuronal autophagy inducer 10-ncp, as well as structurally related compounds.
