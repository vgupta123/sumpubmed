included l. innocua , l. monocytogenes , l. seeligeri , and l. ivanovii .
recovery of potentially pathogenic l. monocytogenes from raw fish and environment of open-air fish market samples in this study is a convincing evidence for the zoonotic potential of listeriosis.
isolates showed high resistance against tetracycline , penicillin g, and cephalothin .
besides, we observed significant resistance level to tetracycline , ampicillin , cephalothin, penicillin g, and streptomycin  in the l. monocytogenes isolates.
of the 43â€‰l. monocytogenes isolates,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  belonged to serovars 1/2a, 4b, and 1/2b, respectively.
the inla, inlb, inlc, inlj, acta, hlya, iap, plca, and prfa virulence-associated genes were detected in almost all of the l. monocytogenes isolates.
we found that tetm , teta , ampc , and pena  were the most prevalent antibiotic resistance genes in the l. monocytogenes isolates.
the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and characterization of listeria species and listeria monocytogenes isolated from raw fish and open-air fish market environments.
eight hundred and sixty two samples including raw fish and fish market environments  were collected from the open-air fish markets in the northern region of iran.
was isolated from 104/ <dig>  raw fish and 29/ <dig>  of samples from open-air fish market environment.
