finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a microarray dose-response study, to identify  <dig> Î²-estradiol sensitive genes in breast cancer cells that are induced at low concentrations.
in addition, we discuss the concept of the mixed-directional false discovery rate , and extend the general procedure to enable directional decisions for two-sided alternatives.
procedures generated from the framework are shown to maintain control of the ofdr and mdfdr, quantities that are especially relevant in the case of multiple hypothesis set testing.
simulation results also show that two of our new procedures achieve higher power than previous methods.
we applied the framework to the case of microarray time-course/dose-response experiments, and proposed three procedures for testing differential expression and making multiple directional decisions for each gene.
we adopt the concept of the overall false discovery rate  for controlling false discoveries on the hypothesis set level.
for example, in gene expression studies over ordered categories , interest is often in testing differential expression across several categories for each gene.
in complex large-scale experiments, in addition to simultaneously considering a large number of features, multiple hypotheses are often being tested for each feature.
the framework is easy to use and adaptable to various practical settings that frequently occur in large-scale experiments.
simulation studies confirm the control of the ofdr and mdfdr by the proposed procedures under independence and positive correlations across genes.
based on an existing procedure for identifying differentially expressed gene sets, we discuss a general two-step hierarchical hypothesis set testing procedure, which controls the overall false discovery rate under independence across hypothesis sets.
