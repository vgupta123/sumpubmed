in view of such diverse collection of genomes, revealing evolutionary trends and charting functional relationships of proteins remain challenging.
we propose that the expansion of tnap families in hymenoptera potentially contributes to the accelerated genome dynamics that characterize the wasp and ants.
at present, there are dozens of fully sequenced insect genomes that cover a range of habitats, social behavior and morphologies.
the highest variability among insects associates with the function of transposition and nucleic acids processes .
specifically, the wasp and ants have an order of magnitude more tnap families and proteins relative to species that belong to diptera .
by assigning annotations to hundreds of species-specific families, the functional diversity among species and between the major clades  is revealed.
we found that many species-specific families are associated with receptor signaling, stress-related functions and proteases.
an unsupervised clustering methodology combined with a comparative functional analysis unveiled proteomic signatures in the major clades of winged insects.
among all the tested species, ants are characterized by an exceptionally high rate of family gain and loss.
