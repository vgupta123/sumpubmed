we have compiled a screen that enables the identification of new sites of site-selective editing, primarily in coding sequences.
five of these sites are situated in genes coding for the neuron-specific rna binding proteins hub and hud.
we further evaluated the results of the explorative screen by determining which transcripts were enriched for a-g mismatches between the genomic template and the expressed sequence since the editing product, inosine , is read as guanosine  by the translational machinery.
lastly, we refined the results from the explorative screen using a novel scoring scheme based on characteristics for known a-to-i edited sites.
the extent of editing in the final candidate genes was verified using total rna from mouse brain and  <dig> sequencing.
several bioinformatic approaches have previously been used to find novel sites of adar mediated a-to-i rna editing in human.
editing was also verified at several other novel sites within candidates predicted to be edited.
to identify candidate sites of rna editing, we first performed an explorative screen based on rna structure and genomic sequence conservation.
