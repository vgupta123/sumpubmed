evaluation of rna quality is essential for gene expression analysis, as the presence of degraded samples may influence the interpretation of expression levels.
we tested and compared rna yields, total rna integrity, mrna integrity and stability in these two protocols according to the duration of storage.
a long time tissue storage had little effect on the total rna and mrna integrity but induced changes in the transcript levels of stress-responsive genes as tnf-alpha or cox <dig> after  <dig> h. the loss of the rna integrity was higher in the placental tissues that underwent a dissection before rna processing by comparison with those transferred directly into rna later™ solution.
particularly, qrt-pcr data can be affected by rna integrity and stability.
rapid tissue handling without dissection and using rna-stabilizing solution  is a prerequisite to obtain suitable rna integrity and stability.
this study shows that placental samples can be stored at + 4°c up to  <dig> h before rna extraction without altering rna quality.
