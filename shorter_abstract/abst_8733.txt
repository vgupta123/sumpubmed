this metric estimates the combined effects of technical and environmental variance, as well as poisson sampling noise by isolating each component.
to address this, we developed a statistical approach to establish significance bounds for inter-species differential expression in rna-seq data based on the variance measured across biological replicates.
we quantified gene expression with whole-transcriptome sequencing in four diploid, prototrophic strains of saccharomyces species grown under the same condition to investigate the evolution of gene expression.
we provide an improved methodology for measuring gene expression changes in evolutionary diverged species using rna seq, where experimental artifacts can mimic evolutionary effects.
the evolution of gene expression is a challenging problem in evolutionary biology, for which accurate, well-calibrated measurements and methods are crucial.
despite a paucity of large expression changes, we found a strong correlation between the variance of gene expression change and species divergence .
