in the future we can expect a northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus cyclamen.
for many species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species are considered to be at high risk of extinction.
over the next  <dig> years we predict a northward shift in the area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable.
even without human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive climate change even if many species are lost.
the ancestral cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal mediterranean climate characteristic of dry summers and wet winters.
a next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective.
there is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification.
the area of climatic suitability for every cyclamen species is predicted to decrease.
human-assisted establishment of cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments.
the impact of global climate change on plant distribution, speciation and extinction is of current concern.
future bioclimatic niches, based on bioclim and maxent models, are examined with reference to a future climate scenario for the 2050s.
this risk is examined from a phylogenetic perspective.
examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel interpretations of these models.
we demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that most cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging, geographically expansive, species.
