this work exposes what may be a general feature of evolutionary conflicts fought by pathogen antagonists at host protein-protein interaction interfaces involved in immune signaling: the emergence of receptor-binding ligand epitopes capable of buffering amino acid variation.
such a striking signature of selective pressure suggested either recurrent episodes of pathogen antagonism or ligand/receptor co-evolution.
our results -- reminiscent of clustered positively selected sites revealing functionally important residues at host-virus interaction interfaces -- are consistent with il <dig> having evolved to avoid recurrent pathogen antagonism, while maintaining the capacity to bind and signal through its cognate receptor.
to test the latter possibility, we performed detailed functional analysis of il <dig> allotypes expressed by mus musculus musculus and mus musculus castaneus, which happen to differ at  <dig> residues  in and adjacent to the site  <dig> epitope that binds the il4rÎ± subunit shared by the type i and type ii il <dig> receptors.
this analysis revealed evidence of diversifying selection at  <dig> residues, clustered in epitopes responsible for il <dig> binding to its type i and type ii receptors.
we show that this intra-species variation affects the ability of il <dig> neither to bind il <dig> receptor alpha  nor to signal biological responses through its type i receptor.
