scenarios include the quantification of 3d images with poor signal-to-noise ratios or the generation of so-called ground truth segmentations that are used to evaluate the accuracy of automated segmentation methods.
depending on the degree of user interactions, segmentation methods can be divided into manual, automated or semi-automated approaches.
image segmentation is a crucial step in quantitative microscopy that helps to define regions of tissues, cells or subcellular compartments.
we have developed gebiss; an imagej plugin for the interactive segmentation, visualisation and quantification of 3d microscopic image stacks.
gebiss was developed as a cross-platform imagej plugin and is freely available on the web at http://imaging.bii.a-star.edu.sg/projects/gebiss/.
