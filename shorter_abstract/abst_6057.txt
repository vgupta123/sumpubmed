moreover, these data allowed us to identify unique signatures of genes for which as is misregulated in the different types of hcc.
finally, using rna interference and a reverse transcription-pcr screening platform, we examined the implications of cellular proteins involved in the splicing of transcripts involved in apoptosis and demonstrate the potential contribution of these proteins in as control.
our analysis allowed the identification of  <dig> unique transcripts for which as is misregulated in hbv-associated hcc, while  <dig> are unique to hcv-associated hcc,  <dig> to hbv&hcv-associated hcc, and  <dig> to virus-free hcc.
moreover, we demonstrate that the expression pattern of the rna splicing factor hnrnpc in hcc tissues significantly correlates with patient survival.
these findings provide insights into the molecular differences between various types of hepatocellular carcinoma .
this study provides the first comprehensive portrait of global changes in the rna splicing signatures that occur in hepatocellular carcinoma.
in the present study, alterations to the global rna splicing landscape of cellular genes were investigated in a large-scale screen from  <dig> liver tissue samples using high-throughput rna sequencing data.
we also show that the expression of the hbx protein from hbv leads to modifications in the as profiles of cellular genes.
our study identifies modifications in the as patterns of transcripts encoded by more than  <dig> genes such as tumor suppressor genes, transcription factors, and kinases.
dysregulations in alternative splicing  patterns have been associated with many human diseases including cancer.
