here we describe a robust, yet facile method, which we named carrier chip-seq , for use on limited cell amounts.
furthermore, we showed that the differences observed between small-scale chip-seq data and encode data are largely to be due to lab-to-lab variability rather than operating on a reduced scale.
furthermore, our strategy of a dna-free carrier can be adapted to most chip-seq protocols.
our results show that cchip-seq successfully recapitulates bulk data.
for example, applying chip-seq to histone modifications such as h3k4me <dig> has facilitated generating epigenomic maps of putative enhancers.
encode data are the reference standard in the field and have been generated starting from tens of million of cells.
we compared cchip-seq data to data generated as part of the encode project.
chip-seq is highly utilized for mapping histone modifications that are informative about gene regulation and genome annotations.
cchip-seq employs a dna-free histone carrier in order to maintain the working chip reaction scale, removing the need to tailor reactions to specific amounts of cells or histone modifications to be assayed.
we have applied our method to three different histone modifications, h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in the k <dig> cell line, and h3k4me <dig> in h <dig> hescs.
we successfully obtained epigenomic maps for these histone modifications starting with as few as  <dig>  cells.

the underlying principle of our strategy makes it suitable for being applied to a vast range of chromatin modifications without requiring expensive optimization.
