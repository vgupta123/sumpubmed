in total,  <dig> and  <dig> significant loci were identified and these loci explained an average of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance in two environments, respectively, and  <dig> of  <dig>  loci were detected across the two environments.
known  and new significant loci showed pleiotropy and gene linkage.
the pyramid effect of the elite alleles indicated that these significant loci could be beneficial for rice plant architecture improvements in the future.
finally,  <dig> elite varieties were chosen as breeding donors for further rice plant architectural modifications.
future research will focus on the biological validation of the candidate genes, and elite varieties will also be of interest in genome selection and breeding by design.
this study detected multiple novel loci and candidate genes related to rice morphological traits, and the work demonstrated that genome-wide association studies are powerful strategies for uncovering the genetic variations of complex traits and identifying candidate genes in rice, even though the linkage disequilibrium decayed slowly in self-pollinating species.
expression-level analyses identified four candidate genes as the most promising regulators of tiller angle.
genome-wide association studies were performed to uncover the genotypic and phenotypic variations using a mixed linear model.
elite plant morphological traits should include compact plant type, short stature, few unproductive tillers, thick and sturdy stems and erect leaves.
in addition, a long genome region covering ~ <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> was identified, which may be critical for rice leaf architecture because of a high association with flag leaf length and the ratio of flag leaf length and width.
the ideal plant architecture is considered to be critical to enhance rice yield.
for the  <dig> loci,  <dig> candidate genes were predicted in a 200-kb region .
to reveal the genetic variations of important morphological traits,  <dig> germplasm accessions were genotyped using the illumina custom-designed array containing  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  and phenotyped in two independent environments.
