this is the first confirmation by statistical test of differing selection intensities among self-incompatibility alleles from different populations or species.
in contrast, the genus solanum did not undergo a restriction of s-locus diversity and its s-alleles are generally much older.
because recovery from reduced s-locus diversity should involve increased selection, we employ a statistical framework to ask whether s-locus selection intensities are higher in physalis than solanum.
maximum-likelihood and bayesian coalescent methods found higher intensities of selection and more sites under significant positive selection in the  <dig> physalis s-rnase alleles than the  <dig> from solanum.
relatively recent diversification of s-alleles has occurred in the genus physalis following a historical restriction of s-allele diversity.
because different s-rnase lineages diversify in physalis and solanum, we also ask whether different sites are under selection in different lineages.
a random effects likelihood method that examines data from both taxa jointly confirmed higher selection intensities in physalis, but did not find different proportions of sites under selection in the two datasets.
likelihood and bayesian methods provide a statistical approach to testing differential selection across populations or species.
highest posterior densities of dn/ds  estimates show that the strength of selection is greater for physalis at  <dig> codons.
clade-specific likelihood models indicated some codons were under greater selection in background solanum lineages than in specific lineages of physalis implying that selection on sites may differ among lineages.
a nested maximum likelihood method was more conservative, but still found  <dig> sites with greater selection in physalis.
