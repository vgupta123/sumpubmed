lantibiotics are post-translationally modified, ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides with a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.
initial screening revealed that polymyxin b and polymyxin e  exhibited synergistic activity with lacticin  <dig>  checkerboard assays were performed against a number of strains, including both gram positive and gram negative species.
the resultant fractional inhibitory concentration  index values established that, while partial synergy was detected against gram positive targets, synergy was obvious against gram negative species, including cronobacter and e. coli.
combining lacticin  <dig> with low levels of a polymyxin could provide a means of broadening target specificity of the lantibiotic, while also reducing polymyxin use due to the lower concentrations required as a result of synergy.
