numerical experiments indicate that the new threading application offers template detection abilities and provides much better alignments than other methods.
the comparative modeling approach to protein structure prediction inherently relies on a template structure.
bioshell threading software is a versatile tool for aligning protein structures, protein sequences or sequence profiles and query sequences to a template structures.
before building a model such a template protein has to be found and aligned with the query sequence.
