in contrast, in higher perceived risk areas , the risk of breakdown is defined by the history of disease and the probability of badger occurrence.
the results suggest that significant gains in btb control could be made by targeting herds in low incidence areas that import the greatest number of cattle from high incidence areas.
despite differences in the management of btb across different countries of gb , we found no significant differences in btb risk at the national level after these other factors had been taken into account.
the continuing expansion of high incidence areas of bovine tuberculosis  in great britain  raises a number of questions concerning the determinants of infection at the herd level that are driving spread of the disease.
we compare the significance of these different risk factors in high and low incidence areas .
in areas with lower perceived risk , the risk of breaking down is largely determined by the number of animals that a herd buys in from high incidence areas.
