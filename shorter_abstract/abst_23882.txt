the identification of a distinct pentameric sequence in a significant insulin-signaling pathway protein suggests a possible identity for the lmwcr peptide.
this identification clarifies directions for further investigation of lmwcr peptide fractions, chromium bio-coordination chemistry and a possible role in the insulin signaling pathway.
the amino acid composition of a low molecular weight chromium binding peptide , isolated from bovine liver, is reportedly e:g:c:d::4:2:2: <dig>  though its sequence has not been discovered.
a broader search for pentameric sequences  corresponding to the stoichiometric ratio e:d:g:c::2:1:1: <dig>  within the set of human proteins and the set of proteins in, or related to, the insulin signaling pathway, yields a match at an acidic region in the Î±-subunit of the insulin receptor .
there is some controversy surrounding the exact biochemical forms and the action of cr in biological systems; the topic has been the subject of many experimental reports and continues to be investigated.
a genomic search of the non-redundant database for all possible decapeptides of the reported composition yields three exact matches, edgeecdcge, dgeecdcgee and ceggceedde.
a synthetic peptide derived from this sequence binds chromium and forms a metal-peptide complex that has properties matching those reported for isolated lmwcr and cr-containing peptide fractions.
the search for an acidic decameric sequence indicates that lmwcr may not be a contiguous sequence.
implications for models of chromium action in the insulin-signaling pathway are discussed.
