macromolecular structures are modeled by conformational optimization within experimental and knowledge-based restraints.
rna sampling is demonstrated by rebuilding a protein-rna interface.
this approach has been used successfully for protein loop modeling, comparative modeling and electron density fitting in x-ray crystallography.
ability to construct arbitrary ligands is used in sampling protein-ligand interfaces within electron density.
finally, secondary structure and shape information derived from em are combined to generate multiple conformations of a protein consistent with the observed density.
