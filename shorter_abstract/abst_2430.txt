the level of hypotension is a major determinant of the severity of hepatic and renal dysfunction and of the inflammatory response arising during post-ischemic hemorrhagic shock resuscitation.
to evaluate whether the level of hypotension during hemorrhagic shock may influence the oxidative and inflammatory responses developed during post-ischemic resuscitation.
fifteen rabbits were equally allocated into three groups: sham-operated ; bled within  <dig> minutes to mean arterial pressure  of  <dig> mmhg ; bled within  <dig> minutes to map of  <dig> mmhg .
resuscitation was performed by reinfusing shed blood with two volumes of ringer's lactate and blood was sampled for estimation of serum levels aminotransferases, creatinine, tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig>  malondialdehyde  and total antioxidant status  and for the determination of oxidative burst of polymorhonuclears  and mononuclear cells .
no differences were found between two groups regarding serum mda and tas and oxidative burst on pmns and mcs but both groups were different to group sham.
measured cytokines, mda and cellular oxidative burst of groups, shock- <dig> and shock- <dig> were higher than group sham within the first  <dig> minutes after start of resuscitation.
serum ast of group shock- <dig> was higher than that of group shock- <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes after start of resuscitation; serum creatinine of group shock- <dig> was higher than group shock- <dig> at  <dig> minutes.
serum concentrations of il-1β, il- <dig> and tnf-α of group shock- <dig> were higher than group shock- <dig> at  <dig> minutes .
