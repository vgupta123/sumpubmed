genome-wide association studies  have identified  <dig> crc risk variants.
these two snps are located near the slc5a <dig> and dusp <dig> loci, respectively, which could be good functional candidates for the association signals.
we have performed the first crc gwas in a southern european population and by these means we were able to identify two new susceptibility variants at 1p <dig> and 8p <dig> loci.
we therefore believe that these two markers constitute good candidates for crc susceptibility loci and should be further evaluated in other larger datasets.
moreover, we highlight that were these two snps true susceptibility variants, they would constitute a decrease in the crc missing heritability fraction.
moreover, these signals have only been inspected in populations of northern european origin.
thus, we followed the same approach in a spanish cohort of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls.
