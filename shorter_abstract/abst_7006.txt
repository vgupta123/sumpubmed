our results further show that genetic changes affecting genes other than tbx <dig> must be responsible for the complete loss of forelimbs in moa.
an alternatively spliced exon  <dig> for tbx <dig> that is expressed specifically in the forelimb region was shown to be almost identical between moa and ostrich, suggesting that, as well as being fully functional, tbx <dig> is likely to have been expressed normally in moa since divergence from their flighted ancestors, approximately  <dig> mya.
in addition we show that missexpression of moa tbx <dig> in the hindlimb of chicken embryos results in the formation of forelimb features, suggesting that tbx <dig> was fully functional in wingless moa.
the results suggests that, as in mice, moa tbx <dig> is necessary for the induction of forelimbs, but is not sufficient for their outgrowth.
amongst birds, a single order, dinornithiformes, comprising the extinct wingless moa of new zealand, are unique in having no skeletal evidence of forelimb-like structures.
