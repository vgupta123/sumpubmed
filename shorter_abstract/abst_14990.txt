here, we demonstrate that a compendium of genomic signatures can be used to classify the plant abiotic stress phenotype in arabidopsis according to the architecture of the transcriptome, and then be linked with gene coexpression network analysis to determine the underlying genes governing the phenotypic response.
using this approach, we confirm the existence of known stress responsive pathways and marker genes, report a common abiotic stress responsive transcriptome and relate phenotypic classification to stress duration.
such information is critical to current and future investigations in plant biology and, in particular, to evolutionary ecology, where a mechanistic understanding of adaptive physiological responses to abiotic stress can provide researchers with a tool of great predictive value in understanding species and population level adaptation to climate change.
indeed much progress has been made in this area, particularly in biomedicine where functional genomic information can be used to determine the physiological state  and predict phenotypic outcome .
ecology currently lacks an analogous approach where genomic information can be used to diagnose the presence of a given physiological state  and then predict likely phenotypic outcomes .
linking genomic signatures to gene coexpression analysis provides a unique method of relating an observed plant phenotype to changes in gene expression that underlie that phenotype.
