molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dynamic behaviour of the docked complexes and the molecular interactions between the screened compounds and the ligand binding residues of gcgr were analysed in detail.
the top scoring compounds were also compared with already documented gcgr inhibitors- mk- <dig> and ly <dig> for their binding affinity and other adme properties.
interaction of the small peptide hormone glucagon with glucagon receptor  stimulates the release of glucose from the hepatic cells during fasting; hence gcgr performs a significant function in glucose homeostasis.

in the present study, a large library of natural compounds was screened against  <dig> transmembrane domain of gcgr to identify novel therapeutic molecules that can inhibit the binding of glucagon with gcgr.
inhibiting the interaction between glucagon and its receptor has been reported to control hepatic glucose overproduction and thus gcgr has evolved as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of type ii diabetes mellitus.
this study contributes evidence for application of these compounds as prospective small ligand molecules against type ii diabetes.
