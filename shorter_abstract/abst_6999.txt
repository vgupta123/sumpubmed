very interestingly, structural superimposition of hutz and its homologous protein hugz, a heme oxygenase from helicobacter pylori, exhibited a structural mismatch of one amino acid residue in β <dig> of hutz, although residues involved in this region are highly conserved in both proteins.
we report the first crystal structure of hutz in a homodimer determined at  <dig>  Å resolution.
this mismatch initiates more divergent structural characteristics towards their c-terminal regions, which are essential features for the heme-binding of hugz as a heme oxygenase.
however, no heme oxygenase activity has been observed with this protein.
hutz’s deficiency in heme oxygenase activity might derive from its residue shift relative to the heme oxygenase hugz.
the hutz structure adopted a typical split-barrel fold.
derived homologous models of different single point variants with model evaluations suggested that pro <dig> of hutz, corresponding to phe <dig> of hugz, might have been the main contributor to the structural mismatch.
through a docking study and site-directed mutagenesis, a heme-binding model for the hutz dimer is proposed.
