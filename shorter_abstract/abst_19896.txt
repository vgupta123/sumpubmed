massively parallel sequencing of different fruit cdna collections has provided large scale information about the structure and putative function of gene transcripts accumulated during fruit development.
comparative transcript profiling allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes with potential relevance in regulating the fruit metabolism and phenolic content during ripening.
despite its primary economic importance, genomic information on olive tree is still lacking.
fruits of coratina, a widely cultivated variety characterized by a very high phenolic content, and tendellone, an oleuropein-lacking natural variant, were used as starting material for monitoring the transcriptome.
raw sequence data were processed using a four step pipeline procedure and data were stored in a relational database with a web interface.
