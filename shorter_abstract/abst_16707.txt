in transgenic maize, the scbv-im promoter was shown to be comparable in strength to the maize ubiquitin  <dig> promoter in young leaf and root tissues.
the scbv-im enhancer can activate transcription upstream or downstream of genes and in either orientation.
enhancer sequences were identified and shown to increase the activity of a heterologous truncated promoter.
these enhancer sequences were shown to be more active when arrayed in  <dig> copy arrays than in  <dig> or  <dig> copy arrays.
transcriptional enhancers have been used to enhance expression of specific promoters in transgenic plants and in activation tagging studies to help elucidate gene function.
a transcriptional enhancer from the sugarcane bacilliform virus - ireng maleng isolate  that can cause increased transcription when integrated into the the genome near maize genes has been identified.
transcriptional enhancers are able to increase transcription from heterologous promoters when placed upstream, downstream and in either orientation, relative to the promoter.
the promoter was dissected to identify sequences that confer high activity in transient assays.
when the enhancer array was transformed into maize plants it caused an increase in accumulation of transcripts of genes near the site of integration in the genome.
