transformants were isolated, and the transformed kanamycin resistance gene  was detected from the plasmid dna extracts of the recombinant strains by pcr and was confirmed by restriction digestions.
this study aims to develop a genetic transfer system for thermotoga spp.
a lack of genetic tools has hampered the investigation and application of these organisms.
a thermotoga-e. coli shuttle vector pdh <dig> was constructed using prq <dig>  a cryptic mini-plasmid found in t. sp.
rq <dig>  plasmid pdh <dig> was introduced to t. maritima and t. sp.
a heterologous kan gene is functionally expressed and stably maintained in thermotoga.
the transformed dna was stably maintained in both thermotoga and e. coli even without the selective pressure.
thermotoga are transformable by multiple means.
methods for preparing and handling thermotoga solid cultures under aerobic conditions were optimized.
