the ion torrent pgm is a popular benchtop sequencer that shows promise in replacing conventional sanger sequencing as the gold standard for mutation detection.

our analysis revealed that false negative indels could be generated by ts under both default calling parameters and parameters adjusted for maximum sensitivity.
despite the pgm’s reported high accuracy in calling single nucleotide variations, it tends to generate many false positive calls in detecting insertions and deletions , which may hinder its utility for clinical genetic testing.
however, indel calling with the same data using the open source variant callers, gatk and samtools showed that false negatives could be minimised with the use of appropriate bioinformatics analysis.
however, the variant caller of ts exhibits a lower sensitivity than gatk and samtools.
recently, the proprietary analytical workflow for the ion torrent sequencer, torrent suite , underwent a series of upgrades.
in our best case scenario that involved the tmap aligner and samtools, we achieved 100% sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity and 29% false discovery rate  in indel calling from all  <dig> samples, which is a good performance for mutation screening using pgm.
our findings demonstrate that although indel calling from pgm sequences may appear to be noisy at first glance, proper computational indel calling analysis is able to maximize both the sensitivity and specificity at the single base level, paving the way for the usage of this technology for future clinical genetic testing.
furthermore, we identified two variant calling measures, quality-by-depth  and variation of the width of gaps and inserts , which substantially reduced false positive indels, including non-homopolymer associated errors without compromising sensitivity.
