by utilizing a graph representation of protein data, random walk techniques have performed well in sequence classification and functional prediction; however, this method has not yet been applied to protein localization.
we propose a graph theory model for predicting protein localization using data generated in yeast and gram-negative  bacteria.
this classification issue thus involves predicting labels in a dataset with a limited number of labeled data points available.
accordingly, we propose a novel classifier in the site prediction of proteins based on random walks on a graph.
we tested the performance of our classifier on the two datasets, optimizing the model training parameters by varying the laziness values and the number of steps taken during the random walk.
this study presents a new classifier derived from the random walk technique and applies this classifier to investigate the cellular localization of proteins.
using 10-fold cross-validation, we achieved an accuracy of above 61% for yeast data and about 93% for gram-negative bacteria.
