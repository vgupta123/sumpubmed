the svm approach is well suited to the ao prediction problem, and yields a prediction accuracy superior to previous methods.
we propose a two-stage strategy to develop an optimal model:  feature selection using correlation analysis, mutual information, and svm-based recursive feature elimination , and  ao prediction using standard and profiled svm formulations.
this method yielded an optimal subset of  <dig> representative features, which were all related to energy and sequence motifs.
in the first stage, the svm-rfe technique was most efficient and robust in the presence of low number of samples and high input space dimension.
the profiled svm produced the best results  and predicted high  and low efficacy  aos with a success rate of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which is better than by previous approaches.
a web server for ao prediction is available online at .
the profiled svm was found to perform better than the standard svm, suggesting that it could lead to improvements in other prediction problems as well.
this paper presents the use of support vector machines  for prediction and analysis of antisense oligonucleotide  efficacy.
