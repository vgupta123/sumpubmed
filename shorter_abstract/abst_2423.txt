to understand the genesis of the pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis within a genus where the majority of species are harmless environmental organisms, we have used genome sequence data from  <dig> mycobacteria to look for evidence of horizontal gene transfer  associated with the emergence of pathogenesis.
next, we performed alignment searches for the  <dig> proteins of m. tuberculosis h37rv against  <dig> other mycobacterial genomes, generating a matrix of  <dig> comparisons, to look for genetic elements that were uniquely found in m. tuberculosis and closely-related pathogenic mycobacteria.
m. tuberculosis emerged through vertical inheritance along with the step-wise addition of genes acquired via hgt events, a process that may more generally describe the evolution of other pathogens.
more recently, analysis across species has become feasible, especially in genera where genome sequencing projects of multiple species have been initiated.
to assign when foreign genes were likely acquired, we designed a bioinformatic program called mycohit  to analyze these data in conjunction with the mlsa-based phylogeny.
in the past decade, the availability of complete genome sequence data has greatly facilitated comparative genomic research aimed at addressing genetic variability within species.
the bioinformatic screen predicted that  <dig> genes had been acquired by hgt at different phylogenetic strata; these included genes coding for metabolic functions and modification of mycobacterial lipids.
