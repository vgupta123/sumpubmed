comparative analysis showed that the structure and evolutionary patterns of the i <dig> locus vary considerably between potato and tomato.
its high divergence was partly due to frequent sequence exchanges between homologues.
the i <dig> homologues from different solanaceae species usually do not have orthologous relationship, due to duplication, deletion and frequent sequence exchanges.
we hypothesized that mir <dig> and mir <dig> might have facilitated the expansion of the i <dig> family in solanaceae species, since they can minimize their potential toxic effects by down-regulating their expression.
several resistance traits, including the i <dig> resistance against tomato fusarium wilt, were mapped to the long arm of chromosome  <dig> of solanum.
sequence analysis showed that mir <dig> was originated after the divergence of solanaceae.
at least  <dig> sequence exchanges were detected among  <dig> tomato i <dig> homologues, but sequence exchanges between i <dig> homologues in potato is less frequent.
