pro-inflammatory signals can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of adherens junction proteins.
redox-sensitive kinase; pyk <dig> activation led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin and β-catenin, leading to disruption of junctional assembly.
the dissociation of tyrosine phosphatases ve-ptp and shp <dig> from cadherin complex resulted into increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin and β-catenin in hiv- <dig> tat c treated hbmvecs.
western blotting has been used to study the expression levels and co-immunoprecipitation has been used to study the interactions among adherens junction proteins.
human brain microvascular endothelial cells  are integral part of the blood brain barrier.
post-translational modifications of adherens junction proteins regulate the permeability of human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
trans-endothelial electrical resistance and fluorescent dye migration assay have been used to check the permeability of hbmvecs.
unrestricted phosphorylation of junctional proteins in hbmvecs, in response to hiv- <dig> tat c protein; leads to the disruption of junctional complexes and increased endothelial permeability.
