our results demonstrate that this line represents a convenient tool to capture the dynamics of otx <dig> gene expression from early embryonic stages to adulthood.
we generated a new mouse line harbouring an insertion of the gfp gene within the otx <dig> coding sequence to monitor the gene activity while preserving most of its functions.
this opens up the way to live imaging of a highly dynamic actor of brain development and can be adapted to any mutant background to probe for genetic interaction between otx <dig> and the mutated gene.
