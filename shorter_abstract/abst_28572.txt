this study demonstrates that v-cycle activity is triggered by several abiotic stressors even when they occur in an absolute absence of light, leading to a decrease in fv/fm.
in the violaxanthin  cycle, v is de-epoxidized to zeaxanthin  when strong light or light combined with other stressors lead to an overexcitation of photosystems.
we have shown that besides desiccation, other factors such as immersion, anoxia and high temperature also induced v-de-epoxidation in darkness.
current results suggest that both violaxanthin de-epoxidase  and zeaxanthin-epoxidase  have a basal constitutive activity even in darkness, being ze inhibited under stress.
this inhibition leads to z accumulation.
the implication of the redox-state of the plastoquinone-pool and of the differential activity of v-cycle enzymes on v-de-epoxidation in darkness was also examined.
