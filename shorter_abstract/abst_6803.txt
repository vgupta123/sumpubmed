the topological structure of the wiring of the mammalian brain cortex plays an important role in shaping the functional dynamics of large-scale neural activity.
the kuramoto model was used to simulate interaction of cortical brain areas by means of coupled phase oscillators—with anatomical connections between regions derived from diffusion weighted imaging and module assignment of brain regions based on empirically determined resting-state data.
here, we examined the theoretical role of anatomical hubs and their wiring in brain dynamics.
our results converge on anatomical hubs having a leading role in intermodular synchronization and integration in the human brain.
our findings show that synchrony among hub nodes was higher than any module’s intramodular synchrony , suggesting that hub nodes lead the functional modules in the process of synchronization.
furthermore, suppressing structural connectivity among hub nodes resulted in an elevated modular state , indicating that hub-to-hub connections are critical in intermodular synchronization.
finally, perturbing the oscillatory behavior of hub nodes prevented functional modules from synchronizing, implying that synchronization of functional modules is dependent on the hub nodes’ behavior.
