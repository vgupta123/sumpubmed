it suggests contrasted evolutionary history among the three analyzed methanomassiliicoccales representatives and provides information on conserved characteristics among the overall methanogens and among thermoplasmata.
comparative analyses revealed atypical features, such as the scattering of the ribosomal rna genes in the genome and the absence of eukaryotic-like histone gene otherwise present in most of euryarchaeota genomes.
to better understand this new order and its relationship to other archaea, we manually curated and extensively compared the genome sequences of three methanomassiliicoccales representatives derived from human git microbiota, “candidatus methanomethylophilus alvus", “candidatus methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis” and methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis.
the genome of m. luminyensis encodes several features to thrive in soil and sediment conditions suggesting its larger environmental distribution than git.
previously identified in thermoplasmatales genomes, these features are presently extended to several completely sequenced genomes of this large evolutionary branch, including mg-ii and dhve <dig>  the three methanomassiliicoccales genomes share a unique composition of genes involved in energy conservation suggesting an original combination of two main energy conservation processes previously described in other methanogens.

a seventh order of methanogens, the methanomassiliicoccales, has been identified in diverse anaerobic environments including the gastrointestinal tracts  of humans and other animals and may contribute significantly to methane emission and global warming.
this study represents the first insights into the genomic organization and metabolic traits of the seventh order of methanogens.
