cultivated peanut  is one of the most important oil crops in the world.
an integrated analysis of proteome and transcriptome data revealed specifically or differentially expressed genes in the different developmental stages at both the mrna and protein levels.
the molecular mechanism underlying geocarpic pod development in peanut is poorly understood.
this study provides the basis for examining the molecular mechanisms underlying peanut geocarpy pod development.
furthermore,  <dig> specific or highly abundant proteins related to fatty acid metabolism, starch synthesis, and lignin synthesis were identified in the early swelling pods.
we identified thousands of proteins in the aerial gynophores, subterranean gynophores, and early swelling pods of peanut.
a total of  <dig> proteins involved in the gravity response, light and mechanical stimulus, hormone biosynthesis, and transport were identified as being involved in geocarpy.
in addition, we identified  <dig> proteins involved in metabolism, defense, hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction, nitrogen fixation, and transport that accumulated in subterranean unswellen gynophores.
to gain insight into the mechanism of geocarpy, we extracted proteins from aerial gynophores, subterranean unswollen gynophores, and gynophores that had just started to swell into pods.
furthermore, we identified  <dig> genes that were specifically or abundantly expressed in aerial gynophores, including pectin methylesterase and expansin, which were presumed to promote the elongation of aerial gynophores.
this means of reproduction, referred to as geocarpy, distinguishes peanuts from most other plants.
