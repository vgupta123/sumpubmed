nearly a quarter of the snps were found in genic regions.
snp discovery was performed through in silico analysis of the sequencing data against the whole genome shotgun sequence assembly of flax genotype cdc bethune.
depending on the relatedness of the genotypes and the number and length of the reads, between 78% and 93% of the reads mapped onto the cdc bethune whole genome shotgun sequence assembly.
reduced representation libraries of eight flax genotypes were sequenced on the illumina sequencing platform resulting in sequence coverage ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> x .
we report here on the use of a reduced representation library strategy combined with next generation illumina sequencing for rapid and large scale discovery of snps in eight flax genotypes.
next generation sequencing of reduced representation libraries was successfully implemented for genome-wide snp discovery from flax.
a total of  <dig>  out of  <dig>  snps discovered in macbeth were validated using genotyping-by-sequencing of  <dig> f <dig> individuals from a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between cdc bethune and macbeth, corresponding to a validation rate of  <dig> %.
a total of  <dig>  snps were discovered with the largest number of snps belonging to the genotypes with the highest mapping coverage percentage.
