mats stands out in the analysis of real rna-seq data when all the as events being evaluated are simple as events.
a number of software and computational methods have been developed for detecting as.
using a real data, the study looks at the consistences between the packages and verifies a subset of the detected as events using pcr studies.
the study examines the effect of varying as ratio, read depth, dispersion pattern, as types, sample sizes and the influence of annotation.
the goal of this paper is to benchmark existing computational differential splicing  detection methods so that biologists can choose the most suitable tools to accomplish their goals.
cufflinks achieve a better tradeoff between precision and recall and turns out to be the best one when incomplete annotation is provided.
