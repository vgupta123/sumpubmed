in contrast to unicellular eukaryotes, the c. elegans dss- <dig> encodes an essential protein, which is required for embryogenesis, larval growth, and oogenesis, and which is functionally conserved with its yeast and human homologues.
however, expression of the c. elegans dss- <dig> in yeast cells deleted for its orthologue sem <dig> rescued their temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, and partially rescued the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in these cells.
in addition, dss- <dig> rnai caused embryonic lethality and larval arrest, presumably due to loss of the dss- <dig> mrna maternal contribution.
no apparent effect on proteasome function was found in dss- <dig> rnai treated worms.
dss-1::gfp fusion protein localised primarily in the nucleus.
in addition to its function in the protein degradation machinery, it has been linked to brca <dig>  and homologous dna recombination, mrna export, and exocytosis.
