while our report is more technology-oriented, it nevertheless addresses a major world-wide problem for crops generally: high salinity.
together with low temperatures and water stress, high salinity is responsible for crop losses of millions of tons of various legume  crops.
newly identified transcript isoforms are potential targets for breeding novel cultivars with high salinity tolerance.
as a demonstration of the power of this combination, we have chosen the salt stress transcriptomes of roots and nodules of the third most important legume crop chickpea .
as a good example for such stress-exposed crop plants, we started to characterize salt stress responses of chickpeas on the transcriptome level.
the salt stress responses of  <dig>  transcripts representing  <dig>  unique  <dig> bp deepsupersage tags  from roots of the salt-tolerant variety inrat- <dig> two hours after treatment with  <dig> mm nacl were characterized.
of these, only  <dig> and  <dig> specific transcripts, respectively, were commonly up- or down-regulated  under salt stress in both organs, witnessing a differential organ-specific response to stress.
cross validation with recent reports enriched the information about the salt stress dynamics of more than  <dig>  chickpea ests, and enlarged their pool of alternative transcripts isoforms.
as an example for the high resolution of the employed technology that we coin deepsupersage, we demonstrate that ros-scavenging and -generating pathways undergo strong global transcriptome changes in chickpea roots and nodules already  <dig> hours after onset of moderate salt stress .
additionally, gene ontology  categories over-representation analysis enabled to filter out enriched biological processes among the differentially expressed unitags.
although both processes are already very well characterized in other plants, the information generated in the present work is of high value.
continuously deteriorating environmental conditions will combine with salinity stress to further compromise crop yields.
from several filtered pathways, here we focus exemplarily on transcripts associated with the generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species , as well as on transcripts involved in na+ homeostasis.
profiting from recent pioneer works on massive cdna sequencing in chickpea, more than  <dig>  unitags were able to be linked to uniprot entries.
from a total of  <dig>  analyzed  <dig> bp tags in roots and nodules together,  <dig>  unique transcripts were identified.
information on expression profiles and sequence similarity for several hundreds of transcripts of potential interest is now available.
