bacterial population was found to be maximum during the mesophilic phase, but decreased during the thermophilic phase and declined further in the cooling and maturation phase of composting.
the bacterial population ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> cfu g- <dig> compost.
however, the microbial diversity during composting may vary with the variety of composting materials and nutrient supplements.
therefore, it is necessary to study the diversity of microorganisms during composting of different agricultural byproducts like wheat bran, rice bran, rice husk, along with grass clippings and bulking agents.
the culturable bacterial diversity was assessed during the process by isolating the most prominent bacteria.
composting is microbial decomposition of biodegradable materials and it is governed by physicochemical, physiological and microbiological factors.
the predominant bacteria were characterized biochemically, followed by 16s rrna gene sequencing.
here it has been attempted to assess the diversity of culturable bacteria during composting of agricultural byproducts.
genera like kocuria, microbacterium, acidovorax, comamonas and some new species of bacillus were also identified for the first time from the compost made from agricultural byproducts.
the importance of microbial communities  during composting is well established.
the use of appropriate nitrogen amendments and bulking agents in composting resulted in good quality compost.
