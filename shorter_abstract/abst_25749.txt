modifications of rna bases have been found in some mrnas and non-coding rnas including rrnas, trnas, and snrnas, where modified bases are important for rna function.
we suggest that mirnas contain modified bases and such modifications might be important for mirna maturation and/or function.
these results indicate that our bioinformatics method successfully detected modified nucleotides in trnas.
in the current work, we carried out a bioinformatics analysis of rna base modifications in trnas and mirnas using large numbers of cdna sequences of small rnas  generated with the  <dig> technology and the massively parallel signature sequencing  method.
little is known about rna base modifications in arabidopsis thaliana.
we obtained  <dig>  sites with possible rna base modifications supported by both  <dig> and mpss sequences.
the positions of major substitution sites corresponded with the following known rna base modifications in trnas: n1-methyladenosine , n2-methylguanosine , and n2-n2-methylguanosine .
as with trnas, substitutions from a to u or g and from g to c, u, or a were common, suggesting that base modifications might be similar in trnas and mirnas.
