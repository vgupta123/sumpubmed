the current study sought to determine if long-term behavioral effects could be detected in animals that received ketamine or a saline control injection on either e <dig> or e <dig>  rat behavior was evaluated on two different measures: spontaneous locomotion and water maze learning.
however, the nature of the drug-induced changes depends on the point during embryonic development when ketamine is administered.
the data also indicate that the paradoxical age-dependent effects of early ketamine treatment on learning, previously described in fetuses and neonates, may also be detected later in young adult rats.
embryonic day  <dig>  rat fetuses pre-treated with ketamine  and taught a conditioned taste aversion  learn and remember the cta, whereas e <dig> fetuses do not.
administration of the n-methyl-d-aspartate  antagonist ketamine during the perinatal period can produce a variety of behavioral and neuroanatomical changes.
these data suggest that both the day in fetal development when ketamine is administered and the timing of post-natal behavioral testing interact to influence behavioral outcomes.
water maze performance of ketamine-treated rats was similar to that of controls when tested on p <dig>  likewise, the age of the animal at the time of ketamine/saline treatment did not influence learning of the maze.
