approximately 50% of mammalian mirnas are expressed from introns of protein-coding genes; the primary transcript  is therefore assumed to be the host transcript.
we define sets of conserved and non-conserved human, mouse and rat pre-mirnas using bidirectional blast and synteny analysis.
using comparative data, we are able to identify the boundaries of a significant proportion of human, mouse and rat pri-mirnas.
the 5' end of the pri-mirna is predicted from transcription start sites, cpg islands and 5' cage tags mapped in the upstream flanking region surrounding the precursor mirna .
the 3' end of the pri-mirna is predicted based on the mapping of polya signals, and supported by cdna/est and ditags data.
little is known about the primary transcripts of intergenic mirnas.
the upstream regions of 54% of the predicted pri-mirnas are found to be associated with promoter and insulator regulatory sequences.
the lengths and boundaries of primary transcripts are highly conserved between orthologous mirnas.
micrornas  are important regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in development, differentiation and pathogenesis.
a significant fraction of pri-mirnas have lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> kb, with very few introns.
