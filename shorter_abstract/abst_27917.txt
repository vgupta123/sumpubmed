however, little is known about how expression of parental gene copies  responds following genome merger.
hylite is a flexible and easy-to-use program designed for bench biologists to explore patterns of gene expression following genome merger.
hylite offers practical advantages over manual methods and existing programs, has been designed to accommodate a wide range of genome merger systems, can identify snps that arose following genome merger, and offers accurate performance on non-model organisms.
high throughput rna sequencing now makes this analysis technically feasible, but tools to determine homeolog expression are still in their infancy.
here we present hylite â€“ a single-step analysis to obtain tables of homeolog expression in a hybrid or allopolyploid and its parent species directly from raw mrna sequence files.
hylite accommodates any number of parent species, multiple data sources , and implements a statistical framework optimized for genes with low to moderate expression.
forming a new species through the merger of two or more divergent parent species is increasingly seen as a key phenomenon in the evolution of many biological systems.
