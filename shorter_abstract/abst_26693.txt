the program proteinortho described here is a stand-alone tool that is geared towards large datasets and makes use of distributed computing techniques when run on multi-core hardware.
the ever-increasing flood of sequence data, and hence the rapidly increasing number of genomes that can be compared simultaneously, calls for efficient software tools as brute-force approaches with quadratic memory requirements become infeasible in practise.
we apply proteinortho to compute orthologous proteins in the complete set of all  <dig> eubacterial genomes available at ncbi at the beginning of  <dig>  we identified thirty proteins present in 99% of all bacterial proteomes.
it implements an extended version of the reciprocal best alignment heuristic.
