photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance were also enhanced by elevated co <dig> under moderate drought, but inhibited with over-watering.
the results indicated that co <dig> enrichment alleviated severe and moderate drought stress, and highlighted that co <dig> fertilization’s dependency on water status should be considered when projecting key species’ responses to climate change in dry ecosystems.
here, we aimed to characterize the effects of elevated co <dig> and a water status gradient on the growth, photosynthetic capacity, and mesophyll cell ultrastructure of a dominant grass from a degraded grassland.

although the effects of elevated co <dig> and drought on plants have been well reported individually, little is known about their interaction, particularly over a water status gradient.
elevated co <dig> stimulated plant biomass to a greater extent under moderate changes in water status than under either extreme drought or over-watering conditions.
intrinsic water use efficiency  and total biomass water use efficiency  were increased by elevated co <dig>  regardless of water status.
severe drought distorted mesophyll cell organelles, but co <dig> enrichment partly alleviated this effect.
plant structural traits were also found to be tightly associated with photosynthetic potentials.
