we compare and discuss features such as strand bias, phylogenetic informativeness, non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rates and other mitogenomic characteristics, including ribosomal and transfer rnas annotation and structure.
the mitogenomes of the metacrangonyctidae have the usual characteristics of the metazoan mitogenomes  and show a conserved gene order with several rearrangements with respect to the presumed pancrustacean ground pattern.
next-generation sequencing of pooled long-pcr amplicons can help to rapidly generate mitogenomic information of a high number of related species to be used in phylogenetic and genomic evolutionary studies.
the features of the rrnas, trnas and sequence motifs of the control region of the metacrangonyctidae are similar to those of the few crustaceans studied at present.
all mitogenomes were at-rich and included the usual  <dig> genes of the metazoan mitochondrial genome, but showed a unique derived gene order not matched in any other amphipod mitogenome.
we present the analyses of mitochondrial genome sequences of  <dig> metacrangonyctids in the genera metacrangonyx and longipodacrangonyx, covering the entire geographical range of the family.
