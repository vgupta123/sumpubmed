while expression of il4i <dig> driven from its previously described promoter is found mostly in b cells, the expression driven by the nup <dig> promoter is restricted to cells in testis  and in the brain .
expression of the il4i <dig> gene from the "nup62" promoter and the tissue specific involvement of the pre-mrna processing machinery to regulate expression of two unrelated proteins indicate a novel mechanism of gene regulation.
tissue specific regulation of expression and splicing are major factors enhancing the number of the encoded products.
since nup <dig> is itself ubiquitously expressed, the il4i1_ <dig> variant likely derives from cell type specific alternative pre-mrna processing.
