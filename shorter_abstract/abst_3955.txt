based on the distribution patterns of srlks and srlcks in a reconciled species-domain tree, a maximum parsimony model was then established for simultaneously inferring and dating gene duplication/loss and fusion /fission events in srlk evolution.
two classes of proteins resembling the extracellular s domain  or the intracellular kinase domain  of srk are also ubiquitous in land plants, indicating that the srlks are composite molecules that originated by domain fusion of the two component proteins.
the functional diversification of duplicated srlks was illustrated by molecular evolution analyses of srks.
various srk alleles from crucifer species were then included in our phylogenetic analyses to infer the origination of srks by identifying the proper outgroups.
the founding member of this subfamily, the s-locus receptor kinase , functions as the female determinant of specificity in the self-incompatibility  responses of crucifers.
two gene fusion events were inferred and the major gene fusion event occurred in the common ancestor of land plants generated almost all of extant srlks.
our findings support that srks originated as two ancient haplotypes derived from a pair of tandem duplicate genes through random regulatory neo-/sub- functionalization in the common ancestor of the brassicaceae.
