the novel generalized k-base encoding scheme and resulting local alignment algorithm permits the development of higher fidelity ligation-based next generation sequencing technology.
dna sequence comparison is a well-studied problem, in which two dna sequences are compared using a weighted edit distance.
a generalized version of the previous two-base encoding dna sequence comparison algorithm is used to compare a k-base encoded sequence to a dna reference sequence.
finally, simulations are performed to evaluate the power, the false positive and false negative snp discovery rates, and the performance time of k-base encoding compared to previous methods as well as to the standard dna sequence comparison algorithm.
a generalized k-base encoding scheme is presented, whereby feasible higher order encodings are better able to differentiate errors in the encoded sequence from true dna sequence variants.
the encoded dna sequence may contain technical errors, and therefore encoded sequencing errors must be incorporated when comparing an encoded dna sequence to a reference dna sequence.
