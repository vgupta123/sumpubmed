in klh-immunised mice, splenocytes restimulated in vitro with klh and bv <dig> produced significantly smaller amounts of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  klh-induced il- <dig> and il- <dig> production was also significantly blunted in animals administered bv <dig> in vivo at the time of klh immunisation or two weeks later.
similar results were obtained when bv <dig> was administered in vivo.
bv <dig>  prokineticin- <dig>  or endocrine gland-vascular endothelial growth factor, and prokineticin- <dig> are recently isolated peptide agonists of two g protein-coupled receptors, prokineticin receptor- <dig>  and prokr  <dig>  and have been described as affecting a number of myeloid cell functions.
