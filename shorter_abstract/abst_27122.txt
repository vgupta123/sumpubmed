one aspect in which rna sequencing is more valuable than microarray-based methods is the ability to examine the allelic imbalance of the expression of a gene.
allelic imbalance analysis is subject to technical biases, due to differences in the sequences of the measured alleles.
we present allelicimblance, a software program that is designed to detect, manage, and visualize allelic imbalances comprehensively.
the visualization features can reveal notable, non-trivial allelic imbalance behavior over specific regions, such as exons.
the software provides a complete framework to perform allelic imbalance analyses of aligned rna sequencing data, from detection to visualization, within the robust and versatile management class, aseset.
