to increase our understanding of cold stress responses in this species, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly for o. americanum var.
a total of  <dig> , <dig> high quality, clean reads were obtained from four libraries  and were used to perform de novo transcriptome assembly.
after isoforms were considered,  <dig>  unigenes were generated,  <dig>  of which were similar to known proteins as determined by a blastx search  against ncbi non-redundant, swiss-prot, gene ontology, kegg, and cluster of cog databases.
to increase our understanding of these differentially expressed unigenes, we performed gene ontology and kegg pathway enrichment analyses.
the cbf-mediated transcriptional cascade, a well-known cold tolerance pathway, was reconstructed using our de novo assembled transcriptome.
pilosum, none of the identified cold responsive  gene orthologs was induced by cold, which is consistent with the lack of cold tolerance in this plant.
our results suggest that cold temperature significantly affects genes related to protein translation and cellular metabolism in this chilling sensitive species.
our study has generated a genome-wide transcript profile of o. americanum var.
although most of the cbf pathway genes have orthologs in o. americanum var.
