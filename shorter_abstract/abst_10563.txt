after the evaluation of neurologic function, the spinal cords were immediately removed for biochemical and histopathological analysis.
however, the exact mechanism by which tmp protects the spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion  injury is still unknown.
tetramethylpyrazine  is one of the most important active ingredients of a chinese herb ligusticum wallichii franchat, which is widely used in many ischemia disorders treatments.
greater bcl- <dig> and attenuated bax expression was found in the tmp treating rabbits.
these findings suggest that tmp has protective effects against spinal cord i/r injury by reducing apoptosis through regulating bcl- <dig> and bax expression.
tmp significantly reduced the loss of motoneurons and tunel-positive rate.
for this purpose, rabbits were randomly divided into sham group, control group and tmp group.
apoptosis was measured quantitatively by the terminal transferase utp nick end-labeling  method and confirmed by electron microscopic examination, the expression of bax and bcl- <dig> was immunohistochemically evaluated and quantified by western blot analysis.
neurologic outcomes in the tmp-group were significantly better than those in the control group .
