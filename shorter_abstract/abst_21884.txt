in this paper, we propose a simulation based procedure for power estimation using the negative binomial distribution and assuming a generalized linear model  that considers the dependence between gene expression level and its variance  and also allows equal or unequal dispersion across conditions.
the null distribution of the test statistics was simulated for the desired false positive control to avoid excess false positives with the usage of an asymptotic chi-square distribution.
the proposed procedure is able to properly control the false positive error rate at the nominal level.
sample size calculation and power estimation are essential components of experimental designs in biomedical research.
we provide a framework for power estimation of rna-seq data.
moreover, the dependency among genes should be taken into account in order to obtain accurate results.
we compared the performance of both wald test and likelihood ratio test under different scenarios.
