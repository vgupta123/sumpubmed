we propose that al-induced photosynthesis inhibition was mainly caused by impaired photosynthetic electron transport chain, which may be associated with growth inhibition.
shoot growth is more sensitive to al stress than root growth, co <dig> assimilation, chl, rubisco, ojip transient and most related parameters.
b-induced amelioration of root inhibition was probably caused by b-induced changes in al speciation and/or sub-cellular compartmentation.
however, b-induced amelioration of shoot and photosynthesis inhibition and photoinhibitory damage occurring at both donor and acceptor sides of photosystem ii could be due to less al accumulation in shoots.
b had little effect on plant growth, root, stem and leaf al, leaf chlorophyll , co <dig> assimilation, ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase , chl a fluorescence  transient and related parameters without al stress except that root, stem and leaf b increased with increasing b supply and that  <dig> μm b decreased slightly root dry weight.
the objectives of this study were to determine how b alleviates al-induced growth inhibition and to test the hypothesis that al-induced photosynthesis inhibition can be alleviated by b via preventing al from getting into shoots.
both initial and total rubisco activity in al-treated leaves decreased to a lesser extent than co <dig> assimilation.
little information is available on the amelioration of boron  on aluminum -induced photosynthesis inhibition.
al decreased maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry and total performance index, but increased minimum fluorescence, k-band, relative variable fluorescence at j- and i-steps.
sour pummelo  seedlings were irrigated for  <dig> weeks with nutrient solution containing  <dig> b levels  ×  <dig> al levels .
