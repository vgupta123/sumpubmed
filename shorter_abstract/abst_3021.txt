however, mscs can also be isolated from peripheral blood.
the aim of this work was to advance these studies by investigating the possibility of msc isolation from ovine peripheral blood  and by subsequently characterizing there in vitro properties.
morphological changes were observed after 24-hour culture in neurogenic media, and the transcript levels of the neurogenic markers increased during the prolonged induction period.
these cells were analysed for their proliferative and differentiation potential into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes, as well as for the gene expression of cell surface markers.
mscs can be isolated from a variety of tissues including bone marrow and adipose tissue, which are the most common sources of these cells.
mesenchymal stem cells  are multipotent stem cells with capacity to differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages.
sheep has been proposed as an ideal model for biomedical studies including those of orthopaedics and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies .
albeit some variability was observed between animals, these cells retained their capacity to differentiate into mesenchymal lineages and to transdifferentiate into neuron-like cells in vitro.
although the ability of the cultures derived from different animals to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes was heterogeneous, we confirmed this feature using specific staining and analysing the gene expression of differentiation markers.
therefore, opb-mscs could serve as a valuable tool for biomedical research in fields including orthopaedics or prion diseases.
