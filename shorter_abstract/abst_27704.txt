in addition, pre-calculated transcription factor binding sites of each gene are generated and mutant information is incorporated into profits.
signal transduction is a fundamental biological process in living cells, and many protein families participate in this process in sensing, amplifying and responding to various extracellular or internal stimuli.
therefore, it is a good starting point to integrate information on the maize functional genes involved in signal transduction.
in short, profits provides a user-friendly web interface for studies in signal transduction process in maize.
profits, which utilizes both the b <dig> maize genome and full length cdna  datasets, provides users a comprehensive platform of maize annotation with specific focus on the categorization of families involved in the signal transduction process.
functional annotations such as go annotation, protein signatures, protein best-hits in the arabidopsis and rice genome are provided.
users can explore gene models, corresponding transcripts and flcdnas using the three abovementioned protein hierarchical categories, and visualize them using an ajax-based genome browser  or generic genome browser .
thus, a well-annotated datasets and informative database will be important for further research discoveries.
here we introduce a comprehensive database 'profits' , which endeavours to identify and classify protein kinases/phosphatases, transcription factors and ubiquitin-proteasome-system related genes in the b <dig> maize genome.
in  <dig>  the b <dig> maize genome sequencing made a great step forward, using clone by clone strategy; however, functional annotation and gene classification of the maize genome are still limited.
profits is designed as a user-friendly web interface and it is valuable for experimental researchers.
