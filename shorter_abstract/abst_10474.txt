we first elucidate how fecundity traits of the morphs vary in relation to the frequencies and densities of males and female morphs in multiple sites over multiple years.
the coexistence of multiple male and/or female morphs is widely believed to be maintained through negative frequency-dependent selection imposed by social interactions.
our reported frequency- and density-dependent fecundity patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that the polymorphism is driven by a conflict between sexes over optimal mating rate, with costly male sexual harassment driving negative frequency-dependent selection on morph fecundity.
our results further indicate that all investigated fecundity traits are negatively affected by relative male density , which confirms male harassment as selective agent.

we present some of the first empirical evidence collected under natural conditions that egg number and clutch mass was higher in the rarer female morph.
sex-limited polymorphisms have long intrigued evolutionary biologists and have been the subject of long-standing debates.
however, remarkably few empirical studies have evaluated how social interactions, morph frequencies and fitness parameters relate to one another under natural conditions.
here, we test two hypotheses proposed to explain the maintenance of a female polymorphism in a species with extreme geographical variation in morph frequencies.
second, we evaluate whether the two female morphs differ in resource allocation among fecundity traits, indicating alternative tactics to maximize reproductive output.
this morph-specific fecundity advantage gradually switched with the population morph frequency.
