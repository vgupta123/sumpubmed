the effect of three different levels of oxygen availability on the physiology of p. pastoris and s. cerevisiae revealed a very distinct remodelling of the transcriptional program, leading to novel insights into the different adaptive responses of crabtree negative and positive yeasts to oxygen availability.
saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia pastoris are two of the most relevant microbial eukaryotic platforms for the production of recombinant proteins.
further important differences were related to fab production, which was not significantly affected by oxygen availability in s. cerevisiae, while a clear productivity increase had been previously reported for hypoxically grown p. pastoris.
the major differences in the transcriptomes of s. cerevisiae and p. pastoris were observed between hypoxic and normoxic conditions, where the availability of oxygen strongly affected ergosterol biosynthesis, central carbon metabolism and stress responses, particularly the unfolded protein response.
in this comparative study, the gene expression profiles of s. cerevisiae and p. pastoris, a crabtree positive and crabtree negative yeast, respectively, were analyzed for three different oxygenation conditions  under recombinant protein producing conditions in chemostat cultivations.
their known genome sequences enabled several transcriptomic profiling studies under many different environmental conditions, thus mimicking not only perturbations and adaptations which occur in their natural surroundings, but also in industrial processes.
steady state conditions under low oxygen set-points seemed to perturb the transcriptome of s. cerevisiae to a much lesser extent than the one of p. pastoris, reflecting the major tolerance of the baker's yeast towards oxygen limitation, and a higher fermentative capacity.
