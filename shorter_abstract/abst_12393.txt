thus, this large molecular weight conjugate is not prevented from extravasation through the coronary microvasculature.
this conjugate mrs <dig> and a structurally related model compound mrs <dig> displayed binding ki values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively, and were potent in in vitro functional assays to inhibit camp production.
a pamam dendrimer fully substituted by click chemistry on its peripheral groups with  <dig> moieties of a nucleoside agonist was shown to be potent and selective in binding to the mouse a3ar and effective in cardioprotection in an isolated mouse heart model of ischemia/reperfusion  injury.
both mrs <dig> and mrs <dig>  were effective at increasing functional recovery of isolated mouse hearts after  <dig> min ischemia followed by  <dig> min reperfusion.
unliganded pamam dendrimer alone did not have any effect on functional recovery of isolated perfused mouse hearts.
when stimulated by small molecular agonists, the a <dig> adenosine receptor  mediates cardioprotective effects without inducing detrimental hemodynamic side effects.
<dig> nm mrs <dig> did not improve functional recovery after i/r in hearts from a3ar gene "knock-out"  mice compared to control, indicating the effects of mrs <dig> were a3ar-specific.
