however, in initial experiments we encountered a mutation frequency of  <dig> % compared to a reported  <dig> â€“  <dig> % for other strategies.
current options for constructing shrna vectors include the use of annealed complementary oligonucleotides , a pcr approach using hairpin containing primers  and primer extension of hairpin templates .
our technical modifications will be of tangible benefit to researchers looking for a more efficient and reliable shrna construction process.
short hairpin rna  encoded within an expression vector has proven an effective means of harnessing the rna interference  pathway in mammalian cells.
