we developed a fast gene-gene interaction test, gcore-sib, for discordant sib pairs and implemented the test into an efficient tool.
finally, the gcore-sib was applied to a gwas dataset with approximately  <dig>  discordant sib pairs, and the gcore-sib finished testing  <dig> , <dig>  pairs of snps within 6Â days.
an efficient gene-gene interaction tool for discordant sib pairs was developed.
it will be very useful for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis in gwas using discordant sib pairs.
we used simulations to demonstrate that the gcore-sib has correct type i error rates and has comparable power to that of the regression-based interaction test.
a computationally efficient tool is required for a genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis that tests an extremely large number of single-nucleotide polymorphism  interaction pairs in genome-wide association studies .
current tools for gwas interaction analysis are mainly developed for unrelated case-control samples.
relatively fewer tools for interaction analysis are available for complex disease studies with family-based design, and these tools tend to be computationally expensive.
