of particular interest was the possibility that there was some effect of mood stabilizers on the association between gsα and cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains , similar to that seen with long-term antidepressant treatment.
specific membrane domains like lipid rafts have been shown to be inhibitory domains to a number of signaling proteins, including gsα, and chronic antidepressant treatment facilitates gs signaling by removing gsα form lipid rafts.
these results also validate the hypothesis that translocation of gsα from lipid rafts could serve as a biosignature for antidepressant action.
results indicate that escitalopram was effective at liberating gsα from lipid rafts while lithium was not.
the results of this study indicate that the mood stabilizing agent, lithium, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, escitalopram, act on their cellular targets through mutually exclusive pathways.
there are a number of drug treatments for mood disorders and yet there is no unifying hypothesis for a cellular or molecular basis of action.
