a detailed mutational analysis of the individual genes within the dnd locus in streptomyces lividans responsible for dna phosphorothioation was performed and is described here.
dna phosphorothioation is a multi-enzymatic and highly coordinated process controlled by five dnd genes.
a  <dig> -bp dna region carrying just five orfs  was defined as the sole determinant for modification of the dna backbone in s. lividans to form phosphorothioate.
interestingly, overdosage of dndc or dndd, but not other dnd proteins, in vivo was found to be detrimental to cell viability.
overexpression of some proteins in vivo prevented growth of host strain, suggesting that expression of the gene cluster is strictly regulated in the native host.
an efficient mutation-integration-complementation system was developed to allow for detailed functional analysis of these dnd genes.
the dnd- phenotype caused by specific in-frame deletion of the dnda, c, d, and e genes or the enhanced dnd phenotype resulting from in-frame deletion of dndb could be restored by expression vectors carrying the corresponding dnd genes.
while dnda is clearly transcribed independently, dndb-e constitute an operon, as revealed by rt-pcr analysis.
