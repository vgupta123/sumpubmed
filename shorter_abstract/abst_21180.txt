the big surprise of the evaluation is that the maximum likelihood methods do not score well, minimal evolution distance methods over msa-induced alignments score consistently better.
these are methods which base their construction solely on sequences, coding dna or amino acids.
the second result is the comparison of the trees against trees derived from accepted taxonomies, the taxon measure.
our first result is a statistically significant evaluation of  <dig> ptmss done by comparing trees derived from  <dig> orthologous groups of proteins using a new measure of quality between trees.
this new measure, called the intra measure, is very consistent between different groups of species and strong in the sense that it separates the methods with high confidence.
this comparison also allows us to rank different components of the tree building methods, like msas, substitution matrices, ml tree builders, distance methods, etc.
we analyze phylogenetic tree building methods from molecular sequences .
