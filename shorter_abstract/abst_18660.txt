this conclusion was derived from biochemical and immunofluorescence studies, and also from the fact that free cargo protein resulting from cleavage by proteases after ubiquitin or sumo- <dig> was never observed.
several bacterial expression vectors have been constructed to produce modular proteins containing from the n- to the c-terminus: the flag epitope, a cleavage site for a protease, a ptd, human ubiquitin or sumo- <dig>  and either gfp or the ha epitope.
considering these positive results and other data from the literature, we further tested the ability of ubiquitin or sumo- <dig> linked to various ptd at their n-terminus to deliver within cells proteins or peptides fused downstream of their diglycine motif.
this process results from a non-endocytic pathway.
nine different ptds were tested, including the tat basic domain, wild type or with various mutations, and stretches of arginine or lysine.
we previously developed small hybrid proteins consisting of sumo- <dig> linked to an heptapeptide fused to the tat protein transduction domain .
it was observed that some of these ptds, mainly the tat ptd and seven or nine residues long polyarginine motifs, caused association of the hybrid proteins with cells, but none of these constructs were delivered to the cytosol.
however, in agreement with our previous observations, mutation of the diglycine motif into alanine-arginine, as in the shp constructs, allows cytosol entry demonstrated by immunofluorescence observations on living cells and by cell fractionation analyses.
these constructs, named shp, are able to enter primary lymphocytes and some of them inhibit hiv- <dig> replication.
our observations indicate that fusion of sumo- <dig> to a peptide-ptd module allows generation of a stable hybrid protein that is easily produced in bacteria and which efficiently enters into cells but this property necessitates mutation of the diglycine motif at the end of sumo- <dig>  thereby impairing delivery of the peptide alone.
