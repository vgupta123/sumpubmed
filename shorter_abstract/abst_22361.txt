due to some of the more complex features present in cellml models, such as imports, developing code ab initio to correctly process models can be an onerous task.
cellml is an xml based language for representing mathematical models, in a machine-independent form which is suitable for their exchange between different authors, and for archival in a model repository.
however, for cellml models to be useful, tools which can process them correctly are needed.
we developed an api which allows the information in cellml models to be retrieved and/or modified.
we also developed a series of optional extension apis, for tasks such as simplifying the handling of connections between variables, dealing with physical units, validating models, and translating models into different procedural languages.
tools have been developed using the api which are mature enough for widespread use.
