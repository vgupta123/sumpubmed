a large number of genes associated with secondary metabolite production, including homologs of toxin biosynthesis genes found in other dothideomycete plant pathogens, were identified.
ramularia collo-cygni is a newly important, foliar fungal pathogen of barley that causes the disease ramularia leaf spot.
the relative paucity of plant cell wall degrading enzyme genes may be associated with the stealth pathogenesis characteristic of plant pathogens from the mycosphaerellaceae.
the draft assembly of  <dig> Â mb contained  <dig>  predicted gene models.
our phylogenomic analysis confirmed the classification of this ascomycete fungus within the family mycosphaerellaceae, order capnodiales of the class dothideomycetes.
the r. collo-cygni genome was sequenced using a combination of illumina and roche  <dig> technologies.
the genome sequence of r. collo-cygni provides a framework for understanding the genetic basis of pathogenesis in this important emerging pathogen.
of particular interest will be the analysis of r. collo-cygni gene expression during interactions with the host barley, to understand what triggers this fungus to switch from being a benign endophyte to an aggressive necrotroph.
the reduced complement of carbohydrate-degrading enzyme genes is likely to reflect a strategy to avoid detection by host defences during its prolonged asymptomatic growth.
