rcsb-p/gade regulatory complex, the general direct regulator of glutamate-, arginine- and lysine-dependent acid resistance pathways plays a central role in the regulatory cascade.
h-ns lies near the top of the hierarchy orchestrating acid response centred on rcsb-p/gade regulatory complex, the general direct regulator of glutamate-, arginine- and lysine-dependent acid resistance pathways.
we combined mutational, phenotypic and gene expression analyses, to unravel the regulatory hierarchy in acid resistance involving h-ns, rcsb-p/gade complex, hdfr, cadc, adiy regulators, and dna-binding assays to separate direct effects from indirect ones.
the present study aimed to characterize the h-ns-dependent cascade governing the acid stress resistance pathways and to define the interplay between the different regulators.
finally, we found that in addition to h-ns and rcsb, a third regulator, hdfr, inversely controls glutamate-dependent acid resistance pathway and motility.
however, h-ns also directly controls specific regulators of these pathways  and genes involved in general stress resistance .
h-ns regulates the acid stress resistance.
