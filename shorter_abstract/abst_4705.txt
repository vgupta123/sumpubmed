numerous studies have been conducted to define its origin and nature, but the molecular nature and mechanism of tpd occurrence remains unknown.
a majority of genes involved in natural rubber biosynthesis and jasmonate synthesis with most potential relevance in tpd occurrence were found to be differentially expressed.
in tpd-affected trees, the expression of most genes related to the latex biosynthesis and jasmonate synthesis was severely inhibited and is probably the direct cause of the tpd.

this study is committed to de novo sequencing and comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of healthy  and tpd-affected  rubber trees to identify the genes and pathways related to the tpd.
total raw reads of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> ,020 bp were obtained from h and t library, respectively using illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing technology.
de novo assemblies yielded  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes from h and t library, respectively.
among  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were identified as differential expressed genes between h and t library via comparative transcript profiling.
