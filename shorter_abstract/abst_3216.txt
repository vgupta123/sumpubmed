to investigate the transcriptome during the male sterility transition in pgms rice, the transcriptome of nongken 58s under short-day  and long-day  at the glume primordium differentiation and pistil/stamen primordium forming stages was compared.
seventy-three and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified at the glume primordium differentiation and pistil/stamen primordium forming stages, respectively.
gene ontology annotation and pathway analysis revealed that four biological processes and the circadian rhythms and the flowering pathways coordinately regulated the male sterility transition.
the results presented here indicate that the transcriptome in nongken 58s was significantly suppressed under ld conditions.
photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile  rice, nongken 58s, was discovered in  <dig>  it has been widely used for the production of hybrid rice, and great achievements have been made in improving rice yields.
further quantitative pcr analysis demonstrated that the circadian rhythms of osprr <dig>  osprr <dig>  osgi, hd <dig>  oslhy and osdof in leaves were obviously different between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> under ld conditions.
moreover, both osprr <dig> and hd <dig> in the inflorescence displayed differences between nongken 58s and nongken  <dig> under both ld and sd conditions.
among these degs, the circadian rhythm and the flowering pathway were involved in the male sterility transition.
however, the mechanism of the male sterility transition in pgms rice remains to be determined.
five and  <dig> genes were markedly up-regulated , and two and five genes were considerably down-regulated  under sd during the male sterility transition.
furthermore, these pathways were coordinately involved in the male sterility transition in pgms rice.
