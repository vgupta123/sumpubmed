a total of  <dig> free-ranging wild boar were captured by means of portable cages and corral traps and then anaesthetized with intramuscular darts using a blowpipe.
pre-release mortality during capture and handling  was associated with severe trauma in corral traps.
both cage and corral traps are efficient methods to capture wild boar.
this anaesthetic protocol is useful for prolonged handling of wild boar and allows sampling and collecting data for ecological and epidemiological studies.
the individual response to chemical immobilization was characterized using anaesthetic, clinical, and serum biochemical variables.
mean induction period was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, hypnosis period enabling effective handling was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min, and recovery period was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min.
cage traps are safer, as demonstrated by mortality rates as well as anaesthetic, physiological, and serum biochemical responses.
according to the best statistical model obtained, the main factor driving anaesthetic efficacy and stress indicators is trap type.
the aim of this study was testing a combination of tiletamine-zolazepam   and medetomidine   on eurasian wild boar .
after the procedure,  <dig> of these wild boar were monitored for  <dig> days using gps-gsm collars.
capture specificity for wild boar was  <dig> % and trapping effort was  <dig>  days per captured wild boar.
