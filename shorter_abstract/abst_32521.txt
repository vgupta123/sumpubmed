among the millets, finger millet has high amount of calcium, methionine, tryptophan, fiber, and sulphur containing amino acids.
mining of simple sequence repeats  yielded abundance of ssrs within the finger millet genome.
functional annotation and mining of transcription factors revealed finger millet genome harbors large number of drought tolerance related genes.
availability of genomic resources of finger millet will enhance the novel breeding possibilities to address potential challenges of finger millet improvement.
the finger millet genome was found to have higher colinearity with foxtail millet and rice as compared to other poaceae species.
experimental results from whole genome sequencing and assembling process of ml- <dig> finger millet cultivar yielded 1196 mb covering approximately 82% of total estimated genome size.
the online version of this article  contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
therefore, development and utilization of genomic resources for genetic improvement of this crop is immensely useful.

this genome sequencing effort will strengthen plant breeders for allele discovery, genetic mapping, and identification of candidate genes for agronomically important traits.
transcriptome analysis of low moisture stress and non-stress samples revealed the identification of several drought-induced candidate genes, which could be used in drought tolerance breeding.
