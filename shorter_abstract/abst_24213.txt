while all viruses induced antiviral responses, the h5n <dig> virus infection resulted in higher expression levels of cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammatory responses.
pulmonary macrophages have been implicated in disease severity in the lower airway, and understanding the host response ﻿of macrophages infected with avian influenza viruses should provide new therapeutic strategies.
we used a systems-based approach to investigate the transcriptome response of primary murine lung macrophages  infected with the mouse-adapted h1n1/wsn virus and low pathogenic avian influenza  viruses h5n <dig> and h5n <dig>  the results showed that the lpai viruses h5n <dig> and h5n <dig> can infect pmФ with similar efficiency to the h1n1/wsn virus.

a﻿lthough﻿ the h5n <dig> virus it is capable of inducing high levels of cytokines that are associated with inflammation﻿, this property is disti﻿nct from its inability to﻿ efficiently replicate in a mammalian host.
