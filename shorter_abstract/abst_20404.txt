coat colour and patterns, facial and body markings, gender and parental hearing status were recorded.
no significant associations were found between deafness and coat colour.
in some breeds, chsd is associated with a lack of cochlear melanocytes in the stria vascularis, certain coat characteristics, and potentially, abnormalities in neuroepithelial pigment production.
australian cattle dogs suffer from chsd, and this disease is more common in dogs with mask-free faces, and in those without pigmented body patches.
univariable and multivariable analyses revealed a negative association between deafness and bilateral facial masks .
congenital hereditary sensorineural deafness  occurs in many dog breeds, including australian cattle dogs.
this study investigates phenotypic markers for chsd in  <dig> australian cattle dogs.
auditory function was tested in  <dig> australian cattle dogs in family groups using brainstem auditory evoked response testing.
in australian cattle dogs, chsd may be more common in females.
females were at increased risk of deafness  after adjusting for any confounding by mask type and pigmented body spots.
using multivariable logistic animal modelling, the risk of deafness was lower in dogs with pigmented body spots .
in unilaterally deaf dogs with unilateral masks, the lack of observed association between side of deafness and side of mask suggests that if chsd is due to defects in molecular pigment pathways, the molecular control of embryonic melanoblast migration from ectoderm to skin differs from control of migration from ectoderm to cochlea.
within unilaterally deaf dogs with unilateral facial masks, no association was observed between the side of deafness and side of mask.
the side of unilateral deafness was not significantly clustered amongst unilaterally deaf dogs from the same litter.
deafness prevalence among all  <dig> dogs was  <dig> % with  <dig> % unilaterally deaf, and  <dig> % bilaterally deaf, and amongst pups from completely tested litters  was  <dig> %, with  <dig> % unilaterally deaf, and  <dig> % bilaterally deaf.
