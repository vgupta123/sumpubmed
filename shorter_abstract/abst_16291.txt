an orthologous gene was also found in the cephalochordate amphioxus, but no orthologous genes were found by the authors in other non-vertebrate species, even if a fgfrl <dig> gene was identified in the sea urchin genome, as well as a closely related gene, named nou-darake, in the planarian dugesia japonica.
our work sheds light on the existence of a putative fgf signalling pathway actor present in the ancestor of probably all metazoans, the function of which has received little attention until now.
to better understand the implication of fgfrl <dig> genes in chordate embryonic development, we have analyzed expression patterns of the amphioxus and the mouse genes by whole mount in situ hybridization.
fibroblast growth factors  and their receptors are well known for having major implications in cell signalling controlling embryonic development.
we show that some homologous expression territories can be defined, and we propose that fgfrl <dig> and fgf8/17/ <dig> were already co-expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm in the ancestor of chordates.
our analysis also shows that fgfrl <dig> orthologous genes are linked in the genome with other members of the fgf signalling pathway from cnidarians to bilaterians .
