regeneration of transgenic cells remains a major obstacle to research and commercial deployment of most taxa of transgenic plants, and woody species are particularly recalcitrant.
we found a large initial change in expression after the beginning of hormone treatment , and then a much smaller number of additional differentially expressed genes at subsequent regeneration stages.
we analyzed gene expression during poplar in vitro dedifferentiation and shoot regeneration using an affymetrix array representing over  <dig>  poplar transcripts.
the major regulatory events during plant cell organogenesis occur at early stages of dedifferentiation.
our aim is to improve knowledge of gene regulatory circuits important to dedifferentiation, redifferentiation, and adventitious meristem organization during in vitro regeneration of plants.
we focused on callus induction and shoot formation, thus we sampled rnas from tissues: prior to callus induction,  <dig> days and  <dig> days after callus induction, and  <dig> days and  <dig> days after the start of shoot induction.
when compared with data on in vitro callogenesis in arabidopsis, 25%  of up-regulated and 22%  of down-regulated genes were in common with the genes regulated in poplar during callus induction.
genes that showed strong differential expression included components of auxin and cytokinin signaling, selected cell division genes, and genes related to plastid development and photosynthesis.
