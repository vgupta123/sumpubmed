we conclude that although widely expressed in the developing pns, cato is expressed and regulated very differently in different sensory lineages.
expression is predominantly in sensory lineages that depend on the atonal and amos proneural genes.
mutant embryos show several defects in chordotonal sensory lineages, most notably the duplication of the sensory neuron, which appears to be caused by an extra cell division.
in these cells, we propose that it plays roles in sense organ precursor maintenance and/or identity, and in controlling the number of cell divisions in the neuronal branch of the lineage arising from these precursors.
consistent with this, we find evidence that cato is a direct target gene of atonal and amos, but not of scute.
in addition, we show that cato is required to form the single chordotonal organ that persists in atonal mutant embryos.
we characterised the expression pattern of cato in detail using newly raised antibodies and gfp reporter gene constructs.
