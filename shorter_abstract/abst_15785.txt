the m. persicae cdna libraries include ones made from sexual and asexual whole aphids, guts, heads, and salivary glands.
the agilent earray platform was used to design an m. persicae oligonucleotide microarray representing over  <dig>  unique genes.
comparison of cdna data from three aphid lineages identified single nucleotide polymorphisms that can be used as genetic markers and, in some cases, may represent functional differences in the protein products.
aphids for library construction were raised on arabidopsis thaliana, nicotiana benthamiana, brassica oleracea, b. napus, and physalis floridana .
however, despite the significant damage inflicted by m. persicae in agricultural systems through direct feeding damage and by its ability to transmit plant viruses, limited genomic information is available for this species.
sequencing of  <dig> m. persicae cdna libraries generated  <dig>  expressed sequence tags .
in particular, non-conservative amino acid substitutions in a highly expressed gut protease may be of adaptive significance for m. persicae feeding on different host plants.
new genomic resources have been developed for m. persicae, an agriculturally important insect pest.
these resources will help elucidate the adaptations that allow m. persicae to develop compatible interactions with its host plants, complementing ongoing work illuminating plant molecular responses to phloem-feeding insects.
these include previously unknown sequence data, a collection of expressed genes, molecular markers, and a dna microarray that can be used to study aphid gene expression.
in silico comparison of cdna libraries identified aphid genes with tissue-specific expression patterns, and gene expression that is induced by feeding on nicotiana benthamiana.
the green peach aphid, myzus persicae , is a world-wide insect pest capable of infesting more than  <dig> plant families, including many crop species.
