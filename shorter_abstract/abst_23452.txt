these results suggest that substantial changes in gene expression are associated with adventitious rooting.
indole-3-butyric acid  is applied to the cuttings of various plant species to induce formation of adventitious roots  in commercial settings.
our study presents a global view of the transcriptomic profiles of tetraploid black locust cuttings in response to iba treatment and provides new insights into the fundamental mechanisms associated with auxin-induced adventitious rooting.
kegg pathway enrichment indicated that glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism, photosynthesis, nucleotide sugar metabolism, and lysosome were the pathways most highly regulated by iba.
comparison of the four consecutive developmental stages showed that  <dig> and  <dig> degs were shared between iba-treated and ck, suggesting that iba treatment increased the number of degs.
we identified a number of differentially regulated unigenes, including  <dig> methionine-related genes and  <dig> ethylene-related genes, associated with the kegg pathway cysteine and methionine metabolism.
to further elucidate the mechanisms of ar formation, we used illumina sequencing to analyze transcriptome dynamics and differential gene expression at four developmental stages in control  and iba-treated groups.
the short reads were assembled into  <dig>  unitranscripts and  <dig>  unigenes, with average lengths of  <dig> and 852 bp.
the go enrichment, pathway mapping, and gene expression profile analyses revealed molecular traits for root induction and initiation.

tetraploid black locust is an attractive ornamental tree that is drought resistant, sand tolerant, can prevent sand erosion and has various commercial uses.
go functional category analysis indicated that iba significantly up- or down-regulated processes associated with regulation of transcription, transcription of dna dependent, integral to membrane and atp binding during the development process.
