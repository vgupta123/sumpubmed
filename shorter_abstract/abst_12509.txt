additionally, proteome analysis of roots from stressed plants was performed and  <dig> proteins putatively associated to drought tolerance were identified by mass spectrometry.
the analyses of subtractive cdna libraries and differential protein expression of drought tolerant and susceptible genotypes can contribute to the understanding of the genetic control of water use efficiency in rice.
several genes expressed exclusively in the tolerant or susceptible genotypes were identified.
there is an indication that the mechanisms of susceptibility to drought in upland rice are similar to those of lowland varieties.
rice  germplasm represents an extraordinary source of genes that control traits of agronomic importance such as drought tolerance.
in contrast, in the susceptible genotype, expression of genes involved in protection against cell damage was not detected.
two subtractive libraries were constructed using cdna of drought susceptible and tolerant genotypes submitted to stress against cdna of well-watered plants.
genes exclusively expressed in the tolerant genotype were, in general, related to maintenance of turgor and cell integrity.
this diversity is the basis for the development of new cultivars better adapted to water restriction conditions, in particular for upland rice, which is grown under rainfall.
