the good agreement between pcr and ihc indicates that ihc can be used as an alternative method.
these methods do not appear to depend on the clinical status of the animal or the anatomical source of the skin sample; there is no "best region" for any method.
finally, tissue samples from ears, nose and abdomen, particularly ears and nose, are potentially useful for diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis independently of the animal's clinical status.
there was weak agreement between pcr and he for all tissue samples; good agreement between pcr and ihc for ear and abdomen samples, and weak agreement for nose; and optimal agreement between ihc and he for ear and abdomen and good agreement for nose samples.
we compared skin biopsy samples from different anatomical regions for detecting leishmania in dogs, using histological , immunohistochemical  and polymerase chain reaction  techniques.
the pcr on ear skin could be the best procedure for diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis.
