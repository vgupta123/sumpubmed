previous studies focused mostly on whether dosage compensation occurs, and the next generation transcriptomics sequencing technology rna-seq is expected to eventually uncover the mechanisms of gene expression regulation and the related pathological phenotypes in human aneuploidy.
using next generation transcriptomics sequencing technology rna-seq, we profiled the transcriptomes of four human aneuploid induced pluripotent stem cell  lines generated from monosomy Ã— , trisomy  <dig> , trisomy  <dig> , and partial trisomy 11: <dig>  as well as two umbilical cord matrix ipsc lines as euploid controls to examine how phenotypic abnormalities develop with aberrant karyotype.
our results demonstrate that the extra or missing chromosome has extensive effects on the whole transcriptome.
a total of  <dig> m  reads were obtained from the six ipsc lines, and over  <dig>  mrnas were identified by gene annotation.
global analysis of gene expression profiles and functional analysis of differentially expressed  genes were implemented.
human aneuploidy is the leading cause of early pregnancy loss, mental retardation, and multiple congenital anomalies.
functional analysis of differentially expressed genes reveals that the genes most affected in aneuploid individuals are related to central nervous system development and tumorigenesis.
over  <dig> de genes are determined between aneuploidy and euploid ipscs respectively while  <dig> kegg pathways are overlapped enriched in four aneuploidy samples.
