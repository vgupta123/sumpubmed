the amyloid precursor protein  is a key molecule in alzheimer disease.
our results contribute to the elucidation of mechanisms involved in app trafficking in alzheimer disease.
we observed that pat <dig> binds poorly app at the cell surface of primary cortical neurons contrary to cytoplasmic app.
these data suggest that pat <dig> slows down app trafficking to the cell surface in primary cortical neurons.

the increase of app at the cell surface induced by low levels of pat <dig> did not trigger cell death signaling.
its localization at the cell surface can trigger downstream signaling and app cleavages.
app trafficking to the cell surface in neurons is not clearly understood and may be related to the interactions with its partners.
using down and up-regulation of pat <dig>  we observed respectively an increase and decrease of app at the cell surface.
