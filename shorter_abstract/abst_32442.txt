intraspecific variation within the diverse southern african murine rodents has not been extensively investigated, yet cryptic diversity is evident in several taxa studied to date.
similar to other african murine rodents, m. namaquensis radiated during the pliocene and pleistocene coinciding with major periods of aridification and the expansion of savanna habitats.
gene tree and phylogeographic analyses of these alleles suggest the presence of at least eight lineages or haplogroups , with varying degrees of intra-lineage diversity.
the namaqua rock mouse, micaelamys namaquensis smith,  <dig> is a widespread endemic murine rodent from the subregion.
we further show statistical support for the association of several of these lineages with particular vegetation biomes of southern africa.
contrasting intra-lineage phylogeographic patterns suggest differences in adaptation and responses to plio-pleistocene climatic and vegetation changes.
