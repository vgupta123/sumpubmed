however, the transcriptional landscape is complex and it is unclear as to what extent it reflects the ribosome associated mrna population .
nonetheless, reporter assays demonstrated that the tss variants impacted on the translational readout both quantitatively  and qualitatively .
indeed, promoter switches have been reported in pathologies such as cancer.
since characterisation of the proteome remains technically laborious it is attractive to define the genetic expression profile using the transcriptome.
in this article, we have characterised both the transcriptome and translatome of the mcf <dig>  and mcf10a  cell lines.
the results point to considerable and distinct cell-specific 5′tl heterogeneity within both the transcriptome and translatome of the two cell lines analysed.
the genetic program, as manifested as the cellular phenotype, is in large part dictated by the cell’s protein composition.
this is not a moot point because the 5′tl plays a key role in regulating mrna recruitment onto polysomes.
this observation is in-line with the ribosome filter hypothesis which posits that the ribosomal machine can selectively filter information from within the transcriptome.
this is particularly pertinent for genes using multiple transcriptional start sites  generating mrnas with heterogeneous 5′ transcript leaders .
