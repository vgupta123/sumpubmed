using the mutant antennaless, a likely regulatory null mutation at the tc-kni locus, we provide evidence that our rnai studies represent a null situation.
however, published tc-kni data are restricted to cuticle phenotypes and tc-even-skipped and tc-wingless stainings in knockdown embryos.
hence, it has remained unclear whether the entire antennal and mandibular segments depend on tc-kni function, and whether the intervening intercalary segment is formed completely.
we address these questions with a detailed examination of tc-kni function.
surprisingly, tc-kni controls the timing of expression of the hox gene tc-labial in the intercalary segment, although this segment does form in the absence of tc-kni function.
in tribolium, as in drosophila, head and trunk segmentation gene networks cooperate to pattern the mandibular segment, albeit involving tc-kni as novel component.
the drosophila larval head is evolutionarily derived at the genetic and morphological level.
in the beetle tribolium castaneum, development of the larval head more closely resembles the ancestral arthropod condition.
by examining the expression of marker genes in rnai embryos, we show that tc-kni is required only for the formation of the posterior parts of the antennal and mandibular segments .
unexpectedly, we find that the pair-rule gene tc-even-skipped helps set the posterior boundary of tc-kni expression in the mandible.
tc-kni is not required for specification of the anterior regions of these segments, nor the intervening intercalary segment, confirming that tc-kni is not a canonical ‘gap-gene’.
moreover, we find that the role of tc-kni is distinct in these segments: tc-kni is required for the initiation of the antennal parasegment boundary, but only for the maintenance of the mandibular parasegmental boundary.
