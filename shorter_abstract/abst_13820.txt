bank vole population density was estimated and blood samples collected to detect puuv specific antibodies.
in europe, bank voles  are widely distributed and can transmit puumala virus  to humans, which causes a mild to moderate form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, called nephropathia epidemica.
bank voles were live trapped three times a year in 2010â€“ <dig> in three woodland plots in each of four regions in germany.
moreover, puuv infection might affect host fitness, because seropositive individuals survived better from spring to summer than uninfected bank voles.
our study provides robust estimations of relevant patterns and processes of the dynamics of puuv and its rodent host in central europe, which are highly important for the future development of predictive models for human hantavirus infection risk.
we demonstrated that fluctuation of puuv seroprevalence is dependent not only on multi-annual but also on seasonal dynamics of rodent host abundance.
uncovering the link between host and virus dynamics can help to prevent human puuv infections in the future.
individual space use was independent of puuv infections.
