d <dig> receptor plays an important role in this regulation of transporter uptake and availability.
pramipexole treatment completely antagonized the neurotoxic effects of mptp, as measured by substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area th-immunoreactive cell counts.
subchronic treatment with pramipexole lowered the vmax for da and mpp+ uptake into striatal synaptosomes of wt mice.
stereological quantification of dopamine neuron number and optical density measurement of dopamine fiber loss were carried out at  <dig> week after treatment, using immunostaining for dopamine transporter  and tyrosine hydroxylase .
our aim was to determine if pramipexole, a d <dig> preferring agonist, effectively reduced dopamine neuron and fiber loss in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine  mouse model when given at intraperitoneal doses corresponding to clinical doses.
pramipexole treatment lowered vmax in wt but not d <dig> ko mice; however, d <dig> ko mice had lower vmax for da uptake.
there was no change in dat number in wt with pramipexole treatment or d <dig> ko mice at  <dig> h post-treatment, but there was a reduction in wt-pramipexole treated and not in d <dig> ko mice at  <dig> days post-treatment.
these results suggest that protection occurs at clinically suitable doses of pramipexole.
the kinetics of mpp+ and da uptake  were determined  <dig> h later; and at  <dig> h and  <dig> days dopamine transporter density was measured by quantitative autoradiography.
we also determined whether subchronic treatment with pramipexole regulates dopamine transporter function, thereby reducing intracellular transport of the active metabolite of mptp, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium .
protection could be due to a reduced amount of mpp+ taken up into da terminals via dat.
