a critical time window exists after which a cell that has been more strongly activated nevertheless cannot exclude an inferior competitor.
extracellular feedback is an abundant module of intercellular communication networks, yet a detailed understanding of its role is still lacking.
here, we study interactions between polyclonal activated t cells that are mediated by il- <dig> extracellular feedback as a model system.
using mathematical modeling we show that extracellular feedback can give rise to opposite outcomes: competition or cooperation between interacting t cells, depending on their relative levels of activation.
our model suggests that extracellular feedback can contribute to these observed behaviors as it translates quantitative differences in t cells’ activation strength and in their relative activation time into qualitatively different outcomes.
we propose extracellular feedback as a general mechanism that can balance speed and accuracy – choosing the most suitable responders out of a polyclonal population under the clock of an escalating threat.
