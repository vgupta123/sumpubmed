ann <dig> gene has been under positive selection, but ann <dig> and ann <dig> have been under purifying selection among the four species in their evolutionary histories.
these results provided significant information for understanding the diverse roles of plant annexins and opened a new avenue for functional studies of cold induced male sterility in wheat.
additionally, eight and  <dig> annexin genes were identified from the draft genome sequences of triticum urartu and aegilops tauschii, progenitor for the a and d genome of wheat, respectively.
pi values of each of ann1– <dig> genes among t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare species was very low, with the exception of ann <dig> and ann <dig> genes.
this study analyzed the size and composition of the annexin gene family in wheat and barley, and investigated differential tissue-specific and stress responsive expression profiles of the gene family in wheat.
based on available genomic and transcriptomic data,  <dig> and  <dig> putative annexin genes were found through in silico analysis in wheat and barley, respectively.
among those genes, taann <dig> is specifically expressed in the anther but fails to be induced by low temperature in thermosensitive genic male sterile lines, suggesting that specific down-regulation of taann <dig> is associated with conditional male sterility in wheat.
by phylogenetic analysis, annexins in these four species together with other monocots and eudicots were classified into six different orthologous groups.
the nucleotide diversities of ann1– <dig> genes in the four species were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
annexins are an evolutionarily conserved multigene family of calcium-dependent phospholipid binding proteins that play important roles in stress resistance and plant development.
gene expression patterns obtained by real-time pcr and re-analyzing the public microarray data revealed differential temporal and spatial regulation of annexin genes in wheat under different abiotic stress conditions such as salinity, drought, cold and abscisic acid.

no selective pressure was operated on annexin genes in the same species.
