within lamellipedia, a clade of pygidium bearing taxa is resolved that can be shown to have a broadly helmetiid-like tergite morphology in its ground pattern.
the stereotypical lateral splay of the appendages of lamellipedians is a homoplastic character shown to be achieved by several groups independently.
cladistic analysis with a broad taxon sampling of predominantly early palaeozoic arthropods yields a monophyletic lamellipedia as sister taxon to the crustacea or tetraconata.
exceptionally preserved palaeozoic faunas have yielded a plethora of trilobite-like arthropods, often referred to as lamellipedians.
the combination of helmetiid, trilobite, and nektaspid characters in arthroaspis gives important hints concerning character polarisation within the trilobite-like arthropods.
sp., a new arthropod from the early cambrian sirius passet lagerstätte of north greenland shows a striking combination of both dorsal and ventral characters of helmetiida, nektaspida, and trilobita.
the trilobite appendages, though similar to those of other lamellipedians in gross morphology, have a unique outward rotation of the anterior trunk appendages, resulting in a ‘hard wired’ lateral splay, different to that observed in other lamellipedia.
