the individual opls models are linear, but the piecewise combination of several models accommodates modelling and prediction of changes which are non-linear with respect to the time course.
the method provides a competitive complement to commonly applied multivariate methods such as opls and principal component analysis  for modelling and analysis of short time-series data.
