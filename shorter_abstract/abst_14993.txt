the administration of flbz as a cds-based solution, does not seem to achieve great practical relevance for parasite control in sheep.
however, oppositely to what was expected, the absorption-related pharmacokinetic parameters did not show any marked formulation-dependant effect.
the comparative in vitro aqueous solubility of flbz and other bzd anthelmintics in the presence of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin  was evaluated in the current work.
administration of flbz, the auc and the tmax of the parent compound were significantly  reduced, which is consistent with ruminal bypass.
plasma and abomasal fluid samples were collected between  <dig> and 72 h post-treatment.
experiment 1: in a crossover study, sheep received either a flbz-cds solution  or a flbz-cmc suspension  by the i.r.
route with the flbz-cds solution .
the pharmacokinetic study involved two experiments.
cyclodextrins  are usually used to increase aqueous solubility of poor hydrosoluble compounds.
improvement of flbz aqueous solubility due to cds resulted markedly higher than that observed for mebendazole and albendazole.
