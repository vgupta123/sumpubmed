using both simulation data and a published diabetes dataset, we show that our test outperforms the commonly used approaches, the global test and gene set enrichment analysis .
we show using simulations that type i error is protected under different choices of working covariance matrices and power is improved as the working covariance approaches the true covariance.
we develop tegs , a variance component test for the gene set effects by assuming a common distribution for regression coefficients in multivariate linear regression models, and calculate the p-values using permutation and a scaled chi-square approximation.
tegs outperforms two widely used methods, gsea and global test in both simulation and a diabetes microarray data.
here we propose to tackle this important feature of a gene set to improve statistical power in gene set analyses.
we propose to model the effects of an independent variable, e.g., exposure/biological status , on multiple gene expression values in a gene set using a multivariate linear regression model, where the correlation among the genes is explicitly modeled using a working covariance matrix.
we develop a gene set analyses method  under the multivariate regression framework, which directly models the interdependence of the expression values in a gene set using a working covariance.
gene set analyses have become increasingly important in genomic research, as many complex diseases are contributed jointly by alterations of numerous genes.
the global test is a special case of tegs when correlation among genes in a gene set is ignored.
