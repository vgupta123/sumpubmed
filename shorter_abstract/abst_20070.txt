other methods can support these techniques: we have developed an automatic method "breps" that creates highly specific sequence patterns for the functional annotation of enzymes.
the final high-quality patterns can be used for functional annotation.
we ran our protocol on a recent swiss-prot release and show statistics, as well as a comparison to priam, a probabilistic method that is also specialized on the functional annotation of enzymes.
our protocol computes highly specific sequence patterns that can be used to support the functional annotation of enzymes.
models for the simulation of metabolic networks require the accurate prediction of enzyme function.
the results show that breps can be a valuable addition to the reconstruction of metabolic networks.
the enzyme sequences in the tree nodes are aligned with clustalw.
the enzymes are then clustered into a number of trees, where each tree node is associated with a set of ec-numbers.
based on a genomic sequence, enzymatic functions of gene products are today mainly predicted by sequence database searching and operon analysis.
the main advantages of our method are that it is automatic and unsupervised, and quite fast once the patterns are evaluated.
