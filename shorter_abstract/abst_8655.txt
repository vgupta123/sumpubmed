this paper focuses on the information in the database for pathogens that impact global public health, emerging infectious organisms, and bioterrorist threat agents.
thousands of different microorganisms affect the health, safety, and economic stability of populations.
the database structure facilitates linkage to public genomic databases.
many different medical and governmental organizations have created lists of the pathogenic microorganisms relevant to their missions; however, the nomenclature for biological agents on these lists and pathogens described in the literature is inexact.
this ambiguity can be a significant block to effective communication among the diverse communities that must deal with epidemics or bioterrorist attacks.
we have developed a database known as the microbial rosetta stone.
the microbial rosetta stone is available at .
