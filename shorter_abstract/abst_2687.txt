the abc transporter superfamilies constitute many different systems that are widespread among living organisms with different functions, such as ligands translocation, mrna translation, and dna repair.
iron plays an important role in many biological processes but it has low solubility under physiological condition.
an abc transporter system, named as mtsabc  was cloned from s. iniae hd- <dig>  and was found to be involved in heme utilization.
this is believed to be the first report on the cloning the abc transporter lipoprotein from s. iniae genomic dna.
many microorganisms have been shown to be able to circumvent this nutritional limitation by forming direct contacts with iron-containing proteins through atp-binding cassette  transporters.
the analysis indicated that mtsa is a putative lipoprotein which binds to heme that can serve as an iron source for the microorganism, and is expressed in vivo during kunming mice infection by s. iniae hd- <dig>
together, our data suggested that mtsa is associated with heme, and is expressed in vivo during kunming mice infection by s. iniae hd- <dig> which indicated that it can be a potential candidate for s. iniae subunit vaccine.
streptococcus iniae  is a major pathogen that causes considerable morbidity and mortality in cultured fish worldwide.
the pathogen's ability to adapt to the host affects the extent of infection, hence understanding the mechanisms by which s. iniae overcomes physiological stresses during infection will help to identify potential virulence determinants of streptococcal infection.
grow s. iniae under iron-restricted conditions is one approach for identifying host-specific protein expression.
