these results may be of substantial interest for enzymatic peptide synthesis reactions at mild conditions with high selectivity in industrial drug production.
possible reasons for this loss are mass transport limitations or structural changes.
the immobilization conditions in organic solvent were optimized for a peptide synthesis reaction.
porcine trypsin immobilization was carried out in organic and aqueous media with magnetic microparticles.
the results indicate a substantial potential of the micro-aqueous organic protease immobilization method for preservation of enzymatic activity during enzyme coupling step.
the highest carrier activity was achieved at 1 % of water  in dioxane.
the resulting immobilizate could be used over ten cycles with activity retention of 90 % in peptide synthesis reaction in 80 %  ethanol and in hydrolysis reaction with activity retention of 87 % in buffered aqueous solution.
further, the optimized method was applied in peptide synthesis and hydrolysis reactions in comparison to an aqueous immobilization method varying the protein input.
comparing the specific activity yields of the tested immobilization methods revealed maximum values of  <dig>  % and 100 % in peptide synthesis and  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % in hydrolysis reaction for the dioxane and aqueous method, respectively.
the hydrolysis activity coupling yield displayed a maximum value of  <dig>  % in dioxane immobilization method while the aqueous method achieved a maximum value of  <dig>  %.
in this work different immobilization media were compared towards the synthetic and hydrolytic activities of immobilized trypsin as model enzyme on magnetic micro-particles.
the dioxane immobilization method showed a higher activity coupling yield by factor  <dig> in peptide synthesis with a maximum activity coupling yield of  <dig>  % compared to aqueous immobilization.
for this reason an immobilization method must be selected depending on immobilisate’s demands.
by immobilizing trypsin in dioxane, a beneficial effect on the synthetic trypsin activity resilience compared to aqueous immobilization medium was shown.
