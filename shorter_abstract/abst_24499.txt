hypothyroid treatment impaired performance measures in cold-acclimated but not warm-acclimated individuals, whereas supplementation with both th metabolites restored performance.
we measured whole-animal responses , tissue-specific regulatory enzyme activities, gene expression, and free levels of t <dig> and t <dig>
th could either induce or repress responses, depending on the actual temperature and thermal history of the animal.
we therefore aimed to determine whether th regulates thermal acclimation in the zebrafish .
we found that both t <dig> and the lesser-known t <dig>  regulate thermal acclimation in an ectotherm.
we suggest that the properties that underlie the role of th in thermal acclimation  may have predisposed this hormone for a regulatory role in the evolution of endothermy.
thyroid hormone  is best known for its role in development in animals, and for its control of metabolic heat production  during cold acclimation in mammals.
it is unknown whether the regulatory role of th in thermogenesis is derived in mammals, or whether th also mediates thermal responses in earlier vertebrates.
the molecular mechanisms underpinning th action are very similar across vertebrates, suggesting that th may also regulate thermal responses in ectotherms.
