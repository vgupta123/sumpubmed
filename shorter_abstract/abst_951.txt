to circumvent this problem, we have developed a simplified method for sequencing chloroplast genomes, using fosmids selected from a total cellular dna library.
the h. akashiwo chloroplast genomes share little synteny with other algal chloroplast genomes sequenced to date.
the fosmid cloning technique reveals that both strains contain an isomeric chloroplast dna population resulting from an inversion of their single copy domains.
although both ccmp <dig> and nies <dig> chloroplast dnas contains  <dig> genes, multiple nucleotide polymorphisms are present in both coding and intergenic regions.
application of this method has provided new insights into chloroplast genome architecture, gene content and evolution within the stramenopile cluster.
two genes of interest in h. akashiwo, not previously reported in any chloroplast genome, include tyrc, a tyrosine recombinase, which we hypothesize may be a result of a lateral gene transfer event, and an unidentified  <dig> amino acid protein, which we hypothesize serves as a g-protein-coupled receptor.
surprisingly, chloroplast genome sequences are available only for diatoms, representing two  of approximately  <dig> classes of algae that comprise this taxonomic cluster.
the technique has been used to sequence chloroplast dna of two heterosigma akashiwo strains.
a universal challenge to chloroplast genome sequencing studies is the retrieval of highly purified dna in quantities sufficient for analytical processing.
this raphidophyte has served as a model system for studies of stramenopile chloroplast biogenesis and evolution.
h. akashiwo strain ccmp <dig>  chloroplast dna is  <dig>  bp in size with a  <dig> -bp inverted repeat, whereas nies <dig>  chloroplast dna is  <dig>  bp in size and has an inverted repeat of  <dig>  bp.
both strains contain multiple small inverted and tandem repeats, non-randomly distributed within the genomes.
