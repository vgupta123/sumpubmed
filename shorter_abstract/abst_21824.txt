the ces gene locus is flanked by genetic regions with high homology to virulence plasmids of b. cereus, bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus anthracis.
pfge and southern hybridization showed that the ces genes are restricted to emetic b. cereus and indeed located on a  <dig> kb megaplasmid, which has high similarities to pxo1-like plasmids.
the ces genes are restricted to emetic toxin producers, but pxo1-like plasmids are also present in emetic-like strains.
the ces gene cluster that is located on a pxo1-like virulence plasmid represents, beside the insecticidal and the anthrax toxins, a third type of b. cereus group toxins encoded on megaplasmids.
these data might indicate the presence of an ancient plasmid in b. cereus which has acquired different virulence genes over time.
cereulide, a depsipeptide structurally related to valinomycin, is responsible for the emetic type of gastrointestinal disease caused by bacillus cereus.
due to the unusual structure of the hydroxyl acid incorporating enzyme modules of ces, substantial biochemical efforts will be required to dissect the complete biochemical pathway of cereulide synthesis.
the enzyme modules responsible for incorporation of the hydroxyl acids showed an unusual structure while the modules responsible for the activation of the amino acids ala and val showed the typical domain organization of nrps.
the  <dig> kb ces gene cluster comprises  <dig> cdss and includes, besides the typical nrps genes like a phosphopantetheinyl transferase and two cdss encoding enzyme modules for the activation and incorporation of monomers in the growing peptide chain, a cds encoding a putative hydrolase in the upstream region and an abc transporter in the downstream part.
