when expression levels of  <dig> other genes were measured in aa-arna generated from a universal reference rna, qpcr sensitivity and efficiency were decreased.
to overcome this limitation, we modified the reverse transcription  protocol that generates cdna from aa-arna as follows: addition of a denaturation step and 2-min incubation at room temperature to improve random primers annealing, a transcription initiation step to improve rt, and a final treatment with rnase h to degrade remaining rna.
finally, qpcr results significantly correlated with microarrays.
to test this possibility, we used an ongoing study of our laboratory aiming at identifying new biomarkers of graft rejection by the transcriptomic analysis of blood cells from brain-dead organ donors.
tested on aa-arna from  <dig> brain-dead organ donors, rt optimization provided a gain of  <dig>  cycles .
validation of microarrays data by quantitative real-time pcr  is often limited by the low amount of available rna.
tested on universal reference aa-arna, these modifications provided a gain of  <dig>  cq  and an increase of qpcr efficiency .
we present here an optimized rt protocol for validation of microarrays by qpcr from aa-arna.
this raised the possibility to perform validation experiments on the amplified amino allyl labeled rna  leftover from microarrays.
