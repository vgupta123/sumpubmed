sequencing of a novel fourth vtg transcript in labrid species, and the presence of duplicated paralogs in certain model organisms supports the notion that lineage-specific gene duplications frequently occur in teleosts.
the differential expression of the labrid vtg genes are further consistent with the notion that neofunctionalized aa-type vtgs are important determinants of the pelagic or benthic character of the eggs in acanthomorph teleosts.
the differential expression and latent neofunctionalization of vtg genes in acanthomorph teleosts is an adaptive feature associated with oocyte hydration and spawning in the marine environment.
we argue that the vertebrate vtg gene cluster originated in proto-chromosome m, but that vtg genes have subsequently duplicated and rearranged following whole genome duplications.
the data show that the vtg gene cluster is more conserved between acanthomorph teleosts and tetrapods, than in ostariophysan teleosts such as the zebrafish.
the vertebrate vtg gene cluster existed prior to the separation of sarcopterygii from actinopterygii > <dig> million years ago, a period associated with the second round of whole genome duplication.
by integrating phylogenetics of novel vtg transcripts from old and modern teleosts with syntenic analyses of all available genomic variants of non-metatherian vertebrates we identify the gene orthologies between the sarcopterygii  and actinopterygii .
