the results from our study clearly indicated that b. manatorum individuals consume turtle skin.
the pathological effects of this agent and the potential implications in sea turtle conservation and management are discussed.
the gut contents of b. manatorum reacted positively for cytokeratin, indicating consumption of turtle skin.
all the individuals  were affected by severe copepod load and presented different degrees of external macroscopic skin lesions.
it sheds light on the type of life style that b. manatorum has developed with its hosts, particularly turtles;  it makes a cautionary note of the potential health risks associated with b. manatorum in sea turtles under captivity conditions and in the wild, and  it provides data on effective treatments against b. manatorum.
we report for the first time a massive infestation of the copepod b. manatorum and subsequent acute mortality in a group of loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings.
the ventral area of front flippers, axillar and pericloacal skin were mostly affected, and were the main parasite distribution regions.
diseases associated to external parasitosis are scarcely reported in sea turtles.
during the last decades several organism have been documented as a part of normal epibiont community connected to sea turtles.
