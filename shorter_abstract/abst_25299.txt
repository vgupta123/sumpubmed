the strong antidepressant-like effects of the potent trpv <dig> plus cb <dig> agonist ar, which has been reported to cause part of its trpv1-mimetic and cannabimimetic effects presumably via non-trpv <dig> or non-cb <dig> mechanisms support a contribution from other sites of action which may play a therapeutically important role in the treatment of nc abuse.
in the present study, the effects of trpv <dig> ligands with or without affinity for cb <dig> receptors were examined on nc-induced depression-like behavioral alterations in a mouse model in order to elucidate the "antidepressant-like" contributions of trpv <dig> receptors against the nc-induced "depression" observed in various types of tobacco abuse.
repeated subcutaneous nc treatments , like repeated immobilization stress  , caused depression-like behavioral alterations in both the forced swimming  and the tail suspension  tests, at the  <dig> h time point after the last treatment.
in both nc and im groups, the trpv <dig> agonists capsaicin  and olvanil  administered intraperitoneally provided significant antidepressant-like attenuation against these behavioral alterations, whereas the trpv <dig> antagonist capsazepine  did not attenuate any depression-like behaviors.
the antidepressant-like effects of trpv <dig> agonists shown in the present study suggest a characteristic involvement of trpv <dig> receptors in nc-induced depression-like behaviors, similar to those caused by im.
