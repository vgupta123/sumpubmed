this lowers the prediction accuracy of these methods, limiting their usability in practice.
netter is a flexible system which can be applied in unison with any method producing a ranking from omics data.
we propose a post-processing algorithm which is applicable to any confidence ranking of regulatory interactions obtained from a network inference method which can use, inter alia, graphlets and several graph-invariant properties to re-rank the links into a more accurate prediction.
however, the structural properties of the predicted network do not resemble those typical for a gene regulatory network, as most algorithms only take into account connections found in the data and do not include known graph properties in their inference process.
many algorithms have been developed to infer the topology of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data.

furthermore, netter compares favorably to other post-processing algorithms and is not restricted to correlation-like predictions.
lastly, we demonstrate that the performance increase is robust for a wide range of parameter settings.
community prediction inferred from real expression data is further improved.
it can be tailored to specific prior knowledge by expert users but can also be applied in general uses cases.
concluding, we believe that netter is an interesting second step in the network inference process to further increase the quality of prediction.
