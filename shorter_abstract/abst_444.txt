one such lipoprotein, ompp <dig>  is homologous to the outer membrane lipoprotein e  of h. influenzae.
in h. influenzae, e  stimulates production of bactericidal and protective antibodies and contributes to pathogenesis by facilitating acquisition of the essential nutrients heme and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide .
we next constructed and characterized an isogenic ompp <dig> mutant, designated 35000hpompp <dig>  in h. ducreyi strain 35000hp.
these results indicate that expression of ompp <dig> in not necessary for h. ducreyi to initiate disease or progress to pustule formation in humans.
hyperimmune mouse serum raised against purified, recombinant ompp <dig> did not promote bactericidal killing of 35000hp or phagocytosis by j774a.
to test whether ompp <dig> was necessary for virulence in humans, eight healthy adults were experimentally infected.
the overall parent and mutant pustule formation rates were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively .
haemophilus ducreyi, which causes the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, expresses a number of lipoproteins during human infection.
bacterial lipoproteins often play important roles in pathogenesis and can stimulate protective immune responses.
here, we tested the hypothesis that, like its homolog, h. ducreyi ompp <dig> contributes to virulence and stimulates production of bactericidal antibodies.
we determined that ompp <dig> is broadly conserved among clinical isolates of h. ducreyi.
our data suggest that, unlike e , h. ducreyi ompp <dig> is not a suitable vaccine candidate.
ompp <dig> may be dispensable for virulence because of redundant mechanisms in h. ducreyi for heme acquisition and nad utilization.
