within the context of biological pathways, the biopax initiative, part of a broader movement towards the standardization and integration of life science databases, forms a necessary prerequisite for its successful application of e-science in health care and life science research.
nowhere is the demand greater than in the semantic integration of these data.
semantic web tools and technologies afford the chance to achieve this semantic integration.
since pathway knowledge is central to much of the scientific research today it is a good test-bed for semantic integration.
once these semantic weaknesses are addressed, it will be possible to integrate pathway information in a manner that would be useful in e-science.
