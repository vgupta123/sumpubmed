we mapped 18 tb drug resistance gene products to  <dig> metabolic pathways critical for mycobacterial growth and latent tb by screening publicly available microarray data.
one of the putative targets, rv <dig>  was analysed by modelling its three dimensional structure and docking potential inhibitors.
we focused on metabolic pathways associated with bacterial drug resistance and proteins unique to pathogenic bacteria to identify novel putative drug targets.
a structural model was generated for rv <dig>  subjected to molecular dynamic simulation, and identified  <dig> compounds with affinities better than that for the ligand cytidine-5′-monophosphate .
nine putative targets, rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv <dig>  rv1622c, rv1456c and rv2421c, were found to be essential, to lack a close human homolog, and to share >67 % sequence identity and >87 % query coverage with mycobacterial orthologs.
hower, these resources do not necessarily map to metabolic pathways and the targets are not involved in dormancy.
in this study, we specifically identify drug resistance pathways to allow known drug resistant mutations in one target to be offset by inhibiting another enzyme of the same metabolic pathway.
