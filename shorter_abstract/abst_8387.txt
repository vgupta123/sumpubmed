here we introduce threshold adjacency statistics, the essence which is to threshold the image and to count the number of above threshold pixels with a given number of above threshold pixels adjacent.
the genomic revolution has led to rapid growth in sequencing of genes and proteins, and attention is now turning to the function of the encoded proteins.
they remove the need for cropping of individual cells from images, and are an order of magnitude faster to calculate than other commonly used statistics while providing comparable or better classification accuracy, both essential requirements for application to large-scale approaches.
while image statistics have proved highly successful in distinguishing localisation, commonly used measures suffer from being relatively slow to compute, and often require cells to be individually selected from experimental images, thus limiting both throughput and the range of potential applications.
threshold adjacency statistics have the potential to greatly extend the scale and range of applications of image statistics in computational image analysis.
classification accuracies of  <dig> % and  <dig> % are obtained on the endogenous and transfected sets, respectively.
threshold adjacency statistics are applied to classification of protein sub-cellular localization images.
threshold adjacency statistics are found to provide comparable or higher accuracy than other commonly used statistics while being an order of magnitude faster to calculate.
further, threshold adjacency statistics in combination with haralick measures give accuracies of  <dig> % and  <dig> % on the endogenous and transfected sets, respectively.
