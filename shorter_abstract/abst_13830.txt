our analysis was carried out at four levels â€“ the nucleotide level , the gene level, the protein level , and the phenotype level.
our study is a first attempt on mining of gwa data to examine genetic associations between different diseases.
our results show that crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type  <dig> diabetes share evidence of genetic associations at all levels of analysis, offering strong molecular support for the current grouping of the diseases.
genome-wide association studies prove to be a powerful approach to identify the genetic basis of different human diseases.
on the other hand, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type  <dig> diabetes, despite being considered as a natural group with potential aetiological overlap, do not show any evidence of shared genetic basis at all levels.
the positive result is apparently not a coincidence and hence demonstrates the promising use of our approach.
we studied the relationship between seven diseases characterized in a previous genome-wide association study by the wellcome trust case control consortium.
