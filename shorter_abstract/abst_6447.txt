hypothesized relationships among these taxa greatly impact interpretations of cnidarian character evolution.
the expansion of mitogenomic data along with improvements in phylogenetic inference methods and use of additional nuclear markers will further enhance our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships and character evolution within cnidaria.
our phylogenetic analyses based on a mitochogenomic dataset support many prior hypotheses, including monophyly of hexacorallia, octocorallia, medusozoa, cubozoa, staurozoa, hydrozoa, carybdeida, chirodropida, and hydroidolina, but reject the monophyly of anthozoa, indicating that the octocorallia + medusozoa relationship is not the result of sampling bias, as proposed earlier.
cnidarian mitochondrial genomic data contain phylogenetic signal informative for understanding the evolutionary history of this phylum.
further, our analyses contradict scyphozoa , acraspeda , as well as the hypothesis that staurozoa is the sister group to all the other medusozoans.
by rejecting the traditional acraspeda and scyphozoa hypotheses, these analyses suggest that the shared morphological characters in these groups are plesiomorphies, originated in the branch leading to medusozoa.
we expanded the sampling of cnidarian mitochondrial genomes, particularly from medusozoa, to reevaluate phylogenetic relationships within cnidaria.
