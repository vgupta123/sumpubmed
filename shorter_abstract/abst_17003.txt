we present a new automatic algorithm to segment and simultaneously classify cell nuclei in 3d/4d images.
this algorithm can correctly segment nuclei even when they are touching, and remains effective under temporal and spatial intensity variations.
studying how individual cells spatially and temporally organize within the embryo is a fundamental issue in modern developmental biology to better understand the first stages of embryogenesis.
segmentation and classification results of three complete datasets are presented.
segmentation relies on training samples that are interactively provided by the user and on an iterative thresholding process.
the segmentation is coupled to a classification of nuclei according to cell cycle phases, allowing biologists to quantify the effect of genetic perturbations and drug treatments.
in order to perform high-throughput analyses in three-dimensional microscopic images, it is essential to be able to automatically segment, classify and track cell nuclei.
