other features include: novel algorithms to compute sequence conservation, mapping conservation scores to a 3d structure in jmol, displaying secondary structure elements, and sorting sequences by residue composition.
the annotations can be combined with sophisticated analysis to test hypothesis that relate to sequence, structure and function.
consequently, multiple sequence alignments are routinely used to identify trends that relate to function.
here we describe the release of pfaat version  <dig> , a tool for editing, analyzing, and annotating multiple sequence alignments.
once a multiple sequence alignment is populated with sequence annotations, sequences can be easily selected and sorted through a sophisticated search dialog.
residue annotations are also searchable, and allow one to quickly select alignment columns for further sequence analysis, e.g.
residue annotations are accessible from the alignment viewer and are typically used to designate binding sites or properties for a particular residue.
the sequence annotations are accessible from the alignment and tree, where they are typically used to label sequences or hyperlink them to related databases.
sequence annotations can be created manually or extracted automatically from uniprot entries.
the selected sequences can be further analyzed using statistical methods that explicitly model relationships between the sequence annotations and residue properties.
pfaat provides a framework whereby end-users can specify knowledge for a protein family in the form of annotation.
