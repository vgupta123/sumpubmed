other rearrangements were found to affect genes in pathways involved in epigenetic regulation, mitosis and signal transduction, underscoring their potential role in breast tumorigenesis.
to identify novel somatic chromosomal rearrangements, we determined the genome structures of  <dig> hormone-receptor negative breast tumors by long-insert mate pair massively parallel sequencing.
moreover, downregulation of ddx <dig> in breast cancer cells lead to an increased frequency of apoptotic nuclear morphology.
