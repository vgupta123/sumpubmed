both trna families and ribosomal rnas show composite substitution pathways.
comparative analyses showed that neuropterid mitochondrial protein-coding genes experienced complex evolutionary histories, involving features ranging from codon usage to rate of substitution, that make them potential markers for population genetics/phylogenetics studies at different taxonomic ranks.
the  <dig> trnas show variable substitution patterns in neuropterida, with higher sequence conservation in genes located on the Î± strand.
the control region in neuropterida, as in other insects, is fast-evolving genomic region, characterized by at-rich motifs.
the l. macaronius genome shows the lowest a+t content  among known neuropterid genomes.
comparisons among endopterygotan mitochondrial genomes showed that a+t content and at/gc-skews exhibit a broad range of variation among  <dig> analyzed taxa.
the new genome shares many features with known neuropteran genomes but differs in its low a+t content.
it includes the entire set of  <dig> genes usually present in animal mitochondrial genomes.
in the present work, the mitochondrial genome of the ascalaphid owlfly libelloides macaronius is described and compared with the known neuropterid mitochondrial genomes: megaloptera, neuroptera and raphidioptera.
inferred secondary structures for neuropterid rrns and rrnl genes largely agree with those known for other insects.
the mitochondrial genome of l. macaronius is a circular molecule  <dig>  bp long.
for the first time, a model is provided for domain i of an insect rrnl.
the gene order of this newly sequenced genome is unique among neuroptera and differs from the ancestral type of insects in the translocation of trnc.
these analyses are further extended to other endopterygotan orders.
