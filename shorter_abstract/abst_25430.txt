functional analysis of the deregulated transcripts indicated changes of genes involved in cell death, inflammatory response, lipid metabolism, steroidogenesis, blood-testis-barrier formation and maintenance, as well as spermatogenesis failure.
in order to unravel the molecular basis of global testis dysfunction in ks patients, we performed a transcriptome analysis on testis biopsies obtained from  <dig> azoospermic non-mosaic ks patients and  <dig> control subjects.
the increased lcs steroidogenic function together with the impairment of inflammatory pathways and btb structure, result in increased apoptosis.
the large majority of the deregulated transcripts were expressed by sertoli cells  and leydig cells .
the analysis found that, compared to controls, ks patients showed the differential up- and down-expression of  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts.
