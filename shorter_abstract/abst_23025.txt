each caucasian genome has more than four million single nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, copy number variants, and structural variants.
in addition, vtc was written to be easily extended with new tools.
we developed new software called the variant tool chest  to provide much needed tools to work with vcf files.
vtc provides a variety of tools for manipulating, comparing, and analyzing vcf files beyond the functionality of existing tools.
variant tool chest brings new and important functionality that complements and integrates well with existing software.
