as with vertebrates, the drosophila heart arises from lateral mesoderm that migrates medially to meet their contralateral partners, to then assemble a midline vessel.
apical accumulation of integrins is enhanced by robo, and reciprocally, apicalisation of luminal factors like slit and robo requires integrin function.
subsequent to migration, integrin is required for normal cardioblast alignment and lumen formation.
integrins are required for normal levels of leading edge membrane motility.
during migration, integrins are among the first proteins restricted to the presumptive luminal domain of cardioblasts.
key to this process is the establishment of a new luminal domain on the cell surface, generally from the apical domain of a migratory cell.
