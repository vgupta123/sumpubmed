in this study we present a simple bioinformatics methodology that uses public, carefully curated microarray data and the mutual information algorithm aracne in order to obtain a database of transcriptional interactions.
in contrast to previous efforts to obtain root trns, that have focused on particular functional modules or tissues, our root transcriptional interactions provide an overview of the transcriptional pathways present in arabidopsis thaliana roots and will likely yield a plethora of novel hypotheses to be tested experimentally.
we further show that these networks are a powerful tool to integrate and analyze high-throughput expression data, as exemplified by our analysis of a short root induction time-course microarray dataset, and are a reliable source for the prediction of novel root gene functions.
this study demonstrates that network inference using carefully curated microarray data yields reliable trn architectures.
in particular, we used our database to predict novel genes involved in root secondary cell-wall synthesis and identified the mads-box tf xal1/agl <dig> as an unexpected participant in this process.
however, a vast amount of data from public microarray experiments is available, which can be subject to inference algorithms in order to recover reliable trn architectures.
