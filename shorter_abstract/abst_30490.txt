recently, it has been published that the conversion of β-carotene into astaxanthin requires only one enzyme, astaxanthin synthase or crts, encoded by crts gene.
the carotenoid composition of the transformants was altered in relation to the wild type strain.
two transformants, cbstr and t <dig>  were obtained by deleting the crtr gene and inserting a hygromycin b resistance cassette.
we determined the structural organization of the crtr gene and its location in the yeast electrophoretic karyotype.
the yeast xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous synthesizes astaxanthin, a carotenoid with high commercial interest.
in this work, a crtr gene was isolated from x. dendrorhous yeast, which encodes a cytochrome p <dig> reductase  that provides crts with the necessary electrons for substrate oxygenation.
in addition to the crts gene, x. dendrorhous requires a novel gene, crtr, for the conversion of β-carotene to astaxanthin.
