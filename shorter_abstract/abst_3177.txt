the implications of these gene mutations and expression changes and their underlying mechanisms should be investigated in the future.
in recent decades, e. faecium has been recognised as an opportunistic pathogen that causes diseases such as neonatal meningitis, urinary tract infections, bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis and diverticulitis.
comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses showed that differentially expressed genes or proteins were involved with replication, recombination, repair, cell wall biogenesis, glycometabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, predicted general function and energy production/conversion.
this study analysed the comprehensive genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic changes of an e. faecium mutant from subcultures that were loaded on the shenzhou- <dig> spacecraft.
e. faecium could be taken into space with astronauts and exposed to the space environment.
the genomic comparison revealed that dpra, a recombination-mediator gene, and arpu, a gene associated with cell wall growth, were mutated.
for a long time, enterococcus faecium was considered a harmless commensal of the mammalian gastrointestinal  tract and was used as a probiotic in fermented foods.
we hope that the current exploration of multiple “-omics” analyses of this e. faecium mutant will provide clues for future studies on this opportunistic pathogen.
an e. faecium mutant with biochemical features that are different from those of the wild-type strain was obtained from subculture after flight on the shenzhou- <dig> spacecraft.
thus, it is necessary to observe the phenotypic and molecular changes of e. faecium after spaceflight.
