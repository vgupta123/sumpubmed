for automated querying via custom software, we offer a web service and an exemplary client application.
furthermore, curation of combined dictionaries considerably increases size and decreases ambiguity.
we analyzed the degree of ambiguity of gene and protein names within and between dictionaries, to a lexicon of common english words and domain-related non-gene terms, and we compared different data sources in terms of size of extracted dictionaries and overlap of synonyms between those.
furthermore, it shows that, despite considerable efforts of co-curation, the overlap of synonyms in different data sources is rather moderate and that the degree of ambiguity of gene names with common english words and domain-related non-gene terms varies depending on the considered organism.
the study shows that the number of genes/proteins and synonyms covered in individual databases varies significantly for a given organism, and that the degree of ambiguity of synonyms varies significantly between different organisms.
in conclusion, these results indicate that the combination of data contained in different databases allows the generation of gene and protein name dictionaries that contain significantly more used names than dictionaries obtained from individual data sources.
frequently, several alternative names are in use for biological objects such as genes and proteins.
we compiled five gene and protein name dictionaries for each of the five model organisms  from different organism-specific and general public databases.
