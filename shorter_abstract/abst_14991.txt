at this point males and females demonstrate comparable heart rates that are 50% lower than adult mice.
as genetic links to these disorders are established and transgenic mouse models produced in efforts to understand and treat them, there is a surprising lack of information on electrocardiograms  and ecg abnormalities in neonate mice.
this should serve to be of broad utility, facilitating further investigations into development of a diverse group of diseases and therapeutics in preclinical mouse studies.
electrocardiography remains the best diagnostic tool and therapeutic biomarker for a spectrum of pediatric diseases involving cardiac or autonomic nervous system defects.
upon weaning fvb/n females quickly develop slower heart rates than males, though pr intervals are comparable between sexes until a later age.
here, we use a non-invasive system to characterize development of the heart rate and electrocardiogram throughout the growth of conscious neonate fvb/n mice.
this suggests separate developmental events may contribute to these gender differences in electrocardiography.
neonatal mice exhibit very low heart rate variability.
within  <dig> days of birth pr, qrs and qtc interval durations are near adult values while heart rate continues to increase until weaning.
we provide insight with a new level of detail to the natural course of heart rate establishment in neonate mice.
