the high flux of energy into carbohydrate and storage protein synthesis in guar seeds was reflected by a high representation of genes annotated as involved in signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism, chaperone and proteolytic processes, and translation and ribosome structure.
guar gum is a galactomannan, consisting of a linear -β-linked d-mannan backbone with single-unit, -linked, α-d-galactopyranosyl side chains.
the endosperm of guar seed is a rich source of mucilage or gum, which forms a viscous gel in cold water, and is used as an emulsifier, thickener and stabilizer in a wide range of foods and industrial applications.
among the seed storage proteins, the most abundant contig represented a conglutin accounting for  <dig> % of the total ests from both libraries.
guar unigenes involved in galactomannan metabolism were identified.
to better understand regulation of guar seed development and galactomannan metabolism we created cdna libraries and a resulting est dataset from different developmental stages of guar seeds.
a database of  <dig>  guar seed ests was constructed, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  ests derived from cdna libraries i and ii, respectively.
library i was constructed from seeds at an early developmental stage , and library ii from seeds at 30– <dig> daf.
the present est collection and its annotation provide a resource for understanding guar seed biology and galactomannan metabolism.
