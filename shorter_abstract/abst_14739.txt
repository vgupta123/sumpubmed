the availability of hundreds of bacterial genomes allowed a comparative genomic study of the type vi secretion system , recently discovered as being involved in pathogenesis.
furthermore, the sequence analysis of the vgrg proteins, proposed to be exported in a t6ss-dependent way, confirmed that some c-terminal regions possess domains showing similarities with adhesins or proteins with enzymatic functions.
based on these results, new functional hypotheses concerning the assembly and function of t6ss proteins are proposed.
phylogenetic reconstruction based on the core genes showed that lateral transfer of the t6ss is probably its major way of dissemination among pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria.
this genome wide analysis allowed the identification of a set of  <dig> proteins constituting the t6ss protein core and a set of conserved accessory proteins.
by combining comparative and phylogenetic approaches using more than  <dig> prokaryotic genomes, we characterized the global t6ss genetic structure in terms of conservation, evolution and genomic organization.
