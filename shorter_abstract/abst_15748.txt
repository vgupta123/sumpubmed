there was caudal displacement of the dilated caecum in  <dig> patients, torsion around the longitudinal axis in  <dig> and retroflexion in  <dig>  the most important laboratory finding was hypocalcaemia, which occurred in  <dig> % of cases.
in  <dig> % of cases, swinging and/or percussion auscultation were positive on the right side, and  <dig> % had little or no faeces in the rectum.
conservative treatment is not rewarding in cattle considered surgical candidates with suspected caecal torsion or retroflexion and surgery should not be delayed in these patients.
swinging and percussion auscultation as well as rectal examination are important diagnostic tools.
this retrospective study describes the clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcome of  <dig> cattle with caecal dilatation.
caecal dilatation could be diagnosed via rectal palpation in  <dig>  cattle.
caecal dilatation can usually be diagnosed based on clinical findings and treated conservatively or surgically.
because of a grave prognosis,  <dig> cases were euthanased or slaughtered intraoperatively.
of the  <dig> cattle,  <dig>  initially received conservative therapy  and  <dig>  underwent surgical treatment.
of the  <dig> cattle that received conservative treatment,  <dig> did not respond after one to two days of therapy and required surgical treatment.
of the  <dig> patients,  <dig>  responded to either conservative or surgical treatment and were cured, and  <dig> were euthanased or slaughtered.
ruminal motility was reduced or absent in  <dig> % of cattle.
the general condition and demeanor were abnormal in  <dig> % of cases, and  <dig> % of the patients had colic.
ten patients were slaughtered or euthanased after the initial physical examination.
