we present a gpu implementation to accelerate pairwise statistical significance estimation of local sequence alignment using standard substitution matrices.
harvesting the high performance of modern gpus is a promising approach to accelerate pairwise statistical significance estimation for local sequence alignment.
we further extend the parallelization technique to estimate pairwise statistical significance using position-specific substitution matrices, which has earlier demonstrated significantly better sequence comparison accuracy than using standard substitution matrices.
by carefully studying the algorithm's data access characteristics, we developed a tile-based scheme that can produce a contiguous data access in the gpu global memory and sustain a large number of threads to achieve a high gpu occupancy.
pairwise statistical significance has been recognized to be able to accurately identify related sequences, which is a very important cornerstone procedure in numerous bioinformatics applications.
we observe end-to-end speedups of nearly  <dig>  × using single-gpu tesla c <dig> gpu  over the cpu implementation using intel© core™i <dig> cpu  <dig> processor.
