arylamine n-acetyltransferases  are important drug- and carcinogen-metabolising enzymes that catalyse the transfer of an acetyl group from a donor, such as acetyl coenzyme a, to an aromatic or heterocyclic amine, hydrazine, hydrazide or n-hydroxylamine acceptor substrate.
for example, nat from mycobacterium tuberculosis has been proposed to have a role in cell wall lipid biosynthesis, and is therefore of interest as a potential drug target.
to date there have been no studies investigating the kinetic mechanism of a bacterial nat enzyme.
we have determined that nat from pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has been described as a model for nat from m. tuberculosis, follows a ping pong bi bi kinetic mechanism.
this is the first reported study investigating the kinetic mechanism of a bacterial nat enzyme.
the true kinetic parameters for the nat-catalysed acetylation of 5-aminosalicylic acid with acetyl coenzyme a as the co-factor have been established, validating earlier approximations.
we also describe substrate inhibition by 5-aminosalicylic acid, in which the substrate binds both to the free form of the enzyme and the acetyl coenzyme a-enzyme complex in non-productive reaction pathways.
additionally, the methods used herein can be applied to investigations of the interactions of nat enzymes with new chemical entities which are nat ligands.
