this study provides evidence that androgen masculinization results in a marked dysregulation of early gene expression profiles when compared to natural testicular or ovarian differentiation.
go annotations 'sex differentiation' and 'steroid biosynthesis' were enriched in a cluster of genes with high expression levels only in control males.
gene ontology  data mining revealed that androgen treatment triggers a marked down-regulation of genes potentially involved in early oogenesis processes , an up-regulation of the translation machinery  along with a down-regulation of proteolysis .
interestingly none of these genes were stimulated by the masculinizing androgen treatment.
genes considered as muscle fibres markers  and genes annotated as structural constituents of the extracellular matrix  or related to meiosis  were found significantly enriched in the two clusters of genes specifically up-regulated in androgen-treated female gonads.
based on these results we suggest that, in our experimental conditions, androgen masculinization proceeds mainly through an early inhibition of female development.
the aim of this study was to identify the main effects of an androgen masculinizing treatment  on gonadal gene expression profiles of an all-female genetic population of trout.
these genes were classified in  <dig> k-means clusters of temporally correlated expression profiles.
