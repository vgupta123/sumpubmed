high observed infection rates and among-population variation in natural systems can consequently not be explained if defense mechanisms are absent and when transmission efficiency is perfect.
on the other hand, deterministic 'curing'  can occur under conditions of low dispersal, e.g.
however, high and stable infection rates can be maintained in metapopulations over a considerable spectrum of conditions favoring intermediate levels of dispersal in the host.
no fitness compensations were built into the model for male killing endosymbionts, but they spread as a group beneficial trait.
conditions that favor the evolution of high dispersal in hosts.
under low environmental stochasticity and high dispersal mortality.
emergent feedbacks through increased evolutionary stable dispersal rates provide an alternative explanation for both, the high male-killing endosymbiont infection rates and the high among-population variation in local infection rates reported for some natural systems.
because of the reproductive manipulation, we expect them to have an effect on the evolution of host dispersal rates.
by simulating the host-endosymbiont dynamics in an individual-based metapopulation model we show that male killing endosymbionts increase host dispersal rates.
