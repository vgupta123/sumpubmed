besides this dramatic situation, data on the diversity of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex  strains causing this epidemic in this area are only sparsely available.
the population diversity was high with two previously described m. africanum lineages  and seven m. tuberculosis lineages .
here we analyzed the population structure of strains from sierra leone with a special focus on the prevalence of m. africanum.
<dig>  million new cases every year.
the population structure of mtbc strains shows an intriguing diversity raising the question of possible consequences for tb epidemic and for the introduction of new diagnostic tests or treatment strategies in west africa.
a total of  <dig> strains isolated from smear positive cases registered for re-treatment in the western area and kenema districts in years 2003/ <dig> were investigated by susceptibility testing  and molecular typing .
furthermore, two new m. tuberculosis genotypes sierra leone- <dig>  and - <dig>  were found.
resistance rates in sierra leone have reached an alarming level.
