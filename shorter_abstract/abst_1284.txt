hemosiderin deposits were observed the lamina propria of endometrium in uterus and the red pulp of spleen.
indirect bilirubin content and reticulocyte numbers were increased in swainsonine-treated f <dig> and f <dig> generation mice compared to control group .
red blood cells, hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin levels were significantly decreased in f <dig> and f <dig> mice compared with the control group .
damage to liver, uterus and spleen, as well as hematological changes, are observable before neurological symptoms present.
lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase content in f0-i and f0-ii mice were significantly increased compared with f0-iv group mice .
swainsonine was administered to f <dig> and f <dig> mice by intraperitoneal injection before, during and after pregnancy at the following doses:  <dig>  mg/kg bw,  <dig>  mg/kg bw,  <dig>  mg/kg bw and 0 mg/kg bw.
livestock that consume locoweed exhibit multiple neurological symptoms, including dispirited behavior, staggered gait, trembling, ataxia, impaired reproductive function and cellular vacuolar degeneration of multiple tissues due to toxicity from plant-derived alkaloids such as swainsonine.
