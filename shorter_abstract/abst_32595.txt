in addition, these genome resources provide capability to determine allele specific gene regulation among interspecies hybrids produced by crossing any of the three species that are known to produce progeny predisposed to tumor development.
in addition, a survey of transposable elements allowed us to deduce an ancestral te landscape, uncovered potential active tes and document a recent burst of tes during evolution of this genus.
two new xiphophorus genomes and their corresponding transcriptomes were efficiently assembled, the former using a novel guided assembly approach.
the recent availability of the x. maculatus reference genome assembly now provides unprecedented opportunities for novel and exciting comparative research studies among xiphophorus species.
we present sequencing, assembly and annotation of two new genomes representing xiphophorus couchianus and xiphophorus hellerii.
use of various interspecies hybrids to investigate the genetics underlying spontaneous and induced tumorigenesis has resulted in the development and maintenance of pedigreed xiphophorus lines specifically bred for research.
xiphophorus fishes are represented by  <dig> live-bearing species of tropical fish that express many attributes  that have made attractive research models for over 85Â years.
three assembled genome sequences within this single vertebrate order of new world live-bearing fishes will accelerate our understanding of relationship between environmental adaptation and genome evolution.
