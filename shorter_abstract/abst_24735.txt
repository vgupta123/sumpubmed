in silico analysis of the promoter sequences available for a subset of the bacterium-primed genes identified several hormones, including iaa and aba as potential regulators of transcription.
a previous study distinguished bacterium-responsive genes from bacterium-primed genes, distinguished by the fact that the latter are only up-regulated when both p. fluorescens and the pathogen fusarium culmorum are present.
application of iaa, but not of aba reduced both disease severity and yield loss caused by f. culmorum, but neither hormone affect in vitro fungal growth.
this hypothesis was validated by the fact that pre-application of iaa reduced both symptoms and yield loss asssociated with the disease.
hormones, including the auxin indole acetic acid  and abscisic acid , are essential regulators of a multitude of biological functions, including plant responses to biotic and abiotic stressors.
both iaa and aba are involved in the p. fluorescens-mediated control of fhb disease of barley.
gene expression studies also support the hypothesis that iaa plays a role in the primed response to f. culmorum.
treatment with the bacterium or pathogen resulted in increased iaa and aba levels in head tissue; both microbes had additive effects on the accumulation of iaa but not of aba.
this is the first evidence that iaa plays a role in the control of fhb disease and in the bacterial priming of host defences.
