a comparison of all three treatment variations and the reference treatment revealed a significant difference for the immediate efficacy , but not for the sustained efficacy .
a post-hoc-test for the immediate efficacy indicated a significant difference between methods a and c .
recently, a propanol-based hand rub has been described to exceed the efficacy requirements of the european standard en  <dig> in only  <dig>  min significantly.
we have investigated a propanol-based hand rub  in three variations: with  and without  a  <dig> min hand wash before the disinfection of  <dig>  min with immediate sampling after the disinfection; and  without a hand wash before the disinfection but with sampling  <dig> min after the disinfection.
an application of the propanol-based hand rub for  <dig>  min after  <dig> min hand wash fulfills the efficacy requirements of en  <dig>  the efficacy can be improved to some extent by omitting the preceding hand wash and by awaiting the evaporation of the alcohol which is clinical practice anyway.
hence, none of the treatment variations was significantly less effective than the reference treatment.
based on our data hands should not be routinely washed before the disinfection period unless there is a good reason for it such as visible soiling.
method c revealed the best efficacy .
the preceding hand wash has the most negative effect on the immediate effect.
the efficacy of the three variations was compared to the reference treatment of en  <dig>  all experiments were performed in a latin-square design with  <dig> volunteers.
the  <dig> min reference disinfection reduced resident hand bacteria on average by  <dig>  log <dig> steps  and  <dig>  log10-steps  respectively.
