bac clones containing the asparagine synthetase, sucrose synthase and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase gene sequences were isolated and used in this study.
using techniques focused on specific genes, gene models can be established that can aid in the assembly of gene-rich regions, and this information can be used to compare genomes and understand functional evolution.
the gene models derived from the gene capture approach were compared with the genomic sequences derived from the bac clones.
the gene models were constructed using geneassembler, a new bioinformatic pipeline, which reconstructed over 82Â % of the gene structures, and a high proportion  of the captured gene models contained sequences from the promoter regulatory region.
in this study, gene capture technology combined with bac isolation and sequencing was used as an experimental approach to establish de novo gene structures without a reference genome.
the experimental approach used in this study is a valuable combined technique to study genomic gene structures in species for which a reference genome is unavailable.
it can be used to establish exon/intron boundaries in unknown gene structures, to reconstruct incomplete genes and to obtain promoter sequences that can be used for transcriptional studies.
although drafts of three conifer genomes have recently been published, this number is too low to understand the full complexity of conifer genomes.
probes were designed for  <dig> maritime pine transcripts to sequence genes captured from genomic dna.
