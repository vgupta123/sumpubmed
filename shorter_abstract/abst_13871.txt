interactions between mceph and other kv <dig> subunits were studied in cell culture, xenopus oocytes and the brain.
mceph can form tetramers with kv <dig>  in cell culture and has a dominant negative effect on kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  currents in oocytes.
however, high kv <dig>  mrna levels in mceph/mceph brain indicated that it escaped this control mechanism.
mceph was found to lack mature  glycosylation, but to be core glycosylated and trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum .
therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated kv <dig>  would be expressed and dysregulate other kv <dig> subunits in the mceph/mceph mice.
we found that the mceph protein is expressed in the brain of mceph/mceph mice.
the predicted mceph protein is truncated at amino acid  <dig> out of  <dig>  truncated proteins are usually not expressed since nonsense mrnas are most often degraded.
the megencephaly mice express a truncated kv <dig>  in the brain, and constitute a unique tool to study kv <dig>  trafficking relevant for understanding epilepsy, ataxia and pathologic brain overgrowth.
