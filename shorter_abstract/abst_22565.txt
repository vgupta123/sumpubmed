data-driven methods based on three statistical tests–fisher exact test, rank-sum test, and multi-hypergeometric test—perform poorly, even when the threshold is chosen optimally.
a major goal of molecular biology is determining the mechanisms that control the transcription of genes.
instead, the input consists of all regulatory regions, each labeled with the level of a biological signal.
we evaluate these methods, along with two existing methods , using yeast chip-chip data.
our novel, threshold-free linear regression method works well on chip-chip data.
some of these methods require a user-specified signal threshold, some identify an optimum threshold in a data-driven way and two of our methods are threshold-free.
we first define a mathematical framework for motif enrichment analysis that relaxes the requirement that the biologist input a selected set of genes.
motif enrichment analysis  seeks to determine which dna-binding transcription factors control the transcription of a set of genes by detecting enrichment of known binding motifs in the genes' regulatory regions.
we then define and implement a number of motif enrichment analysis methods.
