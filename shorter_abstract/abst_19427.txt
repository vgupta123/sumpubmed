eiec strains were distributed mainly in three phylogroups in a serogroup-dependent manner.
these features are distributed in a phylogenetic and serogroup-dependent manner suggesting the existence of stable eiec subclones.
recent eiec important outbreaks, apparently generating more life-threatening cases, have prompted us to screen eiec for virulence traits usually related to extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli .
that could explain the appearance of eiec strains presenting higher virulence potential.
uropathogenic e. coli  pai genetic markers were detected in all eiec strains.
eiec is a dec pathovar that presents vgs and pathogenicity island genetic markers typically associated with expec, especially upec.
enteroinvasive escherichia coli  may be the causative agent of part of those million cases of diarrhea illness reported worldwide every year and attributable to shigella.
that is because both enteropathogens have many common characteristics that difficult their identification either by traditional microbiological methods or by molecular tools used in the clinical laboratory settings.
