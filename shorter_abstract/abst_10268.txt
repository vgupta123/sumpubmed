a. thaliana plants overexpressing the gene showed less disease symptoms after pst dc <dig> infection with reduced bacterial colonization compared to infected wild type and f-box-nictaba knock-out plants.
qrt-pcr analyses confirmed high expression of f-box-nictaba in leaf trichomes.
here, we present a detailed qrt-pcr expression analysis of f-box-nictaba in arabidopsis plants upon different stresses and hormone treatments.
β-glucuronidase histochemical staining of transgenic arabidopsis plants displayed preferential activity of the at2g <dig> promoter in trichomes present on young rosette leaves.
previously, the so-called f-box-nictaba protein, encoded by the gene at2g <dig>  was shown to be a functional lectin which binds n-acetyllactosamine structures.
expression of the f-box-nictaba gene was enhanced after plant treatment with salicylic acid and after plant infection with the virulent pseudomonas syringae pv.
a small group of f-box proteins consisting of a conserved f-box domain linked to a domain homologous to the glycan-binding protein has been identified within the genome of arabidopsis thaliana.
our data show that the arabidopsis f-box-nictaba gene is a stress-inducible gene responsive to sa, bacterial infection and heat stress, and is involved in salicylic acid related plant defense responses.
