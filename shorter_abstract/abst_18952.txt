the past five years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of completely sequenced plastid genomes, fuelled largely by advances in conventional sanger sequencing technology.
here we report a further significant reduction in time and cost for plastid genome sequencing through the successful use of a newly available pyrosequencing platform, the genome sequencer  <dig>  system , to rapidly and accurately sequence the whole plastid genomes of the basal eudicot angiosperms nandina domestica  and platanus occidentalis .
the nandina and platanus plastid genomes shared essentially identical gene complements and possessed the typical angiosperm plastid structure and gene arrangement.
error rates were generally higher in the single-copy and noncoding regions of both plastid genomes relative to the inverted repeat and coding regions.
highly accurate and essentially complete sequence information was obtained for the nandina and platanus plastid genomes using the gs  <dig> system.
more importantly, the high accuracy observed in the gs  <dig> plastid genome sequence was generated for a significant reduction in time and cost over traditional shotgun-based genome sequencing techniques, although with approximately half the coverage of previously reported gs  <dig> de novo genome sequence.
the gs  <dig> should be broadly applicable to angiosperm plastid genome sequencing, and therefore promises to expand the scale of plant genetic and phylogenetic research dramatically.
plastid genome sequence information is vital to several disciplines in plant biology, including phylogenetics and molecular biology.
more than 97% of all observed errors were associated with homopolymer runs, with ~60% of all errors associated with homopolymer runs of  <dig> or more nucleotides and ~50% of all errors associated with regions of extensive homopolymer runs.
no substitution errors were present in either genome.
more than  <dig> % of each plastid genome was simultaneously obtained during two gs  <dig> sequence runs, to an average depth of coverage of  <dig> × in nandina and  <dig> × in platanus.
