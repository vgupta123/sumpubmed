an ensemble of artificial neural networks has been trained on a set of experimentally solved protein structures to predict the relative exposure of the amino acids.
however, our implementation of reliability scores in the form of a z-score is shown to be the more informative measure for discriminating good predictions from bad ones in the entire range from completely buried to fully exposed amino acids.
estimation of the reliability of specific real value predictions is nontrivial and the efficacy of this is often questionable.
such an approach is not feasible for methods that predict a biological feature as a single real value rather than a classification.
it is important to know if you can trust a given prediction and therefore the best methods associate a prediction with a reliability score or index.
the method assigns a reliability score to each surface accessibility prediction as an inherent part of the training process.
both methods associate a reliability score with the individual predictions.
for discrete qualitative predictions, the reliability is conventionally estimated as the difference between output scores of selected classes.
as a solution to this challenge, we have implemented a method that predicts the relative surface accessibility of an amino acid and simultaneously predicts the reliability for each prediction, in the form of a z-score.
