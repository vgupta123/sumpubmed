specifically, we annotate these four protein expression profiles, as well as profiles from naïve hmsc and differentiated human osteoblasts , with known gene ontologies and analyze them as a tensor with modes for the expressed proteins, gene ontologies, and stimulants.
the differences between the proteomic profiles of os-stimulated hmsc and ecm-hmsc characterize different transitional phenotypes en route to becoming osteoblasts.
additionally, the second component demonstrates that proteomic profiles of collagen i- and vitronectin-stimulated hmsc are distinct from those of os-stimulated cells.
recently, we demonstrated that human mesenchymal stem cells  stimulated with dexamethazone undergo gene focusing during osteogenic differentiation : 1608– <dig>  2005).
a three-mode tensor analysis reveals additional focus proteins critical for characterizing the phenotypic variations between naïve hmsc, partially differentiated hmsc, and host.
the directed component maps the differentiation stages of the stimulated stem cell populations along the differentiation axis created by the difference in the expression profiles of hmsc and host.
surprisingly, hmsc treated with ecm proteins lie closer to osteoblasts than do hmsc treated with os media.
here, we examine the protein expression profiles of three additional populations of hmsc stimulated to undergo osteogenic differentiation via either contact with pro-osteogenic extracellular matrix  proteins  or osteogenic media supplements .
