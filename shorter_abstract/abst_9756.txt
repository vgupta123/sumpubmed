we identified tnfaip <dig> interacting protein <dig>  as a target and characterized a functional snp in the mir-517a/c binding site.
consistent with these results, mir-517a/c induced the expression of endogenous nf-κb targets and promoted the nuclear localization of p <dig> and the degradation of iκb.
aberrant regulation of nf-κb is associated with several disorders including autoimmune disease, chronic inflammation, and cancer, making the nf-κb pathway an attractive therapeutic target.
many regulatory components of the nf-κb pathway have been identified, including micrornas .
here we present a cell-based functional genomics screen to systematically identify mirnas that regulate nf-κb signaling.
we identified putative functional targets of these hits by integrating computational predictions with nf-κb modulators identified in a previous genome-wide cdna screen.
we screened a library of mirna mimics using a nf-κb reporter cell line in the presence and absence of tumor necrosis factor .
there were  <dig> and  <dig> hits in the -tnf and +tnf screens, respectively.
mirnas are small non-coding rnas and are common components of signal transduction pathways.
mir-517a and mir-517c were the top hits, activating the reporter 86- and 126-fold, respectively.
our study suggests that mirnas are common components of nf-κb signaling and mir-517a/c may play an important role in linking nf-κb signaling with cell survival through tnip <dig>
