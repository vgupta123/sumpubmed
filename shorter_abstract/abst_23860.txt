best practice information can help to bridge such subtle differences by increasing communication of protocols to a wider audience.
this makes it difficult to keep track of available bioinformatics software, let alone the most suitable protocols in a specific research area.
however, as experimental complexity has increased the choice of appropriate methodologies has become an increasingly difficult task.
we used the practice of highly published and widely collaborative researchers  to analyse the influence of authority on community practice.
we propose that the practice of expert authors from the field of evolutionary biology is the closest to contemporary best practice in phylogenetic experimental design.
we find a number of issues related to the nature of best practice, as opposed to community practice.
our approach is to implement data extraction techniques on the full-text of scientific articles to obtain the set of experimental protocols used by an entire scientific discipline, molecular phylogenetics.
we find expert authors exhibit patterns of practice common to their field and therefore act as useful field-specific practice indicators.
