cre recombinase is a common reagent used for the in vivo on/off switching of the expression of target genes flanked by loxp sites.
however, the recovery of active tat-cre remains a demanding process and its specific activity varies significantly among batches, making difficult data comparison.
ai values were recorded after each purification passage to identify the critical steps and to choose optimal alternatives for chromatographic conditions, desalting procedures, and protocols for bacterial endotoxin removal.
furthermore, the effect of metal ions and temperature on tat-cre aggregation and inactivation was characterized in vitro.
the existence of such correlation enabled us to indirectly monitor the tat-cre recombinase activity during the multi-step purification process by measuring its monodispersity, a parameter detectable by means of a spectrofluorimetric assay that allows the calculation of the aggregation index  in an easy and rapid way.
a rational purification protocol for tat-cre has been developed by choosing the options that minimize the enzyme aggregation.
we noticed a strong correlation between recombinase activity and enzyme monodispersity.
