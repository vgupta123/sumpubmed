using the present methodology, the cryopreservation of individual identifiable cells, and their observation and retrieval, at an individual cell resolution become possible for the first time.
successful cryopreservation is essential for reproductive medicine, stem cell research, cord blood storage and related biomedical areas.
thus, it is expected to significantly enhance current cryopreservation procedures for successful regenerative and reproductive medicine.
the core of this approach is an array of picowells, each picowell designed to maintain an individual cell during the severe conditions of the freezing - thawing cycle and accompanying treatments.
this approach facilitates the correlation between cell characteristics before and after the freezing - thawing cycle.
the methods currently used to retrieve a specific cell or a group of individual cells with specific biological properties after cryopreservation are quite complicated and inefficient.
the present study suggests a new approach in cryopreservation, utilizing the individual cell-based cryo-chip .
thus the comparison between pre-freezing and post-thawing data can be achieved at an individual cell resolution.
the results of the present study offer new opportunities for cryopreservation.
more than 97% of cells were found to retain their position in the picowells throughout the entire freezing - thawing cycle and medium exchange.
