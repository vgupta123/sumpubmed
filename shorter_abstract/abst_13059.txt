the secreted pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin exotoxin a  disrupts intestinal protein synthesis, which triggers the induction of a subset of p. aeruginosa-response genes in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans.
nipi- <dig> is a negative regulator of cebp- <dig>  which in turn negatively regulates protective immune mechanisms.
we show here that one toxa-induced c. elegans gene, the tribbles pseudokinase ortholog nipi- <dig>  is essential for host survival following exposure to p. aeruginosa or toxa.
this pathway represents a previously unknown innate immune signaling pathway in intestinal epithelial cells that is involved in the surveillance of cellular homeostasis.
because nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig> are also essential for c. elegans development, nipi- <dig> is analogous to other key innate immune signaling molecules such as the toll receptors in drosophila that have an independent role during development.
