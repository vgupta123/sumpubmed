we have developed caryoscope, which is an open source java application for visualizing microarray data from array comparative genome hybridization experiments in a genomic context.
the microarray data can be browsed using an interactive, zoomable interface, which helps users identify regions of chromosomal deletion or amplification.
caryoscope is a useful tool that can aid in the visualization, exploration and interpretation of microarray data in a genomic context.
the graphical representation of the data can be exported in a number of graphic formats, including publication-quality formats such as postscript.
these data are interpreted more easily when represented graphically in a genomic context.
