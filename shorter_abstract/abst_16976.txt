pretreatment of kal7ko mice with a low dose of ifenprodil, a selective glun2b antagonist, eliminated their enhanced locomotor response to cocaine, revealing an important role for glun2b in this behavior.
a number of genetic studies have implicated altered kalirin expression in schizophrenia and other disorders such as alzheimerâ€™s disease.
mice lacking kalirin- <dig> , a rho gdp/gtp exchange factor, self-administer cocaine at a higher rate than wildtype mice, and show an exaggerated locomotor response to experimenter-administered cocaine.
consistent with these observations, kal <dig> plays an essential role in nmda receptor dependent long term potentiation and depression, and glutamatergic transmission plays a key role in the response to chronic cocaine.
kal <dig>  which localizes to post-synaptic densities at glutamatergic synapses, interacts directly with the glun2b subunit of the n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor.
as observed in kalirin global knockout mice, eliminating kalirin expression in drd2-expressing neurons increased exploratory behavior in the elevated zero maze, an effect eliminated by pretreatment with ifenprodil.
the cocaine-sensitive neuronal pathways which are most sensitive to altered kalirin function may be the pathways most dependent on glun2b and drd <dig>
a comparison of the effects of experimenter-administered cocaine on mice lacking all kalirin isoforms to its effects on mice lacking only kalirin- <dig> identified kal <dig> as the key isoform whose deletion produces exaggerated locomotor responses to cocaine.
