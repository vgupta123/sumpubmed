it shows that right-match and left-match criteria have no significant difference with biocreative.
in experiment  <dig>  we apply hypothesis testing and correlation coefficient to find alternatives to biocreative's evaluation scheme.
to analyze the difference between jnlpba's and biocreative's evaluation, we conduct experiment  <dig> to evaluate the top four jnlpba systems using biocreative's classification scheme.
we then compare them with the top four biocreative systems.
in our experiment, we found that right match and left match can be appropriate alternatives to jnlpba and biocreative's matching criteria.
in many applications, biomedical nes could have several acceptable tags, which might just differ in their left or right boundaries.
in experiment  <dig>  we evaluate a range of five matching criteria from loose to strict on the top jnlpba system and examine the percentage of false negatives.
a key component of this process is named entity recognition .
generally speaking, two annotated corpora, genia and genetag, are most frequently used for training and testing biomedical named entity recognition  systems.
in experiment  <dig>  we propose a customized relaxed-match criterion that uses right match and merges jnlpba's five ne classes into two, which achieves an f-score of  <dig> %.
in addition, our relaxed-match criterion demonstrates that users can define their own relaxed criteria that correspond more realistically to their application requirements.
both tasks take different approaches to corpus annotation and use different matching criteria to evaluate system performance.
we then examine the impact of different criteria and annotation schemes on system performance by retesting systems participated in the above two tasks.
