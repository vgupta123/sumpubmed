the present work introduced a set of snps at sufficiently high density for qtl mapping in populations derived from s. pimpinellifolium .
a total of  <dig>  unique snp loci were identified as a result of tag alignment to the genome assembly and were used in qtl analysis of  <dig> fruit quality traits.
solanum pimpinellifolium has high breeding potential for fruit quality traits and has been used as a donor in tomato breeding programs.
a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were generated by the illumina hiseq next-generation sequencing platform.
unlocking the genetic potential of s. pimpinellifolium requires high-throughput polymorphism identification protocols for qtl mapping and introgression of favourable alleles into cultivated tomato by both positive and background selection.
s. pimpinellifolium contributed favourable alleles for  <dig> qtls , thus confirming the high breeding potential of this wild species.
in this study we identified snp loci using a genotyping by sequencing  approach in an ibl mapping population derived from the cross between a high yielding fresh market tomato and s. pimpinellifolium  as the recurrent and donor parents, respectively.
moreover, this study demonstrated the high efficiency of the gbs approach for snp identification, genotyping and qtl mapping in an interspecific tomato population.
a majority of the sequence tags  were uniquely aligned to the tomato genome.
