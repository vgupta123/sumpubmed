two srna libraries from 7b- <dig> and wild type  anthers were sequenced and thirty two families of known mirnas and  <dig> new mirnas were identified in both libraries.
mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> were up-regulated and mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and two new mirnas, mir#w and mir#m were down-regulated in 7b- <dig> anthers.
overall, we identified mirnas with potential roles in anther development and regulation of male-sterility in 7b- <dig>  a number of new mirnas were also identified from tomato for the first time.
qpcr analysis showed differential expression of mirna/target pairs of interest in anthers and stem of 7b- <dig>  suggesting that they may regulate different biological processes in these tissues.
small rnas  in tomato have been mainly characterized in fruit development and ripening, but none have been studied with respect to flower development and regulation of male-sterility.
our data could be used as a benchmark for future studies of the molecular mechanisms of male-sterility in other crops.
using srna sequencing, we identified mirnas that are potentially involved in anther development and regulation of male-sterility in 7b- <dig> mutant.
mirna targets with potential roles in anther development were validated using 5â€²-race.
expression level of most mirna/target pairs showed negative correlation, except for few.
in situ hybridization showed predominant expression of mir <dig>  gamybl <dig>  pmei and cystatin in tapetum, tetrads and microspores.
