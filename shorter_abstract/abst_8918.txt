to our knowledge, this is the first report on the determination of novel genes involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction of fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos.
k <dig> complete cdna sequence is  <dig> base pairs  in length, with a  <dig> bp open reading frame  encoding a putative protein of  <dig> amino acids .
k <dig> protein contains a putative transmembrane helix and five putative phosphorylation sites but without a signal peptide.
taken together, our findings indicated that k <dig> gene is a novel gene differentially expressed in fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos and over-expression of k <dig> gene can cause lethality of cultured fish cells.
gene expression analysis of cross-species cloned embryos will yield new insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in cross-species nuclear transfer and embryonic development.
cross-species nuclear transfer has been shown to be a potent approach to retain the genetic viability of a certain species near extinction.
a novel gene, k <dig>  was identified as an up-regulated gene in fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos using ssh approach and race method.
comparative analysis revealed no homologous known gene in zebrafish and other species database.
interestingly, over-expression of k <dig> gene can cause lethality in the epithelioma papulosum cyprinid  cells in cell culture, which gave hint to the inefficient reprogramming events occurred in cloned embryos.
