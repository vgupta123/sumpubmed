sam domains are known protein-protein interaction domains, capable of binding each other to form polymers and heterodimers.
anks <dig> is a direct interacting partner of anks <dig>  by structurally and biochemically characterizing the interaction between the anks <dig> and anks <dig> sam domains, our work provides a basis for future investigation of how the interaction between these proteins mediates kidney function.
we find that anks3-sam polymerizes and anks6-sam can bind to one end of the polymer.
we present crystal structures of both the anks3-sam polymer and the anks3-sam/anks6-sam complex, revealing the molecular details of their association.
recent work has revealed that anks <dig> interacts with a related protein called anks <dig>  both anks <dig> and anks <dig> have a similar domain structure, with ankyrin repeats at the n-terminus and a sam domain at the c-terminus.
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is the most common genetic disorder leading to end-stage renal failure in humans.
the sam domain of anks <dig> is identified as a direct binding partner of the anks <dig> sam domain.
we also learn how the r823w mutation disrupts anks <dig> function by dramatically destabilizing the sam domain such that the interaction with anks3-sam is lost.
