the test method is an extension of earlier work that made use of point estimates for the variance.
the method proposed here explicitly calculates in analytic form the marginal distribution for the difference in the mean expression of two samples, obviating the need for point estimates of the variance without recourse to posterior simulation.
prior work in this area has featured the use of t-tests with pooled estimates of the sample variance based on similarly expressed genes.
the prior distribution involves a single hyperparameter that can be calculated in a statistically rigorous manner, making clear the connection between the prior degrees of freedom and prior variance.
these methods do not display consistent behavior across the entire range of pooling and can be biased when the prior hyperparameters are specified heuristically.
the test is generally applicable outside the microarray field to any situation where prior information about the variance is available and is not limited to cases where estimates of the variance are based on many similar observations.
