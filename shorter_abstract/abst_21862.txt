in order to get a complete view of how uorfs are involved in gene regulation, it is expected that a large number of experimentally verified functional uorfs are needed.
in this paper, a new computational approach to predicting functional uorfs in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented.
the hypotheses predict  <dig> further genes to have  <dig> novel functional uorfs.
three  of these  <dig> genes have been hypothesised, following wet-experiments, by a related study to have functional uorfs.
a comparison with another related study suggests that eleven of the predicted functional uorfs from genes ldb <dig>  hem <dig>  cin <dig>  bck <dig>  pmc <dig>  fas <dig>  app <dig>  acc <dig>  cka <dig>  sur <dig>  and ath <dig> are strong candidates for wet-lab experimental studies.
learning based prediction of functional uorfs can be done with a high sensitivity.
our method results in a set of simple and informative hypotheses with an estimated sensitivity of 76%.
some upstream open reading frames  regulate gene expression  and can play key roles in keeping organisms healthy.
our approach is based on inductive logic programming and makes use of a novel combination of knowledge about biological conservation, gene ontology annotations and genes' responses to different conditions.
however, how uorfs are involved in gene regulation is not yet fully understood.
