highly divergent allopatric lineages are restricted to putative refugia across arid and semi-arid australia, and provide important evidence towards understanding the history and spread of the australian arid zone, suggesting at a minimum that semi-arid conditions were present by the early miocene, and that severe aridity was widespread by the mid to late miocene.
we identify at least  <dig> deeply divergent lineages within the single recognised species crenadactylus ocellatus, including a radiation of five endemic to the kimberley region of north-west australia, and at least four known from areas of less than  <dig> km <dig>  lineages restricted to geographically isolated ranges and semi-arid areas across central and western australia are estimated to have began to diversify in the late oligocene/early miocence , concurrent with, or even pre-dating, radiations of many iconic, broadly sympatric and much more species-rich australian vertebrate families .
in addition to documenting a remarkable instance of underestimation of vertebrate species diversity in a developed country, these results suggest that increasing integration of molecular dating techniques into cryptic species delimitation will reveal further instances where taxonomic conservatism has led to profound underestimation of not only species numbers, but also highly significant phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary history.
based on their deep divergence and no evidence of recent gene flow, we recognise each of the  <dig> main lineages as candidate species.
the identification of such ancient, but cryptic, lineages has important ramifications for conservation, biogeography and evolutionary biology.
