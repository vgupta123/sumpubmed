we suggest future deep sequencing transcriptome projects of species lacking a genomics backbone will need to concentrate mainly on resolving the issues of redundancy and paralogy during transcriptome assembly.
the garden pea, pisum sativum, is among the best-investigated legume plants and of significant agro-commercial relevance.
pisum sativum has a large and complex genome and accordingly few comprehensive genomic resources exist.
based on theoretical and biological considerations we concluded that the sequence reads in the database tagged the vast majority of transcripts in the aerial tissues.
all results have been made available as a fully annotated database in fasta format.
a pathway representation analysis showed the merits of sampling multiple aerial tissues to increase the number of tagged genes.
for leaf libraries we found normalization allows partial recovery of expression strength aside the desired effect of increased coverage.
