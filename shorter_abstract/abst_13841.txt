we use this framework to conduct a computer simulation comparing  <dig> different variants of gene set enrichment procedures and to analyze two experimental data sets.
we conduct an extensive survey of statistical approaches for gene set analysis and identify a common modular structure underlying most published methods.
correspondingly, a large number of statistical approaches for detecting gene set enrichment have been proposed, but both the interrelations and the relative performance of the various methods are still very much unclear.
based on the results we offer recommendations for best practices regarding the choice of effective procedures for gene set enrichment analysis.
analysis of microarray and other high-throughput data on the basis of gene sets, rather than individual genes, is becoming more important in genomic studies.
