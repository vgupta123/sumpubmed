fig trees thus differ from many species in their reproductive growth characteristics.
to date, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this unorthodox physiology of floral induction and fruit setting in fig trees have not been elucidated.
diurnal variation analysis revealed that fcft <dig> mrna expression increased under relative long-day and short-day conditions, but not under continuous darkness.
because the floral induction occurs in many plants when specific environmental conditions are satisfied, most plants bloom and bear fruit during the same season each year.
we isolated a flowering locus t -like gene from fig and examined its function, characteristics, and expression patterns.
these results suggest that fcft <dig> activation is regulated by light conditions and may contribute to fig’s unique fruit-setting characteristics.
fcft <dig> was mainly expressed in leaves and induced early flowering in transgenic tobacco, suggesting that fcft <dig> is a fig ft ortholog.
the isolated gene, f. carica ft , is single copy in fig and shows the highest similarity at the amino acid level  to apple mdft <dig>  we sequenced its upstream region  and identified many light-responsive elements.
