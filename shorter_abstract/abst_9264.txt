the excursion method identifies six origins not predicted by bws <dig>  showing that the at excursion method is a valuable complement to bws <dig>  we have also applied the at excursion method to two other families of double stranded dna viruses, the poxviruses and iridoviruses, of which very few replication origins are documented in the public domain.
many computational methods have been developed for predicting their locations in archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic genomes.
replication origins are considered important sites for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in dna replication.
the prediction results are made available as supplementary materials at  <cit> .
in this paper, we propose the at excursion method, which is a score-based approach, to quantify local at abundance in genomic sequences and use the identified high scoring segments for predicting replication origins.
the at excursion method will be a useful computational tool for identifying replication origins in a variety of genomic sequences.
however, a prediction method designed for a particular kind of genomes might not work well for another.
this method has the advantages of requiring no preset window size and having rigorous criteria to evaluate statistical significance of high scoring segments.
we have evaluated the at excursion method by checking its predictions against known replication origins in herpesviruses and comparing its performance with an existing base weighted score method .
