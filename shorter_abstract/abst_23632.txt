biopanned immuno-cdna libraries were subjected to next generation sequencing, de novo assembly, and bioinformatic analysis.
the 24-48Â h tick-feeding phase is critical to tick parasitism as it precedes important events in tick biology, blood meal feeding and disease agent transmission.
others include enzymes , ribosomal proteins, and those of miscellaneous functions .
of these, ~19%  show high level of identity to other tick hypothetical proteins, and the rest include putative proteases , protease inhibitors , and transporters and/or ligand binding proteins .
of significance, previously validated immunogenic tick saliva proteins including av <dig> protein, calreticulin, histamine release factor, histamine binding/lipocalins, selenoproteins, and paramyosin were identified in this screen, supporting the specificity of the approach in this study.
