we also study the consistency on models derived from real gene expression data and note that the assumptions needed for consistency never hold even for modest sized gene networks and ℓ
1-based methods for a class of bipartite graphs motivated by the structure of models commonly used for gene regulatory networks.
1-penalised undirected network structure learning methods are unable to reliably learn many sparse bipartite graph structures, which arise often in gene expression data.
intuitively, these conditions are related to situations where the penalty term will dominate the optimisation.
1-penalised estimation methods such as graphical lasso and clime are widely used for sparse precision matrix estimation and learning of undirected network structure from data.
