limb somite electroporation technique using vectors containing these different promoters allowed us to target all myogenic cells, myoblasts or differentiated muscle cells.
these stable and promoter-specific vectors lead to bicistronic expression either in somitic-derived myogenic cells or lateral plate-derived cells, depending on the electroporation sites and open new avenues to study the interactions between myogenic cells and tendon or connective tissue cells during limb development.
in addition, we designed three vectors with different promoters to target muscle cells at different steps of the differentiation process.
we designed a gene delivery system in chick embryos with the ultimate aim to study the interactions between the components of the musculoskeletal system during limb development.
we combined the tol <dig> genomic integration system with the viral t2a system and developed new vectors that lead to stable and bicistronic expression of two proteins at comparable levels in chick cells.
limb skeletal muscles originate from somites, while the skeleton and attachments  derive from limb lateral plate.
components of the limb musculoskeletal system have distinct mesoderm origins.
despite distinct mesoderm origins, the development of muscle, skeleton and attachments is highly coordinated both spatially and temporally to ensure complete function of the musculoskeletal system.
combined with limb somite and lateral plate electroporation techniques, two fluorescent reporter proteins were co-expressed in stoichiometric proportion in the muscle lineage  or in skeleton and their attachments .
a system to study molecular interactions between somitic-derived tissues  and lateral-plate-derived tissues  during limb development is missing.
