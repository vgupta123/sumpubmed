comparative sequence analyses of the 16s rrna as well as rpob genes allocated the strains to two well-defined groups within the genus enterobacter, family enterobacteriaceae.
two novel proposed enterobacterial species, denominated enterobacter oryziphilus sp.
the two species can be differentiated from each other and from existing enteric species by acid production from l-rhamnose and d-melibiose, decarboxylation of ornithine and utilization of d-alanine, d-raffinose l-proline and l-aspartic acid, among other characteristics.
genomic dna:dna hybridization analyses and biochemical analyses provided further evidence that the novel strains belong to two new species within the genus enterobacter.
an rpob  protein comparison supported the placement in the genus enterobacter and the relatedness of our isolates to the aforementioned species.
members of both species revealed capacities to colonise rice roots, including plant-growth-promoting capabilities such as an active supply of fixed nitrogen to the plant and solubilisation of inorganic phosphorus, next to traits allowing adaptation to the plant.
nov.  were isolated from rice roots.
both species are capable of promoting rice growth by supplying nitrogen and phosphorus.
