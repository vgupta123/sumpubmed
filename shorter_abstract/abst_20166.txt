the budding yeast pif <dig> dna helicase, as well as several bacterial pif <dig> family helicases, unwind g <dig> structures robustly in vitro and suppress g4-induced dna damage in s. cerevisiae in vivo.
using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing, we found that many g <dig> motifs in the s. pombe genome were associated with pfh <dig>  cells depleted of pfh <dig> had increased fork pausing and dna damage near g <dig> motifs, as indicated by high dna polymerase occupancy and phosphorylated histone h2a, respectively.
in the absence of functional pfh <dig>  unresolved g <dig> structures cause fork pausing and dna damage of the sort associated with human tumors.
we determined the genomic distribution and evolutionary conservation of g <dig> motifs in four fission yeast species and investigated the relationship between g <dig> motifs and pfh <dig>  the sole s. pombe pif <dig> family helicase.
g-quadruplexes  are stable non-canonical dna secondary structures consisting of stacked arrays of four guanines, each held together by hoogsteen hydrogen bonds.
