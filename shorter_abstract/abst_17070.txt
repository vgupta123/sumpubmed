the frap results, together with its mutant effects late in meiosis i, indicate that γtub37c may perform a role subsequent to metaphase i, rather than nucleating microtubules for meiosis i spindle formation.
it is still uncertain whether γ-tubulin, a microtubule nucleator essential for mitotic spindle assembly and maintenance, plays a role.
we show, for the first time, using a bright gfp fusion protein and live imaging, that the drosophila maternally-expressed γtub37c is present at low levels in oocyte meiosis i spindles.
despite this, we find that formation of bipolar meiosis i spindles does not require functional γtub37c, extending previous findings by others.
anastral spindles assemble by a mechanism that involves microtubule nucleation and growth from chromatin.
