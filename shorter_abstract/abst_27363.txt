copy number variants  are key players in the genetic etiology of numerous neurodevelopmental disorders and prior findings also revealed that chromosomal aberrations are more susceptible against the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
this study was carried out by high density whole genome array-cgh analysis with blood dna samples from a cohort of  <dig> epilepsy patients to search for cnvs associated with epilepsy.
we have described, for the first time, several novel cnvs/genes implicated in epilepsy in the saudi population.
these findings enable us to better describe the genetic variations in epilepsy, and could provide a foundation for understanding the critical regions of the genome which might be involved in the development of epilepsy.
furthermore, these cnv findings were confirmed by qpcr.
