a phylogenetical analysis of lipoprotein receptors showed that bglpr grouped with other sequences annotated as lpr in a cluster placed as a sister group of vertebrate low density lipoprotein receptors  + lipoprotein receptor-related proteins  <dig>  + vitellogenin receptors  + very low density lipoprotein receptors .
bglpr protein levels increase in parallel to vitellogenesis in both organs.
experiments with jh iii suggest that such a hormone regulates the expression of bglpr posttranscriptionally.
mrna levels in the fat body increase in parallel to vitellogenesis, whereas they decrease in the ovaries.
the aim of the present work was to characterize the lpr of the cockroach blattella germanica, not only molecularly but also functionally using rnai techniques, and to place lprs in a phylogenetical context among lipoprotein receptors.
rnai experiments show that females with lower bglpr expression have less lipophorin in the growing oocytes with respect to controls.
rnai experiments indicate that bglpr is a functional lipophorin receptor.
the different expression patterns in the fat body and the ovary, comparing mrna and protein, indicate that the corresponding mechanisms regulating bglpr expression are different.
lipophorin receptors  have been described in a number of insects, but functional studies have been reported only in locusts and mosquitoes.
in ovaries and fat body, the two isoforms are similarly expressed during the first gonadotrophic cycle.
we cloned a putative lpr from b. germanica  using rt-pcr methods.
the two bglpr isoforms are expressed in different adult female tissues  and in embryos.
two isoforms of bglpr that differ from each other by an insertion/deletion of  <dig> amino acids were obtained from the fat body and the ovary.
