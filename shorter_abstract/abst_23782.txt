mesophotic corals  provide a unique opportunity to study the limits of the interactions between corals and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the genus symbiodinium.
the level of genetic diversity detected in the coral nad <dig> suggests that there is undescribed taxonomic diversity in the genus leptoseris from hawaii.
this is one of the first studies to examine genetic diversity in corals and their endosymbiotic dinoflagellates sampled at the limits of the depth and light gradients for hermatypic corals.
in hawaii via manned submersibles across a depth range of  <dig> -  <dig> m. both the host and symbiodinium communities were genotyped, using a non-coding region of the mitochondrial nd <dig> intron  and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region  <dig> , respectively.
the results reveal that these corals associate with generalist endosymbiont types commonly found in shallow water corals and implies that the composition of the symbiodinium community  alone is not responsible for the dominance and broad depth distribution of leptoseris spp.
coral colonies harbored endosymbiotic communities dominated by previously identified shallow water symbiodinium its <dig> types  and exhibited genetic variability at mitochondrial nad <dig>
