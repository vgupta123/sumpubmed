the y-chromosomal diversity in the african buffalo  population of kruger national park  is characterized by rainfall-driven haplotype frequency shifts between year cohorts.
both wet and dry periods were associated with a specific haplotype indicating a sr distorter and sr suppressor, respectively.
the distinctive properties suggested for explaining y-chromosomal polymorphism in african buffalo may not be restricted to this species alone.
stable y-chromosomal polymorphism is difficult to reconcile with haplotype frequency variations without assuming frequency-dependent selection or specific interactions in the population dynamics of x- and y-chromosomal genes, since otherwise the fittest haplotype would inevitably sweep to fixation.
frequencies varied by a factor of five; too high to be alternatively explained by y-chromosomal effects on pregnancy loss.
here we show temporal correlations between y-chromosomal haplotype frequencies and foetal sex ratios in the knp buffalo population, suggesting sr genes.
these sex-ratio  genes modify  gamete transmission in their own favour at a fitness cost, allowing for stable polymorphism.
sex ratios were male-biased during wet and female-biased during dry periods , seasonally and annually.
stable y-chromosomal polymorphism due one of these factors only seems possible when there are y-chromosomal distorters of an equal sex ratio, which act by negatively affecting x-gametes, or y-chromosomal suppressors of a female-biased sex ratio.
sr genes may play a broader and largely overlooked role in mammalian sex-ratio variation.
