females exposed to these males were found to have higher mortality rate.
in combination, these results suggest that male reproductive traits and life-history traits can evolve in response to the altered levels of interlocus sexual conflict.
however, progeny production of females continuously exposed to f-males was significantly higher than the progeny production of females exposed to m-males indicating that the f-males are relatively benign towards their mates.
interlocus conflict predicts  evolution of traits, beneficial to males but detrimental to females and  evolution of aging and life-span under the influence of the cost of bearing these traits.
we present responses observed after > <dig> generations of altered levels of interlocus conflict .
males from the male biased  regime evolved higher spontaneous locomotor activity and courtship frequency.
males from the female biased regime  did not evolve altered courtship frequency and activity.
here, we test both the above mentioned predictions using experimental evolution on replicate populations of drosophila melanogaster.

the m-males  caused higher female mortality indicating that they had evolved increased mate harming ability, possibly as a by product of increased reproduction related activity.
