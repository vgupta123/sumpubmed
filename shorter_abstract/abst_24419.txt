the impact of environmental gradients on the evolution of life history traits is a central issue in macroecology and evolutionary biology.
our results fail to support bergmann's rule in liolaemus lizards.
one such example is bergmann's rule, which predicts that body size will be positively correlated with latitude and elevation, and hence, with decreasing environmental temperatures.
non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that none of the studied clades experience increasing body size with increasing latitude and elevation.
therefore, evolution of larger body size in colder environments appears to be a disadvantageous thermoregulatory strategy.
however, a later reassessment of this evidence, performed on one of the four analysed clades, produced contrasting conclusions.
a recent study conducted on some species belonging to four of these six clades concluded that liolaemus species follow bergmann's rule, representing the only known phylogenetic support for this model in lizards.
here, we investigate bergmann's rule in the six main clades forming the liolaemus genus, one of the largest and most environmentally diverse genera of terrestrial vertebrates.
in cold environments, adaptations to gain heat rapidly are under strong positive selection to allow optimal feeding, mating and predator avoidance.
most physiological and behavioural processes in ectotherms depend directly upon their body temperature.
