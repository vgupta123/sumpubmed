the interpretation of the degs revealed new insight into the molecular processes that regulate the defence responses in orange tissue.
an antifungal compound, 2-phenylethanol , has been identified from the extract of k. apiculata.
to better understand the molecular processes underlying the response of citrus fruit tissue to k. apiculata, the extract and pea, microarray analyses were performed on navel oranges using an affymetrix citrus genechip.
as many as  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified after the application of k. apiculata, the extract and pea, respectively.
in general, k. apiculata induced the expression of defence-related genes.
this study provides a global picture of the gene expression changes in navel oranges after the application of the antagonist yeast k. apiculata, its extract and pea.
in contrast, monodehydroascorbate reductase, superoxide dismutase , catalase , peroxidase  and carotenoid biosynthesis genes were down-regulated.
the expression profiles for the extract- and pea-treated samples were similar to that found for yeast , with a significant increase in the transcript levels of defence-related genes.
in addition to chitinase and Î²- <dig> -glucanase, genes involved in ethylene , jasmonic acid , calcium signalling, mapk signalling and phenylalanine metabolism were induced.
