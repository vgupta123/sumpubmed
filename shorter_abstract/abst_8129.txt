finally, artificial neural networks were used to construct protein feature based methods for identification of non-classically secreted proteins in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
however, we also show that the apparently non-classically secreted proteins are still distinguished from cellular proteins by properties such as amino acid composition, secondary structure and disordered regions.
we present an overview of bacterial non-classical secretion and a prediction method for identification of proteins following signal peptide independent secretion pathways.
we have compiled a list of proteins found extracellularly despite the absence of a signal peptide.
we present a publicly available prediction method capable of discriminating between this group of proteins and other proteins, thus allowing for the identification of novel non-classically secreted proteins.
the prediction method is available online.
