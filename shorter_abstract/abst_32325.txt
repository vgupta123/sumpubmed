nevertheless, they can distinguish histological classical variants and follicular variants of ptc in the tcga dataset.
our results showed that down-regulated micrornas can be used as new potential common biomarkers of ptc and to distinguish main subtypes of ptc.
results were validated experimentally by qrt-pcr on normal samples, tumors and lnm from  <dig> independent patients and in silico using the dataset from the cancer genome atlas .
in general, primary tumors and lnm presented similar microrna expression profiles but specific variations like the down-regulation of mir-7-2-3p and mir-30c-2-3p in lnm were observed.
we selected the  <dig> most down-regulated micrornas in ptc and we showed that they are potential biomarkers of ptc samples.
microrna expressions can be linked to the development of lnm of ptc.
papillary thyroid cancer  is the most prevalent type of endocrine cancer.
in addition, there is a need for molecular biomarkers allowing improved ptc diagnosis.
we showed that the associated aggressive expression profile is mainly due to the presence of the braf v600e mutation.
we designed a new bioinformatics framework to handle each aspect of the mirnome: whole expression profiles, isomirs distribution, non-templated additions distributions, rna-editing or mutation.
the bioinformatics framework that we have developed can be used as a starting point for the global analysis of any microrna deep-sequencing data in an unbiased way.
we performed small rna deep-sequencing of  <dig> ptc, their matching normal tissues and lymph node metastases .
investigations of the 5p-to-3p arm expression ratios, non-templated additions or isomirs distributions revealed no major implication in ptc tumorigenesis process or lnm appearance.
in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> down-regulated micrornas are significantly less expressed in aggressive ptc compared to non-aggressive ptc.
