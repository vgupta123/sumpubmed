navigo is a web-based tool for interactive visualization, retrieval, and computation of functional similarity and associations of go terms and genes.
we developed navigo, which visualizes and analyses functional similarity and associations of go terms and genes.
similarity of go terms and gene functions is quantified with six different scores including protein-protein interaction and context based association scores we have developed in our previous works.
with the well-defined structure and manual curation, gene ontology  is the most frequently used vocabulary for representing gene functions.
