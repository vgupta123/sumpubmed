one critical posttranslational modification of notch for its function in vivo is the addition of o-linked fucose residues by protein o-fucosyltransferase  <dig> .
o-linked fucose residues on notch can serve as substrates for further sugar modification by fringe  proteins.
cax mutant embryos have somites of variable size, showed partly abnormal lfng expression and, consistently defective anterior-posterior somite patterning and axial skeleton development but had virtually no defects in several other notch-regulated early developmental processes outside the paraxial mesoderm that we analyzed.
notch modification by fringe differently affects the ability of ligands to activate notch receptors in a context-dependent manner indicating a complex modulation of notch activity by differential glycosylation.
we have identified and characterized a spontaneous mutation in the mouse pofut <dig> gene, referred to as "compact axial skeleton" .
notch-dependent processes apparently differ with respect to their requirement for levels of pofut <dig>  normal lfng expression and anterior-posterior somite patterning is highly sensitive to reduced pofut <dig> levels in early mammalian embryos, whereas other early notch-dependent processes such as establishment of left-right asymmetry or neurogenesis are not.
alternatively, reduced o-fucosylation might preferentially affect sites that are substrates for lfng and thus important for somite formation and patterning.
whether the context-dependent effects of notch receptor glycosylation by fng reflect different requirements of distinct developmental processes for o-fucosylation by pofut <dig> is unclear.
the evolutionarily conserved notch signalling pathway regulates multiple developmental processes in a wide variety of organisms.
