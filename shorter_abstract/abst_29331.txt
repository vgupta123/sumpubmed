the cgview comparison tool  is a package for visually comparing bacterial, plasmid, chloroplast, or mitochondrial sequences of interest to existing genomes or sequence collections.
cct can be used to visually compare a reference sequence to thousands of existing genomes or sequence collections  on a standard desktop computer.
visualization of the results is important, as it allows information from a variety of sources to be integrated and interpreted.
the comparisons are conducted using blast, and the blast results are presented in the form of graphical maps that can also show sequence features, gene and protein names, cog  category assignments, and sequence composition characteristics.
user-defined features or analysis results can be included on maps, and maps can be extensively customized.
comparisons can be conducted within a particular species or genus, or all available genomes can be used.
to simplify program setup, a cct virtual machine that includes all dependencies preinstalled is available.
detailed tutorials illustrating the use of cct are included with the cct documentation.
by visually presenting sequence conservation information along with functional classifications and sequence composition characteristics, cct can be a useful tool for identifying rapidly evolving or novel sequences, horizontally transferred sequences, or unusual functional properties in newly sequenced genomes.
the entire map creation process, from downloading sequences to redrawing zoomed maps, can be completed easily using scripts included with the cct.
