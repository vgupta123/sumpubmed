we used an experimental condition in which the visual information was incongruent despite the motor execution and somatosensory feedback being congruent.
these results suggested that visual information influenced the neuronal activity concerning sensorimotor interaction in the sii during motor execution.
activation in the primary somatosensory area  revealed inhibition of neural activity and that in the secondary somatosensory area  showed enhancement with voluntary movement.
the mirror condition provided a visual feedback by showing a reflection of the subjectâ€™s right hand in place of the left hand.
therefore, in the asymmetric task of the mirror condition, subjects saw symmetric movements despite performing asymmetric movements.
in addition, the sii contralateral to the side of stimulation was significantly enhanced in the asymmetric task of the mirror condition, which provided non-veridical visual feedback.
this study investigated the influence of visual feedback on information processing in somatosensory areas during movement execution using magnetoencephalography.
the sii contributes to the detection of unpredicted visual feedback of movement execution.
a mechanism that monitors the congruence between sensory inputs and motor outputs is necessary to control voluntary movement.
the representation of limb position is constantly updated on the basis of somatosensory and visual information and efference copy from motor areas.
however, the cortical mechanism underlying detection of limb position using somatosensory and visual information has not been elucidated.
