this represents to our knowledge the first direct evidence that endosymbiont bacteria, and in particular wolbachia, might induce sex ratio variation in spiders.
despite the observation that endosymbiont bacteria are frequently encountered in spiders and that the sex ratio of particular spider species is strongly female biased, a direct relationship between bacterial infection and sex ratio variation has not yet been demonstrated for this arthropod order.
breeding experiments show that sex ratio variation in this species is primarily maternally inherited and that removal of the bacteria by antibiotics restores an unbiased sex ratio.
as female biased clutches were of significantly smaller size compared to non-distorted clutches, killing of male embryos appears to be the most likely manipulative effect.
females of the dwarf spider oedothorax gibbosus exhibit considerable variation in the sex ratio of their clutches and were infected with at least three different endosymbiont bacteria capable of altering host reproduction i.e.
moreover, clutches of females infected with wolbachia were significantly female biased while uninfected females showed an even sex ratio.
these findings are pivotal to further understand the diversity of reproductive phenotypes observed in this arthropod order.
