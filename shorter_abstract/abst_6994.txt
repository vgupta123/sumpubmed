instead, mosses and vascular plants possess the two formin classes known from angiosperms: membrane-anchored class i formins and class ii formins carrying a pten-like domain.
subsequent amplification of formin genes, possibly coincident with the expansion of plants to dry land, was followed by acquisition of alternative membrane attachment mechanisms present in extant class i and class ii formins, allowing later loss of the rhogap-like domain-containing formins in angiosperms.
pten-related domains were found also in stramenopile formins, where they have been probably acquired independently rather than by horizontal transfer, following a burst of domain rearrangements in the chromalveolate lineage.
in plants this replaced gbd/fh <dig> by a probably inactive rhogap-like domain, preserving a formin-mediated association between  rho gtpases and the actin cytoskeleton.
the rho gtpase-binding domain  reported from opisthokont and dictyostelium formins was found in all lineages except plants, suggesting its ancestral character.
we performed a phylogenomic analysis of formins in most eukaryotic kingdoms, aiming to reconstruct an evolutionary scenario that may have produced the current diversity of domain combinations with focus on the origin of the angiosperm formin architectures.
