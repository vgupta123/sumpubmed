the distribution of this mosquito follows the coast of the brazilian atlantic forest.
the analysis revealed very high fst values and fixed differences between the two an.
the results reveal no migration in either direction and allowed a rough estimate of the divergence time between the two sibling species.
a multilocus approach using six loci, three circadian clock genes and three encoding ribosomal proteins, was implemented to investigate in more detail the genetic differentiation between the an.
the results suggest that the two species have not exchanged migrants since their separation and that they possibly diverged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago, a period of intense climatic changes.
anopheles cruzii is the primary human plasmodium vector in southern and southeastern brazil.
cruzii populations from santa catarina  and bahia states  that represent two sibling species.
an isolation with migration model was fit to the data using the im program.
