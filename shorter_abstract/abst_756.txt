analysis of the syntenic regions from several fishes strongly suggests that the smelt acquired the afp gene from the herring.
the corresponding syntenic region has been identified and searched in a number of other species and found to be devoid of lectin or afp sequences.
the alternative hypothesis, that the afp evolved from a lectin present in a shared ancestor and that this gene was lost in most species, is not favored because both the exon and intron sequences are highly conserved.
unlike the introns of the afp gene, the intronic sequences of the flanking genes are not conserved between species.
we have previously postulated that this sporadic distribution has resulted from lateral gene transfer.
these results provide stand-alone support for an example of lateral gene transfer between vertebrate species.
quantitative pcr indicates that there is but a single copy of this gene within the smelt genome, which is atypical for fish afp genes.
while c-type lectins are ubiquitous, type ii afps are only found in a few species in three widely separated branches of teleost fishes.
here we have sequenced and annotated a  <dig> kb smelt bac clone containing a centrally-located afp gene along with  <dig> other genes.
as well, the rate and pattern of mutation in the afp gene are radically different from those seen in other smelt and herring genes.
type ii antifreeze protein  from the rainbow smelt, osmerus mordax, is a calcium-dependent c-type lectin homolog, similar to the afps from herring and sea raven.
