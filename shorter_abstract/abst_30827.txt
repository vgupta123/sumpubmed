both map_bs and yflg_bs are functional methionine aminopeptidases in vitro and in vivo.
biochemical assays showed that both map  and yflg  from b. subtilis overproduced in escherichia coli and obtained as pure proteins exhibited a methionine aminopeptidase activity in vitro.
the high expression level of map and low expression level of yflg may account for their essentiality and dispensality in b. subtilis, respectively, when cells are grown under laboratory conditions.
further work identified that yvoa acted as a possible weak repressor of yflg expression in b. subtilis in vivo.
two putative methionine aminopeptidase genes, map  and yflg , were identified in the genome sequence of bacillus subtilis.
both map and yflg genes expressed in multi-copy plasmids could complement the function of a defective map gene in the chromosomes of both e. coli and b. subtilis.
in contrast, lacz gene transcriptional fusions showed that the promoter activity of map was  <dig> to 100-fold higher than that of yflg.
we investigated whether they can function as methionine aminopeptidases and further explored possible reasons for their essentiality or dispensability in b. subtilis.
compared with map_bs, yflg_bs was approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient when assayed on synthetic peptide substrates.
