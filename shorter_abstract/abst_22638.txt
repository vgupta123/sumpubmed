while some members from each csl family  were expressed in all tissues examined, many of oscsl genes were expressed in specific tissues .
in particular, oscesa <dig>  - <dig> & - <dig> and oscesa <dig>  - <dig> & - <dig> were strongly co-expressed in tissues typical of primary and secondary cell walls, suggesting that they form as a cellulose synthase complex; these results are similar to the findings in arabidopsis.
duplication events contributed largely to the expansion of this superfamily, with cluster i and ii mainly attributed to tandem and segmental duplication, respectively.
the expression pattern of oscesa/csl and osbc1l which extensively co-expressed with oscesa/csl can be divided into three major groups with ten subgroups, each showing a distinct co-expression in tissues representing typically distinct cell wall constitutions.
these investigations revealed very useful clues on the major roles of cesa/csl, their potentially functional complement and their associations for appropriate cell wall synthesis in higher plants.
with microarray data of  <dig> tissue samples covering the entire life cycle of rice, fairly high oscesa gene expression and rather variable oscsl expression were observed.
the cellulose synthase and cellulose synthase-like gene superfamily  is proposed to encode enzymes for cellulose and non-cellulosic matrix polysaccharide synthesis in plants.
oscesa5/oscesa <dig> is likely partially redundant with oscesa <dig> for oscesa complex organization in the specific tissues .
moreover, the phylogenetic comparison in rice, arabidopsis and other species can provide clues for the prediction of orthologous gene expression patterns.
a total of  <dig> identified members of oscesa/csl were classified into two clusters based on phylogeny and motif constitution.
