muralytic enzymes from bacteriophages have recently gained attention for their potential as antibacterial agents against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms.
the muralytic activity of the phage k tame was localized to the c-terminal chap domain.
in addition, p <dig> was effective in decolonizing rat nares of s. aureus usa <dig> in an experimental model.
the gene product  contains a c-terminal domain corresponding to cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase , which demonstrated muralytic activity on a staphylococcal cell wall substrate and was lethal to s. aureus cells.
we then generated a chimeric gene construct encoding lys <dig> and a staphylococcal cell wall-binding sh3b domain.
we identified a phage k gene that encodes a protein associated with the phage tail structure.
in vivo, p <dig> was efficacious against methicillin-resistant s. aureus in a rat nasal colonization model.
we identified a phage k gene, designated orf <dig>  as encoding the phage tail-associated muralytic enzyme .
this chimeric protein  showed potent antistaphylococcal activity on global clinical isolates of s. aureus including methicillin-resistant strains.
this potent antistaphylococcal tame was combined with an efficient staphylococcus-specific cell-wall targeting domain sh3b, resulting in the chimeric protein p <dig>  this protein shows bactericidal activity against globally prevalent antibiotic resistant clinical isolates of s. aureus and against the genus staphylococcus in general.
phage k is a polyvalent virulent phage of the myoviridae family that is active against many staphylococcus species.
we constructed n-terminal truncated forms of orf <dig> and arrived at a 16-kda protein  that retained antistaphylococcal activity.
