as different assemblers use different underlying algorithms to generate contigs, we also explored merging of assemblies and found that the merged datasets not only aligned better to reference sequences than individual assemblies, but were also more consistent in the number and size of contigs.
seqman assemblies performed best on the criterion of recapitulating known transcripts, and had more novel sequence than the other assemblers, but generated an excess of small, redundant contigs.
combining differently optimal assemblies from different programs however gave a more credible final product, and this strategy is recommended.
although no single assembler performed best on all our criteria, newbler  <dig>  gave longer contigs, better alignments to some reference sequences, and was fast and easy to use.
roche  <dig> pyrosequencing has become a method of choice for generating transcriptome data from non-model organisms.
we have carried out a systematic comparison of five assemblers  to establish best practices for transcriptome assemblies, using a new dataset from the parasitic nematode litomosoides sigmodontis.
transcriptome assemblies are smaller than genome assemblies and thus should be more computationally tractable, but are often harder because individual contigs can have highly variable read coverage.
