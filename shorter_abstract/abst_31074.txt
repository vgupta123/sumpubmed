the existence and expression pattern of these channels, and behavioral effects induced by channel blockers, suggests that hydra co-opted neuropeptides for fast neuromuscular transmission.
an ion channel directly gated by hydra-rfamide neuropeptides has indeed been identified in hydra – the hydra na+ channel  2/3/ <dig>  which is expressed at the oral side of the tentacle base.
in situ hybridization suggests that hynacs are expressed in epitheliomuscular cells at the oral and the aboral side of the tentacle base and at the peduncle.
we report molecular cloning of seven new hynac subunits – hynac <dig> to hynac <dig>  all of which are members of the deg/enac gene family.
in xenopus oocytes, these subunits assemble together with the four already known subunits into thirteen different ion channels that are directly gated by hydra-rfamide neuropeptides with high affinity .
our results show that hydra has a large variety of peptide-gated ion channels that are activated by a restricted number of related neuropeptides.
hydra-rfamides are more widely expressed, however, being found in neurons of the head and peduncle region.

it is generally the case that fast transmission at neural synapses is mediated by small molecule neurotransmitters.
