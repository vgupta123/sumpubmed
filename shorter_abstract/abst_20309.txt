the combined vector system allows for flexible and affordable generation of knock-out hpscs lines, thus enabling investigation of developmental processes as well as the generation of isogenic disease models without the need for patient material.
transcription activator-like effector nucleases  have emerged as a tool for enabling targeted gene editing and disruption in difficult systems, such as human pluripotent stem cells .

improved functionality of the combined system was demonstrated by targeted disruption of the hprt <dig> gene to create isogenic disease models of lesch-nyhan-syndrome.
here, we extend an existing tale assembly system by a dual set of expression vectors for efficient application of talen technology in hpscs.
differentiating isogenic knock-out cells both into central nervous system  as well as into sensory-like neurons recapitulated previously described phenotypes based on patient-specific induced pscs and extended these findings to non-cns neurons, respectively.
