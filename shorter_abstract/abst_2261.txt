here, we characterized the metabolome and transcriptome of berries from a single clone of the corvina variety cultivated in seven different vineyards, located in three macrozones, over a 3-year trial period.
to overcome the anticipated strong vintage effect, we developed statistical tools that allowed us to identify distinct terroir signatures in the metabolic composition of berries from each macrozone, and from different vineyards within each macrozone.
our experiments with a single corvina clone in different vineyards have revealed the existence of a clear terroir-specific effect on the transcriptome and metabolome which persists over several vintages and allows each vineyard to be characterized by the unique profile of specific metabolites.
however, there is an increasing interest to define and quantify the contribution of individual factors to a specific terroir objectively.
the dynamic interaction among diverse factors including the environment, the grapevine plant and the imposed viticultural techniques means that the wine produced in a given terroir is unique.
the definition of the terroir concept is one of the most debated issues in oenology and viticulture.
we observed some relationships between the plasticity of the metabolome and transcriptome, allowing a multifaceted scientific interpretation of the terroir concept.
