however, the gd problem is np-hard, and therefore, most analyses use heuristics that lack any performance guarantee.
although the gd problem is np-hard, our novel ilp solution for it can solve instances with data sets consisting of as many as  <dig> taxa and  <dig>   <dig> genes in a few hours.
furthermore, we apply the new ilp solution to solve the gene duplication problem for the seed plant phylogeny using a 12-taxon,  <dig>  084-gene data set.
the unique, optimal solution, which places gnetales sister to the conifers, represents a new, large-scale genomic perspective on one of the most puzzling questions in plant systematics.
solving this problem makes it possible to use large gene families with complex histories of duplication and loss to infer phylogenetic trees.
the gene duplication  problem seeks a species tree that implies the fewest gene duplication events across a given collection of gene trees.
thus, this work can provide large-scale genomic perspectives on phylogenetic questions that previously could only be addressed by heuristic estimates.
with simulations, we demonstrate that the ilp solution can solve problem instances with up to  <dig> taxa.
we describe the first integer linear programming  formulation to solve instances of the gene duplication problem exactly.
