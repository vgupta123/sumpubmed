could produce in female dogs naturally infected but without clinical signs of disease, by screening a wide variety of biochemical markers for potential changes.
dogs were divided into two groups according to the results of fecal flotation methods.
mann–whitney u test was used to compare the biochemical analyte results between the two groups .
in naturally infected dogs without any evident clinical signs of disease, which could be considered in differential diagnosis, especially in an endemic area for this parasite.
the biochemical analytes determined were: the acute-phase proteins c-reactive protein  and haptoglobin ; the lipid profile ; the serum iron profile: iron, unsaturated iron binding-capacity , and ferritin; the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase ; the pancreatic profile: amylase, lipase, and trypsin-like immunoreactivity ; the oxidative stress markers: total antioxidant capacity  and paraoxonase − <dig> , along with total protein, albumin, and insulin-like growth factor –  <dig> .
therefore, the aim of this study was to explore and evaluate the possible pathophysiological changes that ancylostoma spp.
group 1: negative fecal floatation , and group 2: subclinical infection with the observation of ancylostoma spp.
significant increases in crp  : non-infected dogs:  <dig> ; subclinically infected dogs  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , hp  : g1:  <dig> ; g2:  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , and uibc  : non-infected dogs:  <dig> ; subclinically infected dogs: 216; p =  <dig> , and significantly decreased iron  : non-infected dogs:  <dig> ; subclinically infected dogs:  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , igf- <dig>  : non-infected dogs: 224; subclinically infected dogs: 123; p =  <dig> , and albumin  : non-infected dogs:  <dig> ; subclinically infected dogs:  <dig> ; p =  <dig>  concentrations were observed in dogs with subclinical ancylostoma spp.
these findings provide an overview of the biochemical effects produced by patent ancylostoma spp.
is one of the most prevalent canine intestinal nematode infections which usually causes subclinical disease in adult dogs and has zoonotic implications.
samples of feces and blood of  <dig> dogs were collected and fecal flotation and zinc sulphate centrifugal flotation were performed.
