various methods of retrieval including a keyword search, browsing of an arborized list of international classification of diseases, 10th revision  codes or using disorder phenotypic similarities can be combined to define a group of disorders and the genes known to be associated with them.
this website is intended to serve users by allowing them to input a single disorder or a disorder group and generate a panel of genes predicted to underlie the disorder of interest.
moreover, softpanel enables users to expand or refine a gene list by utilizing several biological data resources.
in addition to providing users with the facility to create a “hard” panel that contains an exact gene list for targeted sequencing, softpanel also enables generation of a “soft” panel of genes, which may be used to further filter a significantly altered set of genes identified through whole genome or whole exome sequencing.
a tutorial page is included for trying out sample data and interpreting results.
although tools to prioritize candidate disease genes have been developed, the great majority of these require prior knowledge and a set of seed genes as input, which is only possible for diseases with a known genetic etiology.
targeted next-generation sequencing is playing an increasingly important role in biological research and clinical diagnosis by allowing researchers to sequence high priority genes at much higher depths and at a fraction of the cost of whole genome or exome sequencing.
