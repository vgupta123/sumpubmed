the regulated genes clustered into three classes; immune response, cell adhesion/extracellular matrix and metabolic process.
microarray results were validated with real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.
transcriptomic analyses were performed on renal medulla biopsies obtained  <dig> hours post intervention or from sham group.
acute kidney injury  is a common and serious complication of cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass .
post cpb aki, as defined by clinical criteria, is characterised by molecular changes in renal medulla that are associated with both injury and survival programmes.
we sought to determine the changes in renal medullary gene expression in a novel and clinically relevant porcine model of cpb-induced aki.
our observations highlight the value of large animal models in aki research and provide insights into the failure of findings in rodent models to translate into clinical progress.

upregulated genes included factor v, slc16a <dig> and ckmt <dig> whereas downregulated genes included gst, cpe, mmp <dig> and sell.
the pathogenesis is poorly understood and the study of aki in rodent models has not led to improvements in clinical outcomes.
