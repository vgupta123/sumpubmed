far-western analyses followed by ms showed methionine synthase and cyclophilin bound strongly to the lrr domain.
the lrr domain bound avidly to  <dig> different cle peptides, a cyclophilin and a methionine synthase.
binding constants of 20– <dig> nm for peptides found in plant and nematode secretions were found.
western analysis suggested homo-dimers could form after protein extraction from roots.
therefore, the lrr domain of gmrlk18- <dig> might underlie both root development and disease resistance in soybean and provide an avenue to develop new variants and ligands that might promote reduced losses to scn.
the purified lrr domain, from residue 131– <dig>  was seen to form a mixture of monomers and homo-dimers in vitro.
the lrr domain of the gmrlk18- <dig> protein formed both a monomer and a homo-dimer.
