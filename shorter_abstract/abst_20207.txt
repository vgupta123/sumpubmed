the neuropeptide arginine vasopressin  modulates social behaviors via its two centrally expressed receptors, the avp 1a receptor and the avp 1b receptor .
to identify other brain areas that are affected by altered avpr1b signaling, genotypic differences in immediate early gene activation, i.e.
in males, while there were no intruder-evoked genotypic differences in c-fos immunoreactivity, genotypic differences were observed in egr- <dig> immunoreactivity within the ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the anterior hypothalamus; with avpr1b −/− males having less egr- <dig> immunoreactivity in these regions than controls.
recent work suggests that, at least in mice, avp signaling through avpr1b within the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus is critical for normal aggressive behaviors and social recognition memory.
in females, no genotypic differences in intruder-evoked c-fos or egr- <dig> immunoreactivity were observed in any of the brain areas measured.
these data are the first to identify specific brain areas that may be a part of a neural circuit that includes avpr1b-expressing cells in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus.
however, this brain area is just one part of a larger neural circuit that is likely to be impacted in avpr1b knockout  mice.
it is thought that this circuit, when working properly, plays a role in how an animal evaluates its social context.
