to address this problem, here we have developed bioword, a macro-enabled self-installing template for microsoft word documents that integrates an extensive suite of dna and protein sequence manipulation tools.
beyond simple sequence manipulation, bioword integrates functionality ranging from dyad search and consensus logos to motif discovery and pair-wise alignment.
bioword integrates a powerful set of tools for biological sequence manipulation within a handy, user-friendly tab in a widely used word processing software package.
the ability to manipulate, edit and process dna and protein sequences has rapidly become a necessary skill for practicing biologists across a wide swath of disciplines.
biologists can then easily manipulate dna and protein sequences using a familiar interface and minimize the need to switch between applications.
