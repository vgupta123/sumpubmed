this significantly enhances the number of collembolan ests in the public databases, providing useful comparative data within this phylum.
the aim of this project was to generate clones and sequence data in the form of ests to provide a platform for the future molecular characterisation of the processes involved in protective dehydration.
extraction and analysis of go annotations proved an extremely effective method for identifying generic processes associated with biochemical pathways, proving more efficient than solely analysing blast data output.
the use of go annotation for analysis has facilitated the identification of a wide variety of ests associated with a number of different biochemical pathways involved in the dehydration and recovery process in o. arcticus.
five normalised libraries were produced from both desiccating and rehydrating populations of o. arcticus from stages that had previously been defined as potentially informative for molecular analyses.
a number of genes were identified, which have previously been shown to be involved in water transport and desiccation such as members of the aquaporin family.
it is able to do this by reducing the amount of water in its body to almost zero: a process that is called "protective dehydration".
however this exactly describes the arctic winter, and the arctic springtail onychiurus arcticus regularly survives these extreme conditions and re-emerges in the spring.
40% of the clones produced significant matches against the swissprot and trembl databases and these were further analysed using go annotation.
this paper describes for the first time est data from the arctic springtail .
