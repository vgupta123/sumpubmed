rich and rigorous bio-ontologies should represent biological knowledge with high fidelity and robustness.
they offer a means of creating rich and rigorous bio-ontologies with reduced effort.
ontology design patterns, including those tested in the cell cycle ontology, can be explored in the ontology design patterns public catalogue that has been created based on the documentation system presented ().
bio-ontologies are key elements of knowledge management in bioinformatics.
this representation will produce a more efficient knowledge management in the long term.
some real-world use cases of ontology design patterns are provided and tested in the cell cycle ontology.
analogous to design patterns in software engineering, ontology design patterns are solutions to typical modelling problems that bio-ontologists can use when building bio-ontologies.
the concept of ontology design patterns is described and documentation and application methodologies for ontology design patterns are presented.
ontology design patterns provide a method for rich and rigorous modelling in bio-ontologies.
they also offer advantages at different development levels  enabling, if used, a more modular, well-founded and richer representation of the biological knowledge.
