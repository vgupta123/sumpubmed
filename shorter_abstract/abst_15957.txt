we demonstrate the robustness of the sorting effect for large parameter variations and give an analytic derivation for alternative steady-states that are reached.
the epidermal growth factor  receptor has been shown to internalize via clathrin-independent endocytosis  in a ligand concentration dependent manner.
here, we present a mathematical model of receptor sorting into alternative pathways that explains the egf-concentration dependent response of cie. the described mechanism involves a saturation effect of the dominant clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway and implies distinct steady-states into which the system is forced for low vs high egf stimulations.
from a modeling point of view, this resembles an ultrasensitive response, which is the ability of signaling networks to suppress a response for low input values and to increase to a pre-defined level for inputs exceeding a certain threshold.
several mechanisms to generate this behaviour have been described theoretically, the underlying assumptions of which, however, have not been experimentally demonstrated for the egf receptor internalization network.
the model is not restricted to egf receptor internalization and might account for ultrasensitivity in other cellular contexts.
