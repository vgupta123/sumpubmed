this mechanism may provide a means for strains to express different combinations of genes, and differences in the strain-specific repertoire of phase variable genes may underlie the strain differences.
by genome comparison of the four publicly available neisserial genomes a revised list of  <dig> genes was created that have the potential to be phase variable in n. gonorrhoeae, excluding the opa and pilc genes.
the study indicates that there are large differences between these four n. gonorrhoeae strains in terms of gene expression during in vitro growth.
there are several differences associated with the behaviour of the four main experimental neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, fa <dig>  fa <dig>  ms <dig>  and f <dig>  although there is data concerning the gene complements of these strains, the reasons for the behavioural differences are currently unknown.
phase variation is a mechanism that occurs commonly within the neisseria spp.
the results provide us with more evidence as to which genes identified through comparative genomics are indeed phase variable.
<dig> of the  <dig> genes show differences in the composition or length of the repeats, of which  <dig> are likely to be associated with phase variation.
further study of one of these in a range of clinical isolates showed this association to be due to sample size and is not maintained in a larger sample.
it does not, however, identify any clear patterns by which previously reported behavioural differences can be correlated with the phase variable gene repertoire.
