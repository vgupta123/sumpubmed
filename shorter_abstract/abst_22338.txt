some enzymes associated with cis, such as β-amylases and invertases, have still to be identified at a sequence level.
we detected biphasic behaviour of mrna accumulation for carbohydrate-associated genes and our combined genechip-qpcr data identified, at a sequence level, enzymatic activities such as β-amylases and invertases previously reported as being involved in cis.
the identification, at a sequence level, of various enzymes long known as having a role in cis provides molecular tools for further understanding the phenomenon.
in order to obtain an overall picture of early transcriptional events associated with cis, we investigated whether the commercially-available tomato affymetrix genechip could be used to identify which potato cold-responsive gene family members should be further studied in detail by real-time -pcr .
the genechip data also unveiled important processes accompanying cis, such as the induction of redox- and ethylene-associated genes.
in addition, little is known about the early events that trigger cis and on the involvement/association with cis of genes different from carbohydrate-associated genes.
transcript profiling of early events associated with cis revealed a complex network of events involving sugars, redox and hormone signalling which may be either linked serially or act in parallel.
several cold-responsive genes were identified, and their expression pattern was studied in detail by qpcr over  <dig> days.
a tomato-potato global match file was generated for the interpretation of various aspects of the heterologous dataset, including the retrieval of best matching potato counterparts and annotation, and the establishment of a core set of highly homologous genes.
