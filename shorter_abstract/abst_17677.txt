to identify chromatin binding proteins with a potential role in controlling myc activity, we established a genetic assay for dmyc activity in drosophila.
we conducted a genome-wide screen using this assay, and identified the trithorax group protein ash <dig> as a modifier of dmyc activity.
many of these genes also respond similarly upon depletion of pc and pho transcripts, as determined by concurrent microarray analysis of pc and pho rnai embryos, suggesting that the three are required for low levels of expression of a common set of targets.
the myc oncoprotein is a transcriptional regulator whose function is essential for normal development.
using rnai in the embryo and affymetrix microarrays, we show that ash <dig> rnai causes the increased expression of many genes, suggesting that it is directly or indirectly required for repression in the embryo, in contrast to its known role in maintenance of activation.
ash <dig> is a histone methyltransferase known for its role in opposing repression by polycomb.
genetic, genomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggest a model in which pc, ash <dig> and pho are required to maintain a low level of expression of embryonic targets of activation by myc, and that this occurs, directly or indirectly, by a combination of disparate chromatin modifications.
