based on these selection criteria, the isolates were identified as having the potential for horizontal gene transfer and were used to investigate the transfer of multiple antibiotic resistance phenotypes.
this study highlights the potential for extensive horizontal gene transfer in a previously neglected reservoir for enterococci.
enterococci are now well recognised for their ability to transfer antibiotic resistance and for their association with nosocomial infections, but less is known regarding their relevance in the wider environment.
all isolates were also tested for antibiotic resistance phenotypes using both disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration  assays.
these tests revealed that the enterococci demonstrated both phenotypic clumping and antibiotic resistance phenotypes.
conjugal transfer of antibiotic resistance phenotypes was determined using a solid agar mating method followed by a standard antibiotic selection test resulting in different transfer patterns.
an interspecies conjugal transfer of vancomycin resistance from e. faecalis to e. faecium was identified while the remaining reactions were within the same species.

the conjugation reactions and selection conditions used in this study resulted in a variety of co-transferred resistance phenotypes suggesting the presence of different mobile elements in the set of natural isolates.
transfer efficiencies ranging from 2 × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> were determined based on the reactions of three donor isolates  and two recipient isolates , with the transfer of vancomycin, erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes.
