the arabidopsis thaliana dgat <dig> mutant, as <dig>  has an oil content which is decreased by 30%, and a strongly increased ratio of 18:3/20: <dig>  compared to wild type.
co-incident homozygous knockout lines of dgat1/lpcat <dig> exhibited severe penalties on tag biosynthesis, delayed plant development and seed set, even with a functional pdat1; the double mutant dgat1/lpcat <dig> showed only marginally lower oil content than as <dig>
pdat <dig> expression was up-regulated by ca 65% while pdat <dig> expression was up-regulated only 15%, reinforcing the dominant role of pdat <dig> in as <dig> tag biosynthesis.
recently, it was demonstrated that in the absence of dgat <dig>  pdat <dig> was essential for normal seed development, and is a dominant determinant in arabidopsis tag biosynthesis.
collectively, the data strongly support that in as <dig> it is lpcat <dig> up-regulation which is primarily responsible for assisting in pdat1-catalyzed tag biosynthesis, maintaining a supply of pc as co-substrate to transfer sn- <dig> moieties to the sn- <dig> position of the enlarged as <dig> dag pool.
biochemical, metabolic and gene expression studies combined with genetic crossing of selected arabidopsis mutants have been carried out to demonstrate the contribution of arabidopsis pdat <dig> and lpcat <dig> in the absence of dgat <dig> activity.
