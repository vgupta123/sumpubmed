based on the pfold model, ppfold is capable of fast, high-quality predictions of large rna secondary structures, such as the genomes of rna viruses or long genomic transcripts.
we have distributed both the phylogenetic calculations and the inside-outside algorithm in ppfold, resulting in a significant reduction of runtime on multicore machines.
the pfold model couples a stochastic context-free grammar to phylogenetic analysis for a high accuracy in predictions, but the time complexity of the algorithm and underflow errors have prevented its use for long alignments.
we have evaluated the accuracy of ppfold using bralibase i tests, and demonstrated its practical use by predicting the secondary structure of an alignment of  <dig> complete hiv- <dig> genomes in  <dig> minutes on an 8-core machine and identifying several known structural elements in the prediction.
here we present ppfold, a multithreaded version of pfold, which is capable of predicting the structure of large rna alignments accurately on practical timescales.
the prediction of the structure of large rnas remains a particular challenge in bioinformatics, due to the computational complexity and low levels of accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms.
we have also improved the user interface and portability: alongside standalone executable and java source code of the program, ppfold is also available as a free plugin to the clc workbenches.
