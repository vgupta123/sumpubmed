the geometric average of any three of hprt <dig>  ef1Î±, ppia and rnapolii is suitable for normalisation of gene expression data in primary myogenic cultures from atlantic salmon.
comparison of data normalised with the geometric average obtained from combinations of any three of these genes showed no significant differences, indicating that any combination of these genes is valid.
we have investigated the expression of eight candidate genes to identify suitable reference genes for use in primary myogenic cell cultures from atlantic salmon .
initial results showed several of the candidate genes exhibited stable expression throughout myogenic culture while sdha was identified as the least stable gene.
to produce robust data from quantitative real-time pcr mrna levels need to be normalised using internal reference genes which have stable expression across all experimental samples.
relatively few studies have used cell culture systems to investigate gene expression and the regulation of myogenesis in fish.
