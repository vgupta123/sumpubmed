the  <dig> linkages between the genetic and physical maps corresponded to an equal number of contigs containing a total of  <dig>  bac clones.
both types of markers proved to be valuable for linking bac clones to the genetic map and were successfully placed across all  <dig> linkage groups.
we searched for simple sequence repeats  in the  <dig>  bac-end sequences  from the physical map and genetically mapped any polymorphic bes-ssrs onto the genetic map.
common bean  is the most important legume for direct human consumption and the goal of this study was to integrate a recently constructed physical map for the species with a microsatellite based genetic map using a bac library from the genotype g <dig> and the recombinant inbred line population dor <dig> Ã— g <dig>
of these,  <dig> were successfully integrated into the genetic map.
the integration of common bean physical and genetic maps is an important part of comparative genome analysis and a prelude to positional cloning of agronomically important genes for this crop.
a subgroup of  <dig> di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide based ssr primer pairs from these bacs was tested on the mapping parents with  <dig> single copy loci and  <dig> found to be polymorphic markers.
class ii microsatellites were more common in the bes than longer class i microsatellites.
