our findings establish a novel and dominant t aml leukemia signature characterized by occupancy of aml1-eto/n-cor at promoter-distal genomic regions enriched in motifs for myeloid differentiation factors, thus providing mechanistic insight into the leukemic phenotype.
a significant discovery of our study is that genes co-occupied by aml1-eto and n-cor  are associated with the leukemic phenotype, as determined by analyses of gene ontology and by the observation that these genes are predominantly up-regulated upon aml1-eto depletion.
because of the pressing need for new therapies in the treatment of acute myleoid leukemia, we investigated the genome-wide occupancy of aml1-eto in leukemic cells to discover novel regulatory mechanisms involving aml-eto bound genes.
in contrast, the aml1-eto/p <dig> gene network is less responsive to aml1-eto depletion and less associated with the differentiation block characteristic of leukemic cells.
the t chromosomal translocation produces aml1-eto, an oncogenic fusion protein that compromises the function of aml <dig>  a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell differentiation.
