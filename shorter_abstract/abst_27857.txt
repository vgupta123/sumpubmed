in-depth analysis of both simulated and real genomic data suggests that the method is notably insensitive to stochastic events such as gene loss, rate variation and database error, which are common challenges to the current methodology.
a new computational method of rapid, exhaustive and genome-wide detection of hgt was developed, featuring the systematic analysis of blast hit distribution patterns in the context of a priori defined hierarchical evolutionary categories.
however, these methods often produce misleading results due to their inability to resolve indirect phylogenetic links and their vulnerability to stochastic events.
this method was further tested on real genomic datasets, including rickettsia genomes, and was compared to previous studies.
results show consistency with currently employed categories of hgt prediction methods.
the program is versatile, easily deployed, has a low requirement for computational resources.
this will continue to be necessary given the rapid growth of genomic data and the technical difficulties in conducting large-scale explicit phylogenetic analyses.
tests on simulated genomic data suggest that this approach effectively targets atypically distributed genes that are highly likely to be hgt-derived, and exhibits robust performance compared to conventional blast-based approaches.
