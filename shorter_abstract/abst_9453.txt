t. versicolor ibl- <dig> was cultured in solid state fermentation  medium of corn cobs and maximum lip activity of 592 ±  <dig> u/ml was recorded after five days of incubation under optimum culture conditions.
the free and immobilized lips were characterized and the results showed that the free and immobilized lips had optimum ph  <dig> and  <dig> while optimum temperatures were 60°c and 80°c, respectively.
the results obtained after dual phase characterization suggested xerogel matrix entrapment a promising tool for enzyme immobilization, hyper-activation and stabilization against high temperature and inactivating agents.
the ph and temperature optima, extra thermo-stability features and kinetic characteristics of this novel lip of t. versicolor ibl- <dig> make it a versatile enzyme for various industrial and biotechnological applications.
keeping in view the extensive industrial applications of lignin peroxidase , this study was performed to purify and characterize the lip from an indigenous strain of trametes versicolor ibl- <dig>  xerogel matrix enzyme immobilization technique was applied to improve the kinetic and thermo-stability characteristics of lip to fulfil the requirements of the modern enzyme consumer sector of biotechnology.
the indigenously isolated white rot fungal strain t. versicolor ibl- <dig> showed tremendous potential for lip synthesis in ssf of corncobs in high titters  than other reported trametes  species.
immobilization was found to enhance the activity and thermo-stability potential of lip significantly and immobilized lip remained stable over broad ph and temperature range as compare to free enzyme.
the lip was immobilized by entrapping in xerogel matrix of trimethoxysilane  and proplytetramethoxysilane  and maximum immobilization efficiency of  <dig> % was achieved.
the crude lip was  <dig> -fold purified with specific activity of  <dig> u/mg after passing through the deae-cellulose and sephadex-g- <dig> chromatography columns.
