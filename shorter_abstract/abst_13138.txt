the two inducible promoters drive much lower levels of rsp <dig> protein expression than the constitutive psad promoter, which shows almost complete rescue of motility.
maximum complementation  was reached with very different kinetics .
based on our data, the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters should be capable of fully complementing mutants in genes whose products exert their biological activity at low concentrations.
to our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of the cyc <dig> or cah <dig> promoters to perform a chemically regulated complementation of a chlamydomonas mutant.
we fused the cyc <dig> and cah <dig> promoters to an ha-tagged rsp <dig> gene, encoding a protein of the flagellar radial spoke complex.
chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for the biology of unicellular green algae.
