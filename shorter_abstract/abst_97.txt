pentraxins are secreted proteins that bind to, and promote efficient clearance of, microbial pathogens and cellular debris during infection, inflammation, and tissue damage.
as monocytes and macrophages are exposed to differing concentrations of pentraxins and their ligands during infection, inflammation, and tissue damage, we assessed what effect pentraxins and their ligands have on these cells.
these results suggest that the presence of pentraxins and their ligands regulate macrophage differentiation in the blood and tissues, and that crp may be a potent inducer of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>

however, pentraxins, their ligands, and cytokines differentially regulate the expression of the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex receptor cd <dig>  the sialic acid-binding lectin cd <dig>  and the macrophage mannose receptor cd <dig>  crp, a pentraxin generally thought of as being pro-inflammatory, increases the extracellular accumulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  and this effect is attenuated by gm-csf, mannose-binding lectin, and factor h.
