samples of plasma and white blood cells were collected from three alaskan caribou herds, mulchatna , teshekpuk  and the western arctic  in  <dig>
in  <dig>  ocular and nasal swab samples were collected from  <dig> apparently healthy reindeer calves near wales, alaska.
pcr of nasal and ocular swabs sampled from  <dig> reindeer calves in wales, alaska  yielded four cvhv <dig> positive samples.
a virus neutralization test of  <dig> samples from both reindeer and caribou showed that elisa positive samples always neutralized cvhv <dig> to a greater extent than bohv <dig> or elk herpesvirus , indicating that cvhv <dig> is the most likely virus circulating.
based on sequence similarity, cvhv- <dig> is the most likely virus.
this study shows that alaskan reindeer and caribou are infected with an alphaherpesvirus.
we sought to determine if the same virus, or similar herpesviruses, were circulating in alaskan reindeer and caribou .
pcr amplicons of the expected size  were obtained from  <dig> of the  <dig> buffy coats samples from caribou, and the amplicon sequences were consistent with cvhv <dig>
