further, the results described here are of particular interest when reverse genetics studies cannot be easily achieved in organisms not amenable to rnai.
next, we performed a functional complementation of tbpfr <dig>  silenced via dsrna targeting its coding sequence, through heterologous expression of the tbpfr <dig> orthologue gene from trypanosoma cruzi: the flagellum regained its motility.
this work shows that functional complementation experiments can be readily performed in order to ascertain that phenotypic effects observed upon rnai experiments are indeed due to the specific silencing of the targetted gene.
using the protozoan trypanosoma brucei as a model, we designed a functional complementation assay to ascertain that phenotypic effect observed upon rnai were due to specific silencing of the targeted gene.
