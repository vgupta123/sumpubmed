transcriptomic analysis of the glandular trichomes from the s. pomifera leaves revealed two genes likely involved in miltiradiene synthesis.
in the present study, a thorough metabolite analysis of s. pomifera leaves led to the isolation and structure elucidation of carnosic acid-family metabolites including one new natural product.
in addition, several cyp-encoding transcripts were identified providing a valuable resource for the identification of the biosynthetic mechanism responsible for the production of carnosic acid-family metabolites in s. pomifera.
the transcriptome of s.pomifera glandular trichomes was analysed aiming to identify genes that could be used in the engineering of synthetic microbial systems.
our work has uncovered the key enzymes involved in miltiradiene biosynthesis in s. pomifera leaf glandular trichomes.
their products were identified and the corresponding enzymes were characterized as copalyl diphosphate synthase  and miltiradiene synthase .
among them, carnosic acid and carnosol, tanshinones and sclareol are well known for their cardiovascular, antitumor, antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities.
the transcriptomic dataset obtained provides a valuable tool for the identification of the cyps involved in the synthesis of carnosic acid-family metabolites.
