for certain tfs, the co-binding partners of direct binding  differs from those of indirect binding ; the distinct set of co-binding partners can predict whether the tf binds directly or indirectly with up to 95% accuracy.
our results provide comprehensive cell-type-specific combinatorial binding maps and suggest a modular organization of combinatorial binding.
furthermore, we found that tens of thousands of regulatory regions use multiple modules, a structure that cannot be observed with previous hard clustering based methods.
for certain regulatory regions, more than one regulatory module  are combined to achieve context-specific gene regulation.
our method learns compact and coherent regulatory modules from in vivo binding data using a topic model.
joint analysis across two cell types reveals both cell-type-specific and shared regulatory modules.
we present a new computational approach that models the modular organization of tf combinatorial binding.
the combinatorial binding of trans-acting factors  to the dna is critical to the spatial and temporal specificity of gene regulation.
however, previous approaches are limited to either pairwise tf co-association analysis or assuming that only one module is used in each regulatory region.
we found that the binding of  <dig> tfs in k <dig> cells can be organized into  <dig> interpretable modules.

the modules discovered recapitulate many published protein-protein physical interactions, have consistent functional annotations of chromatin states, and uncover context specific co-binding such as gene proximal binding of nfy + fos + sp and distal binding of nfy + fos + usf.
