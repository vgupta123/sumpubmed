to address the general issue of whether transposons mediate genomic changes in environment-adaptation genes, we scanned two alleles per each of the six xenobiotic-metabolizing helicoverpa zea cytochrome p <dig> loci, including cyp6b <dig>  cyp6b <dig>  cyp321a <dig>  cyp321a <dig>  cyp9a12v <dig> and cyp9a <dig>  for the presence of transposon insertions by genome walking and sequence analysis.
transposable elements , are the major internal spontaneous mutation agents for the variability of eukaryotic genomes.
in d. melanogaster, seven out of the eight drosophila p450s  implicated in insecticide resistance are associated with a variety of transposons.
these results indicate that tes are selectively retained within or in close proximity to xenobiotic-metabolizing p <dig> genes.
we also scanned thirteen drosophila melanogaster p450s genes for te insertions by in silico mapping and literature search.
twelve novel transposons, including lines , sines , mites , one full-length transib-like transposon, and one full-length tcl-like dna transpson, are identified from the alleles of the six h. zea p <dig> genes.
by contrast, all the five drosophila p450s  involved in ecdysone biosynthesis and developmental regulation are free of te insertions.
