unlike existing methods for motif discovery, the motifs themselves are not required to occur at unusually high frequency but only to exhibit a significant preference to occur at a specific distance from each other.
in the present implementation of the method, motifs are represented by pentamers and all pairs of pentamers are evaluated for statistically significant preference for a specific distance.
a number of methods have been developed for discovery of such sequence motifs with a primary focus on detection of regulatory motifs and particularly transcription factor binding sites.
an important step of the algorithm eliminates motif pairs where the spacers separating the two motifs exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity; such motif pairs likely arise from duplications of the whole segment including the motifs and the spacer rather than due to selective constraints indicative of a functional importance of the motif pair.
dna sequences contain repetitive motifs which have various functions in the physiology of the organism.
the method was used to scan  <dig> complete prokaryotic genomes for novel sequence motifs.
we present a new motif-finding technique that is applicable to scanning complete genomes for sequence motifs.
we conclude that our approach to detection of significant motif pairs can complement existing motif-finding techniques in discovery of novel functional sequence motifs in complete genomes.

the results from analysis of  <dig> genomes suggest that the method detects previously known motifs that are expected to be found as well as new motifs that are unlikely to be discovered by traditional motif-finding methods.
selected motif pairs were subjected to further investigation and in some cases their possible biological functions were proposed.
