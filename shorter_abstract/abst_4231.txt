two training sets representing organellar  and cell envelope  proteins were constructed based on previous experimental evidence and comparative genomics.
random forest  classifiers trained on these two sets could differentiate between organellar and cell envelope proteins with ~89% accuracy using  <dig> features consisting of frequencies of two adjacent amino acid combinations.
a physicochemically distinct organellar sub-proteome containing  <dig> proteins was predicted with the best rf classifier.
it is currently unknown which proteins constitute the organellar proteome and how anammox bacteria are able to specifically target organellar and cell-envelope proteins to their correct final destinations.
here, we make use of these genome data to predict the organellar sub-proteome and address the molecular basis of protein sorting in anammox bacteria.
a physicochemically distinct organellar sub-proteome was predicted from the genome of the anammox bacterium k. stuttgartiensis.
however, the genome of the anammox bacterium candidatus "kuenenia stuttgartiensis" has recently been sequenced.
apparently, the cytoplasmic membrane performs no catabolic functions.
this result provides strong in silico support for the existing experimental evidence for the existence of an organelle in this bacterium, and is an important step forward in unravelling a geochemically relevant case of cytoplasmic differentiation in bacteria.
