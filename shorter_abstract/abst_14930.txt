genes of the major histocompatibility complex  code for key functions in the adaptive immune response of vertebrates and most of them show exceptionally high polymorphism.
more specifically, the potential negative relation between individual allele divergence and number of parasite species is in line with the 'divergent allele advantage' hypothesis.
we analysed mhc class iib diversity, gastrointestinal parasite load and body condition in the wild ranging tropical rat leopoldamys sabanus  under natural selection conditions in a highly variable rainforest environment in borneo to explore the mechanisms that maintain these high levels of genetic polymorphism.
besides a clear advantage for more diverse mhc genotypes in terms of number of alleles, reflected in better body condition and resistance against helminth infection, our data also suggested a positive effect of mhc allele divergence within an individual on these parameters.
