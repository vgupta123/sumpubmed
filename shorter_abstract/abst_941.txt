alzheimer’s disease affects more than  <dig> million people worldwide but there is no known cure.
to identify these early events we used transcriptional profiling of mouse brains combined with computational approaches including singular value decomposition and hierarchical clustering.
a combination of transcriptional profiling combined with computational analyses has uncovered novel features relevant to alzheimer’s disease in a widely used mouse model and offers avenues for further exploration into early stages of ad.
our study identifies three key events in early stages of alzheimer’s disease.
here, we used a mouse model of alzheimer’s disease to identify age-specific changes that occur prior to and at the onset of traditional alzheimer-related phenotypes including amyloid plaque formation.
first, the most important drivers of alzheimer’s disease onset in these mice are age-specific changes.
finally, insulin signaling, in particular the down-regulation of the insulin receptor substrate  <dig>  gene, may be an important event in the transition from age-related changes to alzheimer’s disease specific-changes.
these include perturbations of the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
