it was lost from hap <dig> in the eutherian lineage, and also from t27a <dig>  in c. elegans.
we performed phylogenetic analyses of the hap1_n domain family of proteins, incorporating hap <dig> orthologues  from  <dig> vertebrate classes, and also searched the dictyostelium proteome for a common ancestor.
we have identified eutherian hap <dig> as an evolutionarily recent adaptation of a vertebrate trak protein-like ancestor, and found conserved cdx1/cdx <dig> and max transcription factor binding sites near the tata box in mammalian hap <dig> gene promoters.
hap <dig>  trak <dig> and trak <dig> have a degree of common function, particularly regarding intracellular receptor trafficking.
a conserved arrangement of regulatory elements was identified, including sites for caudal-related homeobox transcription factors , and myc-associated factor x  in the region of the tata box.
huntingtin-associated protein  <dig>  is expressed in neurons and endocrine cells, and is critical for postnatal survival in mice.
we also demonstrated that hap <dig> is expressed in endocrine cells of the human gut.
cdx <dig> and cdx <dig> are intestine-enriched factors, prompting investigation of hap <dig> protein expression in the human duodenum.
the hap <dig> promoter from human, mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, dog, tasmanian devil and opossum contained common sites for transcription factors involved in cell cycle, growth, differentiation, and stress response.
we found that as recently as marsupials, hap <dig> contained a milt/trak domain and was more similar to trak <dig> and trak <dig> than to eutherian hap <dig>  the milt/trak domain likely arose post multicellularity, as it was absent in the dictyostelium proteome.
however, trak <dig>  trak <dig> and milton  differ in function to hap <dig> in that they are mitochondrial transport proteins, while hap <dig> has emerging roles in starvation response.
hap <dig> was localized to singly dispersed mucosal cells, including a subset of serotonin-positive enterochromaffin cells.
