the two alleles of about 60% of the  <dig>  snps are segregating simultaneously in both coastal and interior provenances, which indicates a high proportion of ancestral shared polymorphisms or a high level of gene flow between these two ecologically and phenotypically different varieties.
both will serve as a useful resource for the further characterization of the genome and transcriptome of douglas-fir and for the analysis of genetic variation using genotyping or resequencing methods.
however, genomic data and tools for studying genetic variation in natural populations to understand the genetic and physiological mechanisms of adaptation are currently missing for douglas-fir.
functional annotation by blast searches and gene ontology mapping showed that the composition of functional classes is very similar to other plant transcriptomes and demonstrated that a large fraction of the douglas-fir transcriptome is tagged by the puts.
the  <dig> sequencing of twelve normalized cdna libraries resulted in  <dig>  million reads from which a set of  <dig>  putative unique transcripts  was assembled.
a total number of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  were detected by three snp detection tools.
the libraries were constructed from needle and wood tissue of coastal and interior provenances subjected to drought stress experiments.
this study represents a first step towards characterizing the douglas-fir transcriptome based on  <dig> sequencing of twelve cdna libraries.
however, only  <dig>  snps were identified by all three methods, indicating that snp detection depends on the particular method used.
based on evolutionary conservation, we identified about  <dig>  candidate genes related to drought stress.
