here we report that genotypically unrelated strains of e. aerogenes can be misidentified as k. pneumoniae by routine laboratories using standard biochemical identification and using identification automates.
ten clinical isolates, identified as k. pneumoniae or k. terrigena with the routinely used biochemical tests and with api-20e, were identified as e. aerogenes by tdna-pcr – an identification that was confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing for five of these isolates.
it could be shown by rapd-analysis that the e. aerogenes strains belonged to different genotypes.
clinical e. aerogenes isolates can be easily misidentified as klebsiella due to delayed positivity for ornithine decarboxylase and motility.
enterobacter aerogenes and klebsiella pneumoniae are common isolates in clinical microbiology and important as producers of extended spectrum β-lactamases .
misidentification also occurred when using the automated identification systems vitek  <dig> and phoenix, and was due to delayed positivity for ornithine decarboxylase and motility.
subculture and prolonged incubation resulted in positive results for ornithine decarboxylase and for motility.
a useful clue for correct identification is the presence of an inducible β-lactamase, which is highly unusual for k. pneumoniae.
