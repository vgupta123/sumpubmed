to determine the prea/preb regulon in s. typhimurium, we performed dna microarrays comparing the wild type strain and various prea and/or preb mutants in the presence of ectopically expressed prea .
contrary to previous reports on this tcs, we were unable to show a prea/preb-dependent effect of the quorum-sensing signal ai- <dig> or of epinephrine on s. typhimurium with regard to bacterial motility.
a proportion of the activated loci were previously identified as pmra-activated genes  or were genes located in the local region around prea, including the preab operon.
in both salmonella and e. coli, this system has been shown to affect motility and virulence in response to quorum-sensing and hormonal signals, and to affect the transcription of the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  pmrab operon, which encodes an important virulence-associated tcs.
this first in-depth study of the prea/preb regulatory system phenotypes and regulation suggests significant comparative differences to the reported function of the orthologous qseb/qsec in e. coli.
the transcriptional units were defined in this local region by rt-pcr, suggesting three prea activated operons composed of prea-preb, mdab-ygin, and ygiw-stm <dig>  several putative virulence-related phenotypes were examined for preab mutants, resulting in the observation of a host cell invasion and slight virulence defect of a preab mutant.
