we developed a machine learning  method to augment polybayes to improve its prediction accuracy.
while both ml and polybayes produced a similar number of true positives, the ml program generated only  <dig> false positives as compared to  <dig>  for polybayes.
the ml program c <dig>  was applied to a set of features in order to build a snp classifier from training data based on human expert decisions .
the training data were  <dig>  candidate snp generated by sequencing  <dig> sts   in both directions from  <dig> diverse homozygous soybean cultivars and polybayes analysis.
the complexity of the soybean genome may have contributed to high false snp predictions by polybayes and hence results may differ for other genomes.
the results from this study indicate that a trained ml classifier can significantly reduce human intervention and in this case achieved a 5â€“ <dig> fold enhanced productivity.
after training the ml classifier, it agreed with the experts on  <dig> % of test data compared with  <dig> % agreement between polybayes and experts.
a machine learning  method was developed as a supplementary feature to the polymorphism detection software for improving prediction accuracies.
test data of  <dig>  candidate snp were generated similarly from  <dig> additional sts .
