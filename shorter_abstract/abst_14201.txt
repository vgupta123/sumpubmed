during forebrain development, otp <dig> is expressed in anterior groups of diencephalic cells, positioned in the preoptic area   and the posterior tuberculum  .
disruptions of hedgehog  and fibroblast growth factor  pathways point to the ability of shh protein to trigger otp <dig> expression in po presumptive neuroblasts, with the attenuating effect of dzip <dig> and fgf <dig>  in addition, our data disclose otp <dig> as a determinant of ca neurons in the pt, where otp <dig> activity is strictly dependent on nodal signaling and it is not responsive to shh and fgf.
