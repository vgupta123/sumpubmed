among these, hiv-nef is considered a promising target for vaccine development because immune responses directed against this viral protein could help to control the initial steps of viral infection and to reduce viral loads and spreading.
here we report the expression and purification of hiv nef from transgenic tobacco.
we have successfully expressed hiv nef polypeptides in the cytosol of transgenic tobacco plants.
modern vaccines are becoming increasingly complex, with the incorporation of multiple antigens.
we therefore generated transgenic plants expressing cytosolic, full length or truncated nef.
we designed constructs to direct the expression of p <dig> and p <dig> nef to either the cytosol or the secretory pathway.
the same is not true for nef polypeptides targeted to the secretory pathway by virtue of a signal peptide.
two isoforms of nef protein can be found in cells: a full-length n-terminal myristoylated form  and a truncated form .
we tested these constructs by transient expression in tobacco protoplasts.
we have shown that transient expression can help to rapidly determine the best cellular compartment for accumulation of a recombinant protein.
cytosolic nef polypeptides are correctly synthesised and are stable.
expression levels were variable, but in some lines they averaged  <dig> % of total soluble proteins.
