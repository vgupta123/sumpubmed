the intronic unannotated expression was found to be strongly associated with genes annotated for neurogenesis, axon guidance, negative regulation of transcription, and neural transmission.
we found that the neural and stem cell transcriptomes share global similarity in both gene and chromosomal expression, but are quite different from those of liver or muscle.
to investigate the characteristics of neural transcriptomes and possible functions of previously unknown transcripts, we analyzed and compared nine recent rna-seq datasets corresponding to tissues/organs ranging from stem cell, embryonic brain cortex to adult whole brain.
it also suggested potential functional roles for previously unknown transcripts actively expressed in the developing brain cortex.

we also found an unusually high level of unannotated expression in mouse embryonic brains.
our results revealed unique global and local landscapes of neural transcriptomes.
our findings provide new insights into potentially novel genes, gene functions and regulatory mechanisms in early brain development.
