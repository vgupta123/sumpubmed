we demonstrate the finding that as a result of phenotypic cross resistance, the considered clinical hiv- <dig> protease isolates are confined to ~6% or less of the clinically-relevant phenotypic space.
great strides have been made in the effective treatment of hiv- <dig> with the development of second-generation protease inhibitors  that are effective against historically multi-pi-resistant hiv- <dig> variants.
we show that phenotypic similarity does not imply genotypic similarity, that different pi-resistance mutation patterns can give rise to hiv- <dig> isolates with similar phenotypic profiles.
nevertheless, mutation patterns that confer decreasing susceptibility to available pis continue to arise within the population.
clustering and feature selection methods are used to find representative sequences and mutations for major resistance phenotypes to elucidate their genotypic signatures.
rather than characterizing hiv- <dig> susceptibility toward each pi individually, our study offers a unique perspective on the phenomenon of pi class resistance by uncovering major multidrug-resistant phenotypic patterns and their often diverse genotypic determinants, providing a methodology that can be applied to understand clinically-relevant phenotypic patterns to aid in the design of novel inhibitors that target other rapidly evolving molecular targets as well.
