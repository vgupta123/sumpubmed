assessing which genetic markers are involved in determining trait status is a computationally demanding task, especially in the presence of gene-gene interactions.
in comparison with commonly used approaches for detecting interactions, bayesian neural networks perform very well across a broad spectrum of possible genetic relationships.
by using graphics processing units  the time needed to build these models is decreased by several orders of magnitude.
the proposed framework is shown to be a powerful method for detecting causal snps while being computationally efficient enough to handle large datasets.
a non-parametric bayesian approach in the form of a bayesian neural network is proposed for use in analyzing genetic association studies.
