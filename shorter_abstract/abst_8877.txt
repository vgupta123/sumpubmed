the position of genes within the strand bias structure affects the probability that a gene is switched on and its expression level.
the direct cause of the strand bias structure may be dna replication.
the mouse genome is shown to have a segmented structure defined by strand bias.
transcription is known to cause a strand bias and numerous analyses are presented to show that the strand bias in question is not caused by transcription.
however, these strand bias segments influence the position of genes and their unspliced length.
the strand bias segments represent a further biological feature, the chromatin structure, which in turn influences the ease of transcription.
