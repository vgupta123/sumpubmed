molecular dynamics simulations show that the y <dig> side chain can be in "open" or "closed" states with only the former enabling complex formation.
molecular dynamics simulations have revealed how the binding of p <dig> to mdm <dig> is modulated by the conformational mobility of y <dig> which is the gatekeeper residue in mdm <dig>  the mobility of this residue can be modulated by the conformations of p <dig> and the nterminal lid region of mdm <dig>
interconversions between these two states can be induced by the n-terminal region of mdm <dig> or by the conformations of the p <dig> peptides.
when both p <dig> and mdm <dig> are in near native conformations, complex formation is rapid and is driven by the formation of a hydrogen bond between w <dig> of p <dig> and l <dig> of mdm <dig> or by the embedding of f <dig> of p <dig> into mdm <dig>  the transition of y <dig> from "closed" to "open" can increase the size of the binding site.
