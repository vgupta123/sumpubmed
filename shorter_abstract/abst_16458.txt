however, the impact of the iron availability on the c. crescentus transcriptome and an overall perspective of the regulatory networks involved remain unknown.
in this work we report the identification of iron-responsive and fur-regulated genes in c. crescentus using microarray-based global transcriptional analyses.
using a global transcriptional approach, we determined the c. crescentus iron stimulon.
altogether, our results showed that adaptation of c. crescentus to iron limitation not only involves increasing the transcription of iron-acquisition systems and decreasing the production of iron-using proteins, but also includes novel genes and regulatory mechanisms.
we identified  <dig> genes that were strongly upregulated both by mutation of fur and by iron limitation condition.
caulobacter crescentus, an important freshwater α-proteobacterium, uses the ferric uptake repressor  for such purpose.

in addition to the fur modulon, iron limitation altered expression of  <dig> more genes, including induction of genes involved in fe-s cluster assembly, oxidative stress and heat shock response, as well as repression of genes implicated in amino acid metabolism, chemotaxis and motility.
as expected, this group includes many genes involved in energy metabolism, mostly iron-using enzymes.
bioinformatics analyses suggest that positive regulation by fur is mainly indirect.
among them, there are genes involved in iron uptake , riboflavin biosynthesis and genes encoding hypothetical proteins.
these data were validated by β-galactosidase and emsa assays for two operons encoding putative transporters.
