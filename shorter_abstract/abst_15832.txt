our data provide genetic evidence of the multiple disease hypothesis that many cytokine genes are involved in tb susceptibility.
we performed a case–control study of  <dig> patients diagnosed with ptb,  <dig> with latent tb infection , and  <dig> healthy controls , to explore the association between polymorphisms in cytokine genes and a predisposition to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and tb disease.
the genotype frequencies of other polymorphisms did not differ between the ptb patients, ltbi and hc subjects.
the a allele at nucleotide − <dig> of the interleukin  <dig>  gene was significantly more common in ptb patients than in ltbi subjects.
moreover, the polymorphisms at ifn-γ − <dig> and il10 −  <dig> were associated with protein levels of ifn-γ and il- <dig>  respectively, in the ptb group.
in particular, the balance between the th <dig> and th <dig> cytokine responses influences the expression of disease in individuals with pulmonary tb .
polymorphisms in cytokine genes are known to influence cytokine levels, which may influence susceptibility to tuberculosis  infection and disease.
a single-gene analysis showed a dominant association between the aa genotype or a allele at nucleotide − <dig> of the interferon γ  gene and ltbi.
