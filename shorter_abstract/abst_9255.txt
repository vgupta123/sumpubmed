the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data allowed us to identify genes with potentially differential expression under imbalanced nutrition.
imbalanced concentration of nutrient elements in soil decrease flax yields and also results in heritable changes in some flax lines.
obtained results provide new insights into edaphic stress response in flax and the role of lis- <dig> in these process.
differentially expressed genes were identified in flax plants, which were grown under phosphate deficiency and excess nutrition, on the basis of high-throughput sequencing and qpcr data.

moreover, the alterations of wrky family genes differed depending on lis- <dig> presence in flax plant genome.
cultivated flax  is widely used for production of textile, food, chemical and pharmaceutical products.
high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome of flax plants grown under normal , phosphate deficient , and nutrient excess  conditions was carried out using illumina platform.
for further investigation with qpcr,  <dig> genes were chosen and their expression levels were evaluated in the extended sampling of  <dig> flax plants.
the assembly of transcriptome was performed, and a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique transcripts for n, p, and npk sequencing libraries were identified, respectively.
search for genes, which are involved in stress response, is necessary for breeding of adaptive cultivars.
we showed that wrky and jas gene families participate in flax response to imbalanced nutrient content in soil.
besides, we revealed slight and lis- <dig> independent mrna level changes of krp <dig> and ing <dig> genes, which are adjacent to lis- <dig>  under nutrition stress.
significant expression alterations were revealed for genes encoding wrky and jaz protein families under p and npk conditions.
