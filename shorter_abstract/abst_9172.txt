male c57bl/ <dig> mice were respectively fed with a 30% fat diet, the same diet with pioglitazone  <dig> mg/kg/day, or a chow diet as control for  <dig> weeks.
our results show that hepatic steatosis was induced by a high-fat diet and improved by adding pioglitazone.
malondialdehyde concentration and 8-oxog staining were strongly increased in the high-fat diet group, but attenuated by pioglitazone.
gene expressions of antioxidant defense mechanism: sod <dig>  sod <dig>  ogg <dig> and muty significantly decreased in the high-fat diet group but reversed by pioglitazone co-administration.
the attenuation of hepatic oxidative dna damage by pioglitazone in a high-fat diet may be mediated by up-regulation of the antioxidant defense mechanism and oxidative dna repair activity.
enzymatic antioxidant defense was detected by the real-time pcr of superoxide dismutase  and dna glycosylase .
pioglitazone was reported to improve hepatic steatosis and necroinflammation in human studies.
oxidative dna repair was detected by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting of ogg <dig> expression.
the diminution of oxidative damage may explain the clinical benefit of pioglitazone treatment in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
tissue oxidative stress was indicated by malondialdehyde concentration.
to investigate whether the hepato-protective effect of pioglitazone was associated with an improvement of antioxidant defense mechanism, oxidative dna damage and repair activity were determined in a high fat diet model.
oxidative dna damage was detected by immunohistochemical 8-oxog staining.
