our results suggest that pfsmad <dig> plays a role in biomineralization and can transduce bmp signals in p. fucata.
a knockdown experiment using pfbmp <dig> dsrna showed decreased pfbmp <dig> and pfsmad <dig> mrna and irregular crystallization of the nacreous layer using scanning electron microscopy.
the bmp- <dig> signaling pathway plays a canonical role in biomineralization.
smad <dig> is an intracellular transmitter in the bmp signaling pathway in mammals, and some genomic data show smad4’s involvment in bmp signaling in invertbrates, but whether smad <dig> plays a conservative role in pearl oyster, pinctada fucata, still need to be tested.
in this study, we identified a smad <dig> gene  in pearl oyster pinctada fucata.

our data provides important clues about the molecular mechanisms that regulate biomineralization in pearl oyster.
pfsmad <dig> was located in the cytoplasm in immunofluorescence assays and analyses of pfsmad <dig> mrna in tissues and developmental stages showed high expression in ovaries and d-shaped larvae.
