our analyses, based on the two commonly used mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase i  and cytochrome b , suggest that both arrays and barcodes are capable of discriminating mammalian species with high accuracy.
as for dna barcoding, our analyses show that both cytochrome c oxidase i and cytochrome b genes, and even smaller fragments of them  can successfully discriminate species in a wide variety of specimens.
however, because designing dna arrays require advance knowledge of target sequences, the use of this approach could be limited in large scale monitoring programs where unknown haplotypes might be encountered.
the rapid and accurate identification of species is a critical component of large-scale biodiversity monitoring programs.
dna arrays  and dna barcodes are two molecular approaches that have recently garnered much attention.
for dna arrays we designed three probes for each species to address intraspecific variation.
this study showed that dna arrays and dna barcodes are valuable molecular methods for biodiversity monitoring programs.
we used three different datasets of mammalian species, comprising different sampling strategies.
dna barcodes, by contrast, are sequencing-based and therefore could provide more flexibility in large-scale studies.
both approaches were capable of discriminating among mammalian species in our test assemblages.
