aggresomes are juxtanuclear inclusion bodies that have been proposed to represent a general cellular response to misfolded proteins in mammalian cells.
our results establish that aggresomes are not obligatory products of protein misfolding in vivo.
here, we investigate if a misfolded protein inevitably forms aggresomes in mammalian cells.
we show that a cytoplasmic form of the prion protein may form aggresomes or dispersed aggregates in different cell lines.
modulation of expression levels or proteasome inhibitors does not alter the formation of dispersed aggregates.
