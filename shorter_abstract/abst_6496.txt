however, information about ervs in other bovids and the presence of families of related bovine ervs in different species of the bovidae family is scarce.
in addition, purifying selection could be acting on clusters of ervs from different species.
in addition, six new families, named boerv <dig> to boerv <dig>  were detected in the three bos species.
in cattle, more than  <dig>  elements related to ervs have been detected, and based on the pol gene,  <dig> families or groups of bovine ervs have been described.
the  <dig> families of bovine ervs previously detected in cattle  were also detected in zebus  and yaks .
based on ltr divergence, the most recently inserted families are from class ii.
endogenous retroviruses  are genomic elements of retroviral origin that are present in the genomes of almost all vertebrates.
in addition, purifying selection was detected in the genes and retroviral regions of clusters of ervs of cattle, zebus and yaks.
an analysis of the homology of the ervs of cattle, zebus and yaks revealed that the level of ltr divergence was similar between ervs from cattle and zebus but was less similar between with ervs from cattle and yaks.
in this work, the  <dig> erv families previously identified in cattle were also found in two other species in the bos genus.
