the number of peptide-peptide combinations grows quadratically with respect to the number of proteins, resulting in a high computational complexity.
a further analysis indicated that some of the additional identified results were thanks to the exhaustive search.
chemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry  is a high-throughput approach to studying protein-protein interactions.
it can exhaustively search a whole database in a reasonable period of time without any heuristic pre-selection procedure.
widely used methods including xquest :315– <dig>  2008; walzthoeni et al., nat methods 9:901– <dig>  2012), plink :904– <dig>  2012), proteinprospector :420– <dig>  2014) and kojak :2190– <dig>  2015) avoid searching all peptide-peptide combinations by pre-selecting peptides with heuristic approaches.
we have developed a cross-linked peptides identification tool named ecl.
to the best of our knowledge, ecl is the first tool that can exhaustively search all candidates in cross-linked peptides identification.
a tool that can exhaustively search a whole database without any heuristic pre-selection procedure is therefore desirable.
the most intuitive approach is searching all possible candidates.
