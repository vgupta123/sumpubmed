this study demonstrates that whole-genome re-sequencing to 22x fold genome coverage is an efficient tool to characterise single and multi-copy insertion mutants in the filamentous ascomycete fusarium graminearum.
a random data sampling approach revealed the minimum genome coverage required to survey the f. graminearum genome for alterations.
the workflow was tested using four mutants showing evidence of single and multi-copy insertions in dna blot analysis.
plasmid insertion mutagenesis of fungal protoplasts is frequently used for this purpose in filamentous ascomycetes.
identifying the insertion event has previously met with varying degrees of success, from a cleanly disrupted gene with minimal deletion of nucleotides at the insertion point to multiple-copy insertion events and large deletions of chromosomal regions.
in some cases insertion events are accompanied with large untagged chromosomal deletions while in other cases a straight-forward insertion event could be confirmed.
we developed the findinsertseq workflow to localise the dna tag insertions to the nucleotide level.
we used a whole-genome sequencing  approach using illumina hiseq  <dig> technology to investigate dna tag insertion points and chromosomal deletion events in mutagenised, reduced virulence f. graminearum isolates identified in disease tests on wheat .
by comparing sequencing coverage, unexpected molecular recombination events such as large tagged and untagged chromosomal deletions, and dna amplification were observed in three of the analysed mutants.
