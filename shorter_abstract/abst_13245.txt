however, direct evaluation of the emerging hypothesis that an altered time course of early postnatal development can lead to an asd phenotype remains lacking.
the co-manifestation of these functional, structural and behavioural features suggests that alteration of the developmental time course in certain high-order cortical networks may play an important role in the neurophysiological basis of autism.
recent studies in autistic children consistently point to neuropathological and functional abnormalities in the temporal association cortex  and its associated structures.
brain sections obtained from postnatal rat pups treated with vpa in vivo revealed that almost 40% of cortical cells in tea prematurely exhibited adult-like intrinsic electrophysiological properties and that this was often associated with gross cortical hypertrophy and a reduced predisposition for social play behaviour.
it has been proposed that the trajectory of postnatal development in these regions may undergo accelerated maturational alterations that predominantly affect sensory recognition and social interaction.
indeed, the temporal association regions that are important for sensory recognition and social interaction are one of the last regions to mature suggesting a potential vulnerability to early maturation.
