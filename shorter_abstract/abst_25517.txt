in humans, the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the maintenance of host health by providing energy, nutrients, and immunological protection.
for infants, adults and elderly individuals we measured ratios of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.
we demonstrate that the human intestinal microbiota undergoes maturation from birth to adulthood and is further altered with ageing.
applying current molecular methods is necessary to surmount the limitations of classical culturing techniques in order to obtain an accurate description of the microbiota composition.
here we report on the comparative assessment of human fecal microbiota from three age-groups: infants, adults and the elderly.
by comparing species diversity profiles, we observed age-related changes in the human fecal microbiota.
c. leptum and c. coccoides species were highly represented in the microbiota of infants, while elderly subjects exhibited high levels of e. coli and bacteroidetes.
the counts of major bacterial groups clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, bacteroidetes, bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and escherichia coli were assessed by quantitative pcr .
