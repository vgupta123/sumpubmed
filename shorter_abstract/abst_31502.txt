the combination of single-cell timelapse microscopy and statistical analysis can give detailed insights into the phenotypic consequences of the loss of essential genes, and can thus serve as a new tool to study the function of essential genes.
we show that loss of ygjd leads to a marked decrease in cell size and termination of cell division.
the transition towards smaller size occurs in a controlled manner: cell elongation and cell division remain coupled, but cell size at division decreases.
concomitant deletion of the rela and spot genes - leading to a strain that is uncapable of synthesizing ppgpp - abrogates the decrease in cell size, but does not prevent termination of cell division upon ygjd depletion.
depletion of ygjd protein from growing cells leads to a decrease in cell size that is contingent on ppgpp, and to a termination of cell division.
here, we put ygjd under control of an inducible promoter, and used time-lapse microscopy and single cell analysis to investigate the phenotypic consequences of the depletion of ygjd protein from growing cells.
we also find evidence that depletion of ygjd leads to the synthesis of the intracellular signaling molecule ppgpp, inducing a cellular reaction resembling the stringent response.
