the dna methylation state of the ertbv sequences was correlated with their copy number in the genome.
plant genomes contain various kinds of repetitive sequences such as transposable elements, microsatellites, tandem repeats and virus-like sequences.
most of them, with the exception of virus-like sequences, do not allow us to trace their origins nor to follow the process of their integration into the host genome.
recent discoveries of virus-like sequences in plant genomes led us to set the objective of elucidating the origin of the repetitive sequences.
here, we reconstructed putative virus structures from rtbv-like sequences in the rice genome and characterized to understand evolutionary implication, integration manner and involvements of endogenous virus segments in the corresponding disease response.
comparison of ertbv among the oryza aa-genome species allowed us to speculate a possible role of endogenous virus segments against its related disease.
endogenous rice tungro bacilliform virus -like sequences  have been found throughout the rice genome.
we have collected ertbvs from the rice genomes.
the oryza aa-genome species vary in the ertbv copy number.
comparisons of dna and amino acid sequences suggested the closely relationship between ertbv and rtbv.
the identified ertbv segments were shown to be phylogenetically divided into three clusters.
the species carrying low-copy-number of ertbv segments have been reported to be extremely susceptible to rtbv.
these ertbv segments are unlikely to have functional potential as a virus.
however, these sequences facilitate to establish putative virus that provided information underlying virus integration and evolutionary relationship with existing virus.
