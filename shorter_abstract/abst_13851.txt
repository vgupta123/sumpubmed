although tremendous progress has been made to comprehend the biochemical basis of these complex evolutionarily-conserved organelles, few protein kinases have been reported to co-ordinate ciliary beat.
here we present evidence for p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  playing a role in the ciliary beat of a multicellular eukaryote, the free-living miracidium stage of the platyhelminth parasite schistosoma mansoni.
motile cilia are essential to the survival and reproduction of many eukaryotes; they are responsible for powering swimming of protists and small multicellular organisms and drive fluids across respiratory and reproductive surfaces in mammals.
finally, by inhibiting swimming, p <dig> mapk activation resulted in early release of ciliated epidermal plates from the miracidium thus accelerating development to the post-miracidium larval stage.
western blotting and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that treatment of miracidia with the p <dig> mapk activator anisomycin resulted in a rapid, sustained, activation of p <dig> mapk, which was primarily localized to the cilia associated with the ciliated epidermal plates, and the tegument.
