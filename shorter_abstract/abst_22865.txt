furthermore, simulation results show that data produced with the designed arrays is easier to analyze and would result in more precise identification of binding sites.
discovery of precise specificity of transcription factors is an important step on the way to understanding the complex mechanisms of gene regulation in eukaryotes.
recently, double-stranded protein-binding microarrays were developed as a potentially scalable approach to tackle transcription factor binding site identification.
here we present an algorithmic approach to experimental design of a microarray that allows for testing full specificity of a transcription factor binding to all possible dna binding sites of a given length, with optimally efficient use of the array.
we believe such a design will prove useful for transcription factor binding site identification and other biological problems.
in this study, we present a design of a double stranded dna microarray for protein-dna interaction studies and show that our algorithm allows optimally efficient use of the arrays for this purpose.
