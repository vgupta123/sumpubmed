the ec series is printed in duplicate within each subgrid of the microarray and covers the full range of signal intensities from background to saturation.
microarray normalizations typically apply methods that assume absence of global transcript shifts, or absence of changes in internal control features such as housekeeping genes.
we demonstrate that dilution of oligonucleotides on the microarray itself provides an innovative approach allowing the full dynamic range of the scanner to be covered with a single gene spike-in.
an ec dilution series that involves spike-in of a single concentration of the a. thaliana chlorophyll synthase gene to hybridize against spotted dilutions  of a single complimentary oligonucleotide representing the gene was developed.
the dilution series can be used in a composite normalization to improve detection of differential gene expression and to provide quality control measures.
furthermore, many microarrays lack control features that can be used for quality assurance .
these normalization approaches are not appropriate for focused arrays with small sets of genes where a large portion may be expected to change.
additionally, we demonstrate that the series can be integrated with a lowess normalization to improve the detection of differential gene expression  over lowess normalization on its own.
the quality of microarray experiments and the normalization methods used affect the ability to measure accurate changes in gene expression.
