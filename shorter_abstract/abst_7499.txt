this study provides molecular evidence supporting the hypothesis that transposon-driven recruitment of pre-existing cis-regulatory elements from non-photosynthetic genes into photosynthetic genes plays an important role during c <dig> evolution.
in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the cis-regulatory motifs related to c <dig> photosynthesis genes were recruited from non-photosynthetic genes and further examined potential mechanisms facilitating this recruitment.
the findings of the present study coincide with the observed repetitive emergence of c <dig> during evolution.
in addition, we checked 1) the distance between the acceptors and the donors of potentially recruited motifs in a chromosome, and 2) whether the potentially recruited motifs reside within the overlapping region of transposable elements and the promoter of donor genes.
the results showed that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the potentially recruited motifs might have moved via the transposable elements.
however, the mechanisms underlying the evolution of cis-regulatory elements that control these cell-specific expression patterns remain elusive.
we examined  <dig> predicted bundle sheath cell-specific motifs,  <dig> experimentally validated cell-specific cis-regulatory elements, and  <dig>  motifs derived from gene regulatory networks.

several c <dig> photosynthesis genes show cell-specific expression patterns, which are required for these high resource-use efficiencies.
furthermore, the potentially recruited motifs showed higher binding affinity to transcription factors compared to randomly generated sequences of the same length as the motifs.
