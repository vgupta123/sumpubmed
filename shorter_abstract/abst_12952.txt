this study evaluated rapid maldi-tof ms analysis of vaginal and oral lactobacillus isolates in comparison to 16s rdna analysis.
however, in most cases the species found agreed with the 16s rdna analysis result.
even though some results were ambiguous while 16s rdna sequencing yielded confident species identification, accuracy can be improved by extending reference databases.
the presence of lactobacillus species in carious lesions on the other hand is associated with progressive caries.
despite their clinical significance, species-level identification of lactobacilli still poses difficulties and mostly involves a combination of different phenotypic and genotypic methods.
specific lactobacilli are considered to maintain vaginal health and to protect from urogenital infection.
fifteen different lactobacillus species were found in the vaginal samples, primarily l. iners, l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri.
in the oral samples  <dig> different species were identified, mostly l. salivarius, l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei.
maldi-tof ms analysis proved to be a reliable and fast tool to identify lactobacilli to the species level.
for several samples, maldi-tof ms analysis only yielded scores indicating genus-level identification.
thus, mass spectra analysis provides a suitable method to facilitate monitoring clinically relevant lactobacillus species.
lactobacillus represents a large genus with different implications for the human host.
