this structure is referred to as a bow tie, and allows cells to respond appropriately to complex environmental conditions.
to assess the inference quality, bowtiebuilder and three alternative heuristics are applied to several pathways, and the resulting pathways are compared to reference pathways taken from kegg.
these signals are integrated into core proteins that activate downstream target proteins such as transcription factors .
we show that bowtiebuilder, given multiple source and/or target proteins, infers pathways with satisfactory recall and precision rates and detects the core proteins of each pathway.
understanding this cellular processing of information, from sensory proteins  to target proteins  is important, yet for many processes the signaling pathways remain unknown.
here, we present bowtiebuilder for inferring signal transduction pathways from multiple source and target proteins.
