the analysis and visualization functionalities of the tool are demonstrated using several examples.
when applied to a. marginale, our test case, we show that genotype lengths for a given region follow a normal distribution, while ssr frequencies follow a power-law-like distribution.
lastly, our analysis reveals that the most common edit distance is five or six, which is counter-intuitive since we expected that result to be closer to one, resulting from the simplest change from one repeat to another.
when heterogeneous ssrs are present in a given locus, we can take advantage of the pattern of different repeats to genotype strains based on the ssrs.
short-sequence repeats  occur in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic dna, inter- and intragenically, and may be exact or inexact copies.
repeatanalyzer is a robust software tool that can be used for storing, managing, and analysing short-sequence repeats for the purpose of strain identification.
the tool produced accurate genotyping results in every case.
we developed repeatanalyzer, a new software tool capable of tracking, managing, analysing and cataloguing ssrs and genotypes using anaplasma marginale as a model species.

cataloguing and tracking these repeats can be difficult as diverse groups of researchers are involved in the identification of the repeats.
repeatanalyzer’s repeat identification functionality was validated for all ssrs and genotypes reported in  <dig> publications, using  <dig> a. marginale isolates gathered from the five publications within that list that provided access to their isolates.
