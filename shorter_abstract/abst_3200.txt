as well as assisting experimental biologists to interrogate novel sequence data, it is hoped that p2rp will be built into genome annotation pipelines and re-annotation processes, to increase the consistency of rp annotation in public genomic sequences.
we have developed the web-server p2rp , which enables users to identify and annotate tfs and tcs proteins within their sequences of interest.
p2rp results can then be outputted in user-specified formats.
p2rp is the first publicly available tool for predicting and analysing rp proteins in usersâ€™ sequences.
identification and annotation of tfs and tcss is non-trivial, and between-genome comparisons are often confounded by different standards in annotation.
regulatory proteins  such as transcription factors  and two-component system  proteins control how prokaryotic cells respond to changes in their external and/or internal state.
