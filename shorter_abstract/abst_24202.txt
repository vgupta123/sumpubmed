this study demonstrates that exposure of a mouse-adapted scrapie strain to spc-p does not eliminate infectivity, but does render prpsc protease sensitive.
the current study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a commercial product containing sodium percarbonate to inactivate prions.
treated samples were evaluated for abnormal prion protein -immunoreactivity by western blot analysis, and residual infectivity by mouse bioassay.
prions, the causative agents of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are notoriously difficult to inactivate.
current decontamination recommendations by the world health organization include prolonged exposure to  <dig> n sodium hydroxide or >  <dig>  ppm sodium hypochlorite, or autoclaving.
exposure to a 21% solution of spc-p or a solution containing either  <dig> % or 21% spc-p in combination with sodium dodecyl sulfate  resulted in increased proteinase k sensitivity of prpsc.
samples of mouse brain infected with a mouse-adapted strain of the scrapie agent  were exposed to a sodium percarbonate-based product .
