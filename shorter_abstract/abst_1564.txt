in particular, it is of interest to estimate how many new genes can be detected in a future est sample of given size and also to determine the gene discovery rate: these estimates represent the basis for deciding whether to proceed sequencing the library and, in case of a positive decision, a guideline for selecting the size of the new sample.
in particular, we provide estimates for: a) the coverage, defined as the proportion of unique genes in the library represented in the given sample of reads; b) the number of new unique genes to be observed in a future sample; c) the discovery rate of new genes as a function of the future sample size.
the bayesian nonparametric model we adopt conveys, in a statistically rigorous way, the available information into prediction.
in this work we propose a bayesian nonparametric approach for tackling statistical problems related to est surveys.
the bayesian nonparametric approach we undertake yields valuable tools for gene capture and prediction in est libraries.
est libraries, previously studied with frequentist methods, are analyzed in detail.
the estimators we obtain do not feature the kind of drawbacks associated with frequentist estimators and are reliable for any size of the additional sample.
our proposal has appealing properties over frequentist nonparametric methods, which become unstable when prediction is required for large future samples.
given a preliminary est sample from a certain library, several statistical prediction problems arise.
