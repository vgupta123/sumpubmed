we found that pipe-sites predictions were closer to the confirmed binding site than those of two existing binding site prediction methods based on domain-domain interactions, when applied to the same dataset.
experimental methods often report false binding sites due to experimental limitations, while computational methods tend to require data which is not available at the proteome-scale.
finally, we applied pipe-sites to two datasets of  <dig> yeast and  <dig>  human novel interacting protein pairs predicted to interact with high confidence.
pipe-sites operates at high specificity and requires only the sequences of query proteins and a database of known binary interactions with no binding site data, making it applicable to binding site prediction at the proteome-scale.
here we present pipe-sites, a novel method of protein specific binding site prediction based on pairs of re-occurring polypeptide sequences, which have been previously shown to accurately predict protein-protein interactions.
pipe-sites is available online at http://pipe-sites.cgmlab.org/.
an analysis of the predicted interaction sites revealed a number of protein subsequences which are highly re-occurring in binding sites and which may represent novel binding motifs.
