in this study, we initially develop prediction tools to discriminate coding or non-coding transcripts and thereafter classify ncrnas into respective classes.
high throughput techniques like next generation sequencing have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of sequence data.
similarly, graph properties based feature set along with randomforest algorithm are most suitable to classify different ncrna classes.
knowing that the structure of a ncrna transcript could provide insights into its biological function, we use graph properties of predicted ncrna structures to classify the transcripts into  <dig> different non-coding rna classes.
this work conclusively demonstrates that a simple feature, tri-nucleotide composition, is sufficient to discriminate between coding and non-coding rna sequences.
evidence is accumulating that non-coding transcripts, previously thought to be functionally inert, play important roles in various cellular activities.
