clathrin-mediated vesicular trafficking, the mechanism by which proteins and lipids are transported between membrane-bound organelles, accounts for a large proportion of import from the plasma membrane  and transport from the trans-golgi network towards the endosomal system.
both proteins typically localize anterior to the kinetoplast, at the flagellar pocket and golgi complex region.
in this study, clathrin heavy  and light  chain gene expression and protein localization were investigated in different developmental forms of t. cruzi , using both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against t. cruzi recombinant proteins.
clathrin heavy and light chains are expressed in t. cruzi.
clathrin-mediated events are still poorly understood in the protozoan trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of chagas disease in latin america.
analysis by confocal microscopy revealed an accumulation of tcchc and tcclc at the cell anterior, where the flagellar pocket and golgi complex are located.
our data also indicate that in t. cruzi epimastigotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis of albumin occurs at the flagellar pocket, while clathrin-independent endocytosis of transferrin occurs at the cytostome/cytopharynx complex.
