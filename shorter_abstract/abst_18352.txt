using western blots of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein, we also demonstrate that full length evc <dig> but not evc, is located in the nucleus.
in transfected cells, basal body and cilia localization is observed when evc and evc <dig> constructs are co-transfected but not when either construct is transfected individually.
the gene encoding evc <dig> is in close proximity in divergent orientation to evc and mutations in both human genes lead to the chondrodysplasia ellis-van creveld syndrome.
we developed anti-evc <dig> antibodies and show that evc <dig> and evc co-localize at the basal body and also on primary cilia.
we demonstrate for the first time that evc <dig> is a positive regulator of the hh signalling pathway and that it is located at the basal body of primary cilia.
evc is essential for indian hedgehog  signalling in the cartilage growth plate.
we show that evc and evc <dig> are cilia transmembrane proteins, the c-terminus for both being intracellular and evc <dig>  but not evc, having an extracellular portion.
we show that the presence of evc and evc <dig> at the basal body and cilia membrane is co-dependent.
here we demonstrate that evc <dig> is essential for hh pathway activation in response to the smo agonist purmorphamine.
furthermore, evc is absent at the basal body in evc <dig> null cells.
