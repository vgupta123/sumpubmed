joining a model for the molecular evolution of a protein family to the paleontological and geological records , and then to the chemical structures of substrates, products, and protein folds, is emerging as a broad strategy for generating hypotheses concerning function in a post-genomic world.
this combination of bioinformatics analysis, molecular evolution, paleontology, cladistics, global climatology, structural biology, and organic chemistry serves as a paradigm in planetary biology.
metrics that detect changing function in proteins were then applied, including ka/ks values and those that exploit structural biology.
the combined analysis suggests that aromatase paralogs arose in pigs as a result of selection for suoidea with larger litters than their ancestors, and permitted the suoidea to survive the global climatic trauma that began in the eocene.
these identified specific amino acid replacements that were associated with changing substrate and product specificity during the time of presumed adaptive change.
this strategy expands systems biology to a planetary context, necessary for a notion of fitness to underlie  any discussion of function within a biomolecular system.
