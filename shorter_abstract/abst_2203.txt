we show that euclidean distance between infectious and susceptible premises is a better predictor of transmission risk than shortest and quickest routes via road, except where major geographical features intervene.
thus, a simple spatial transmission kernel based on euclidean distance suffices in most regions, probably reflecting the multiplicity of transmission routes during the epidemic.
here we analyse the most detailed such data to date arising from the uk  <dig> foot and mouth epidemic.
this ideally requires a parallel record of spatial epidemic spread and a detailed map of susceptible host density along with relevant transport links and geographical features.
