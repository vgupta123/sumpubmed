many microarray studies have analysed transcriptomic data from a pathway perspective, for instance by testing for kegg pathway enrichment in sets of upregulated genes.
with the continued proliferation of high-throughput biological experiments, there is a pressing need for tools to integrate the data produced in ways that produce biologically meaningful conclusions.
the metabolic modules returned by ambient are connected parts of the bipartite network that change coherently between conditions, providing a more detailed view of metabolic changes than standard approaches based on pathway enrichment.
a python implementation of ambient is available at http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/ambient.
here we introduce ambient , a simulated annealing approach to the discovery of metabolic subnetworks  that are significantly affected by a given genetic or environmental change.
ambient is an effective and flexible tool for the analysis of high-throughput data in a metabolic context.
