we uncovered one case of horizontal gene transfer among rickettsia, where a strain is a chimera from two distantly related groups, but multi-gene analysis indicates that different parts of the genome tend to share the same phylogeny.
recombination throughout the genus is generally uncommon, although there is evidence of horizontal gene transfer.
there was then a rapid radiation about  <dig> million years ago, which coincided with the evolution of life history adaptations in a few branches of the phylogeny.
even though rickettsia are thought to be primarily transmitted vertically, host associations are short lived with frequent switching to new host lineages.
rickettsia are intracellular symbionts of eukaryotes that are best known for infecting and causing serious diseases in humans and other mammals.
all known vertebrate-associated rickettsia are vectored by arthropods as part of their life-cycle, and many other rickettsia are found exclusively in arthropods with no known secondary host.
rickettsia do not co-speciate with their hosts but host shifts most often occur between related arthropods.
here, we have identified  <dig> new strains of rickettsia from arthropods, and constructed a multi-gene phylogeny of the entire genus which includes these new strains.
approximately  <dig> million years ago, rickettsia split into two main clades, one of which primarily infects arthropods, and the other infects a diverse range of protists, other eukaryotes and arthropods.
rickettsia have evolved adaptations including transmission through vertebrates and killing males in some arthropod hosts.
