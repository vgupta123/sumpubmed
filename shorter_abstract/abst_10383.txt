the libraries included  <dig> pre-mirnas encoding for  <dig> mirnas, of which  <dig> mirnas were unique sequences and  <dig>  were expressed in both periods.
a total of  <dig> mirnas in the lactating mg showed significant differences in expression compared to non-lactating mg .
two mirna libraries were constructed from mg tissues taken from a lactating and a non-lactating holstein dairy cow, respectively, and the short rna sequences  in these libraries were sequenced by solexa sequencing method.
eight hundred and eighty-four mirnas were identified in bovine mg. differences in types and expression levels of mirnas were observed between lactating and non-lactating bovine mg. systematic predictions aided in the identification of lactation-related mirnas, providing insight into the types of mirnas and their possible mechanisms in regulating lactation.
integrative mirna target prediction and network analysis approaches were employed to construct an interaction network of lactation-related mirnas and their putative targets.
however, the specific functions of mirnas in these regulations are not clear.
a custom-designed microarray assay was then performed to compare mirna expression patterns in the mg of lactating and non-lactating dairy cows.
therefore, the elucidation of mirna expression profiles in the mg is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms of lactogenesis.
using a cell-based model, six mirnas  were studied to reveal their possible biological significance.
