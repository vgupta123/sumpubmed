epigenetic regulation was revealed to participate in mrna induced ipscs formation.
after five consecutive transfections, gefs tended to aggregate by day  <dig>  clones appeared on day 15â€“ <dig>  and typical embryonic stem cell -like clones formed on day  <dig>  one thousand akp staining positive clones were achieved in  <dig> gefs, with approximately  <dig> % induction efficiency.
qrt-pcr and western blot showed activated endogenous pluripotent factors expression in the later phase of mrna-induced goat ipscs induction.
therefore, we tried to derive goat ipscs with a new method by transfecting exogenous oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc mrnas into goat embryonic fibroblasts , and explore the mechanisms regarding the transcription regulation of the reprogramming factors in goat ipscs induction.
we successfully generated goat ipscs by transfection of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig> and c-myc mrnas into gefs, which initiated the endogenous reprogramming network and altered the methylation status of pluripotent genes.
core promoter regions of the four reprogramming factors were determined.
transcription factor binding sites, including elf- <dig>  ap- <dig>  sp <dig>  c/ebp and mzf <dig>  were identified to be functional in the core promoter regions of these reprogramming genes.
core promoter regions and functional transcription binding sites of the four reprogramming genes were identified.
the achieved goat ipscs could be cultured to 22nd passage, which showed normal karyotype.
the goat ipscs were able to differentiate into embryoid bodies with three germ layers.
traditional approaches for generating goat pluripotent stem cells  suffer from complexity and low preparation efficiency.
our study provides a safe and efficient approach for goat.
epigenetic analysis of the endogenous pluripotent gene nanog revealed its demethylation status in derived goat ipscs.
immunofluorescence staining and qrt-pcr detection of the escs markers confirmed the properties of the goat ipscs.
