reintroduction of ps <dig> into ps1−/− endothelial cells led to a progressive decrease in fibronectin levels showing that the increased fibronectin in ps1−/− endothelial cells was due to loss of ps <dig>  increases in fibronectin protein in ps1−/− endothelial cells could not be explained by increased levels of fibronectin rna nor based on metabolic labeling studies by increased protein synthesis.
rather we show based on the rate of turnover of exogenously added biotinylated fibronectin that increased fibronectin in ps1−/− endothelial cells results from a slower degradation of the fibronectin fibrillar matrix on the cell surface.
these studies provide molecular clues that may help to explain the origin of the vascular dysgenesis that develops in ps1−/− embryonic mice.
these studies show that ps <dig> regulates the constitutive turnover of the fibronectin matrix in endothelial cells.
we report that primary as well as continuously passaged ps1−/− endothelial cells contain more fibronectin than wild type cells and that the excess fibronectin in ps1−/− endothelial cells is incorporated into a fibrillar network.
because the extracellular matrix plays key roles in vascular development we hypothesized that an abnormal extracellular matrix might be present in endothelial cells lacking ps <dig> and examined whether the lack of ps <dig> affects expression of fibronectin a component of the extracellular matrix known to be essential for vascular development.
one of the most prominent features in the brains of ps1−/− embryos is a vascular dysgenesis that leads to multiple intracerebral hemorrhages.
the molecular and cellular basis for the vascular dysgenesis in ps1−/− mice remains incompletely understood.
supporting the in vivo relevance of this observation fibronectin expression was increased in microvascular preparations isolated from e <dig>  to e <dig>  ps1−/− embryonic brain.
mice with null mutations in ps <dig> die shortly after birth exhibiting multiple cns and non-cns abnormalities.
