the ultrasound scans were performed by two veterinarians.
considering the right side, the renal volume in the day  <dig> was smaller than the day 21st to 40th .
for reproducibility calculations, we used the intraclass correlation coefficient .
the renal volume bitches by 3d ultrasonography using the vocal method  had good correlation with the volume obtained by 2d ultrasonography method.
considering the left side, the renal volume at day  <dig> was smaller than the day 1st to 20th  and day 21st to 40th .
to assess and to compare the renal volume evolution in bitches during pregnancy by two-dimensional  ultrasonography using the ellipsoid technique  and three-dimensional  ultrasonography using the virtual organ computer-aided analysis  method.
the 3d techniques showed, in average, the same renal volumes  regardless of the side and moment.
