we detected evidence of population expansion with migration toward the ct. two clusters of haplotypes were detected in the mtdna data , corresponding to the pacific and indian oceans, with a low level of introgression observed outside a mixing zone at the pacific-indian boundary.
here we contribute to the debate with a phylogeographic survey of a widely distributed reef fish, the peacock grouper  at  <dig> locations  using dna sequence data from mtdna cytochrome b and two nuclear introns .
these data support a scenario of isolation on the scale of  <dig> year glacial cycles, followed by population expansion toward the ct, and overlap of divergent lineages at the pacific-indian boundary.
the coral triangle , bounded by the philippines, the malay peninsula, and new guinea, is the epicenter of marine biodiversity.
population structure was significant  among five regions: french polynesia, the central-west pacific , indo-pacific boundary , eastern indian ocean , and western indian ocean .
a strong signal of isolation by distance was detected in both mtdna  and the combined nuclear loci .
this pattern of isolation, divergence, and subsequent overlap likely contributes to species richness at the adjacent ct and is consistent with the region of overlap hypothesis.
we conclude that the indo-pacific barrier, operating during low sea level associated with glaciation, defines the primary phylogeographic pattern in this species.
