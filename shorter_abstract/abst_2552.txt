the enzyme phytoene synthase  catalyses the first committed step of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and has been associated with control of pathway flux.
we tested the transient activation of the apple psy <dig> and psy <dig> promoters and identified potential and differential regulation by ap2/erf transcription factors, which suggested that the psy genes are controlled by different transcriptional mechanisms.
carotenoid compounds play essential roles in plants such as protecting the photosynthetic apparatus and in hormone signalling.

this has implications for apple breeding programmes where carotenoid enhancement is a target and would allow co-segregation with phenotypes to be tested during the development of new cultivars.
the first committed carotenoid pathway step in apple is controlled by mdpsy <dig> and mdpsy <dig>  while mdpsy <dig> play little or no role in this respect.
transcript levels in ‘granny smith’ and ‘royal gala’ apple cultivars showed psy <dig> was most highly expressed in fruit and other vegetative tissues.
we characterised four psy genes found in the apple genome to further understand their involvement in fruit carotenoid accumulation.
