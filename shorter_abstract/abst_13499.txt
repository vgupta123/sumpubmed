the algorithm applied to familial trios or extended pedigrees can produce partitioned copy number genotypes with distinct parental alleles.
cngen is the first published software for the partitioning of copy number genotypes in pedigrees, making possible the use cnps and cnvs for linkage analysis.
<dig>  it was successfully tested on current linux, windows and mac os workstations.
we have validated the algorithm using simulations on a complex pedigree structure using frequencies calculated from a real dataset of  <dig> genotyped samples from  <dig> pedigrees segregating a congenital heart defect phenotype.
here, we are interested in partitioning copy number variations and polymorphisms in extended pedigrees for the purpose of linkage analysis on familial data.
copy number variations  and polymorphisms  have only recently gained the genetic community's attention.
widely used tools for cnp analysis have been implemented in birdsuite and plink for the purpose of conducting genetic association studies based on the unpartitioned total number of cnp copies provided by the intensities from affymetrix's genome-wide human snp array.
