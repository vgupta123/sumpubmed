pod tissues responded to elevated  by increasing expression of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase genes, which may be involved with increased pod dehiscence in elevated .
in order to understand transcriptional mechanisms of yield loss in soybean, we examined the transcriptome of soybean flower and pod tissues exposed to elevated  using rna-sequencing.
elevated  elicited a strong transcriptional response in flower and pod tissues, with increased expression of genes involved in signaling in both tissues.
mmps are zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases that have roles in programmed cell death, senescence and stress response in plants.
this study established that gene expression in reproductive tissues of soybean are impacted by elevated , and flowers and pods have distinct transcriptomic responses to elevated .
flower tissues also responded to elevated  by increasing expression of genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases .
