many studies have focused on the implication of the serotonin and dopamine systems in neuroadaptive responses to the recreational drug  <dig> -methylenedioxy-metamphetamine .
the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of repeated intermittent mdma administration upon gene-transcript expression of the glutamate transporters , the glutamate receptor subunits of ampa , the glutamate receptor subunits of nmda , as well as metabotropic glutamate receptors  in six different brain regions.
repeated intermittent mdma administration induces neuroadaptive changes in gene-transcript expressions of glutamatergic nmda and ampa receptor subunits, metabotropic receptors and transporters in regions of the brain regulating reward-related associative learning, cognition, and memory and neuro-endocrine functions.
the gene-transcript levels were assessed using real-time pcr validated with a range of housekeeping genes.
in the caudate putamen, mrna levels of glur <dig>  nr2a, and nr2b receptor subunits were significantly increased.
less attention has been given to the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate known to be implicated in schizophrenia and drug addiction.
adolescent male sprague dawley rats received mdma at the doses of  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> mg/kg/day, or 3× vehicle  <dig> hours apart, every 7th day for  <dig> weeks.
