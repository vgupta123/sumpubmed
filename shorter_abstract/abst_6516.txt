treatment with psychoactive medication in parallel with a behaviour modification plan is well documented in the literature, but it is unknown if this is associated with an improvement in underlying affective state  or simply an inhibition of the behaviour.
five dogs showing signs of srp  were treated with fluoxetine chewable tablets  and set on a standard behaviour modification plan for two months.
cognitive judgement bias tasks have been proposed as a method for assessing underlying affective state and so we used this approach to identify if any change in clinical signs during treatment was associated with a consistent change in cognitive bias .
these results demonstrate for the first time that the clinical treatment of a negative affective state and associated behaviours in a non-human species can produce a shift in cognitive bias.
subjects were also evaluated using a spatial cognitive bias test to infer changes in underlying affect prior to, and during, treatment.
furthermore, possible correlations between cognitive bias and clinical measures were also assessed for dogs with srp.
prior to treatment, the dogs with srp responded to ambiguous positions in the cognitive bias test negatively  compared to control dogs .
on weeks  <dig> and  <dig> of treatment, srp dogs displayed similar responses in the cognitive bias test to control dogs, consistent with the possible normalization of affect during treatment, with this effect more pronounced at week  <dig> .
questionnaire based clinical measures were significantly correlated among themselves and with performance in the cognitive bias test.
