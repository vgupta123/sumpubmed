in this work, proteomic and biochemical approaches have been used to study root gs enzymes and nitrogen assimilation in maize plants re-supplied with nitrate, ammonium or both.
the analysis of root proteomes allowed a study to be made of the accumulation and phosphorylation of six gs proteins.
the amino acid accumulation and composition in roots, xylem sap and leaves deeply changed in response to mineral sources.
moreover, the results give new insights about the influence of amino acid metabolism in plant c/n balance.
in maize  one gene for gs <dig> and five genes for gs <dig> subunits are known, but their roles in root metabolism are not yet well defined.
glutamine showed the prevalent changes in all nitrogen nutritions.
this work provides new information about the multifaceted regulation of the gs enzyme in maize roots, indicating the involvement of specific isoenzymes/isoforms, post-translational events and biochemical factors.
for the first time, the proteomic approach allowed to discriminate the individual contribution of the gs <dig> isoforms, highlighting the participation of gs1- <dig> in nitrate metabolism.
the plant metabolic status highlighted the relevance of root system in maize nitrogen assimilation during both nitrate and ammonium nutrition.
the main gs are classified as cytosolic gs <dig> and plastidial gs <dig>  of which the functionality is variable according to the nitrogen sources, organs and developmental stages.
