since tgf-β <dig> is an important cytokine that can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, and previous report showed that only seasonal influenza h1n <dig>  could induce a persistent expression of tgf-β <dig>  we speculate that the modulation of tgf-β <dig> expression by different influenza subtypes via mir- <dig> might be a critical step for determining the outcome of either normal or excessive inflammation progression.
the results showed that dysregulation of mirna expression was mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza a h5n <dig> infection.
we found that mir-21*, mir-100*, mir- <dig>  mir-574-3p, mir-1274a and mir1274b were differentially expressed in response to influenza a virus infection.
this study aims at elucidating how avian influenza infection perturbs the host’s mirna regulatory pathways that may lead to adverse pathological events, such as cytokine storm, using the mirna microarray approach.
avian influenza remains a serious threat to human health.
the consequence of human infection varies markedly among different subtypes of avian influenza viruses.
