we propose that supernatant is a valuable sample for pcr for both fresh and stored specimens, particularly those with a low bacterial load in addition to conventional sediment.
bacterial lysis in the specimens was demonstrated by pcr analysis of supernatant fractions; 53% of the freshly analysed samples contained mycobacterial dna in supernatants.
storage-associated bacterial lysis was accompanied by a decrease in smear grade status in  <dig> of  <dig> samples  and a significant storage-associated reduction in bacterial numbers in the remaining samples.
we conclude that  freshly isolated sputum contains both intact and lysed mycobacteria,  lysis increased during storage and  supernatant fractions routinely discarded during sample processing contain mycobacterial dna.
