large microarray datasets have enabled gene regulation to be studied through coexpression analysis.
while numerous methods have been developed for identifying differentially expressed genes between two conditions, the field of differential coexpression analysis is still relatively new.
we present diffcoex, a novel method for identifying correlation pattern changes, which builds on the commonly used weighted gene coexpression network analysis  framework for coexpression analysis.
diffcoex is a simple and sensitive method to identify gene coexpression differences between multiple conditions.
