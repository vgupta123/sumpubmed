this pattern suggests that selective induction of il- <dig> in uninfected individuals and especially in hiv-monoinfected individuals plays a role in establishing chronic hcv infection and conversely, that attenuation of this response, once chronic infection is established, favours development of hepatic immunopathology.
multiple immune evasion strategies by which hcv establishes chronic infection have been proposed, including manipulation of cytokine responses.
exposure to hcv antigens increased il- <dig> production by pbmc, especially in uninfected and hiv-monoinfected individuals.
intracellular flow cytometry was used to assess il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and ifn-Î³ production by freshly isolated pbmc incubated for  <dig> hours with recombinant hcv core, non-structural protein  <dig> , and ns <dig> proteins.
therefore, we investigated in vitro cytokine responses to hcv structural and non-structural proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from uninfected, hiv-infected, hcv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals.
hcv-specific t cell proliferation was detectable in only one hiv/hcv-coinfected individual who demonstrated no hcv-induced il- <dig> response.
prior infection with hiv increases the likelihood of chronic hcv infection and accelerates development of hcv-related morbidity.
this il- <dig> response was attenuated in chronic hcv infection even with hcv/hiv-coinfection.
the cells producing il- <dig> in response to hcv proteins in vitro matched a pbmc subset recently shown to constitutively produce il- <dig> in vivo.
this subset was found at similar frequencies in uninfected, hiv-infected, hcv-infected and hiv/hcv-coinfected individuals before exposure to hcv proteins.
