comparison with some leading servers demonstrated the uniqueness of the hybrid methodology in effectively sampling conformational space, scoring best decoys and refining low resolution models to high and medium resolution.
data driven homology based computational methods have proved successful in predicting tertiary structures for sequences sharing medium to high sequence similarities.
bhageerath-h methodology is web enabled for the scientific community as a freely accessible web server.
with dwindling similarities of query sequences, advanced homology/ ab initio hybrid approaches are being explored to solve structure prediction problem.
