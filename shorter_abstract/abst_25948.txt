multiple factors seem to have contributed to the lower abundance of est-ssrs in gymnosperms that has resulted in a non-linear relationship with genome size diversity.
our analysis provides the foundation for future comparative studies at the species level to unravel the evolutionary processes that control the ssr genesis and divergence between angiosperm and gymnosperm tree species.
here, we present a comparative analysis of the ssr motif distribution in the 5′utr, orf and 3′utr fractions of ests across selected genera of woody trees representing gymnosperms  and angiosperms .
our analysis supports a modest contribution of est-ssr length to genome size in gymnosperms, while est-ssr density was not associated with genome size in neither angiosperms nor gymnosperms.
simple sequence repeats  derived from expressed sequence tags  belong to the expressed fraction of the genome and are important for gene regulation, recombination, dna replication, cell cycle and mismatch repair.

our data also reveals a higher abundance of hexamers across the gymnosperm genera.
