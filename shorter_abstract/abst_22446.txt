recent studies revealed that mirnas play as important regulators of gene expression and some even as cancer players or inhibitors.
we introduce a web-based analysis platform called mirna analysis system , for processing and analyzing of the sequence data obtained from the total rna clone method.
finally, to extract the biological significance of the mirnas in the samples, further annotations of the known mirna and target genes were performed by collecting the public expression datasets of mirna and target genes in normal and cancer tissues.
the functions of known and predicted mirnas were then analyzed by mirna target prediction followed by target gene annotations.
with miras, mirnas and possible mirna candidates contained in the submitted sequencing data were obtained together with their expression profile.
many studies try to discover new mirnas and reveal the mirna expression profile in cancer using a sage-based total rna clone method.
