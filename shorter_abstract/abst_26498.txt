the  <dig> most common serotypes were salmonella bredeney and s. colindale , s. muenster , s. korlebu , s. eastbourne and s. poona , and s. agona, s. derby, s. drac, s. senftenberg, s. waycross , accounting for  <dig> Â % of all the isolates.
this study highlights the common prevalence of salmonella and the high diversity of salmonella serotypes in aquatic environment in ouagadougou, burkina faso.
therefore, various human activities linked to water and consumption of water-related products, such as fish and lettuce, can lead to human salmonella infections.
the salmonella isolates were found to represent  <dig> different serotypes.
this study investigated the prevalence, serotypes and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of salmonella enterica in environment in ouagadougou, burkina faso.
a total of  <dig> samples, consisting of  <dig> samples of tap water,  <dig> samples of well water,  <dig> samples of channel water,  <dig> samples of reservoir water,  <dig> samples of fish, and  <dig> samples of lettuce were examined using standard bacteriological procedures for salmonella.
