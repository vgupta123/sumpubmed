aminoacyl-trna synthetases  catalyze the first step of protein synthesis.
soluble protein was purified by a three-step purification method using cation exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography.
recombinant human tyrosyl-trna synthetase  is engineered with a single amino acid substitution that unmasks its cytokine activity.
