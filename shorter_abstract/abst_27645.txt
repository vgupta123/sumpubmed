a long-range correlation in microarray data manifests itself in thousands of genes that are heavily correlated with a given gene in terms of the associated t-statistics.
the long-range correlation structure also persists in normalized data.
our findings help decipher the correlation structure of microarray data before and after the application of normalization procedures.
normalization procedures affect both the true correlation, stemming from gene interactions, and the spurious correlation induced by random noise.
when analyzing real world biological data sets, normalization procedures are unable to completely remove correlation between the test statistics.
stochastic dependence between gene expression levels in microarray data is of critical importance for the methods of statistical inference that resort to pooling test-statistics across genes.
we report the effects of four different normalization methods using a large set of microarray data on childhood leukemia in addition to several sets of simulated data.
the paper presents a systematic study of correlation between the t-statistics associated with different genes.
by using normalization methods it is possible to significantly reduce correlation between the t-statistics computed for different genes.
a potential impact of between-gene correlations on the performance of such methods has yet to be explored.
