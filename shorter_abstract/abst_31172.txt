our data also suggested that the maqc reference rna samples, stored at -80°c, were stable over a time frame of at least four years.
the affymetrix genechip® system is a commonly used platform for microarray analysis but the technology is inherently expensive.
microarray data were generated in  <dig> in three replicates for each of the two maqc samples with either expired affymetrix u133a or unexpired u133plus <dig> microarrays.
the percentage of overlap between the lists of differentially expressed genes  from u133plus <dig> microarray data generated in  <dig> and in  <dig> was  <dig> %.
moreover, the microarray data generated using the expired u133a microarrays in  <dig> were highly concordant with microarray and taqman® data generated by the maqc project in  <dig>
our results demonstrated that microarray data generated using u133a microarrays, which were more than four years past the manufacturer’s expiration date, were highly specific and consistent with those from unexpired microarrays in identifying degs despite some appreciable fold change compression and decrease in sensitivity.
these results were compared with data obtained in  <dig> on the u133plus <dig> microarray.
in addition, it was not clear whether the two human reference rna samples established by the maqc project in  <dig> still maintained their transcriptome integrity over a period of four years.
unfortunately, changes in experimental planning and execution, such as the unavailability of previously anticipated samples or a shift in research focus, may render significant numbers of pre-purchased genechip® microarrays unprocessed before their manufacturer’s expiration dates.
while there was some degree of fold change compression in the expired u133a microarrays, the percentage of overlap between the lists of degs from the expired and unexpired microarrays was as high as  <dig> %.
