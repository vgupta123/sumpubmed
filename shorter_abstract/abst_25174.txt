the edc ligands did not display a unique binding mode, probably due to their lipophilicity and flexibility, which conferred them a great adaptability into the hydrophobic and large binding pocket of steroid receptors.
the interaction was characterized by multiple hydrophobic contacts involving a different number of residues facing the binding pocket, depending on ligands orientation.
however, despite the growing concern about the toxicological activity of endocrine disrupters, molecular data of the interaction of these compounds with biological targets are still lacking.
there are several experimental evidences that they bind and activate human steroid receptors.
our results are in agreement with toxicological data on binding and allow to describe a pattern of interactions for a group of ecd to steroid receptors suggesting the requirement of a hydrophobic cavity to accommodate these chlorine carrying compounds.
they have been recognized to have detrimental health effects both on wildlife and humans acting as endocrine disrupters due to their ability of mimicking the action of the steroid hormones, and thus interfering with hormone response.
we have used a flexible docking approach to characterize the molecular interaction of seven endocrine disrupting chemicals with estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors in the ligand-binding domain.
