protein remote homology detection is one of the central problems in bioinformatics, which is important for both basic research and practical application.
two new methods for protein remote homology detection were proposed, called svm-dr and svm-dt.
the better performance of the proposed methods demonstrates that the position dependant approaches are efficient for protein remote homology detection.
exploring feature vectors incorporating the position information of amino acids or other protein building blocks is a key step to improve the performance of the svm-based methods.
these two methods are position dependent approaches incorporating the sequence-order information of protein sequences.
currently, discriminative methods based on support vector machines  achieve the state-of-the-art performance.
svm-dt is a profile-based method, which considers the distances between top-n-gram pairs.
experimental results showed that these two new methods are very promising.
svm-dr is a sequence-based method, in which the feature vector representation for protein is based on the distances between residue pairs.
top-n-gram can be viewed as a profile-based building block of proteins, which is calculated from the frequency profiles.
compared with the position independent methods, the performance improvement is obvious.
