tenm <dig> is a mouse homolog of the drosophila gene tenascin-m ), which functions in motor neuron routing.
epiblast cells maintained expression of pou5f <dig> suggesting that they remain pluripotent, but they did not have the capacity to form any germ layer derivatives in teratomas, showing that the inability to induce mesoderm is cell autonomous.
further, tenm <dig> mutants lack the ability to differentiate in a cell autonomous manner.
misexpression of e-cadherin and n-cadherin suggest that the embryos did not undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
here, we examine the timing and features of gastrulation failure in a loss of function allele.
recently, a genome-wide association analysis for bipolar disorder identified a new susceptibility locus at tenm <dig> increasing the importance of understanding tenm <dig>  a series of tenm <dig> mouse alleles showing a broad range of phenotypes were isolated after enu mutagenesis.

genes normally expressed in embryonic mesoderm were not expressed in the mutant, the primitive streak did not form, and markers of the anteroposterior axis were not expressed or were mislocalized.
these data demonstrate that tenm <dig> mutants fail to form a primitive streak and to induce embryonic mesoderm.
embryonic mesoderm did not form in loss of function tenm4m1/m <dig> mutant embryos.
the lack of embryonic mesoderm could not be attributed to poor proliferation of the epiblast, as normal numbers of dividing cells were observed.
in addition, wnt signaling did not occur in the mutants, as assessed by the topgal reporter assay, while a gsk3Î² inhibitor partially rescued the mutant embryos, and rescued topgal reporter expression.
