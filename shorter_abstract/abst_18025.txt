a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  promising drugs  were discovered for treating early- and late-stage nsclc, respectively.
this work provides better drug prediction accuracy than competitive research according to ic <dig> measurements.
the effectiveness of these drugs is supported by the literature, experimentally determined in-vitro ic <dig> and clinical trials.
with the novel pipeline of drug repositioning, the discovery of enriched pathways and potential drugs related to nsclc can provide insight into the key regulators of tumorigenesis and the treatment of nsclc.
this work integrates two approaches - machine learning algorithms and topological parameter-based classification - to develop a novel pipeline of drug repositioning to analyze four lung cancer microarray datasets, enriched biological processes, potential therapeutic drugs and targeted genes for nsclc treatments.
