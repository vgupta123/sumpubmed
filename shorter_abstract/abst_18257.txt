we found in our study that cd <dig> played a very important role in this process.
the matured monocytes / macrophages, via their high expression of cd <dig>  may play an important role in promoting the tissue repair or tissue damage during their inflammatory response.
the results suggest that the expression of cd <dig> is upregulated during the differentiation of monocyte thp- <dig> cells to macrophage cells, and cd <dig> induces the secretion and activation of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> and enhances the invasive ability of thp- <dig> cells.
invasion assays using reconstituted basement membrane showed a good correlation between the invasiveness of thp- <dig> cells and the production of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig>  the difference in the mmps expression and the invasive ability was significantly blocked by hab18g/cd <dig> antagonistic peptide ap- <dig>  the inhibitory rate of the secretion of prommp- <dig> in the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig> %.
the inhibitory rate of the secretion of prommp- <dig>  the activated mmp- <dig> and prommp- <dig> in the differentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.
the inhibitory rate of invasive potential in the undifferentiated cells and the differentiated thp- <dig> cells was  <dig>  % and  <dig> %, respectively.
after  <dig> hours of pma-induced monocyte differentiation, the mean fluorescence intensity of cd <dig> in differentiated thp- <dig> cells  was higher than that of the undifferentiated thp- <dig> cells .
