it is an open question which form of the disulfide is the functional configuration.
all disulfides in nmr and x-ray protein structures as well as in refined structure datasets were compared and contrasted for configuration and strain energy.
the hiv envelope glycoprotein gp <dig>  for example, is regulated by thiol/disulfide exchange and contains allosteric -rhstaple bonds that can exist in the -lhstaple configuration.
the mean dihedral strain energy of  <dig>  nmr structure disulfides was twice that of  <dig>  x-ray structure disulfides.
moreover, the energies of all twenty types of disulfide bond was higher in nmr structures than x-ray structures, where there was an exponential decrease in the mean strain energy as the incidence of the disulfide type increased.
allosteric disulfide bonds regulate protein function when they break and/or form.
evaluation of protein structures for which there are x-ray and nmr models shows that the same disulfide bond can exist in different configurations in different models.
in nmr structures, this disulfide is characterised by a particularly high potential energy and very short Î±-carbon distance.
they typically have a -rhstaple configuration, which is defined by the sign of the five chi angles that make up the disulfide bond.
a disulfide bond configuration that is rare in x-ray structures is the -lhstaple.
