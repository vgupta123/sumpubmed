shrna fragments targeting bovine cd <dig> were screened by co-transfection in hek  <dig> cells, and the most effective cd <dig> shrna fragment was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector psilencer <dig> -cd <dig> shrna-ires  and transferred into mouse zygotes by pronuclear microinjection to obtain transgenic mice.
thirty-seven founder pups were obtained by pronuclear microinjection, of which three were positive for the transgene.
this study confirms that transgenic mice expressing bovine cd <dig> shrna can be generated by pronuclear microinjection, and demonstrates inhibited endogenous mouse cd <dig> expression that alters gene expression related to the tlr <dig> signaling pathway.
together, these complexes promote the phagocytosis and digestion of gram-negative bacteria, and initiate immune responses.
to date, much of our understanding of cd <dig> function during gram-negative bacterial inflammation comes from studies on mouse knockout models and cell transfection.
to identify the effect of cd <dig> knockdown in this process in large livestock animals, we established a mouse model expressing bovine cd <dig> short hairpin  rna.
the expression patterns of endogenous md- <dig>  tlr <dig>  interleukin- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor-α genes in transgenic mice also varied.
cluster of differentiation  <dig>  functions as a co-receptor for toll-like receptor - <dig> and myeloid differentiation factor - <dig> in detecting bacterial lipopolysaccharide.
