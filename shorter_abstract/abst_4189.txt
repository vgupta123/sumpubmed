using bioinformatics methods, we performed a systematic search for putatively functional sorfs in the mus musculus genome.
our combined genome-wide approach leads to the prediction of a comprehensive but manageable set of putatively coding sorfs, a very important first step towards the identification of a new class of bioactive peptides, called micropeptides.
nevertheless, over the past few years many such non-canonical genes  have been discovered in different organisms like arabidopsis thaliana, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and drosophila melanogaster.
a genome-wide scan detected all sorfs which were subsequently analyzed for their coding potential, based on evolutionary conservation at the aa level, and ranked using a support vector machine  learning model.
in this way dozens of highly conserved sorfs, targeted by ribosomes were identified in the mouse genome, putatively encoding micropeptides.
