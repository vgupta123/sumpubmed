our previous study demonstrated that wnt/β-catenin signaling was able to promote mycobacteria-infected cell apoptosis by a caspase-dependent pathway.
the necrotic cell death was determined by cytometric assay and electronic microscopy; the productions of reactive oxygen species  and reduced glutathione  were measured by a cytometric analysis and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively; and the activity of poly  polymerase  <dig> /apoptosis inhibition factor  signaling was examined by an immunoblotting assay.
mechanistically, the activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling is capable of inhibiting the necrotic cell death in bcg-infected raw <dig>  cells through a mechanism by which the wnt signaling scavenges intracellular ros accumulation and increases cellular gsh concentration.
however, the functionality of this signaling in the necrosis of macrophage following mycobacterial infection remains largely unknown.
this finding may thus provide an insight into the underlying mechanism of alveolar macrophage cell death in response to mycobacterial infection.

intriguingly, an enhancement of wnt/β-catenin signaling shows an ability to reduce the mycobacteria-induced macrophage necrosis.
an activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling can inhibit bcg-induced macrophage necrosis by increasing the production of gsh and scavenging ros in part through a mechanism of repression of parp-1/aif signaling pathway.
in addition, immunoblotting analysis further reveals that wnt/β-catenin signaling is capable of inhibiting the ros-mediated cell necrosis in part through a parp-1/aif- dependent pathway.
