for the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features â€“ a reliable feature detection is mandatory.
we evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and f-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity.
liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  is an important analytical technology for e.g.
the new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments.
we developed a new feature detection algorithm centwave for high-resolution lc/ms data sets, which collects regions of interest  in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain.
the centwave algorithm was integrated into the bioconductor r-package xcms and is available from
determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the lc/ms raw data is called feature detection.
centwave can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, matchedfilter  and the centroidpicker from mzmine.
