ap <dig> mrna was specifically accumulating in the shoot apices of the everbearing genotype, indicating its usability as a marker for floral initiation.
in 'baron solemacher' recessive alleles of an unknown repressor, seasonal flowering locus , are responsible for continuous flowering habit.
we have searched homologs for  <dig> arabidopsis flowering time genes from fragaria by est sequencing and bioinformatics analysis and identified  <dig> gene homologs that by sequence similarity, putatively correspond to genes of all known genetic flowering pathways.
the identification of putative flowering gene homologs and ap <dig> as potential marker gene for floral initiation will strongly facilitate the exploration of strawberry flowering pathways.
in addition to short-day genotypes, everbearing forms of wild strawberry are known.
the comparison of everbearing and short-day genotypes of wild strawberry could facilitate our understanding of fundamental molecular mechanisms regulating perennial growth cycle in plants.
the expression analysis of  <dig> selected genes representing various flowering pathways did not reveal large differences between the everbearing and the short-day genotypes.
moreover, we showed that flowering induction in everbearing 'baron solemacher' and 'hawaii-4' was inhibited by short-day and low temperature, in contrast to short-day genotypes.
however, novel regulatory mechanisms exist, like sfl that functions as a switch between short-day/low temperature and long-day/high temperature flowering responses between the short-day genotype and the everbearing 'baron solemacher'.
we are studying the regulation of flowering in perennial plants by using diploid wild strawberry  as a model.
wild strawberry is a facultative short-day plant with an obligatory short-day requirement at temperatures above 15Â°c.
however, putative floral identity and floral integrator genes ap <dig> and lfy were co-regulated during early floral development.
