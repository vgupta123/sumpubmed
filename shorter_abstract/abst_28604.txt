the chrysochromulina tobin organellar genomes provide new insight into organellar function and evolution.
the complete mitochondrial and chloroplast genome sequences of the haptophyte chrysochromulina tobin  provide insight into the architecture and gene content of haptophyte organellar genomes.
the mitochondrial genome  encodes  <dig> protein coding genes and contains a complex,  <dig> kb tandem repeat region.
similar to other haptophytes and rhodophytes, but not cryptophytes or stramenopiles, the mitochondrial genome has lost the nad <dig>  nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes.

notably, a zinc finger domain has been identified in the rpl <dig> ribosomal protein gene of all chloroplasts sequenced to date with the exception of haptophytes and cryptophytes - algae that have gained  an alternative rpl <dig> lacking the zinc finger motif.
analysis of small  chloroplast encoded tandem and inverted repeats in c. tobin and  <dig> other algal chloroplast genomes show that repeat type, size and location are correlated with gene identity and taxonomic clade.
additionally, each ribosomal operon contains multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms  - a pattern observed in rhodophytes and cryptophytes, but few stramenopiles.
these are the first organellar genomes to be determined for the prymnesiales, a taxon that is present in both oceanic and freshwater systems and represents major primary photosynthetic producers and contributors to global ecosystem stability.
the two c. tobin chloroplast ribosomal rna operon spacer regions differ in trna content.
