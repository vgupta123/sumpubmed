experimental results show storage efficiencies of over 80% for several data sets.
the use of on-chip ram as opposed to fpga logic resources for fsm implementation also enables rapid reconfiguration of the fpga without the place and routing delays associated with complex digital designs.
the process of matching peptide sequences against a genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping pipeline that is used as a case-study.
this paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in computational proteomics.
furthermore, the fpga implementation executing at  <dig> mhz is nearly  <dig> times faster than an implementation of the traditional aho-corasick algorithm executing on a  <dig>  ghz workstation.
this bit-split organization of the aho-corasick implementation enables efficient utilization of the limited random access memory  resources available in typical fpgas.
the aho-corasick algorithm is adapted for execution in field programmable gate array  devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance.
each of the smaller fsms is further divided into five simpler fsms such that each simple fsm operates on a single bit position in the input .
