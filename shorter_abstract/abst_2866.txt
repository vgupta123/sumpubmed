to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying its salinity adaptation, leaf and root transcriptome of s. alterniflora was sequenced using 454/gs-flx.
spartina alterniflora  is a louisiana native monocot halophyte that can withstand salinity up to double the strength of sea water.
digital expression profiles revealed significant enrichment  of transporters, vacuolar proton pump members and transcription factors under salt stress, which suggested the role of ion homeostasis and transcriptional regulation in the salinity adaptation of this grass.
the present study explores the transcriptome of s. alterniflora to understand the gene regulation under salt stress in halophytes.
this study and our previously published studies suggested that s. alterniflora is a rich reservoir of salt tolerance genes that can be used to develop salt tolerant cereal crops, especially rice, a major food crop of global importance.
about 28 % unigenes were considered specific to s. alterniflora.
also,  <dig>  ssrs markers from  <dig> unigenes were generated and validated through genetic diversity analysis among  <dig> accessions of s. alterniflora.
the sequenced transcriptome  of s. alterniflora provides a platform for further gene finding studies in grasses.

soil salinity affects growth and yield of crop plants.
most unigenes  annotated to proteins with known functions, and had more than 90 % similarity to rice genes.
