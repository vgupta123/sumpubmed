these results correlated with the caspase- <dig> staining.
in contrast, the increased cd- <dig> expression post-stroke was reduced in the core of the insult with all treatment protocols.
functional outcome and infarct volume were assessed 24 hours after the insult.
apoptosis was determined using caspase- <dig> immunohistochemistry, phagocytic cells were visualized by cd- <dig> expression and astrogliosis was studied by glial fibrillary acidic protein  staining.
cooling could be postponed up to 1 hour after the onset of the insult without losing its positive effects on neurological deficit and infarct volume.
this study investigated whether a delayed short mild hypothermic treatment is still beneficial as neuroprotective strategy in the endothelin- <dig>  rat model for a transient focal cerebral ischemia.
during the experiment the cerebral blood flow  was measured via laser doppler flowmetry in the striatum, which represents the core of the infarct.
mild hypothermia  is a promising neuroprotective therapy in stroke management.
two hours of mild hypothermia  was induced  <dig>   <dig> or 120 minutes after et- <dig> infusion.
at the same time, hypothermia also establishes a lasting inhibitory effect on the activation of astrogliosis.
in this sub-acute phase following stroke induction, the effects of the hypothermic treatment on apoptosis, phagocytosis and astrogliosis were assessed as well.
these data indicate that in the et- <dig> rat model, a short mild hypothermic treatment delayed for 1 hour is still neuroprotective and correlates with apoptosis.
