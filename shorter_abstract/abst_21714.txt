our data indicate that the a and d genomes in both diploid and tetraploid cotton remain distinct from each such that paralogs can be distinguished.
cultivated cotton is an annual fiber crop derived mainly from two perennial species, gossypium hirsutum l. or upland cotton, and g. barbadense l., extra long-staple fiber pima or egyptian cotton.
a strategy for snp discovery is defined to pre-screen loci for copy number and polymorphism.
this research provides mapped dna markers for intra-specific crosses and introgression of exotic germplasm in cotton.
yet, population-based methods are being used for genome-wide introgression of novel alleles from g. mustelinum and g. tomentosum into g. hirsutum using combinations of backcrossing, selfing, and inter-mating.
over  <dig> snps from  <dig> loci and  <dig> indels from  <dig> loci segregating in g. hirsutum and g. barbadense were genotyped across a standard panel of  <dig> lines,  <dig> of which are elite cotton breeding lines and  <dig> mapping parents of populations from six cotton species.
over  <dig> loci were genetically mapped in a core mapping population derived from tm- <dig> and 3- <dig> and in g. hirsutum breeding germplasm.
in this research, snp and indel diversity is characterized for  <dig> single-copy polymorphic loci in cotton.
these two cultivated species are among five allotetraploid species presumably derived monophyletically between g. arboreum and g. raimondii.
