a preliminary statistical analysis using hidden markov models  indicates a clear change in the blockade pattern upon binding by the single captured aptamer.
if the aptamer is simply a dsdna molecule with a ssdna overhang  then the segment of ssdna that complements that overhang provides a known binding target with binding strength adjustable according to length of overhang.
