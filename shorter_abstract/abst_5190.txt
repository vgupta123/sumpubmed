basolateral aiec infection resulted in more severe disruption of the epithelial barrier.
these findings indicate that aiec, strain lf <dig> disrupts the integrity of the polarized epithelial cell barrier.
these findings provide important links between microbes related to ibd, the intestinal epithelial cell barrier and disease pathogenesis.
after  <dig> h of infection of intestine  <dig> cells, bacteria replicated in the cell cytoplasm and were enclosed in membrane-bound vesicles positive for the late endosomal marker, lamp <dig>
infection of t <dig> and madin-darby canine kidney-i polarized epithelial cell monolayers with aiec, strain lf <dig> led to a reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance and increased macromolecular  flux.
although bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases , mechanisms of intestinal injury and immune activation remain unclear.
therefore, the aim of this study was to delineate the effects of aiec, strain lf <dig>  on model polarized epithelial monolayers as a contributor to intestinal injury in ibd.
increased permeability was accompanied by a redistribution of the tight junction adaptor protein, zonula occludens- <dig>  demonstrated by confocal microscopy and formation of gaps between cells, as shown by transmission electron microscopy.
identification of adherent-invasive escherichia coli  strains in ibd patients offers an opportunity to characterize the pathogenesis of microbial-induced intestinal inflammation in ibd.
