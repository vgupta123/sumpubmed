we further found the sensitivity to dex-induced upregulation of pd- <dig> expression had a significant difference between different t cell subsets, with memory t cells more susceptible to this effect.
programmed cell death  <dig>  is a key cell-surface receptor of cd <dig> superfamily that triggers inhibitory pathways to attenuate t-cell responses and promote t-cell tolerance.

we also showed that dex could suppress t cell functions via inhibition of cytokines production such as il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α and induction of apoptosis of t cells.
our findings suggest a novel way by which dex suppress the function of activated t lymphocytes by enhancing expression of pd- <dig> and provide an insight into the optimum clinical application of gcs.
as a crucial role in tumor immunity, pd- <dig> has been a focus of studies in anti-cancer therapy.
in our study, we used dexamethasone  as a model glucocorticoid and demonstrated that dex could enhance pd- <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner.
considering the wide use of glucocorticoids  in anti-cancer therapy and their immunosuppressive effects, we explored whether gcs could influence the expression of pd- <dig>
