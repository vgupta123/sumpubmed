visualization of protein-ligand complex plays an important role in elaborating protein-ligand interactions and aiding novel drug design.
it features three special effects in virtual reality settings, namely anaglyph, parallax barrier and oculus rift, resulting in visually appealing identification of intermolecular interactions.
moreover, based on the feature-rich version of iview, we have also developed a neat and tailor-made version specifically for our istar web platform for protein-ligand docking purpose.
most existing web visualizers either rely on slow software rendering, or lack virtual reality support.
it supports four surface representations including van der waals surface, solvent excluded surface, solvent accessible surface and molecular surface.
the vital feature of macromolecular surface construction is also unavailable.
