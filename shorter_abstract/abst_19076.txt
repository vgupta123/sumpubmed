in this paper, we make a systematic analysis of the correlation between drug side effects and protein domains, which we call "pharmacogenomic features," based on the drug-target interaction network.
most phenotypic effects of drugs are involved in the interactions between drugs and their target proteins, however, our knowledge about the molecular mechanism of the drug-target interactions is very limited.

the inferred side effect-domain association network is expected to be useful for estimating common drug side effects for different protein families and characteristic drug side effects for specific protein domains.
we detect drug side effects and protein domains that appear jointly in known drug-target interactions, which is made possible by using classifiers with sparse models.
we also discuss advantages and limitations of the pharmacogenomic features, compared with the chemogenomic features that are the associations between drug chemical substructures and protein domains.
one of challenging issues in recent pharmaceutical science is to identify the underlying molecular features which govern drug-target interactions.
it is shown that the inferred pharmacogenomic features can be used for predicting potential drug-target interactions.
