previous work has revealed that c. elegans sperm release factors that stimulate oocyte maturation and ovulation.
here we describe evidence that sperm also promote egg laying, the release of embryos from the uterus.
we have studied the egg-laying defective mutant, egl- <dig>  and found that the cellular basis of the egl- <dig> egg-laying phenotype is likely a defect in sperm.
in insects and in mammals, male sperm and seminal fluid provide signaling factors that influence various aspects of female physiology and behavior to promote reproductive success and to compete with other males.
most importantly, introduction of mutant egl- <dig> sperm into wild-type hermaphrodites or females is sufficient to induce an egg-laying defective phenotype.
third, mating experiments have revealed that wild-type sperm can rescue the egg-laying defect of egl- <dig> mutant animals.
