compared to methods of haplotype block partitioning, we performed best on detection of recombination hotspots.
our results show that the pairwise allelic association of snps can describe various features of genomic variation, in particular recombination hotspots.
we set limits on the maximum acceptable proportion of independent pairs within all blocks and search for the partitioning with maximal proportion of associated snp pairs.
our algorithm performed better than previously reported models in a case-control association study aimed at mapping a single locus trait, based on simulation results that were evaluated by a block-based statistical test.
here, we define an association index based on ld between snp pairs.
by this test, each snp pair is characterized as associated, independent, or not-statistically-significant.
our proposed method divides chromosomes into the regions within which allelic associations of snp pairs are maximized.
essentially, this model is reduced to a constrained optimization problem, the solution of which is obtained by iterating a dynamic programming algorithm.
global partitioning based on pairwise associations of snps has not previously been used to define haplotype blocks within genomes.
resampling hapmap haplotypes under a block-based model of recombination showed that our algorithm is robust in reproducing the same partitioning for recombinant samples.
we use the fisher's exact test to assess the statistical significance of the ld estimator.
nevertheless, the haplotype diversity within the blocks is captured by a small number of tagsnps.
