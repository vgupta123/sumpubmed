collectively, our results suggest that a novel rhoa-dependent signaling pathway under the control of arhgef <dig> has a pivotal role in the regulation of the cell division cycle.
we further isolated the kinesin-like motor protein kif3b as a binding partner of arhgef <dig>  knockdown of kif3b again caused multipolar spindle phenotypes.
the kinesin-like motor protein kif3b may modulate the arhgef10-rhoa pathway through the binding to arhgef <dig>
here we show that rhoa is a substrate for arhgef <dig>  in both g1/s and m phases, arhgef <dig> was localized in the centrosome in adenocarcinoma hela cells.
the supernumerary centrosome phenotype was also observed in s phase-arrested osteosarcoma u2os cells when the expression of arhgef <dig>  rhoa or kif3b was abrogated by rna interference.
however, the function of arhgef <dig> in mammalian cells is totally unknown at a molecular level.
therefore, unregulated centrosome duplication rather than aberration in cytokinesis may be responsible for arhgef <dig> knockdown-dependent multipolar spindle formation.
this pathway is not involved in the regulation of cytokinesis, but instead may regulate centrosome duplication.
the dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factor arhgef <dig> was originally identified as the product of the gene associated with slowed nerve-conduction velocities of peripheral nerves.
furthermore, rna interference-based knockdown of arhgef <dig> resulted in multipolar spindle formation in m phase.
multinucleated cells were not increased upon arhgef <dig> knockdown in contrast to treatment with y- <dig>  a specific pharmacological inhibitor for the rhoa effector kinase rock, which induced not only multipolar spindle formation, but also multinucleation.
downregulation of rhoa elicited similar phenotypes, and aberrant mitotic spindle formation following arhgef <dig> knockdown was rescued by ectopic expression of constitutively activated rhoa.
arhgef <dig> contains no distinctive functional domains except for tandem dbl homology-pleckstrin homology and putative transmembrane domains.
each spindle pole seems to contain a centrosome consisting of two centrioles and the pericentriolar material.
