we employed tiger to characterize polymorphic transductions in fifteen genomes from non-human primate species , as well as in a human genome.
we achieved high accuracy as confirmed by pcr and two single molecule dna sequencing techniques, and uncovered differences in relative rates of transduction between primate species.
by enabling detection of polymorphic transductions, tiger makes this form of relevant structural variation amenable for population and personal genome analysis.
