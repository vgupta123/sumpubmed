the evolutionary range of genome sequences now available, can shed more light on synaptotagmin gene phylogeny and clarify family relationships.
synaptotagmin proteins were first identified in nervous tissue, residing in synaptic vesicles.
only a subset of synaptotagmin proteins appear able to function as calcium triggers.
esyt genes were formerly named fam <dig>  the species in this collection are trichoplax, nematostella, capitella, helobdella, lottia, ciona, strongylocentrotus, branchiostoma, ixodes, daphnia, acyrthosiphon, tribolium, nasonia, apis, anopheles, drosophila, caenorhabditis, takifugu, tetraodon, gasterosteus, oryzias, danio, xenopus, anolis, gallus, taeniopygia,ornithorhynchus, monodelphis, mus and homo.
this collection of genes offers prospects for fruitful speculation about the functional roles of the synaptotagmin repertoires of different animals and includes a great range of biological complexity.
all of the data described in this paper is available as additional files.
with reference to this gene collection, functional relationships among syt, esyt, rph3a, rph3al, doc <dig> and dblc <dig> genes, which encode similar proteins, can better be assessed in future.
current understanding does not explain why this is so.
further difficulty arises as families are defined quite legitimately in different ways: by common descent or by common possession of distinguishing features.
these members have been investigated intensively, but other family members are not well understood, making it difficult to grasp the meaning of family membership in functional terms.
