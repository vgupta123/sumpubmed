the popularity of massively parallel exome and transcriptome sequencing projects demands new data mining tools with a comprehensive set of features to support a wide range of analysis tasks.
we showed that the results generated from seqgene compares favourably to other existing methods in our case studies.
seqgene, a new data mining tool, supports mutation detection and annotation, dbsnp and  <dig> genome data integration, rna-seq expression quantification, mutation and coverage visualization, allele specific expression , differentially expressed genes  identification, copy number variation  analysis, and gene expression quantitative trait loci  detection.
we also developed novel methods for testing the association between snp and expression and identifying genotype-controlled degs.
