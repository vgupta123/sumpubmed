further, we have generated a cre-reporter mouse in which synbgla is expressed following recombination to demonstrate the general utility of synbgla for in vivo analyses.
reporter genes are widely used in biology and only a limited number are available.
we present a new reporter gene for the localization of mammalian cells and transgenic tissues based on detection of the bgla  gene of caldocellum saccharolyticum that encodes a thermophilic β-glucosidase.
synbgla expression can be localized in situ or detected quantitatively in colorimetric assays and can be co-localized with e. coli β-galactosidase.
synbgla will have general applicability to developmental and molecular studies in vitro and in vivo.
