taken together, the results suggested that gen protects pc <dig> cells from aβ25– <dig> induced neurotoxicity by interfering with p-jnk activation, thus attenuating the jnk-dependent apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway.
therefore we endeavored to research further the molecular mechanisms underlying gen’s inhibition of aβ25– <dig> induced apoptosis of neurons.
furthermore, gen significantly reduced the cytoplasmic concentrations of cytochrome c and smac protein as well as caspase- <dig> activity.
