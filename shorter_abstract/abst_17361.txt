the phylogenetic analysis and biochemical experiments suggest that sap <dig> has diverged functionally from the ancestral sap30l by accumulating mutations that have caused attenuation of one of the original functions, association with the nuclear matrix.
this function is mediated by a nuclear matrix association sequence, which consists of a conserved motif in the c-terminus and the adjacent nucleolar localization signal .
these results add further insight into the evolution and function of proteins of the sap <dig> family, which share many characteristic with nuclear scaffolding proteins that are intimately involved in regulation of gene expression.
our analysis indicates that in tetrapods sap30l is more similar than sap <dig> to the ancestral protein, and the two copies in this group originated by gene duplication which occurred after the divergence of actinopterygii and sarcopterygii about  <dig> million years ago .
