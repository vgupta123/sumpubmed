hypovitaminosis d has previously been shown to be prevalent amongst dogs with protein losing enteropathy .
cox regression analysis yielded a hazard ratio of  <dig>   per each one nmol/l increase in serum  <dig> d concentration.
clinical  scores, age at ple diagnosis, and ica concentrations were not significantly different between dog groups.
the hypothesis of this study was that low 25-hydroxyvitamin d  d) serum concentrations could be a risk factor for negative outcome in dogs with ple.
forty-three dogs diagnosed with ple  and which serum vitamin d serum concentrations were collected and archived at − <dig> degrees c were analyzed.
low serum  <dig> d concentration in ple dogs was significantly associated with poor outcome.
a significantly greater  number of ple dogs treated with hydrolyzed or elimination diet alone showed good outcome as compared to the ple negative outcome group.
median serum  <dig> d concentration was significantly  lower in dogs with negative outcome versus ple dogs with good outcome.
post-diagnostic communication with referring veterinarians was made to determine outcome of ple dogss: dogs which died due to ple within 4 months after diagnosis  and dogs alive or which died due to another disease at the end point of the study .
further studies are required to investigate the clinical efficacy of vitamin d  as a potential therapeutic agent for dogs with ple.
