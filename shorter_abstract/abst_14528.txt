microtar does not rely on evolutionary conservation to discern functional targets, and is able to predict both conserved and non-conserved targets.

the algorithm uses predicted free energies of unbound mrna and putative mrna-mirna heterodimers, implicitly addressing the accessibility of the mrna 3' untranslated region.
microtar achieves better sensitivity than previously reported predictions when tested on three distinct datasets of experimentally-verified mirna-target interactions in c. elegans, drosophila, and mouse.
the accurate prediction of a comprehensive set of messenger rnas  regulated by animal micrornas  remains an open problem.
