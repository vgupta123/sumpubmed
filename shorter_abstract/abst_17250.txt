the present study examined the applicability of brain functional magnetic resonance imaging  and diffusion tensor imaging  to sheep using a clinical mr scanner  with a head coil.
white matter tractography was also applied to reveal the macrostructure of the corticospinal tracts and optic radiations.
the individual as well as group-based data processing subsequently showed activation in the eloquent sensorimotor and visual areas.
an ovine model can cast great insight in translational neuroscientific research due to its large brain volume and distinct regional neuroanatomical structures.
utilization of fmri and dti along with anatomical mri in the sheep brain could shed light on a broader use of an ovine model in the field of translational neuroscientific research targeting the brain.
