the occurrence rate of esbl–producing e. coli was  <dig> % , and all were obtained in swine farms located in southern taiwan.
ctx-m- <dig>  esbl–producing e. coli exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype, and multilocus sequence typing revealed that the st <dig> clonal complexes, including st <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> accounted for 35%  of these strains.
esbl-producing e. coli from piglets with diarrhea were isolated from swine farms located in southern taiwan.

esbl–producing bacteria have emerged in livestock in recent years, which may raise concerns regarding possible transfer of such bacteria through the food chain.
the swine industry is important in taiwan, but investigations regarding the status of esbl in swine are limited.
fecal shedding from swine may contaminate the environment, resulting in public health concerns; thus, continued surveillance of esbl is essential in swine and in other food animals.
