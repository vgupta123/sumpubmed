analysis of flavor and fragrance-related gene families  and pathways  is presented in comparison with a chemical analysis of the compounds present in actinidia including esters, acids, alcohols and terpenes.
commercial success is driven by the development of new cultivars with novel consumer traits including flavor, appearance, healthful components and convenience.
this large est resource will allow researchers to undertake the tremendous challenge of understanding the molecular basis of genetic diversity in the actinidia genus as well as provide an est resource for comparative fruit genomics.
to increase our understanding of the genetic diversity and gene-based control of these key traits in actinidia, we have produced a collection of  <dig>  expressed sequence tags .
the ests were derived mainly from four actinidia species  and fell into  <dig>  non redundant clusters .
ests are identified for most genes in color pathways controlling chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid biosynthesis.
in the health area, data are presented on the ests involved in ascorbic acid and quinic acid biosynthesis showing not only that genes for many of the steps in these pathways are represented in the database, but that genes encoding some critical steps are absent.
