further advances in modern microscopy are leading to teravoxel-sized tiled 3d images at high resolution, thus increasing the dimension of the stitching problem of at least two orders of magnitude.
we provide terastitcher both as standalone application and as plugin of the free software vaa3d.
we propose a free and fully automated 3d stitching tool designed to match the special requirements coming out of teravoxel-sized tiled microscopy images that is able to stitch them in a reasonable time even on workstations with limited resources.
terastitcher is a free tool that enables the stitching of teravoxel-sized tiled microscopy images even on workstations with relatively limited resources of memory  and processing power.
the produced images can be saved into a multiresolution representation to be efficiently retrieved and processed.
to this purpose, we designed a software architecture which separates the strategies that use efficiently memory resources from the algorithms which may depend on the characteristics of the acquired images.
it exploits the knowledge of approximate tile positions and uses ad-hoc strategies and algorithms designed for such very large datasets.
the existing software solutions do not seem adequate to address the additional requirements arising from these datasets, such as the minimization of memory usage and the need to process just a small portion of data.
