all three proteins associate with the plasma membrane and with apical vesicles indicating a conserved action mechanism for all syps.
the continuous polarized vesicle secretion in pollen tubes is essential for tip growth but the location of endo- and exocytic sub-domains remains however controversial.
competition with a related dominant negative mutant affected the specific distribution of syp <dig> but not tip growth.
using gfp-fusion constructs, we imaged the distribution of pollen-specific  and non-pollen syntaxins  in transiently transformed nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes.
the results presented suggest that in normal growing pollen tubes, a net exocytic flow occurs in the flanks of the tube apex mediated by syp <dig>  the specific distribution of syp <dig> at the plasma membrane is affected by changes in ca2+ levels in agreement with the importance of this ion for exocytosis.
however, the gfp tagged syp <dig> showed a specific distribution with a higher labelling at the plasma membrane flanks, 10- <dig> Î¼m behind the apex.
both inhibitors decreased growth rate but the distribution of syp <dig> at the plasma membrane was more strongly affected by gd3+.
apical growth and the specific localization of syp <dig> were affected by regulators of membrane secretion  but competition with a dominant negative mutant affected only syp distribution.
in contrast, co-expression of the phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate 5-kinase  <dig>  or of the small gtpase rab <dig> perturbed polarity and the normal distribution of gfp-syp but did not inhibit the accumulation in vesicles or at the plasma membrane.
