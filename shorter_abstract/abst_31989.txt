this analysis often depends on manual annotation of genes based on controlled vocabularies, in particular, gene ontology .
we conclude that the current work will provide biologists with a tool that effectively complements the existing ones for overrepresentation analysis from genomic experiments.
through experimentation with several datasets, we showed that our program can effectively summarize the important conceptual themes of large gene sets, even when traditional go-based analysis does not yield informative results.
the method is based on a statistical framework of mixture model and addresses the methodological flaws in several existing programs.
we implemented this method within a literature mining system, beespace, taking advantage of its analysis environment and added features that facilitate the interactive analysis of gene sets.
our program, genelist analyzer, is freely available at: http://workerbee.igb.uiuc.edu:8080/beespace/search.jsp
free-text, as the source to perform overrepresentation analysis.
we propose a statistical method that uses the primary literature, i.e.
