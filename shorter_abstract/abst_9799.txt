eight multiparous mid-lactating holstein cows  were randomly assigned into two groups in the experiment and were fed a low-concentrate diet  or high-concentrate diet  for 18 weeks.
dairy cows are often fed a high-concentrate diet to meet lactating demands, yet long-term concentrate feeding induces subacute ruminal acidosis  and leads to a decrease in milk fat.
here, we conducted this study to investigate the impact of lipopolysaccharide derived from the rumen on scd <dig> expression and on fatty acid composition in the liver of dairy cows fed a high-concentrate diet.
these data indicate that lipopolysaccharide derived from the rumen down-regulates stearoyl-coa desaturase  <dig> expression and alters fatty acid composition in the liver of dairy cows fed a high-concentrate diet.
the long chain fatty acid profile in the rumen and hepatic vein was remarkably altered in the animals fed the hc diet.
in regards to transcriptional regulators, the expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factors  and srebp cleavage activating protein  was down-regulated, while peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α  was up-regulated.
the results showed that the total volatile fatty acids and lactic acid accumulated in the rumen, leading to a decreased rumen ph and elevated lipopolysaccharides  in the hc group.
stearoyl-coa desaturase <dig>  participates in fatty acid biosynthesis in the liver of lactating ruminants.
the triglyceride , non-esterified fatty acid  and total cholesterol  content in the plasma was significantly decreased, whereas plasma glucose and insulin levels were increased.
