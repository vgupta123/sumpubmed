the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of genotypic variation on both early microbial colonization of the gut and functional development of intestinal tissue.
the results indicate that genetically different chicken lines have different coping mechanisms in early life to cope with the outside world.
these data suggest the genetic background influences colonization of gut microbiota after hatch in combination with the functional development of intestinal mucosal tissue, including the programming of the immune system.
we also observed trends in the microbiota data at genus level when comparing lines x and y. we observed that approximately  <dig> genes showed different temporal gene expression patterns when comparing line x to line y. immunological related differences seem to be only present at day  <dig>  because at day  <dig> and  <dig> similar gene expression is observed for these two lines.
in contrast, no significant differences were observed regarding changes in the microbiota diversity between the two lines throughout this study.
the microbiota composition was significantly different between lines on each time point.
however, for genes involved in cell cycle related processes the data show higher expression over the whole course of time in line y in comparison to line x.
from two genetically diverse chicken lines intestinal content samples were taken for microbiota analyses and intestinal tissue samples were extracted for gene expression analyses, both at three subsequent time-points .
interactions between gut microbiota and host cells of the mucosal layer are of paramount importance for a proper development of host defence mechanisms.
