the cumulus cells  enveloping antral and ovulated oocytes have been regarded as putative source of non-invasive markers of the oocyte developmental competence.
overall, the regulated nature of the group of genes brought out by whole transcriptome analysis constitutes the molecular signature of ccs associated either with developmentally incompetent or competent oocytes and may represent a valuable resource for developing new molecular tools for the assessment of oocyte quality and to further investigate the complex bi-directional interaction occurring between ccs and oocyte.
a number of studies have indeed observed a correlation between ccs gene expression, embryo quality, and final pregnancy outcome.
the developmental incompetence  or competence  of antral oocytes can be predicted using transcript markers expressed by their surrounding ccs .
only ten of the  <dig> genes were up-regulated with amh being the most up-regulated in nsn-ccs, with an average 4-fold higher expression when analysed by qrt-pcr.
here, we isolated ccs from antral mouse oocytes of known developmental incompetence  or competence  and compared their transcriptomes with the aim of identifying distinct marker transcripts.
