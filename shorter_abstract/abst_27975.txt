this represents evidence for a possible ancestral role for helitrons in modelling the genomes of lolium and related species.
cloning of the flowering gene gigantea  from a bac library of the pooideae grass lolium perenne  identified the target gene and several gi pseudogene fragments spanning the first five exons.
they are unique in their proposed rolling-circle mode of replication, have a highly variable copy-number and have been implicated in the restructuring of coding sequences both by their insertion into existing genes and by their incorporation of transcriptionally competent gene fragments.
screening of a bac library of the closely related grass species festuca pratensis  indicated similar helitron-associated gi fragments present in this genome, as well as non-helitron associated gi fragments derived from the same region of gi.
in order to investigate the possible extent of ancestral helitron-activity in l. perenne, a methylation-filtered genethresherÂ® genomic library developed from this species was screened for potential helitron 3' hairpin sequences associated with a 3'-ctrr motif.
this identified  <dig> potential helitron hairpin-types present between at least  <dig> and  <dig> times within the l. perenne methylation-filtered library.
