vv-amp <dig> peptide, produced in escherichia coli, had a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda as determined by mass spectrometry.
the peptides display a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities.
recombinant vv-amp <dig> was extremely heat-stable and showed strong antifungal activity against a broad spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi, with very high levels of activity against the wilting disease causing pathogens fusarium oxysporum and verticillium dahliae.
recombinant vv-amp <dig> displayed non-morphogenic antifungal activity against a broad spectrum of fungi, probably altering the membrane permeability of the fungal pathogens.
vv-amp <dig> encodes for a  <dig> amino acid peptide that shows sequence homology to the family of plant defensins.
a berry specific cdna clone, vv-amp <dig>  was isolated and characterized and shown to encode a plant defensin.
a propidium iodide uptake assay suggested that the inhibitory activity of vv-amp <dig> might be associated with altering the membrane permeability of the fungal membranes.
the predicted signal peptide of vv-amp <dig>  fused to the green fluorescent protein , showed that the signal peptide allowed accumulation of its product in the apoplast.
a berry specific cdna sequence designated vv-amp <dig>  vitis vinifera antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  was isolated from vitis vinifera.
the expression of this peptide is highly regulated in vitis vinifera, hinting at an important defense role during berry-ripening.
latest research shows that small antimicrobial peptides play a role in the innate defense system of plants.
the vv-amp <dig> peptide did not induce morphological changes on the treated fungal hyphae, but instead strongly inhibited hyphal elongation.
