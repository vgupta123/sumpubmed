moreover, an enrichment of defined composite modules has been observed in selected auxin-related gene families.
applying a novel bioinformatic algorithm, we demonstrate on a genome-wide scale that singular motifs or composite modules of auxres, zres, mres but also of myc <dig> related elements are significantly enriched in promoters of auxin-inducible genes.
despite considerable, species-specific differences in the genome structure in terms of the gc content, this enrichment is generally conserved in dicot  and monocot  model plants.
recent publications have proposed that besides the well-characterized auxin response factors  that bind auxin response elements , also members of the bzip- and myb-transcription factor  families participate in transcriptional control of auxin-regulated genes via bzip response elements  or myb response elements , respectively.
using genome-wide bioinformatic analyses, evolutionary conserved motifs have been defined which potentially function as auxre-dependent coupling elements to establish auxin-specific expression patterns.
