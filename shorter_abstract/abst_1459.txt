this multifactorial experiment highlights the potential impacts, over short time scales, of changing environmental factors on the structure of various functional groups like small primary producers, parasites and saprotrophs which, in response, can modify energy flow in the planktonic food webs.
for most of the phylogenetic groups, some rearrangements occurred at the otus level even when their relative proportion  did not change significantly.
we coupled molecular tools  with microscope-based identification and counting to experimentally investigate the short-term responses of small eukaryotes  to a warming treatment  and uvb radiation increases  at two different nutrient levels.
temperature explained almost 20% of the total variance of the small eukaryote community structure .
interestingly, the increase in temperature resulted in higher pigmented eukaryotes abundances and in community structure changes clearly illustrated by molecular analyses.

small size eukaryotes play a fundamental role in the functioning of coastal ecosystems, however, the way in which these micro-organisms respond to combined effects of water temperature, uvb radiations  and nutrient availability is still poorly investigated.
