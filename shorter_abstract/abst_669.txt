using pyrosequencing based approaches we evaluated vlu to characterize their microbial ecology.
approximately  <dig> out of every  <dig> individuals has some form of venous insufficiency, which can lead to chronic venous disease and venous leg ulcer .
results show that vlu infections are polymicrobial with no single bacterium colonizing the wounds.
the polymicrobial nature of vlu and previous research on diabetic foot ulcers and surgical site infections suggest that the future of therapy for such wounds lies in the core of the logical and proven multiple concurrent strategy approach, which has been termed "biofilm-based wound care" and the use of individualized therapeutics rather than in a single treatment modality.
there are known underlying pathologies which contribute to the chronic nature of vlu including biofilm phenotype infections.
topological analysis of vlu show some notable differences in bacterial populations across the surface of the wounds highlighting the importance of sampling techniques during diagnostics.
