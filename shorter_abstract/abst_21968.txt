to address this point, we compared the degree of acoustic similarity of contact calls in free-ranging campbell's monkeys as a function of their social bonds and genetic relatedness.
we found a significantly positive relation between bond strength and acoustic similarity that was independent of genetic relatedness.
one hypothesis is that this capacity has evolved gradually in humans from an ancestral stage that resembled the vocal behavior of modern primates.
support for this has come from studies that have documented limited vocal flexibility and convergence in different primate species, typically in calls used during social interactions.
genetic factors determine the general species-specific call repertoire of a primate species, while social factors can influence the fine structure of some the call types.
the lack of these abilities in non-human primates is especially striking if compared to some marine mammals and bird species, which has generated somewhat of an evolutionary conundrum.
what are the biological roots and underlying evolutionary pressures of the human ability to voluntarily control sound production and learn the vocal utterances of others?
we calculated three different indices to compare the similarities between the calls' frequency contours, the duration of grooming interactions and the microsatellite-based genetic relatedness between partners.
specifically, it has been difficult to rule out explanations based on genetic relatedness, suggesting that such vocal flexibility may not be the result of social learning.
