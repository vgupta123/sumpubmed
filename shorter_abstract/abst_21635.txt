using similar large-scale expression datasets, the identification of biological processes acting at multiple time scales in many organisms is now possible.
the spatiotemporal modules identified by our method suggest the presence of multiple biological processes, acting at distinct time scales in both the arabidopsis root and yeast.
biological processes occur on a vast range of time scales, and many of them occur concurrently.
we introduce a flexible and statistically rigorous method for detecting different time scales in time-series gene expression data, by identifying expression patterns that are temporally shifted between replicate datasets.
this issue is particularly relevant to developmental biologists, who are interested in processes such as growth, segmentation and differentiation, which can all take place simultaneously, but on different time scales.
in both datasets our method successfully detects processes operating on several different time scales.
the challenge however, is to separate these processes and time scales in the data.
in many cases the number of processes and their time scales is unknown.
furthermore we show that many of these time scales can be associated with particular biological functions.
as a result, system-wide measurements of gene expression have the potential to capture many of these processes simultaneously.
