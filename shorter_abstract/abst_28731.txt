we showed in the past that a pharmacokinetic and â€“dynamic model of g-csf and human granulopoiesis can be used to predict the performance of yet untested g-csf schedules.
we established a comprehensive model of combined g-csf and chemotherapy action in humans which allows us to predict and compare the outcome of alternative g-csf schedules.
major assumptions are: proportionality of cell numbers and cell loss, delayed action of chemotherapy, drug, drug-dose and cell stage specific toxicities, no interaction of drugs and higher toxicity of drugs at the first time of application.
risk groups of granulotoxicity were traced back to differences in toxicity parameters.
model assumptions proved to be feasible in explaining granulotoxicity of  <dig> different chemotherapeutic drugs or drug-combinations applied in  <dig> different schedules with and without g-csf.
in the present paper, we propose a comprehensive model of chemotherapy toxicity and combine it with our cell kinetic model of granulopoiesis.
data were either extracted from the literature or were received from cooperating clinical study groups.
correspondingly, chemotherapies can be characterized by a set of toxicity parameters which can be estimated by fitting the predictions of our model to clinical time series data of patients under therapy.
