sampling-based approaches to solve this problem based on codon-shuffling have been limited to exploring only an infinitesimal fraction of the sequence space and by their use of parametric approximations.
we present a novel o2)-time algorithm, codingmotif, to identify nucleotide-level motifs of unusual copy number in protein-coding regions.
it has been increasingly appreciated that coding sequences harbor regulatory sequence motifs in addition to encoding for protein.
these sequence motifs are expected to be overrepresented in nucleotide sequences bound by a common protein or small rna.
using a new dynamic programming algorithm we are able to exhaustively calculate the distribution of the number of occurrences of a motif over all possible coding sequences that encode the same amino acid sequence, given a background model for codon usage and dinucleotide biases.
we demonstrate that our method identifies known functional motifs more accurately than sampling and parametric-based approaches in a variety of coding datasets of various size, including chip-seq data for the transcription factors nrsf and gabp.
