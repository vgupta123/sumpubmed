here we present a comparative analysis of complete draft genome sequences of an additional twelve s. uberis strains.
pan and core genome analysis revealed the core genome common to all strains to be  <dig>  genes in  <dig>  orthologous clusters, complemented by 115- <dig> accessory genes present in one or more s. uberis strains but absent in the reference strain 0140j.
streptococcus uberis, a gram-positive, catalase-negative member of the family streptococcaceae is an important environmental pathogen responsible for a significant proportion of subclinical and clinical bovine intramammary infections.
comparison of the genome sequence of ef <dig> with the validated virulent strain 0140j identified genes associated with virulence, however these did not relate clearly with clinical/non-clinical status of infection.
experimental challenge experiments confirmed strain ef <dig> as non-virulent; only able to infect in a transient manner that did not result in clinical mastitis.
most of the previously predicted virulent genes were present in the core genome of all  <dig> strains but gene gain/loss was observed between the isolates in cds associated with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats , prophage and bacteriocin production.
this first “whole-genome” comparison of strains isolated from clinical vs non-clinical intramammary infections including the type virulent vs non-virulent strains did not identify simple gene gain/loss rules that readily explain, or be confidently associated with, differences in virulence.
this suggests that a more complex dynamic determines infection potential and clinical outcome not simply gene content.
