the master regulator p <dig> tumor-suppressor protein through coordination of several downstream target genes and upstream transcription factors controls many pathways important for tumor suppression.
the putative p53-mirs and their targets are prioritized using current knowledge of cancer biology and literature-reported cancer-mirnas.
specifically, we identify putative microrna regulators of a) transcription factors that are upstream or downstream to p <dig> and b) p <dig> interactants.
