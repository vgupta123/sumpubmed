the performance varies greatly between superfamilies with the truncated receiver operating characteristic, roc <dig>  varying from  <dig>  down to  <dig> .
we analyse the superfamily specific performance of sequence profile-profile matching.
some of the best methods of detecting remote relationships between protein sequences are based on matching sequence profiles.
although the number of sequences in the profile  and degree of sequence variation within positions in the profile  contribute to accurate detection there are other superfamily specific factors.
