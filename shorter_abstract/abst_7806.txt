blastp hits in closely related rosaceae species revealed that about half of the predicted peptides in the strawberry and peach genomes have orthologs in rosa dataset.
comparative gene expression analyses between the different tissues and organs allowed the identification of clusters that are highly enriched in given tissues or under particular conditions, demonstrating the usefulness of the digital gene expression analysis.
digital expression was obtained using rna samples from organs at different development stages and under different stress conditions.
transcripts using rna from various tissues and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
here, we used a combination of illumina and  <dig> sequencing technologies to generate information on rosa sp.
