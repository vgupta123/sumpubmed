cold tolerance is a key determinant of the geographical distribution range of a plant species and crop production.
wild oil-tea camellia samples were genetically differentiated mainly between latitudes  and then among elevations .
gene expression patterns of wild oil-tea camellia samples were compared among different air temperatures, and differentially expressed genes  were discovered.
more degs concerned with cold acclimation were detected at 2 °c than at 5 °c, and a putative c-repeat binding factor  gene was significantly up-regulated only at 2 °c, suggesting a stronger cold stress at 2 °c.
moreover, wild oil-tea camellia is an essential genetic resource for the breeding of cultivated oil-tea camellia, one of the four major woody oil crops in the world.
the aims of our study are to identify variations in transcriptomes of wild oil-tea camellia from different latitudes and elevations, and discover candidate genes for cold acclimation.
leaf transcriptomes were obtained of wild oil-tea camellia from different elevations in lu and jinggang mountains, china.
wild oil-tea camellia populations were genetically differentiated between latitudes.

candidate genes for cold acclimation may be predominantly involved in transmembrane transporter activities.
cold acclimation can enhance freezing-tolerance of plant species through a period of exposure to low nonfreezing temperatures.
huge amounts of simple sequence repeats , single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertion/deletions  were identified.
we developed a new method for identifying significant functional groups of degs.
it may undergo cold acclimation when air temperatures are below 10 °c.
our study provides one of the largest transcriptome dataset in the genus camellia.
when air temperatures were below 10 °c, gene expression patterns changed dramatically and majority of the degs were up-regulated at low temperatures.
as a subtropical evergreen broadleaf plant, oil-tea camellia demonstrates a relatively strong tolerance to freezing temperatures.
based on snps, phylogenetic analysis was performed to detect genetic structure.
among the degs, transmembrane transporter genes were found to be predominant and many of them encoded transmembrane sugar transporters.
