an in silico approach was used to predict srnas genes in intergenic regions of the b. pertussis genome.
the genome sequences of b. pertussis, bordetella parapertussis, bordetella bronchiseptica and bordetella avium were compared using a blast, and significant hits were analyzed using rnaz.
we shown here that b. pertussis, like other pathogens, expresses srnas, and that the expression of one of them is controlled by the bvga/bvgs system, similarly to most virulence genes, suggesting that it is involved in virulence of b. pertussis.
twenty-three candidate regions were obtained, including regions encoding the already documented 6s rna, and the gcvt and fmn riboswitches.
the existence of srnas was verified by northern blot analyses, and transcripts were detected for  <dig> out of the  <dig> additional candidates.
these new srnas were named bordetella pertussis rnas, bpr.
so far, little is known about srnas in bordetella, and only very few srnas have been identified in the genome of bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough.
small bacterial rnas  have been shown to participate in the regulation of gene expression and have been identified in numerous prokaryotic species.
this repeat exhibits certain features of mobile elements.
