we show that the interaction between ago mrnas and mirnas is species-specific due to the diversity in sequences of two mirnas that target agos, sequence diversity among corresponding target regions in ago mrnas and variable expression levels of these mirnas among vascular plants.
sequences of mir <dig> and mir <dig> are not conserved among plant lineages, but surprisingly they differ drastically in their sequence diversity and expression levels even among closely related plants.
our data indicates a complex ago targeting interaction among plant lineages due to mirna sequence diversity and sequences of mirna targeting regions among ago mrnas, thus leading to the assumption that the perturbations by viruses that use host mirnas to target antiviral agos can only be species-specific.
we also show that rapid evolution and likely loss of expression of mir <dig> isoforms in tobacco is related to the insertion of mite-like transposons between mirna and mirna* sequences, a possible mechanism showing how mirnas are lost in few plant lineages even though other close relatives have abundantly expressing mirnas.
across plant lineages, dicer-like  <dig>  proteins process long ds-like structures to produce micro  rna duplexes in a stepwise manner.
expression levels of agos are greatly regulated by plants in order to minimize unwarranted perturbations using mirnas to target mrnas coding for agos.
variation in mir <dig> expression among plants correlates well with secondary structures/length of loop sequences of their precursors.
