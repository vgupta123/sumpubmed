so, the pathway interactions and especially their changes over time corresponding to specific phenotype are critical to understanding cell functions and phenotypic plasticity.
with prior-defined pathways and incorporated protein-protein interaction  data, we counted ppis between corresponding gene sets of each pair of distinct pathways to construct a comprehensive pathway network.
by adding gene expression data regarding a given phenotype, angiogenesis, active ppis corresponding to stimulation of interleukin- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor α  on human umbilical vein endothelial cells  respectively were derived.
we inferred that, in certain case, the static cspn maintains related basic functions of the cells, whereas the dynamic cspn manifests the cells' plastic responses to stimulus and therefore reflects the cells' phenotypic plasticity.
moreover, two kinds of potential cspns found in this work, the static cspn and the dynamic cspn, are helpful to deeply understand the specific function of huvec and its phenotypic plasticity in regard to angiogenesis.
then we proposed a novel concept, characteristic sub pathway network , to realize the phenotype-specific pathway interactions.
a comprehensive pathway network containing  <dig> signalling pathways as nodes and  <dig> pathway interactions were obtained.
from phenotype-specific cspns, a static cspn involving interactions among b cell receptor, t cell receptor, toll-like receptor, mapk, vegf, and erbb signalling pathways, and a dynamic cspn involving interactions among tgf-β, wnt, p <dig> signalling pathways and cell cycle pathway, were detected for angiogenesis on huvec after stimulation of il- <dig> and tnf-α respectively.
two kinds of cspn, namely the static or the dynamic cspn, were detected by counting active ppis.
the comprehensive pathway network helps us realize the cooperative behaviours among pathways.
