with the advent of next-generation sequencing  technologies, full cdna shotgun sequencing has become a major approach in the study of transcriptomes, and several different protocols in  <dig> sequencing have been invented.
we have designed and implemented a new program for raw sequence cleaning in a graphical user interface and a batch script.
as each protocol uses its own short dna tags or adapters attached to the ends of cdna fragments for labeling or sequencing, different contaminants may lead to mis-assembly and inaccurate sequence products.
the cleaning process consists of several modules including barcode trimming, sequencing adapter trimming, amplification primer trimming, poly-a tail trimming, vector screening and low quality region trimming.
it outperforms in cleaning read sequences from complicated sequencing protocols which use barcodes and multiple amplification primers.
estclean is a software package not only for cleaning cdna sequences, but also for helping to develop sequencing protocols by providing summary tables and figures for sequencing quality control in a graphical user interface.
