here i report the unexpected discovery of a density threshold for growth of a strain of methylobacterium extorquens am <dig> used to inoculate eight replicate populations that were evolved in methanol.
these variable dynamics appeared to be due to a density threshold for growth that was specific to both this particular ancestral strain and to growth on methanol.
capturing laboratory examples of transitions to and from growth at low density may help us understand the physiological and evolutionary forces that have led to the unusual properties of natural bacteria that have specialized to low-density environments such as the open ocean.
six of these populations failed to grow to the expected full density during the first couple transfers.
five of these populations recovered to full density soon after, but one population remained an order of magnitude smaller for over one hundred generations.
when tested at full density, this population had become less fit than its ancestor.
remarkably, the final cell number of six populations crashed to levels 60- to 400-fold smaller than their cohorts.
these results demonstrate surprisingly strong tradeoffs during adaptation to growth at low absolute densities that manifest over just a 16-fold change in density.
