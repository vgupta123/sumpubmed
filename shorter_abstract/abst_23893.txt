this suggests a strong involvement of antisense transcript expression in regulatory processes during b. napus seed development.
differential expression showed a shift from gene expression involved in diverse developmental processes including cell proliferation and seed coat formation at  <dig> dap to more focussed metabolic processes including storage protein accumulation and lipid deposition at  <dig> dap.
transcripts from  <dig>  genes were detected at two time-points of seed development,  <dig> days and  <dig> days after pollination .
the usefulness of this technique for detailed expression profiling in a non-model organism was demonstrated for the highly complex, neither fully sequenced nor annotated genome of b. napus by applying a tag-to-gene matching strategy based on brassica ests and the annotated proteome of the closely related model crucifer a. thaliana.
over both time-points,  <dig> % of the detected genes were matched by brassica ests identified by longsage tags in antisense orientation.
limits of tag detection for low-abundance transcripts can today be overcome by ultra-high throughput sequencing approaches, so that tag-based gene expression profiling may soon become the method of choice for global expression profiling in non-model species.
this study underlines the potential of transcript tagging approaches for gene expression profiling in brassica crop species via est matching to annotated a. thaliana genes.
serial analysis of gene expression  was applied for gene expression profiling in seeds of oilseed rape .
the most abundant transcripts at  <dig> dap were coding for diverse protease inhibitor proteins and proteases, including cysteine proteases involved in seed coat formation and a number of lipid transfer proteins involved in embryo pattern formation.
