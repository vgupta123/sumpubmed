in total, these studies focus attention on the worm intestine as a locus that influences longevity in the presence of an accumulating bacterial population.
we provide evidence that intestinal bacterial load, regulated by gut immunity, is an important causative factor of lifespan determination; the effects are specified by bacterial strain, worm genotype, and biologic age, all acting in concert.
we show that as adult worms age, several c. elegans genotypes show diminished capacity to control intestinal bacterial accumulation.
further studies defining the interplay between bacterial species and host immunity in c. elegans may provide insights into the general mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases.
as worms age, bacteria accumulate in the intestinal tract.
caenorhabditis elegans is particularly suited to studies of aging, since numerous single-gene mutations have been identified that affect its lifespan; it possesses an innate immune system employing evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways affecting longevity.
however, quantitative relationships between worm genotype, lifespan, and intestinal lumen bacterial load have not been examined.
to address this question, we evaluated the ability of worms to control bacterial accumulation as a functional marker of intestinal immunity.
we hypothesized that gut immunity is less efficient in older animals, leading to enhanced bacterial accumulation, reducing longevity.
