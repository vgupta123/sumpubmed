examples include finding sequences unique to a pathogen for probe-based infection diagnostics; reducing off-target hits for re-sequencing or genome editing; detecting sequence  insertions; and multiple substitution mutations.
however, there are several areas that would benefit from a more stringent definition of “unique”, requiring that these sub-sequences of length w differ by more than k mismatches  from any other sub-sequence, which we term the k-disjoint problem.
microtaboo implements a solution to the k-disjoint problem in an alignment- and assembly free manner.

we present microtaboo, a method that allows for efficient and extensive sequence mining of unique  sequences of up to  <dig> nucleotides in length.
on a number of simulated and real data sets ranging from microbe- to mammalian-size genomes, we show that microtaboo is able to efficiently find all sub-sequences of a specified length w that do not occur within a threshold of k mismatches in any other sub-sequence.
a common challenge in bioinformatics is to identify short sub-sequences that are unique in a set of genomes or reference sequences, which can efficiently be achieved by k-mer  counting.
since both sensitivity and specificity are critical, an exhaustive, yet efficient solution is desirable.
we exemplify that microtaboo has many practical applications, including point substitution detection, sequence insertion detection, padlock probe target search, and candidate crispr target mining.
