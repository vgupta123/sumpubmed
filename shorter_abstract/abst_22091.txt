our dataset provides a useful source of information on mirna regulation during the early development of cereal grains and our analysis suggests that mirnas contribute to the control of development of the cereal grain, notably through the regulation of phytohormone response pathways.
our data gave us evidence for an increase in mirna-mediated regulation during the transition between pre-storage and storage phases.
potential mirna targets were found in various signalling pathways including components of four phytohormone pathways  and the defence response to powdery mildew infection.
to investigate how mirna regulation contributes to this process in barley, a combination of small rna and mrna degradome analyses were used to identify mirnas and their targets.
our analysis identified  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> new mirnas together with  <dig> putative mirna target genes regulated through a slicing mechanism in grain tissues during the first 15â€‰days post anthesis.
during the early stages of seed development many genes are under dynamic regulation to ensure the proper differentiation and establishment of the tissue that will constitute the mature grain.
we also identified many potential mirnas including several belonging to known mirna families.
