for cells bearing the vγ2vδ <dig> t cell receptor, isoprenoid pyrophosphate stimulation leads to uniform activation and proliferation, but only a fraction of cells express cd <dig> and display potent cytotoxic activity against tumor cells.
for γδ t cells, cytotoxic effector function is acquired when cytotoxic precursors within the population are stimulated to proliferate and express cd <dig>  expression of cd <dig> defines a committed lineage to the cytotoxic phenotype.
public t cell receptor sequences found in the cd56+ subset from one individual might appear in the cd56- subset of another donor.
the commitment of individual clones to cd56+ or cd56- lineages was stable for each donor over a  <dig> year interval.
tracking individual cell clones defined by their vγ <dig> chain cdr <dig> region sequences, we found that cd <dig> was expressed on precursor cytotoxic t cells already present in the population irrespective of their capacity to proliferate after antigen stimulation.
