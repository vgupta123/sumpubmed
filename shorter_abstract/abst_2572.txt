each lineage contains significant phenotypic differences, with lineage i strains being the most commonly associated with human infections.
three genetic lineages of e. coli o157:h <dig> designated i, ii and i/ii have been identified using octamer-based genome scanning and microarray comparative genomic hybridization .
in this study an in silico comparison of six different genotyping approaches was performed on  <dig> e. coli genome sequences from  <dig> o157:h <dig> strains and single o145:nm and k <dig> mg <dig> strains to provide an overall picture of diversity of the e. coli o157:h <dig> population, and to compare genotyping methods for o157:h <dig> strains.
many approaches have been used to study the evolution, population structure and genetic diversity of escherichia coli o157:h7; however, observations made with different genotyping systems are not easily relatable to each other.
the results of this study highlight the similarities in relationships derived from multi-locus genome sampling methods and suggest a "common genotyping language" may be devised for population genetics and epidemiological studies.
future genotyping methods should provide data that can be stored centrally and accessed locally in an easily transferable, informative and extensible format based on comparative genomic analyses.
similarly, a clade of hyper-virulent o157:h <dig> strains implicated in the  <dig> spinach and lettuce outbreaks has been defined using single-nucleotide polymorphism  typing.
lineage i/ii/clade  <dig> strains clustered closest on the supernetwork to e. coli k <dig> and e. coli o55:h <dig>  o145:nm and sorbitol-fermenting o <dig> strains.
