libraries constructed from raw rna and wta samples averaged  <dig>  and  <dig>  expressed genes, respectively.
our goal was to investigate potential biological artifacts introduced through wta approaches by establishing comparisons between matched raw and amplified rna libraries derived from biological replicates.
here, we test the efficacy of nugen’s ovation rna-seq v <dig> system, which uses linear isothermal amplification with a unique chimeric primer for amplification, using white adipose tissue from standard laboratory rats .

rna-seq has enabled high-throughput gene expression profiling to provide insight into the functional link between genotype and phenotype.
we found that 93% of expressed genes were identical between all unamplified versus matched amplified comparisons, also finding that gene density is similar across all comparisons.
