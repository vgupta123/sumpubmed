we have performed a combined analysis of comparative genomics, proteomics and enzymology tests on seven aspergillus species grown on wheat bran and sugar beet pulp.
in general wheat bran gives higher induction of proteases than sugar beet pulp.
putative proteases were identified by homology search and pfam domains.
according to comparative genomics, proteomics and enzymatic experiments serine proteases make up the largest group in the protease spectrum across the species.
genomes of aspergillus species contain a similar proportion of protease encoding genes.
this property has made proteases the most important industrial enzymes by taking up about 60% of the total enzyme market.
microorganisms are the main sources for industrial protease production due to their high yield and a wide range of biochemical properties.
these genes were then clusters based on orthology and extracellular proteases were identified by protein subcellular localization prediction.
proteomics was used to identify the secreted enzymes in the cultures, while protease essays with and without inhibitors were performed to determine the overall protease activity per protease class.
several aspergilli have the ability to produce a variety of proteases, but no comprehensive comparative study has been carried out on protease productivity in this genus so far.
by combining in silico and wet-lab experiments, we present the intriguing variety of protease productivity in aspergilli.
interesting differences of protease activity, extracellular enzyme spectrum composition, protein occurrence and abundance were identified for species.
