in dna microarray experiments, discovering groups of genes that share similar transcriptional characteristics is instrumental in functional annotation, tissue classification and motif identification.
such a new perspective views biclusters with different patterns as hyperplanes in a high dimensional space, and allows us to handle different types of linear patterns simultaneously by matching a specific set of linear geometries.
we have shown that many common types of bicluster are just different spatial arrangements of hyperplanes in a high dimensional data space.
the experimental results on human lymphoma gene expression dataset show that our algorithm can find biologically significant subsets of genes.
moreover, most of these algorithms can only detect a restricted set of bicluster patterns.
the biclustering process is interpreted as the detection of linear geometries in a high dimensional data space.
however, most existing biclustering algorithms are based on searching for sub-matrices within a data matrix by optimizing certain heuristically defined merit functions.
as a particular realization of our framework, we have implemented a hough transform-based hyperplane detection algorithm.
an implementation of the geometric framework using the fast hough transform for hyperplane detection can be used to discover biologically significant subsets of genes under subsets of conditions for microarray data analysis.
the linear coherent model that unifies the seemingly incompatible additive and multiplicative bicluster models.
this geometric viewpoint also inspires us to propose a generic bicluster pattern, i.e.
