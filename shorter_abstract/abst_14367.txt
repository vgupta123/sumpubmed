evaluating beneficial effects of potential protective therapies following cardiac arrest in rodent models could be enhanced by exploring behavior and cognitive functions.
behavioral testing with the morris water maze in sprague–dawley rats  resuscitated after 8 min of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest was carried out  <dig> and 12 weeks after cardiac arrest  and compared to results of naïve rats .
memory recall was impaired early after 8 min of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest and might be a more valuable tool for cognitive testing than learning recall after global ischemia due to cardiac arrest.
even 12 weeks after cardiac arrest, the single p values showed that the control animals displayed a trend to perform better than the resuscitated animals.
seven days later , control group animals remained significantly longer in the target sector compared to every other sector, whereas the cardiac arrest group animals did not.

in the probe trial 24 h after the last trial, time spent in the target sector  within each group was significantly longer  than in each of the three other sectors  but with no significantly differences between groups.
the morris water maze is a well-known cognitive paradigm to test spatial learning and memory.
