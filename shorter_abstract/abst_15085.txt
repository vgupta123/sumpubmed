this technique was applied to six m. tuberculosis isolates prepared within the same laboratory over a two-week period of time.
the application of mst has been demonstrated to serve as a rapid and efficient method to investigate cases of possible cross-contamination with m. tuberculosis.
we herein investigate such episode of cross-contamination by using a technique known as multispacer sequence typing .
the ability to culture mycobacterium tuberculosis from clinical specimens serves as the gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
mst analysis indicated a unique and common sequence profile between a strain isolated from a patient with proven pulmonary tuberculosis and a strain isolated from a patient diagnosed with lung carcinoma.
using this approach, we were able to provide a clear demonstration of laboratory cross-contamination within just four working days.
