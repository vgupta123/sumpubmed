evolutionary rate analyses highlighted branches and sites with positive selection signatures, including two sites shown to be critical for insecticidal activity.
among these, ag <dig> , showed an unexpectedly high insecticidal activity.
the availability of high-quality genomic resources for several fabaceae species, among which the model species medicago truncatula , allowed for a genomic analysis of this protein family aimed at i) deciphering the evolutionary history of a1b proteins and their links with a1b-nodulins that are short non-insecticidal disulfide-bonded peptides involved in root nodule signaling and ii) exploring the functional diversity of a1b for novel bioactive molecules.
investigating the mtr genome revealed a remarkable expansion, mainly through tandem duplications, of albumin <dig>  genes, retaining nearly all of the same canonical structure at both gene and protein levels.
phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ancestral molecule was most probably insecticidal giving rise to, among others, a1b-nodulins.
