the first phylogenomic study of copepoda provides new insights into taxonomic relationships and represents a valuable resource that improves our understanding of copepod evolution and their wide range of ecological adaptations.
copepoda has a close affinity to the clade of malacostraca and thecostraca but not to branchiopoda.
however, this study reveals surprising differences with the majority of the copepod phylogenies and unexpected similarities with postembryonic characters and earlier proposed morphological phylogenies; more precisely, cyclopoida is more closely related to siphonostomatoida than to harpacticoida which is likely the most basally-branching group of podoplea.
this study attempted to resolve phylogenetic relationships among and within four major copepod orders including harpacticoida and the phylogenetic position of copepoda among five other crustacean groups  using  <dig> nuclear protein-coding genes.
copepods play a critical role in marine ecosystems but have been poorly investigated in phylogenetic studies.
in particular, the phylogenetic position of the order harpacticoida is still ambiguous and inconsistent among studies.
until now, a small number of molecular studies have been done using only a limited number or even partial genes and thus there is so far no consensus at the order-level.
