here we report that separated centrioles that migrate from the cell pole are very mobile during cytokinesis and their movements can be characterized as 1) along the nuclear envelope, 2) irregular, and 3) along microtubules forming the spindle axis.
it has been postulated that termination of cytokinesis  depends on the migration of a centriole to the intercellular bridge and then back to the cell center.
in cytokinesis, when the cleavage furrow has been formed, the two centrioles in each daughter cell separate.
to investigate the involvement of centrioles in cytokinesis, we monitored the movements of centrioles in three mammalian epithelial cell lines, hela, mcf 10a, and the p53-deficient mouse mammary tumor cell line kp- <dig> , by time-lapse imaging.
centriole movement towards the intercellular bridge was only seen occasionally and was highly cell-line dependent.
these findings show that centrioles are highly mobile during cytokinesis and suggest that the repositioning of a centriole to the intercellular bridge is not essential for controlling abscission.
we suggest that centriole movements are microtubule dependent and that abscission is more dependent on other mechanisms than positioning of centrioles.
