the genome-wide tss and promoter maps along with the extended genome annotation of b. japonicum represent a valuable resource for future systems biology studies and for detailed analyses of individual non-coding transcripts and orfs.
guided by proteomics evidence, previously identified tsss and tsss experimentally validated here, we assign a score threshold to flag 14Â % of the mapped tsss as a class of lower confidence.
a specialized machine learning procedure for tss recognition allowed us to map  <dig>  tsss:  <dig>  in free-living bacteria,  <dig> in symbiosis with soybean and  <dig> in both conditions.
we performed drna-seq of bradyrhizobium japonicum usda  <dig>  the nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, and developed algorithms to map tsss and promoters.
further, we provide proteomic evidence for  <dig> proteins, among them  <dig> proteins corresponding to new genes and  <dig> proteins with n-termini different from the existing annotation .
however, using drna-seq data to map transcriptional start sites  and promoters genome-wide is a bioinformatics challenge.
mapped tsss and putative promoters, proteomic evidence and updated gene annotation were combined into an annotation file.
