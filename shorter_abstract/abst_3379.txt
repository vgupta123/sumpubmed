repetitive sequences are the major components of the eukaryotic genomes.
the resultant clones showed cross hybridization only with buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomic dna.
rsai repeats are transcriptionally active in somatic tissues and spermatozoa.
real time pcr, detected ~ <dig> Ã—  <dig> copies of pdp <dig>  ~  <dig> copies of pdp <dig> and pdp <dig> and ~  <dig> of pdp <dig> in buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomes, respectively.
the data suggest that rsai repeats have been incorporated into the exonic regions of various transcribing genes, possibly contributing towards the architecture and evolution of the buffalo and related genomes.
upon characterization, these fragments were found to represent retrotransposons and part of some functional genes.
association of these repeats with transcribing sequences and their regulation in buffalo bubalus bubalis has remained largely unresolved.
we cloned and sequenced rsai repeat fragments pdp <dig>  pdp <dig>  pdp <dig>  pdp <dig> of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> base pairs, respectively from the buffalo, bubalus bubalis.
fluorescence in situ hybridization showed repeats to be distributed all across the chromosomes.
