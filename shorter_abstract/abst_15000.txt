gene ontology  characterizes and categorizes the functions of genes and their products according to biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, facilitating interpretation of data from high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies.
here we present a fda go tool named gene ontology for functional analysis .
with goffa, the user can dynamically interact with the go data to interpret gene expression results in the context of biological plausibility, which can lead to new discoveries or identify new hypotheses.
goffa is available through arraytrack software
the go path simultaneously displays the ranks that order goffa tree paths based on statistical analysis.
goffa provides five interactive functions  to analyze the go data.
