iec- <dig> cells were cultured for  <dig> hours in serum free media , with and without various insulin-like growth factor agonists to differentially boost the basal rate of proliferation.
we hypothesized that iec- <dig> cells spontaneously diverge towards a uniform mixture of epigenetic fates, with corresponding phenotypes, rather than persist as a single progenitor lineage.
a strategy was employed to identify constitutive genes as markers of divergent fates through gene array analysis by cross-referencing fold-change trends for individual genes against crypt cell abundance in each treatment.
the most common fate switch that we were able to detect correlates with a down regulation of the apc gene and transformation into an adenoma-like phenotype.
in addition, a small subset of cells expressed the serotonin receptor 2a gene and had neuroendocrine-like morphology.
the majority of iec- <dig> cells in sfm alone had a loss in expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli  gene at the mrna and protein levels, consistent with adenoma-like transformation.
