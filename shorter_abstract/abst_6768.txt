snps identified in this study to cause non-synonymous amino acid substitutions can also be utilized to directly identify causal genes in association studies.
a total of  <dig>  putative amino acid variants were located in  <dig>  protein-coding genes, which were predicted to have enriched binding and catalytic activity as a result.
recently, identifying genome-wide snps in allopolyploid brassica napus  by resequencing many accessions has become feasible, due to the availability of reference genomes of brassica rapa  and brassica oleracea , which are the progenitor species of b. napus .
although many snps in b. napus have been released, the objective in the present study was to produce a larger, more informative set of snps for large-scale and efficient genotypic screening.
hence, short-read genome sequencing was conducted on ten elite b. napus accessions for snp discovery.
a total of  <dig>  bi-allelic snps were discovered throughout the b. napus genome.
despite the polyploid nature of b. napus, nearly  <dig>  simple snps were identified by whole genome resequencing.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most common type of genetic variation.
hence, the development of a much larger genotyping array of informative snps is feasible.
