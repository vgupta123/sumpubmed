in the present study we analyzed the effects of leishmania  amazonensis cpb cooh-terminal extension-derived peptides on cell cultures from murine strains with distinct levels of susceptibility to infection: balb/c, highly susceptible, and cba, mildly resistant.
predicted epitopes, obtained by in silico mapping, displayed the ability to induce cell proliferation and expression of cytokines related to th <dig> and th <dig> responses.
experimental leishmania infection in mice has been widely used in the identification of specific parasite virulence factors involved in the interaction with the host immune system.
based on our results, we consider that some peptides from the cpb cooh-terminal extension may influence host immune responses in the murine infection, thus helping leishmania survival.
leishmania parasites have been reported to interfere and even subvert their host immune responses to enhance their chances of survival and proliferation.
furthermore, we applied in silico simulations to investigate how the mhc/epitopes interactions could be related to the immunomodulatory effects on cytokines, finding evidence that specific interaction patterns can be related to in vitro activities.
