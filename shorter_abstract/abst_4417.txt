phosphate limitation increased the abundance of three different sets of proteins, suggesting that all three function in phosphate transport.
h <dig> limitation increased the abundance of a wide variety of proteins involved in methanogenesis.
we used high-coverage quantitative proteomics to determine the response of m. maripaludis to growth-limiting levels of h <dig>  nitrogen, and phosphate.
the global proteomic response of m. maripaludis to each nutrient limitation suggests a wider response than previously appreciated.
the results give new insight into the function of several proteins, as well as providing information that should contribute to the formulation of a regulatory network model.
in addition, the increased abundance of molybdate transport proteins suggested they function for nitrogen fixation.
nitrogen limitation increased known nitrogen assimilation proteins.
methanococcus maripaludis is a model for studies of the global response to nutrient limitations.
six to ten percent of the proteome changed significantly with each nutrient limitation.
