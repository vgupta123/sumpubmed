in this work, a structural bioinformatics approach was used to screen the protein data bank  for coplanar aromatic motifs similar to those found in known glycan-binding proteins.
based on the combined results, we propose that the putative binding site in pr-5d may be an evolutionary adaptation of solanaceae plants including potato, tomato, and tobacco, towards defense against cellulose-containing pathogens such as species of the deadly oomycete genus, phytophthora.
in addition to numerous binding sites predicted in structural genomics proteins of unknown function, one novel prediction was a surface motif  in the tobacco pathogenesis-related protein, pr-5d.
phylogenetic analysis revealed that the surface motif is exclusive to a subfamily of pr- <dig> proteins from the solanaceae family of plants, and is absent completely in more distant homologs.
more generally, the results demonstrate that coplanar aromatic clusters on protein surfaces are a structural signature of glycan-binding proteins, and can be used to computationally predict novel glycan-binding proteins from  <dig> d structure.
to confirm pr-5d's insoluble-polysaccharide binding activity, a cellulose-pulldown assay of tobacco proteins was performed and pr-5d was identified in the cellulose-binding fraction by mass spectrometry.
clusters of surface aromatic residues and their features may therefore be useful in distinguishing glycan-binding sites as well as predicting novel glycan-binding proteins.
the proteins identified in the screen were significantly associated with carbohydrate-related functions according to gene ontology  enrichment analysis, and predicted motifs were found frequently within novel folds and glycan-binding sites not included in the training set.
