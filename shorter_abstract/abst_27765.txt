the n-methyl-d-aspartate -type glutamate receptor expressed at excitatory glutamatergic synapses is required for learning and memory and is critical for normal brain function.
furthermore, the down-regulation of nmdar-mediated responses during synaptic depression is prevented by disruption of dynamin-dependent endocytosis.
at a cellular level, this receptor plays a pivotal role in triggering and controlling synaptic plasticity.
here we show that depression of synaptic transmission mediated by nmda receptors displays a state-dependence in its plasticity; nmda receptors are resistant to activity-induced changes at silent and recently-silent synapses.
once synapses transition to the active state however, nmda receptors become fully 'plastic'.
depending on the plasticity state in which a synapse currently resides, nmda receptors will either be available or unavailable for down-regulation.
endocytosis of nmda receptors would serve as a potent mechanism for metaplasticity.
such state-dependent regulation of nmdar endocytosis will provide fundamental control over downstream nmda receptor-dependent plasticity of neuronal circuitry.
