this study provides a framework which can guide functional analysis of epiplasmins, the major components of the membrane skeleton in ciliates.
when specific rnai experiments were conducted using sequences from either symmetric or asymmetric classes, phenotypes were drastic.
in either case, this results in aborted cell division.
the est data aid in this classification, in the identification of putative regulating sequences such as tata or caat boxes.
the sub-membranous skeleton of the ciliate paramecium, the epiplasm, is composed of hundreds of epiplasmic scales centered on basal bodies, and presents a complex set of proteins, epiplasmins, which belong to a multigenic family.
local effects show either disrupted or ill-shaped epiplasmic scales.
using structural features, we show that  <dig> epiplasmins are also present in another ciliate, tetrahymena thermophila.
depending on the sequential arrangement of their structural domains, the epiplasmins are defined as symmetric, asymmetric or atypical.
the repeated duplications observed in the p. tetraurelia genome present an interesting model of the organization and evolution of a multigenic family within a single cell.
to study this multigenic family, we used phylogenetic, structural, and analytical transcriptional approaches.
the phylogenetic method defines  <dig> groups of epiplasmins in the multigenic family.
their affiliation with the distinctive structural groups of paramecium epiplasmins demonstrates an interspecific multigenic family.
the epiplasmin multigenic family illustrates the history of genomic duplication in paramecium.
we show that this set of proteins handles an important developmental information in paramecium since maintenance of epiplasm organization is crucial for cell morphogenesis.
