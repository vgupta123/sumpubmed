the developed multiplex rt-pcr assay is recommended as an efficient tool for rapid confirmation of a presumptive cbpp diagnosis in a well-equipped laboratory environment.
the different sample types used were not equally suitable for mmmsc detection.
therefore we developed a novel taqmanÂ®-based real-time pcr assay comprising the amplification of two independent targets  and an internal exogenous amplification control in a multiplex reaction and evaluated its diagnostic performance with clinical samples.
the two rt-pcr tests proved to be the most sensitive methods and identified all  <dig> infected animals.
mycoides sc is the pathogenic agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia , the most important disease of cattle in africa causing significant economic losses.
the diagnostic performance of the assay was evaluated with clinical samples from  <dig> experimentally infected cattle and from  <dig> cattle without cbpp and compared to those of cultivation and a conventional pcr protocol.
the detection limit was determined to be  <dig> fg dna per reaction for the msc_ <dig> assay and  <dig> fg per reaction for the msc_ <dig> assay corresponding to  <dig> and  <dig> genome equivalents, respectively.
while  <dig> % of lung samples from the infected cohort were positively tested in the msc_ <dig> assay, only 81% of pulmonal lymph nodes, 31% of mediastinal lymph nodes and 25% of pleural fluid samples gave a positive result.
