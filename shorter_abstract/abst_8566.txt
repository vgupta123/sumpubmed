we have used this approach to identify such polymorphic sites within the bovine tlr <dig> genes from ten bos indicus and bos taurus cattle breeds.
by analysing tlr <dig> gene phylogeny in a set of mammalian species and a subset of ruminant species we have estimated the selective pressure on individual sites and domains and identified polymorphisms at sites of putative functional importance.
a final proof of their functional relevance requires further studies to determine their functional effect on the immune response after stimulation with relevant ligands and/or their association with immune related traits in animals.
his326gln is of particular interest as it consists of an exchange of differentially-charged amino acids at a position which has previously been shown to be crucial for ligand binding in human tlr <dig>
phylogeny based models of codon substitution based on estimates of Ï‰ for each amino acid position can therefore offer a valuable tool to predict sites of functional relevance.
three of them were localised at positions shaped by positive selection in the ruminant dataset  and in domains involved in the recognition of ligands.
this suggests that there have been functional changes during ruminant evolution.
however a comparison of the ruminant subset of tlr <dig> sequences with the whole mammalian set of sequences revealed that there has been less selective pressure among ruminants than in mammals as a whole.
polymorphic sites affecting tlr function should exhibit signatures of positive selection, identified as a high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions .
twenty newly-discovered non-synonymous polymorphic sites were identified in cattle.
