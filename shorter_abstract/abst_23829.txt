the branchmanager uses as its representative point the phylogenetic center of mass, a choice which has both intuitive and practical appeal.
as a consequence of the evolutionary process, data collected from related species tend to be similar.
other areas of potential impact include motif discovery and vaccine design.
in doing so, we devise a framework for comparison and introduce the concept of a representative point at which the average is situated.
this perspective leads to a new approach in which we define the average in terms of the phylogeny, using the data and a stochastic model to obtain a probability on evolutionary trajectories.
with the assumption that the data evolve according to a brownian motion process on the tree, we show that our evolutionary average can be computed as convex combination of the species data.
because our average is intrinsic to both the dataset and to the phylogeny, we expect it and its corresponding weighting scheme to be useful in all sorts of studies where interspecies data need to be combined.
we first solve the problem of summarizing data related by phylogeny, and we explain why an average should operate on the entire evolutionary trajectory that relates the data.
we compare the branchmanager to two other methods, demonstrating why it exhibits desirable properties.
thus, our approach, called the branchmanager, defines both an average and a novel taxon weighting scheme.
