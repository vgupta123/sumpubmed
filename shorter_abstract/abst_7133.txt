regulondb gene names are now based on those of ecocyc to avoid confusion due to gene names and synonyms, and the public releases of regulondb and ecocyc are henceforth synchronized to avoid confusion due to different versions.
we kindly obtained from the groups of uri alon and hong-wu ma the interactions they have added to enrich their public versions of the e. coli regulatory network.
escherichia coli is the model organism for which our knowledge of its regulatory network is the most extensive.
discrepancies have been corrected, annotations from this and other groups  have been added, making the regulondb and ecocyc databases the largest comprehensive and constantly curated regulatory network of e. coli k- <dig>
several groups have been using these curated data as part of their bioinformatics and systems biology projects, in combination with external data obtained from other sources, thus enlarging the dataset initially obtained from either regulondb or ecocyc of the e. coli k <dig> regulatory network.
public flat files are available providing direct access to the regulatory network interactions thus avoiding errors due to differences in database modelling and representation.
the regulatory network available in regulondb and ecocyc is the most comprehensive and regularly updated electronically-encoded regulatory network of e. coli k- <dig>
one hundred and fifty new interactions have been added to our databases as a result of this specific curation effort, in addition to those added as a result of our continuous curation work.
