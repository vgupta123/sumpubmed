in comparison with polya_svm  sites) while searching for pas-strong poly sites in human sequences, polyar had a significantly higher prediction sensitivity  and specificity  however, when a similar sort of search was conducted for pas-weak and pas-less poly sites, both programs had a very low prediction accuracy, which indicates that our knowledge about factors involved in the determination of the poly sites is not sufficient to identify such polyadenylation regions.
accurate prediction of the pre-mrna 3'-end cleavage/polyadenylation sites is important for defining the gene boundaries and understanding gene expression mechanisms.
we present a new classification of polyadenylation sites into three classes and a novel computer program polyar for prediction of poly sites/regions of each of the class.
mrna polyadenylation is an essential step of pre-mrna processing in eukaryotes.
polyar program with a stand-alone version for downloading is available at http://cub.comsats.edu.pk/polyapredict.htm.
these findings suggest that additional characteristics of such poly sites remain to be elucidated.
