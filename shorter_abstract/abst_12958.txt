the isolates exhibited the same pfge profile and a multidrug-resistant  phenotype to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and Î²-lactams.
the strains produced the ndm- <dig> carbapenemase and the blandm- <dig> gene was part of the variable region of a class  <dig> integron.
this is the first report on the emergence of an mdr strain of e.coli producing the ndm- <dig> mbl in italy.
