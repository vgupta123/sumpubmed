these wt-pico-derived data were compared to microarray results obtained with a labeled arna target generated by two rounds of in vitro transcription  of  <dig> ng of pan-neural rna.
microarray data sets from these samples were compared to a reference profile of all larval cells to identify transcripts with elevated expression in neurons.
dna microarrays provide a powerful method for global analysis of gene expression.
here we compare microarray results obtained with two different methods of rna amplification to profile gene expression in the c. elegans larval nervous system.
we show that two different methods of rna amplification, ivt and wt-pico, produce valid microarray profiles of gene expression in the c. elegans larval nervous system with a low rate of false positives.
wt-pico results in a higher fraction of present calls than ivt, a finding consistent with the proposal that dna-dna hybridization results in lower mismatch signals than the rna-dna heteroduplexes produced by ivt amplification.
these results were validated by the high proportion of known neuron-expressed genes detected in these profiles and by promoter-gfp constructs for previously uncharacterized genes in these data sets.
however, our results also show that each method of rna amplification detects a unique subset of bona fide neural-enriched transcripts and thus a wider array of authentic neural genes are identified by the combination of these data sets than by the microarray profiles obtained with either method of rna amplification alone.
only about half of these transcripts , however, are detected as enriched by both ivt and wt-pico amplification.
with its relative ease of implementation and greater sensitivity, wt-pico is the preferred method of amplification for cases in which sample rna is limiting.
together, the ivt and wt-pico methods identified  <dig>  unique neuron-enriched transcripts.
