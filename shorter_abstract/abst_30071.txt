the proposed optimized vectorization of the viterbi decoding algorithm was extensively evaluated and compared with the hmmer <dig> decoder to process dna and protein datasets, proving to be a rather competitive alternative implementation.
such optimization, together with an improved loading of the emission scores, allows the achievement of a constant processing throughput, regardless of the innermost-cache size and of the dimension of the considered model.
being always faster than the already highly optimized viterbifilter implementation of hmmer <dig>  the proposed cache-oblivious parallel simd viterbi  implementation provides a constant throughput and offers a processing speedup as high as two times faster, depending on the model’s size.
hmmer is a commonly used bioinformatics tool based on hidden markov models  to analyze and process biological sequences.
besides this alternative vectorization scheme, the proposed implementation also introduces a new partitioning of the markov model that allows a significantly more efficient exploitation of the cache locality.
one of its main homology engines is based on the viterbi decoding algorithm, which was already highly parallelized and optimized using farrar’s striped processing pattern with intel sse <dig> instruction set extension.
a new simd vectorization of the viterbi decoding algorithm is proposed, based on an sse <dig> inter-task parallelization approach similar to the dna alignment algorithm proposed by rognes.
