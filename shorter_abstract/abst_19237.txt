the crystal structures of five trmis from hyperthermophilic archaea and thermophilic or mesophilic bacteria have previously been determined, the optimal growth temperature of these organisms ranging from 37°c to 100°c.
the m1a <dig> modification has been shown to be essential for cell growth in yeast and for adaptation to high temperatures in thermophilic organisms.
our structural comparisons provide insight into the different molecular strategies used to achieve the tetrameric organization in order to maintain the enzyme activity under extreme conditions.
our analysis shows that bacterial enzymes from thermophilic organisms display additional intermolecular ionic interactions across the dimer interfaces, whereas hyperthermophilic enzymes present additional hydrophobic contacts.
the availability of crystal structures of trmis from mesophilic, thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms allows a detailed analysis of the architecture of this protein family.
moreover, as an alternative to two bidentate ionic interactions that stabilize the tetrameric interface in all other trmi proteins, the tetramer of the archaeal p. abyssi enzyme is strengthened by four intersubunit disulfide bridges.
in this study, we present a comparative structural analysis of these trmis, which highlights factors that allow them to function over a large range of temperature.
