using the validation scheme and anova, the factors contributing to the variance in normalized dna-microarray data were estimated.
the validation scheme thus allows determining conditions that could be improved to yield even higher dna-microarray data quality.
to this end, a novel and cost-effective validation scheme was devised, implemented, and employed.
there is a need for a quick and robust method to assess data quality and sources of errors in dna-microarray experiments.
a number of validation experiments were performed on lactococcus lactis il <dig> amplicon-based dna-microarrays.
day-to-day as well as experimenter-dependent variances were shown to contribute strongly to the variance, while dye and culturing had a relatively modest contribution to the variance.
clustering experiments showed that trends can be reliably detected also from genes with very low expression levels.
even in cases where  <dig> % of the data were kept for analysis and the experiments were performed under challenging conditions , the cv was at an acceptable  <dig> %.
