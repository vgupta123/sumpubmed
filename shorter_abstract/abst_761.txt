the present study depicted tissue-enriched novel transcripts, a tissue-specific isoform switch, and pathology-associated alternative splicing in a mouse model, suggesting tissue-specific genomic diversity and plasticity.
rna sequencing  has revolutionized the detection of transcriptomic signatures due to its high-throughput sequencing ability.
therefore, genomic annotations on different animal species have been rapidly updated using information from tissue-enriched novel transcripts and novel exons.
rt-pcr results indicated that expression of  <dig> and  <dig> novel transcripts were enriched in testes and liver, respectively, while  <dig> of the  <dig> selected novel exons were detected in the testes or heart.
the novel isoforms containing the identified novel exons exhibited more dominant expression than the known isoforms in heart and testes.
we also identified an example of pathology-associated exclusion of heart-enriched novel exons such as sorbs <dig> and cluh during pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy.
<dig> putative novel transcripts and  <dig> putative tissue-enriched exons were identified using rna-seq datasets representing six tissues available in mouse databases.
