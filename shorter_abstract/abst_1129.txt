the n-terminal and c-terminal dcx domains have undergone sub-specialization and divergence.
the sub-specialization of some members due to restricted expression patterns and sequence divergence may explain the successful addition of genes to this family throughout evolution.
sequence analysis combined with expression analysis is likely to be a useful tool to predict correlations between human disease and mouse models.
this study reveals the existence and conservation of multiple members of the dcx superfamily in different species.
its evolution was followed across vertebrates, invertebrates, and was traced to unicellular organisms, thus enabling following evolutionary additions and losses of genes or domains.
in addition, a novel co-expression analysis for most human and mouse dcx superfamily-genes was performed using high-throughput expression data extracted from unigene.
