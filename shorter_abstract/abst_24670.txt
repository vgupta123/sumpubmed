the newly isolated strain uva <dig> was identified as a pediococcus acidilactici by carbohydrate fermentation profile, growth at 50°c and 16s rdna sequencing.
we identified and characterised the first pediocin produced by a human intestinal pediococcus acidilactici isolate and successfully developed a new real-time pcr assay to show the large distribution of peda-containing strains in baby faecal samples.
in this work, we typed a new strain, co-isolated from baby faeces together with a bifidobacterium thermophilum strain, and characterized its proteinaceous compound with strong antilisterial activity.
the mrna transcript for peda could be detected in p. acidilactici uva <dig> but not in the cured derivative, confirming the expression of the peda-gene in uva <dig>  using a new real-time pcr assay, eleven out of seventeen human faecal samples tested were found to contain peda-dna.
bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria are commonly used as natural protective cultures.
the partially purified bacteriocin was heat resistant up to 100°c, active over a wide range of ph  and susceptible to proteolytic enzymes.
southern hybridization using the dig-labelled peda-probe established that the bacteriocin gene was plasmid-borne as for all pediocin described so far.
p. acidilactici uva <dig> harboured a  <dig> -kb plasmid that could be cured easily, which resulted in the loss of the antimicrobial activity.
the molecular weight, estimated by sds-page, was similar to that of pediocin ach/pa- <dig> .
