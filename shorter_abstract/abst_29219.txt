we introduce a gene regulatory network inference algorithm ennet, which reverse-engineers networks of transcriptional regulation from a variety of expression profiles with a superior accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
superior accuracy achieved on the three different benchmark data sets shows that ennet is a top contender in the task of network inference.
deciphering genome-wide networks that capture which transcription factors regulate which genes is one of the major efforts towards understanding and accurate modeling of living systems.
the proposed method relies on the boosting of regression stumps combined with a relative variable importance measure for the initial scoring of transcription factors with respect to each gene.
the regulation of gene expression by transcription factors is a key determinant of cellular phenotypes.
however, reverse-engineering the network from gene expression profiles remains a challenge, because the data are noisy, high dimensional and sparse, and the regulation is often obscured by indirect connections.
