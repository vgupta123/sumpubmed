corncyc contains on average  <dig>  transcripts per gene, while maizecyc contains almost no alternate splicing.
our results show that the quality of initial enzymatic function assignments primarily determines the quality of the final metabolic pathway resource.
as metabolic pathway resources become more commonly available, researchers have unprecedented access to information about their organism of interest.
two maize metabolic pathway resources for the b <dig> inbred line, corncyc  <dig>  and maizecyc  <dig> , are based on the same gene model set and were developed using pathway tools software.
we present an in-depth comparison between corncyc and maizecyc to demonstrate the effect of initial computational enzymatic function assignments on the quality and content of metabolic pathway resources.
therefore, biologists should pay close attention to the methods and information sources used to develop a metabolic pathway resource to gauge the utility of using such functional assignments to construct hypotheses for experimental studies.
these resources differ in their initial enzymatic function assignments and in the extent of manual curation.
maizecyc contains go annotations for over  <dig>  genes that corncyc is missing.
