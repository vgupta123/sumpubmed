indirect evidence points to at5g <dig> being responsible for low temperature-induced raf accumulation in arabidopsis leaves.
using two independent loss-of-function mutants for at5g <dig> , we confirm that this rs is indeed responsible for raf accumulation during low temperature-acclimation , as previously reported.
the sucrosylgalactoside oligosaccharide raffinose  accumulates in arabidopsis leaves in response to a myriad of abiotic stresses.
collectively our findings point to a single abiotic stress-induced rs isoform  being responsible for raf biosynthesis in arabidopsis leaves.
surprisingly, leaves of mutant plants also fail to accumulate any raf under diverse abiotic stresses including water-deficit, high salinity, heat shock, and methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress.
these results also unambiguously discount the existence of six stress-inducible rs isoforms suggested by recent reports.
conflicting reports suggest the existence of either one or six abiotic stress-inducible rss  occurring in arabidopsis.
correlated to the lack of raf under these abiotic stress conditions, both mutant plants lack the typical stress-induced rafs activity increase observed in the leaves of wild-type plants.
however, they do not support a single rs hypothesis since the seeds of both mutant plants still contained raf, albeit at  <dig> -fold lower concentration than seeds from wild-type plants, suggesting the existence of at least one other seed-specific rs.
