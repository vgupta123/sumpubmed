our approach also allows computational biologists to focus on developing and applying new methods instead of writing boilerplate infrastructure code.
high throughput sequencing has become an increasingly important tool for biological research.
however as high throughput sequencing is a rapidly evolving field, such static approaches lack the ability to readily adopt the latest advances and techniques which are often required by researchers.
this system streamlines data management and allows for rapid integration of novel algorithms.
