more than  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  have been identified in the genome of burkholderia mallei atcc  <dig>  as a demonstrated mechanism of phase variation in other pathogenic bacteria, these may function as mutable loci leading to altered protein expression or structure variation.
to determine if such alterations are occurring in vivo, the genomes of various single-colony passaged b. mallei atcc  <dig> isolates, one from each source, were sequenced from culture, a mouse, a horse, and two isolates from a single human patient, and the sequence compared to the published b. mallei atcc  <dig> genome sequence.
