the rate of ompc production increased after sucrose addition, which is comparable with literature results.
the model captures the basic features of the generally accepted view of envz-ompr signaling and is a reasonable starting point for building sophisticated models and explaining quantitative features of the system.
the relative porin production seems to be unaltered with changes in cell volume changes, atp, envz and ompr at low and high osmolarity conditions.
osmoregulation is one of the well-studied two component regulatory systems comprising of the sensor, envz and the cognate response regulator, ompr, which together control the expression of ompc and ompf porins in response to the osmolyte concentration.
in the case of low osmolarity, steady state production of ompf and repression of ompc was significant.
but the reach of saturation was rapid at high and low osmolarity with altered levels of the above components.
in this model we show that the steady state â€“ production of ompf is dramatically reduced in the high osmolarity medium.
it suggests that the regulation of ompf and ompc is a direct consequence of the level of omprp in the cell and is dependent on the way in which omprp interacts with ompf and ompc regulatory regions.
the preliminary simulation experiment indicates that both reaching steady state expression and saturation is delayed in the case of ompc compared to ompf.
a quantitative model of the osmoregulatory switch operative in escherichia coli was constructed by integrating the enzyme rate equations using e-cell system.
experimental analysis will help improve the model.
