to obtain the input features we employ information content method based on shannon's information theory, shapiro's score scheme, and markovian probabilities.
already many computational methods have been proposed for the detection of splice sites and some of them showed high prediction accuracy.
we also use a feature elimination scheme to reduce the less informative features from the input data.
accurate identification of splice sites in dna sequences plays a key role in the prediction of gene structure in eukaryotes.
in this study we propose a new feature based splice site detection method that shows improved acceptor and donor splice site detection in dna sequences when the performance is compared with various state of the art and well known methods.
in this paper we propose a hybrid algorithm which combines several effective and informative input features with the state of the art support vector machine .
