these interactions are highly dependent upon the pattern of sulfation modifications within the glycosaminoglycan chains.
here, we have employed both recombinant hsulf- <dig> and the native enzyme from conditioned medium of the mcf-7-breast carcinoma cell line.
we previously cloned a cdna encoding a novel human endosulfatase, hsulf- <dig>  which removes 6-o-sulfate groups on glucosamine from subregions of intact heparin.
our results show that the binding of vegf, fgf- <dig>  and certain chemokines  to immobilized heparin was abolished or greatly diminished by pre-treating the heparin with hsulf- <dig>  furthermore, hsulf- <dig> released these soluble proteins from their association with heparin.
our results validate sulf- <dig> as a new tool for deciphering the sulfation requirements in the interaction of protein ligands with heparin/hspgs and expand the range of potential biological activities of this enzyme.
a considerable body of evidence has established that heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans  interact with numerous protein ligands including fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor , cytokines, and chemokines.
heparin/heparan sulfate  proteoglycans are found in the extracellular matrix  and on the cell surface.
