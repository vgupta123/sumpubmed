after validation with functional snvs on the traits distributed by gaw <dig>  we conclude that it is valuable to consider structure/disorder tendencies while prioritizing and predicting mechanistic effects arising from novel genetic variations.
the result of experiments suggests that a significant change in the tendency of a protein region to be structured or disordered caused by snvs may lead to malfunction of such a protein and contribute to disease risk.
recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable genome-wide identification of novel nucleotide variations in a specific population or cohort.
using the exonic single nucleotide variations  identified in the  <dig>  genomes project and distributed by the genetic analysis workshop  <dig>  we systematically analysed the genetic and predicted disorder potential features of the non-synonymous variations.
