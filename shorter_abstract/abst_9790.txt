here we test the hypothesis that multiple mating is prevalent under such circumstances because it enhances female fitness.
our results, however, show that multiple mating yields benefits to females in the form of an increase in the production of f <dig>  the higher fecundity among multiply mated mothers was driven by greater production of sons but not daughters.
considered alongside previous work that female guppies can choose to mate with multiple partners, our results provide compelling evidence that direct fitness benefits underpin these mating decisions.
this benefit is achieved through an increase in fecundity in the first generation, rather than through other fitness correlates such as size at birth, growth rate, time to sexual maturation and survival.
however, contrary to expectation, individually, the offspring of multiply mated females do not grow at different rates than offspring of singly mated females, nor do any indirect fitness benefits or costs accrue to second-generation offspring.
