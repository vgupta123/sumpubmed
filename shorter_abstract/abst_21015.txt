we show that the core genes known from e. coli are consistently regulated in other species, and we identify previously unknown members of the regulon.
these include the cobalamin transporter, btub; all the genes involved in the methionine salvage pathway; as well as several enzymes and transporters of unknown specificity.
for instance, the metj regulon, which controls methionine biosynthesis and transport, has been studied almost exclusively in e. coli and salmonella, but homologs of metj exist in a variety of other species.
we have determined the likely composition of the metj regulon in all species which have metj homologs using bioinformatics techniques.
the metj regulon is present and functional in five orders of gammaproteobacteria: enterobacteriales, pasteurellales, vibrionales, aeromonadales and alteromonadales.
