in the present study, a screening of  <dig> a. niger strains and  <dig> assumed fumonisin producing fusarium strains from  <dig> species, showed that all  <dig> a. niger strains produced fb <dig> and  <dig> of  <dig> fusarium produced fumonisin b <dig> and other isoforms .
five a. niger and five fusarium spp.
a. niger had the highest production of fb <dig> at 25-30°c whereas fusarium spp.
addition of  <dig> -5% nacl, or 10-20% sucrose increased the fb <dig> production of a. niger, whereas addition of glycerol reduced fb <dig> production.
the present study shows that the regulation of fumonisin production is very different in a. niger and fusarium, and that food and feeds preserved by addition of sugar or salts may be good substrates for fumonisin b <dig> production by a. niger.
all three water activity lowering solutes reduced the fumonisin production of the fusarium species.
had the maximal production of fb <dig> and fb <dig> at 20-25°c.
fumonisins are economically important mycotoxins which until recently were considered to originate from only a few fusarium species.
