gene copy-number variation , which provides the raw material for the evolution of novel genes, is widespread in natural populations.
several lines of evidence suggest that these changes were adaptive:  copy-number changes reached high frequency or were fixed in a short time,  many independent populations harbored cnvs spanning the same genes, and  larger average size of cnvs in adapting populations relative to spontaneous cnvs.
we show that gene copy-number changes are a common class of adaptive genetic change.
due to the high rates of origin of spontaneous duplications and deletions, copy-number changes containing the same genes arose readily in independent populations.
multiple duplications and deletions rose to intermediate or high frequencies in independent populations.
duplications that reached high frequencies in these adapting populations were significantly larger in span.
the frequencies of cnvs in these populations were analyzed by oligonucleotide array comparative genome hybridization, quantitative pcr, pcr, dna sequencing across breakpoints, and single-worm pcr.
these results demonstrate the great potential borne by cnvs for evolutionary adaptation.
the latter is expected if larger cnvs are more likely to encompass genes under selection for a change in gene dosage.
