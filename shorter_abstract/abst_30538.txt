our findings will enhance a wide range of research and clinical applications, and in particular will aid in the discovery of genomic deletions in the absence of a priori knowledge of their existence.
here we use a graduated series of arabidopsis thaliana genomic deletion mutations  to optimize cgh-based genomic deletion detection.
oligonucleotide microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  offers an attractive possible route for the rapid and cost-effective genome-wide discovery of deletion mutations.
however, the power to detect small deletions is low.
