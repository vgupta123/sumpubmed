furthermore, saic identifies a number of novel scas in these copy number data that encompass tumor related genes and may warrant further studies.
here we introduce significant aberration in cancer , a new method for characterizing and assessing the statistical significance of recurrent cna units.
experimental results show that saic outperforms peer methods in terms of larger area under the receiver operating characteristics curve and increased detection power.
when compared with previously reported results, saic successfully identifies most scas known to be of biological significance and associated with oncogenes  or tumor suppressor genes .
somatic copy number alterations  in human genomes are present in almost all human cancers.
three main features of saic include:  exploiting the intrinsic correlation among consecutive probes to assign a score to each cna unit instead of single probes;  performing permutations on cna units that preserve correlations inherent in the copy number data; and  iteratively detecting significant copy number aberrations  and estimating an unbiased null distribution by applying an sca-exclusive permutation scheme.
we then apply saic to analyze structural genomic aberrations acquired in four real cancer genome-wide copy number data sets .
supported by a well-grounded theoretical framework, saic has been developed and used to identify scas in various cancer copy number data sets, providing useful information to study the landscape of cancer genomes.
systematic efforts to characterize such structural variants must effectively distinguish significant consensus events from random background aberrations.
we test and compare the performance of saic against four peer methods  on a large number of simulation datasets.
