the high frequency of retroposons in mammals implies that, by chance, such elements also insert into each other.
the efficiency of the new application is demonstrated by applying it to dimeric alu short interspersed elements  to derive a complete chronology of such elements in primates.
we use such activity patterns as a comparative tool to  delineate the historical rise and fall of retroposons and their relations to each other,  understand the retroposon-induced complexity of recent genomes, and  find selective informative homoplasy-free markers of phylogeny.
thousands of such directional, element-in-element insertions are found in present-day genomes.
