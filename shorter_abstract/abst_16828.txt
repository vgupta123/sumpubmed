our data suggests that the up-regulation of read-through rna chimeras in tumors is not random but causes regulatory effects on cellular mechanisms and may impact patient survival.
chimeric read-through rnas are transcripts originating from two directly adjacent genes  on the same dna strand.
2/ <dig> read-throughs were up-regulated: bc039389-gatm was higher expressed in rcc compared to benign adjacent kidney; klk4-krsp <dig> was expressed in 46/ <dig>  rccs, but rarely in normal tissue.
in cell lines, both read-throughs influenced molecular mechanisms  in a way that counteracted the effect of the respective parent transcript gatm or klk <dig>
