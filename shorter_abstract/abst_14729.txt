in addition, we discuss the potential of slowly evolving satdnas as phylogenetic markers.
however, some satdna families evolve more slowly and can be found in several related species.
scatter plots and statistical tests revealed a significant correlation between genetic distances for satdna and mitochondrial dna.
the vast majority of pdo <dig> sequences grouped according to species designation.
here, we analyzed the mode of evolution of the pdo <dig> satdna family of dolichopoda cave crickets.
non-coding satellite dna  usually has a high turn-over rate frequently leading to species specific patterns.
the evolutionary rate of the pdo <dig> satdna was estimated to be  <dig> - <dig> % per lineage per million years.
sliding window analyses showed species specific patterns of variable and conserved regions.
phylogenetic analyses using bayesian, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood approaches yielded largely congruent tree topologies.
