it will also facilitate nano-scale vesicle engineering and selective targeting of rnas of interest to these vesicles for gene therapy purposes.
their potential function as cis-acting elements targeting rnas to exosomes is proposed.
we investigated associations of the discovered motifs with other rna parameters.
sequence motifs targeting rna to the vesicles are currently unknown.
secreted rnas share specific sequence motifs that may potentially function as cis-acting elements targeting rnas to exosomes.
ab initio approach was applied for computational identification of potential rna secretory motifs in the primary sequences of exosome-enriched rnas .
secreted rnas were found to have almost twice shorter half-life times on average, in comparison with cytoplasmic rnas, and the occurrence of some erna-specific motifs significantly correlated with this erna feature.
they are postulated to be involved in cellâ€“cell communication and genetic reprogramming of their target cells.
discovery of these motifs will be useful for our understanding the roles of ernas in cell-cell communication and genetic reprogramming of the target cells.
