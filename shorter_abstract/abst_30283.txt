we simulated libraries with different levels of completeness , and recorded assignments  and their accuracy  under six criteria.
library completeness and the assignment criteria used have been proposed as critical factors affecting the accuracy of such assignments but have not been thoroughly investigated.
dna barcoding often correctly assigned sphingid moths to higher taxa when species matches were unavailable, suggesting that barcode reference libraries can be useful for higher taxon assignments long before they achieve complete species coverage.
we observed little difference  however, in the overall accuracy of the assignments between the lowest and highest levels of library completeness at the tribe and subfamily level.
our results suggest that when using a strict tree-based criterion for higher taxon assignment with dna barcodes, the likelihood of assigning a query a genus name incorrectly is very low, if a genus name is provided it has a high likelihood of being accurate, and if no genus match is available the query can nevertheless be assigned to a subfamily with high accuracy regardless of library completeness.
costa rican sphingids , a well-documented, diverse subset of the family, with each of the tribes and subfamilies represented were used as queries.
this effect was most sharply observed with libraries of the lowest completeness where, for example at the genus level, 32% of assignments were false positives with the liberal criterion versus < 1% when using the strict.
