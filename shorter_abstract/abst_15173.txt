we have developed a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  assay using taqman technology to quantify the amount of mouse tissue that is incorporated into human xenograft samples.
this variation may be influenced by tumor type, number of serial passages in vivo, and even which part of the tumor was collected and used in the assay.
xenograft samples used to test anti-cancer drug efficacies and toxicities in vivo contain an unknown mix of mouse and human cells.
this assay can be performed on aberrantly behaving human xenografts, samples used in bioinformatics studies, and periodically for tumor tissue frequently grown by serial passage in vivo.
the linearity and sensitivity of the assay is evaluated using serial dilutions of single species and heterogeneous dna mixtures.
we examined many xenograft samples at various in vivo passages, finding a wide variety of human:mouse dna ratios.
using a set of specially designed fluorescent probes provides species specificity.
evaluation of drug activity can be confounded by samples containing large amounts of contaminating mouse tissue.
