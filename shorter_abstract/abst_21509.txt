mfb-f <dig> cells can detect and quantify tgf-β in biological samples without prior enrichment of tgf-βs, and can detect biologically activated tgf-β in a cell co-culture system.
embryonic fibroblasts from tgfb1-/- mice were stably transfected with a reporter plasmid consisting of tgf-β responsive smad-binding elements coupled to a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene .
transforming growth factor-β  regulates key biological processes during development and in adult tissues and has been implicated in many diseases.
to study the biological functions of tgf-β, sensitive, specific, and convenient bioassays are necessary.
mfb-f <dig> cells can be used to rapidly and specifically measure tgf-β with high sensitivity.
