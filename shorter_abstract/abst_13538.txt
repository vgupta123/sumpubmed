we present a new form of targeted anti-cancer therapy in the form of targeted drug-carrying phage nanoparticles.
these results define targeted drug-carrying filamentous phage nanoparticles as a unique type of antibody-drug conjugates.
systemic administration of chemotherapeutic agents, in addition to its anti-tumor benefits, results in indiscriminate drug distribution and severe toxicity.
we show that targeting of phage nanomedicines via specific antibodies to receptors on cancer cell membranes results in endocytosis, intracellular degradation, and drug release, resulting in growth inhibition of the target cells in vitro with a potentiation factor of > <dig> over the corresponding free drugs.
the results of the proof-of concept study presented here reveal important features regarding the potential of filamentous phages to serve as drug-delivery platform, on the affect of drug solubility or hydrophobicity on the target specificity of the platform and on the effect of drug release mechanism on the potency of the platform.
our approach is based on genetically-modified and chemically manipulated filamentous bacteriophages.
the phages are loaded with a large payload of a cytotoxic drug by chemical conjugation.
in the presented examples we used anti erbb <dig> and anti ergr antibodies as targeting moieties, the drug hygromycin conjugated to the phages by a covalent amide bond, or the drug doxorubicin conjugated to genetically-engineered cathepsin-b sites on the phage coat.
