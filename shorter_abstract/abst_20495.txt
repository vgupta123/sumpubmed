intensive screening of publicly available trypanosomatid genomes, combined with manual folding analyses, allowed the isolation of putatively pr77-hallmarks with hdv-like ribozyme activity.
these hdv-like ribozymes are widely distributed within retrotransposons across trypanosomatid genomes.
l1tc in trypanosoma cruzi is one of the elements in which such a ribozyme is located.
these results are consistent with the previously suggested common phylogenetic origin of the elements that belong to this clade, although in some cases loss of functionality appears to have occurred and/or perhaps molecular domestication by the host.
indeed, in leishmania spp, the pervasive presence of these hdv-like ribozyme-containing mobile elements in certain 3′-untranslated regions of protein-coding genes has been linked to mrna downregulation.
it can even form part of the pool of mrna 3′-untranslated regions, particularly in leishmania spp.
hepatitis delta virus -like ribozymes have recently been found in many mobile elements in which they take part in a mechanism that releases intermediate rnas from cellular co-transcripts.
