interestingly, many of these were associated with species and genera which are not typically associated with bacteriocin production.
in silico-based approaches to identify novel gene clusters are now also being utilised to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being generated by next generation sequencing technologies.
each of the identified gene clusters were manually annotated and potential bacteriocin-associated genes were evaluated.
multiple bacteriocin gene clusters were identified in a dataset representative of the human gut microbiota.
more specifically, the bacteriocin genome-mining tool bagel <dig> was used to identify potential bacteriocin producers in the genomes of the git subset of the human microbiome projectâ€™s reference genome database.
the human gut microbiota comprises approximately  <dig> trillion microbial cells which significantly impact many aspects of human physiology - including metabolism, nutrient absorption and immune function.
this suggests that targeted manipulation or shaping of the gut microbiota, by bacteriocins and other antimicrobials, has potential as a therapeutic tool for the prevention or treatment of these conditions.
