a striking example concerns the supergroup rhizaria, which comprises several groups of uncultivable free-living protists such as radiolarians, foraminiferans and gromiids, as well as the parasitic plasmodiophorids and haplosporids.
<dig> genes were selected for phylogenetic analyses based on the representation of at least one rhizarian species for each gene.
the position of this clade within rhizaria was sensitive to the method employed and the taxon sampling: maximum likelihood  and bayesian analyses using empirical model of evolution favoured an early divergence, whereas the cat model and ml analyses with fast-evolving sites or the foraminiferan species reticulomyxa filosa removed suggested a derived position, closely related to gromia and phytomyxea.
in contrast to what has been previously reported, our analyses also uncovered the presence of the rhizarian-specific polyubiquitin insertion in acantharea.
it was enabled through the application of a recently developed method of transcriptome analysis, requiring very small amount of starting material.
finally, this work reveals another possible rhizarian signature in the 60s ribosomal protein l10a.
our study illustrates the potential of this method to elucidate the early evolution of eukaryotes by providing large amount of data for uncultivable free-living and parasitic protists.
to address this, we have generated large expressed sequence tag  datasets for  <dig> species of rhizaria belonging to  <dig> important groups: acantharea , phytomyxea  and gromiida .
