to investigate gc- <dig> specificity, we solved crystal structures and performed molecular dynamics simulations of both isoforms complexed with gc- <dig>  crystal structures reveal that, in trα arg <dig> is observed in multiple conformations, an effect triggered by the differences in the interactions between gc- <dig> and ser <dig> or the corresponding asparagine  of trβ.
molecular dynamics support this model: our simulations show that the multiple conformations can be observed for the arg <dig> in trα, in which the ligand interacts either strongly with the ligand or with the ser <dig> residue.
our analysis suggests that the key factors for gc- <dig> selectivity are the presence of an oxyacetic acid ester oxygen and the absence of the amino group relative to t <dig>  these results shed light into the β-selectivity of gc- <dig> and may assist the development of new compounds with potential as drug candidates to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and obesity.
therefore, β-selective thyromimetics have been developed as promising drug-candidates for treatment of obesity and elevated cholesterol level.
