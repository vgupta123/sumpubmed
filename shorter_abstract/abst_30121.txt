genomic and transcriptomic sequence data are essential tools for tackling ecological problems.
functional annotation categories were assigned to homologous clusters using the functional annotation of nematostella vectensis.
using an approach that combines next-generation sequencing, de novo transcriptome assembly, gene annotation and synthetic gene construction, we identify and cluster the protein families from favia corals from the northern red sea.
using the proteome of the sea anemone nematostella vectensis as a reference, we were able to annotate almost 20% of each dataset using reciprocal homology searches.
here we present a study to identify the homologous transcript isoform clusters from the transcriptome of favia corals using a far-related reference proteome.
