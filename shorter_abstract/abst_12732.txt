however, gut permeability, colonic serotonin levels and the colonic levels of the cytokines il- <dig>  inf-Î³, il- <dig> and il- <dig> were higher in dnbs-treated than in untreated mice.
importantly, mice treated with either f. prausnitzii or its sn exhibited significant decreases in intestinal permeability, tissue cytokines and serotonin levels.
the importance of this intestinal microbiota is highlighted when a disruption of the intestinal ecosystem equilibrium appears  leading to an illness status, such as inflammatory bowel diseases .
here, we report the beneficial effects of f. prausnitzii in the physiological changes induced by a chronic low-grade inflammation in a murine model.
chronic low-grade inflammation and gut dysfunction were induced in mice by two episodes of dinitro-benzene sulfonic acid  instillations.
our results show that f. prausnitzii and its sn had beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial barrier impairment in a chronic low-grade inflammation model.
these observations confirm the potential of this bacterium as a novel probiotic treatment in the management of gut dysfunction and low-grade inflammation.
the effects of f. prausnitzii strain a2- <dig> and its culture supernatant  were then investigated.
no significant differences were observed in classical inflammation markers confirming that inflammation was subclinical.
markers of inflammation, gut permeability, colonic serotonin and cytokine levels were studied.
indeed, the reduction of the commensal bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii  has been correlated with several diseases, including ibd, and most importantly, it has been shown that this bacterium has anti-inflammatory and protective effects in pre-clinical models of colitis.
