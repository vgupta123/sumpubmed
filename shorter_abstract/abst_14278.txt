substantial improvements in convergence time and statistical quality of results can be achieved by applying fluxomer variables and the fia algorithm to compute best-fit solutions to mfa models.
analysis of isotope labeling experiments using this set of variables results in a non-convex optimization problem that suffers from both implementation complexity and convergence problems.
these composite variables combine both fluxes and isotopomer abundances, which results in a simply-posed formulation and an improved error model that is insensitive to isotopomer measurement normalization.
the ability to perform quantitative studies using isotope tracers and metabolic flux analysis  is critical for detecting pathway bottlenecks and elucidating network regulation in biological systems, especially those that have been engineered to alter their native metabolic capacities.
this article addresses the mathematical and computational formulation of 13c mfa models using a new set of variables referred to as fluxomers.
