cystic echinococcosis, which is caused by echinococcus granulosus, is one of the most widespread zoonotic helminth diseases that affects humans and livestock.
the present study extended the existing proteomic data of e. granulosus and provides further information regarding host-parasite interactions and survival mechanisms.
in this study, we performed proteomic analysis to identify excretory/secretory products  and antigenic proteins of e. granulosus adult worms using two-dimensional electrophoresis, tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight , and western blotting of sera from infected dogs.
the results of this study contribute to vaccination and immunodiagnoses for e. granulosus infections.
this study identified  <dig> es product spots corresponding to  <dig> different proteins and  <dig> antigenic protein spots corresponding to  <dig> different proteins.
six antigenic proteins were identified for the first time.

dogs, which harbor adult worms in their small intestines, are a pivotal source of e. granulosus infection in humans and domestic animals.
