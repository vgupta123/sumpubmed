alignment and orientation using ssr markers in common with existing b. rapa linkage maps allowed ten linkage groups to be identified, designated a01-a <dig>  the total length of the linkage map was  <dig>  cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent marker loci.
pcr-based insertion/deletion  markers were developed by re-sequencing the two parental lines.
taken together with the previously available linkage maps,  <dig> scaffolds were anchored on to the chromosomes and the total coverage of the genome was  <dig> %.
the multinational b. rapa genome sequencing project  was launched in  <dig>  in  <dig>  next generation sequencing technology was used to sequence the b. rapa genome.
this study concerns the construction of a reference genetic linkage map for brassica rapa, forming the backbone for anchoring sequence scaffolds of the b. rapa genome resulting from recent sequencing efforts.
using the developed linkage map,  <dig> scaffolds were anchored on to the chromosomes, encompassing more than  <dig> % of the b. rapa genome.
one hundred and nineteen doubled haploid  lines derived from microspore cultures of an f <dig> cross between a chinese cabbage  dh line  and a rapid cycling inbred line  were used to construct the linkage map.
the development of this linkage map is vital for the integration of genome sequences and genetic information, and provides a useful resource for the international brassica research community.
the lengths of linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm for a <dig> and a <dig>  respectively.
