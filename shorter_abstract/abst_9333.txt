this is due to its simplicity and reasonable level of accuracy.
the experimental results illustrate its performance and usefulness over other clustering methods.
a matlab package of this method  is provided at the web-link http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/ims/med_sci_math/.
in many biological/genetic analyses, such as genome-wide association study  analysis or multi-omics data analysis, it is required to cluster the plethora of data into sub-categories to understand the subtypes of populations, cancers or any other diseases.
on mll datasets, siml achieved highest clustering accuracy and rand score on 4/ <dig> cases; similarly on srbct dataset, it got for 3/ <dig> cases; on all subtype it got highest clustering accuracy for 5/ <dig> cases and highest rand score for 4/ <dig> cases.
many other clustering methods, including support vector clustering, have been developed in the past, but do not perform well with the biological data, either due to computational reasons or failure to identify clusters.
in this paper, considering the nature of biological data, we proposed a maximum likelihood clustering approach using a stepwise iterative procedure.
