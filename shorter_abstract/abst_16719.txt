the prediction of transcription factor binding sites is difficult for many reasons.
rexspecies  <dig> filters predictions of transcription factor binding sites and generates a set of figures displaying them in evolutionary context.
more specifically, it uses position specific scoring matrices to search for motifs that specify transcription factor binding sites.
identification of transcription factor binding sites of particular functional importance is left to expert filtering.
our tool is designed to analyze transcription factor binding site predictions considering their common pattern of occurrence, highlighting their evolutionary history.
thus, filtering methods are needed to enrich for biologically relevant  matches in the large amount of computational predictions that are frequently generated from promoter sequences.
rexspecies  <dig> interacts with genome browsers to enable scientists to filter predictions together with other sequence-related data.
