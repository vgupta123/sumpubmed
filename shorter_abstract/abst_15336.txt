lactobacillus rhamnosus gr- <dig>  is a probiotic bacterial strain found in both the intestinal and urogenital tracts, and has immunomodulatory effects on several cell types including macrophages.
the tlr <dig> ligand lipoteichoic acid activated all mitogen-activated kinases, akt and nf-κb; whereas, gr- <dig> selectively activated extracellular regulated kinases and p <dig>  nf-κb and akt, but not c-jun n-terminal kinases  in a tlr2-dependent manner.
different species and strains of probiotic bacteria confer distinct immunological responses on immune cells.
a secreted heat-labile protein-like molecule, 30–100 kda in size, induced the preferential production of g-csf.
the toll-like receptor  2/6-agonist pam2csk <dig>  tlr2/1-agonist pam3csk <dig> and tlr4-agonist lipopolysaccharide induced all of these inflammatory cytokines at high levels .
using specific inhibitors, we demonstrated that lack of jnks activation by gr- <dig> caused inefficient production of pro-inflammatory cytokines but not g-csf production.
