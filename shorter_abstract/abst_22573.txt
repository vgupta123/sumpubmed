the clone, a <dig>  was found to have high affinity  and good specificity for seb, showing no cross reactivity to related molecules such as staphylococcal enterotoxin a , staphylococcal enterotoxin d , and shiga toxin.
the anti-seb sdab a <dig> was found to have a high affinity and an extraordinarily high tm and could still refold to recover activity after heat denaturation.
most remarkably, this anti-seb sdab had an extremely high tm of 85°c and an ability to refold after heating to 95°c.
the ability of these small antigen-binding molecules to refold after heating to achieve their original structure, as well as their diminutive size, makes them attractive candidates for diagnostic assays.
camelids and sharks possess a unique subclass of antibodies comprised of only heavy chains.
the sharp tm determined by circular dichroism, was found to contrast with the gradual decrease observed in intrinsic fluorescence.
