physical protein-protein interaction  is a critical phenomenon for the function of most proteins in living organisms and a significant fraction of ppis are the result of domain-domain interactions.
we tested our hypothesis by compiling exon shuffling and ppi data from six eukaryotic species: homo sapiens, mus musculus, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, cryptococcus neoformans and arabidopsis thaliana.
for all four metazoan species, genes enriched in exon shuffling events presented on average higher vertex degree  in ppi networks.
thus, we hypothesized that exon shuffling could have a significant influence in shaping the topology of ppi networks.
