the reliable detection of indels is still a challenging problem, especially for variants that are longer than a few bases.
indels represent the second most frequent class of variants in the human genome, after single nucleotide polymorphisms.
we have developed a set of algorithms and heuristics collectively called indelminer to identify indels from whole genome resequencing datasets using paired-end reads.
there are a number of mature software packages and associated pipelines that can identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  with a high degree of concordance.
indelminer can be used effectively to identify indels in whole-genome resequencing projects.
indelminer uses a split-read approach to identify the precise breakpoints for indels of size less than a user specified threshold, and supplements that with a paired-end approach to identify larger variants that are frequently missed with the split-read approach.
the discovery and mapping of genomic variants is an essential step in most analysis done using sequencing reads.
the output is provided in the vcf format along with additional information about the variant, including information about its presence or absence in another sample.
