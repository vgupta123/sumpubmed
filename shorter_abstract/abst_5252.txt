the primary vascular system, pycnoxylic-manoxylic secondary xylem with bordered pits on both tangential and radial walls of a tracheid and leaf trace divergence of yiduxylon suggest transitional features between the early spermatophytes and ancestral aneurophyte progymnosperms.
a narrow cortex consists of inner cortex without sclerotic nests and sparganum-type outer cortex with peripheral bands of vertically aligned sclerenchyma cells.
yiduxylon justifies the assignment to a new genus mainly because of the protostele with protoxylem strands only near the periphery of primary xylem ribs, leaf trace origination and petiolar vascular supply structure.
stems contain a small protostele with three primary xylem ribs possessing a single peripheral protoxylem strand.
two leaf traces successively arise tangentially from each primary xylem rib and they divide once to produce four circular-oval traces in the stem cortex.
four vascular bundles occur in two c-shaped groups at each petiole base with ground tissue and peripheral bands of sclerenchyma cells.
there remains great controversy over the anatomical differentiation of late devonian and carboniferous seed plant groups of buteoxylonales, calamopityales and lyginopteridales.
it is represented by stems, helically arranged and bifurcate fronds with two orders of pinnae and planate pinnules.
both secondary pinnae and pinnules are borne alternately.
it shares many definitive characters with calamopityales and lyginopteridales, further underscoring the anatomical similarities among early seed plants.
many ovules of late devonian  seed plants have been well studied.

nov. with seed plant affinities has been discovered in the upper devonian  tizikou formation of hubei province, china.
thick secondary xylem displays multiseriate bordered pitting on the tangential and radial walls of the tracheids, and has biseriate to multiseriate and high rays.
protostele evolution of these early spermatophytes needs more research.
