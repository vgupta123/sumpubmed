the two sequenced devil mhc haplotypes revealed three copy number variations that are likely to significantly affect immune response and suggest that future work should focus on the role of copy number variations in disease susceptibility in this species.
here we report the characterization of the genomic regions encompassing mhc class i and class ii genes in the tasmanian devil.
interestingly, when two haplotypes from two individuals were compared, three genomic copy number variants with sizes ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> kb were observed within the classical class i gene region.
<dig> genes and pseudogenes were identified, including five class i and four class ii loci.
one deletion is particularly important as it turns a class ia gene into a pseudogene in one of the haplotypes.
this deletion explains the previously observed variation in the class i allelic number between individuals.
dftd is caused by a clonal tumour cell line that is transmitted between unrelated individuals as an allograft without triggering immune rejection due to low levels of major histocompatibility complex  diversity in tasmanian devils.
four genomic regions approximately  <dig> kb in length were assembled and annotated using bac contigs and physically mapped to devil chromosome 4q.
the third sequenced marsupial mhc provides insights into the evolution of this dynamic genomic region among the diverse marsupial species.
the tasmanian devil  is currently under threat of extinction due to an unusual fatal contagious cancer called devil facial tumour disease .
