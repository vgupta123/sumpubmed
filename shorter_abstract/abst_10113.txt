their ancestral gene order indicates that the trna rearrangement event likely occurred after hepialoidea diverged from other lepidopteran lineages.
all three thitarodes species possess the ancestral gene order with trni-trnq-trnm located between the a + t-rich region and nad <dig>  which is different from the gene order trnm-trni-trnq in all previously sequenced lepidoptera species.
the anticodon of trns in t. renzhiensis and t. yunnanensis is ucu instead of the mostly used gcu in other sequenced lepidoptera mitogenomes.
the formerly identified conserved elements of lepidoptera mitogenomes  are absent in the thitarodes mitogenomes.
the mitogenomes of t. renzhiensis and t. yunnanensis exhibit unusual features compared with the previously determined lepidoptera mitogenomes.
characterization of the two ghost moth mitogenomes has enriched our knowledge of lepidoptera mitogenomes and contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mitogenome evolution, especially gene rearrangements.
to gain new insights into lepidoptera mitogenome evolution, we sequenced the mitogenomes of two ghost moths that belong to the non-ditrysian lineage hepialoidea and conducted a comparative mitogenomic analysis across lepidoptera.
the mitogenomes of thitarodes renzhiensis and t. yunnanensis are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp long with an a + t content of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.
compared with the ancestral insect gene order, these mitogenomes all contain a trna rearrangement.
both mitogenomes include  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> transfer rna genes,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes, and the a + t-rich region.
