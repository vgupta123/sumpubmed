our results indicate that using microarrays and a supervised machine learning approach to predict chemical toxicants, their potential toxicity and mechanisms of action is practical and efficient.
therefore, we developed a new feature selection algorithm called gradient method that had a relatively high training classification as well as prediction accuracy with the lowest overfitting rate of the methods tested.
we comprehensively compared various normalization of gene expression profiles, feature selection and classification algorithms for the classification of these  <dig> chemicals into <dig> compound classes.
svm recursive feature selection  had the highest overfitting rate when an independent dataset was used for a prediction.
choosing the right feature and classification algorithms for this multiple category classification and prediction is critical.
in this study, in vitro cultures of primary rat hepatocytes were exposed to  <dig> chemicals and vehicle controls, representing  <dig> compound classes.
here, we investigated the use of microarrays to predict chemical toxicants and their possible mechanisms of action.
analysis of biomarkers that distinguished the  <dig> classes of compounds identified a group of genes principally involved in cell cycle function that were significantly downregulated by metal and inflammatory compounds, but were induced by anti-microbial, cancer related drugs, pesticides, and pxr mediators.
we found that normalization had little effect on the averaged classification accuracy.
