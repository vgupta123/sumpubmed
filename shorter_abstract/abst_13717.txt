our study provided additional information for evolutionary studies and revealed potentially specific regulation of the control of redox status in hevea.
the results showed the most abundant size for mirnas to be  <dig> nucleotides, except for seven families.
by combining the learn pipeline, data from the plant microrna database  and hevea est sequences, we identified  <dig> conserved mirna families already characterized in other plant species, and  <dig> putatively novel mirna families.
in hevea brasiliensis, environmental and harvesting stresses are known to affect natural rubber production.
the two mirna class sizes were detected for both conserved and putative novel mirna families, suggesting their functional duality.
plants respond to external stimuli through fine regulation of gene expression partially ensured by small rnas.
deep sequencing of small rnas was carried out on plantlets subjected to severe abiotic stress using the solexa technique.
deep sequencing of small rnas combined with transcriptomic data is a powerful tool for identifying conserved and novel mirnas when the complete genome is not yet available.
they negatively regulate gene expression by targeting the cleavage or translational inhibition of target messenger rnas .

several mir genes produced both 20- <dig> nucleotides and 23- <dig> nucleotides.
mirna targets were computationally predicted and analysed.
