two test datasets from ligasite, each containing  <dig> bound and unbound structures, were used to predict binding regions using plb-save and two well-known prediction systems, sitehound and metapocket <dig>  .
prediction of protein binding regions on the protein surface assists in understanding the mechanisms and principles of molecular recognition.
plb-save outperformed the other programs with accuracy rates of  <dig> % for unbound proteins and  <dig> % for bound proteins via a tenfold cross-validation process.
additionally, because the parallel processing architecture was designed to enhance the computational efficiency, we obtained an average of 160-fold increase in computational time.
representative clusters and corresponding anchors were identified from all surface elements and were assigned according to the ranking of their solid angles.
in silico binding region prediction is considered the initial stage in structure-based drug design.
to improve the efficacy of biological experiments for drug development, we developed plb-save, which uses only geometrical features of proteins and achieves a good overall performance for protein-ligand binding region prediction.
here, we describe the novel software, plb-save, which uses parallel processing technology and is ideally suited to extract the geometrical construct of solid angles from surface atoms.
in addition, cavity depth indicators were obtained by proportional transformation of solid angles and cavity volumes were calculated by scanning multiple directional vectors within each selected cavity.
