in both cases, the most populated protein functional classes were those of proteins related to lipid metabolism and oxido-reductases.
sugarcane has been used as the main crop for ethanol production for more than 40Â years in brazil.
therefore, this work contributed to two goals: enlarge the coverage of the sugarcane cell wall proteome, and provide target proteins that could be used in future research to facilitate 2g ethanol production.
one possibility is the remodeling of cell walls, by means of genetic improvement or transgenesis, in order to make the bagasse more accessible to hydrolytic enzymes.
proteins were extracted from the cell walls of 2-month-old culms using two protocols, non-destructive by vacuum infiltration vs destructive.
the results highlighted the importance of using different protocols to extract proteins from cell walls to expand the coverage of the cell wall proteome.
ten ghs were indicated as possible targets for further studies in order to obtain cell walls less recalcitrant to deconstruction.
a predicted signal peptide was found in  <dig> different proteins, called cell wall proteins .
the proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics.
curiously, a single glycoside hydrolase  was identified using the non-destructive method whereas  <dig> ghs were found with the destructive one.
quantitative data analysis allowed the identification of the most abundant proteins.
we aimed at characterizing the cell wall proteome of young sugarcane culms, to identify proteins involved in cell wall biogenesis.
