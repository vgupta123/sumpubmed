it was found that a snp set derived from the mlst database on the basis of maximisation of simpsons index of diversity provided poor resolution and did not define groups concordant with the population structure as defined by eburst analysis of the mlst database.
streptococcus agalactiae ) is an important human pathogen, particularly of newborns.
this yielded a four member snp set that divides gbs into  <dig> groups that are concordant with the population structure.
this entailed use of the "not-n" bioinformatic algorithm that identifies snps diagnostic for groups of known sequence variants, together with an empirical process of snp testing.
the objective of this study was to develop a single nucleotide polymorphism  based method for assigning gbs isolates to multilocus sequence typing -defined clonal complexes.
accordingly, a different approach to snp identification was developed.
