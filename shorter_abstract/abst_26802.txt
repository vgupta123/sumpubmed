in order to validate our approach, we designed a simulation study.
based on all pathways available in the kegg database, we create test gene lists by randomly selecting pathway genes, removing these genes from the known pathways and adding variable amounts of noise in the form of genes not annotated to the pathway.
gene-set enrichment analysis is a commonly used and well established technique to test for the statistically significant over-representation of particular pathways.
this works by comparing interpro domain signatures of the candidate gene lists with domain signatures of gene sets derived from known classifications, e.g.
results based on simulation and data analysis show that domain based pathway enrichment analysis is a very sensitive method to test for enrichment of pathways in sparsely annotated lists of genes.
an r based software package domainsignatures, to routinely perform this analysis on the results of high-throughput screening, is available via bioconductor.
high-throughput technologies like functional screens and gene expression analysis produce extended lists of candidate genes.
we show that we can recover pathway memberships based on the simulated gene lists with high accuracy.
