we do this at two time points representing middle age  and old age  respectively, in three adult diets .
the results suggest that natural genetic variation for sr and lifespan can operate through similar transcriptional mechanisms as those of dietary restriction and life-extending mutations.
finally, we present lists of candidate markers of ageing and lifespan extension.
here, we characterise genome-wide expression patterns of a long-lived, natural variant of drosophila melanogaster resulting from selection for starvation resistance  and compare it with normal-lived control flies .
while studying long-lived mutants has advanced our understanding of the processes involved in ageing, the mechanisms underlying natural variation in lifespan and ageing rate remain largely unknown.
the stress-related genes, including those involved in proteolysis and cytochrome p <dig>  were generally higher expressed in sr flies and showed a smaller increase in expression with age compared to c flies.
the genes involved in reproduction showed a lower expression in middle-aged sr than in c flies and, unlike c flies, a lack of their downregulation with age.
we found profound differences between drosophila lines in their age-related expression.
our study unveils transcriptional changes associated with lifespan extension in sr drosophila.
further, we found that malnutrition strongly affected age-associated transcript patterns overriding the differences between the lines.
however, under less stressful dietary conditions, line and diet affected age-dependent expression similarly.
