hexuronic acids such as d-galacturonic acid and d-glucuronic acid can be utilized via different pathways within the metabolism of microorganisms.
this enzymatic reaction can be tracked continuously by applying a ph-shift assay.
one representative, the oxidative pathway, generates α-keto-glutarate as the direct link entering towards the citric acid cycle.
the developed ph-shift assay, using potassium phosphate and bromothymol blue as the ph indicator, enables a direct measurement.
the penultimate enzyme, keto-deoxy glucarate dehydratase/decarboxylase, catalyses the dehydration and decarboxylation of keto-deoxy glucarate to α-keto-glutarate semialdehyde.
cat and thermal stability was conducted in comparison with the known keto-deoxy glucarate dehydratase/decarboxylase from acinetobacter baylyi adp <dig>  the kinetic constants determined for a. baylyi were k
by establishing a ph-shift assay, an easy measurement method for keto-deoxy glucarate dehydratase/decarboxylase could be developed.
cat  <dig>  s− <dig>  the two new enzymes had a slightly lower catalytic activity  but showed a higher thermal stability than that of a. baylyi.
two new keto-deoxy glucarate dehydratases/decarboxylases  from comamonas testosteroni kf- <dig> and polaromonas naphthalenivorans cj <dig> were identified and expressed in an active form using escherichia coli arcticexpress.
the use of crude extracts did not interfere with the assay and was tested for wild-type landscapes for all three enzymes.
it can be used for measurements of the purified enzymes or using crude extracts.
