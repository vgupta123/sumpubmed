therefore we hypothesized that translational control provides a means to tune gene expression during parasite development in mammalian and fly hosts.
comparison with cultured bloodstream forms from another strain revealed stage-specific changes in gene expression that transcend strain and growth conditions.
genes with upstream orfs had lower mean translation efficiency, but no evidence was found for involvement of uorfs in stage-regulation.
about one-third of all cdss showed statistically significant regulation of protein production between the two stages.
while in vivo and in vitro derived bloodstream forms from different strains are more similar to one another than to procyclic forms, they showed many differences at both the mrna and protein production level.
ribosomal proteins were translated poorly, especially in animal-derived parasites.

ribosome profiling revealed that differences in the production of specific proteins in t. brucei bloodstream and procyclic forms are more extensive than predicted by analysis of mrna abundance.
trypanosoma brucei subspecies infect humans and animals in sub-saharan africa.
a disproportionate number of metabolic enzymes were up-regulated at the mrna level in procyclic forms, as were variant surface glycoproteins in bloodstream forms.
of these, more than two-thirds showed a change in translation efficiency, but few appeared to be controlled by this alone.
