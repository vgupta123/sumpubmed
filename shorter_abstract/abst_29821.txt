in the process, one must find the optimal intervention for every gene regulatory network compatible with the prior knowledge, which can be prohibitively expensive when the size of the network is large.
the experimental design method utilizes the concept of mean objective cost of uncertainty .
simulation results based on synthetic and real gene regulatory networks show that the proposed approximate method has close performance to that of the optimal method but at lower computational cost.
the proposed approximate method also outperforms the random selection policy significantly.
the authors have already proposed an optimal experimental design method based upon the objective for modeling gene regulatory networks, such as deriving therapeutic interventions.
in this paper, we propose a computationally efficient experimental design method.
a matlab software implementing the proposed experimental design method is available at http://gsp.tamu.edu/publications/supplementary/roozbeh15a/.
an accurate understanding of interactions among genes plays a major role in developing therapeutic intervention methods.
we then estimate the approximate expected remaining mocu at a lower computational cost using the reduced networks.
the optimal experiment to be conducted first is the one which leads to the minimum expected remaining mocu subsequent to the experiment.
the process of prioritizing biological experiments to reduce the uncertainty of gene regulatory networks is called experimental design.
gene regulatory networks often contain a significant amount of uncertainty.
