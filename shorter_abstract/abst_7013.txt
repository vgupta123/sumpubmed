in vivo localization studies revealed that pphsp <dig>  localized in cytosolic granules in the vicinity of chloroplasts under non stress conditions, suggesting possible distinct roles for this protein under stress and optimal growth.
numerous studies suggest a role for these proteins in stress tolerance by preventing stress-induced protein aggregation as well as by facilitating protein refolding by other chaperones.
using suppression subtractive hybridization, we isolated an abscisic acid-upregulated gene from p. patens encoding a  <dig> Â kda cytosolic class ii shsp.
our study provides the first direct genetic evidence for a role of a shsp in osmotic and salt stress tolerance, and supports a function for this protein particularly during the stress recovery stage of p. patens.
targeted disruption of both genes resulted in the inability of plants to recover from heat, salt and osmotic stress.

the product of this gene was shown to localize in cytosolic granules near the chloroplasts, suggesting a role for the protein in association with these organelles.
expression of the gene was maintained upon stress relief, suggesting a role for this protein in the recovery stage.
in this study we characterized the function of a shsp in abiotic stress tolerance in the moss physcomitrella patens, a model for primitive land plants.
plant small heat shock proteins  accumulate in response to various environmental stresses, including heat, drought, salt and oxidative stress.
pphsp <dig>  was also induced by salicylic acid, dithiothreitol  and by exposure to various stimuli, including osmotic and salt stress, but not by oxidative stress-inducing compounds.
