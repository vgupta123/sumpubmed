the arabidopsis seuss  gene encodes a transcriptional adaptor protein that is required for a diverse set of developmental events, including floral organ identity specification, as well as gynoecium, ovule and embryo development.
screening of m <dig> lines representing approximately  <dig>  m <dig> individuals identified mutations that enhance the seuss mutant phenotypic disruptions in ovules and gynoecia; here we describe the phenotype of the sum <dig> mutant and enhanced disruptions of ovule and gynoecial development in the seu sum <dig> double mutant.
