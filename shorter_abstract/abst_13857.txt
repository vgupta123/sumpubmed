the divergence time between the clades c. harmani-c. crossoptilon and c. mantchuricum-c. auritum is consistent with the uplift of the tibetan plateau during the tertiary pliocene.
the uplift of tibetan plateau is suggested to impact the divergence between c. harmani-c. crossoptilon clade and c. mantchuricum-c. auritum clade during the tertiary pliocene.
the ka/ks analysis showed that atp <dig> gene in the crossoptilon likely experienced a strong selective pressure in adaptation to the plateau environment.
atp <dig> gene in the crossoptilon species might have experienced a strong selective pressure for adaptation to the plateau environment.
the complete mitogenomes of c. harmani, c. mantchuricum and c. crossoptilon are  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, respectively, encoding a standard set of  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> ribosomal rna genes,  <dig> transfer rna genes, and a putative control region.
c. auritum and c. mantchuricum are more closely related genetically, whereas c. harmani is more closely related to c. crossoptilon.
c. auritum with c. mantchuricum and c. harmani with c. crossoptilon form two pairs of sister groups.
several studies have attempted to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the phasianidae, but many questions still remain unaddressed, such as the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among crossoptilon species.
here, we sequenced the entire mitogenomes of three crossoptilon species  to investigate their evolutionary relationship among crossoptilon species.
the genetic distance between c. harmani and c. crossoptilon is far less than the interspecific distance and is close to the intraspecific distance of crossoptilon, indicating that c. harmani is much more closely related to c. crossoptilon.
