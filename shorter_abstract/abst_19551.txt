this randomized triple-blind trial was designed to assess the impact of an anthelmintic treatment programme  comparing treated and placebo control populations of working donkeys, mules and horses in field conditions in morocco.
<dig> animals completed the full study,  <dig> in the treatment group and  <dig> in the control group.
animals in the treatment group had a significantly lower strongyle worm egg count and increased in body condition score compared to animals in the control group at each examination during the study period.
owners of animals in the treatment group reported improvement in health and work ability and a beneficial effect on pruritus during the early period of the study.
these differences in owner perception between treatment groups had disappeared in the latter stages of the study.
in particular, we assessed animal body weight and condition score, together with a questionnaire-based owner evaluation of number of subjective animal health parameters.
there may be beneficial consequences for the animal health and productivity.
this study demonstrated that a routine anthelmintic treatment programme of three treatments annually can have a significant effect on faecal worm egg count.
faecal worm egg count was also measured.
