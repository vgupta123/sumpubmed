we exploited this terminal wave of nephron production using both microarrays and rna-seq to serially evaluate gene transcript levels in the progenitors.
they also better define the sequence of events after induction and suggest mechanisms contributing to the rapid end of nephron production after birth in mice.
this strategy allowed us to define the changing gene expression states following induction and the onset of differentiation after birth.
these results demonstrate that six <dig> expression is not sufficient to suppress activation of genes associated with growth and differentiation of nephrons.
validation by in situ hybridization demonstrated that the markers were expressed in a subset of six <dig> expressing progenitors.
analysis of proliferation with a nucleotide analog demonstrated in vivo that entry into the s-phase of the cell cycle preceded increases in transcript levels of genetic markers of differentiation.
finally, the studies identified a third set of genes that provide indirect evidence of an altered cellular microenvironment of the multi-potential progenitors after birth.
