the data reported are important for better understanding of the role of opda-like enzymes in pathogenesis in bacterial infections.
characterisation of this protein may serve as a basis for the development of novel antibacterials based on specific inhibition of this peptidase activity.
the aim of this study was to investigate effects of inactivation of an oligopeptidase encoding gene opda gene of yersinia pseudotuberculosis on bacterial properties in vivo and in vitro, and to test dependence of the enzymatic activity of the respective purified enzyme on the presence of different divalent cations.
the results of this study provide valuable contribution to the investigation of bacterial peptidases in general, and that of metallo-oligopeptidases in particular.
unexpectedly, zn2+ showed stimulatory activity only at low concentrations, but inhibited the enzyme at higher concentrations.
in addition, we studied enzymatic properties of this enzyme after expression and purification from e. coli.
in contrast, co2+, ca2+ and mn2+ stimulated activity at all concentrations tested, whilst mg2+ revealed no effect on the enzyme activity at all concentrations used.
in this study we found that oligopeptidase opda of yersinia pseudotuberculosis is required for bacterial virulence, whilst knocking out the respective gene did not have any effect on bacterial viability or growth rate in vitro.
