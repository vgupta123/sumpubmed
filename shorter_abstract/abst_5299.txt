by enhancing support for internationalization, and moreover by simplifying the manual construction of sparql queries through the use of controlled-natural-language interfaces, we believe we have made some early steps towards simplifying access to semantic web resources.
we present sparql assist: a web application that addresses these issues by providing context-sensitive type-ahead completion during sparql query construction.

moreover, established best-practices and internationalization concerns dictate that the identifiers for ontological terms should be opaque rather than human-readable, which further complicates the task of synthesizing queries manually.
ontological terms are suggested using their multi-lingual labels and descriptions, leveraging existing support for internationalization and language-neutrality.
to ensure success, the semantic web must be easily available to all users, regardless of locale, training, or preferred language.
