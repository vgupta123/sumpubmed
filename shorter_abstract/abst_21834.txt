at necropsy, macroscopic lesions were recorded, and tissue samples were collected for mycobacterial culture, is <dig> real time pcr and histopathological examination.
macroscopic and histopathological lesions were detected in pigs infected with each subspecies, and bacterial growth and histopathological changes were demonstrated, also in samples from organs without gross pathological lesions.
the study shows that both subspecies were able to infect pigs.
in comparison, the maa isolate appeared to have a higher ability of intracellular replication in porcine macrophages compared to the mah isolate.
clinical isolates of each subspecies were administered perorally to ten domestic pigs, respectively.
the presence of live mycobacteria was also more pronounced in mah infected tonsils.
culturing was also performed on faecal samples collected at necropsy.
