for shotgun libraries, the use of both sequencing primers and deep coverage, combined with the use of random sequencing primer sites should partly compensate for even high error rates, although it may prove more difficult than previous thought to distinguish between low-frequency alleles and errors.
the main factors related to error are the presence of homopolymers, position in the sequence, size of the sequence and spatial localization in pt plates for insertion and deletion errors.
the pattern identified here calls for the use of internal controls and error-correcting base callers, to correct for errors, when available .
we obtained a mean error rate for  <dig> sequences of  <dig> %.
more importantly, the error rate is not randomly distributed; it occasionally rose to more than 50% in certain positions, and its distribution was linked to several experimental variables.
no single variable can account for the error rate distribution, but most of the variation is explained by the combination of all seven variables.
in  <dig>  for the older gs <dig> system based on experimental sequences.
