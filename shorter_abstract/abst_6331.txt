the expression of genes in two culex pipiens quinquefasciatus populations from florida with known differences in vector competence to west nile virus  were compared using high throughput sequencing.
this study suggests that ovary development is correlated to vector competence in two culex populations in florida.

based on the rnaseq data analysis, ovary development was compared across the populations and following wnv infection.
the more competent population for wnv  over expressed  <dig> genes and down regulated  <dig> genes, compared with the less competent population for wnv .
the functional analysis showed that the largest proportion of transcripts was included in the catalytic activity and transporter activity groups except for those in the unknown group.
interestingly, the up- regulated gene set contained most of the catalytic activity function and the down- regulated gene set had a notable proportion of transcripts with transporter activity function.
this result provides novel insight into the defense mechanism used by culex spp.
a total of  <dig>  transcripts were combined for comparison of expression differences between the two populations and  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed .
