the emerging rna-seq technology enables us to detect gene fusions and profile their features.
this tool can detect gene fusions, construct the structures of chimerical transcripts, and estimate their abundances.
to confirm the read alignment on both sides of a fusion point, we employed a new approach, “residual sequence extension”, which extended the short segments of the reads by aggregating their overlapping reads.
in addition, we estimated fusion abundance using the expectation-maximization algorithm with sparse optimization, and further adopted it to improve the detection accuracy of the fusion transcripts.
fusionq is a novel tool for fusion detection and quantification based on rna-seq data.
in this paper, we proposed a novel fusion detection tool, fusionq, based on paired-end rna-seq data.
using paired-end rna-seq data from breast cancer cell lines, fusionq detected both the previously reported and new fusions.
gene fusions, which result from abnormal chromosome rearrangements, are a pathogenic factor in cancer development.
some highly expressed fusion genes detected by fusionq are important biomarkers in breast cancer.
we also proposed a list of filters to control the false-positive rate.
simulation was performed by fusionq and another two stated-of-art fusion detection tools.
fusionq exceeded the other two in both sensitivity and specificity, especially in low coverage fusion detection.
