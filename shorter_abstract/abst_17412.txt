here we present chimpipe, a modular and easy-to-use method to reliably identify fusion genes and transcription-induced chimeras from paired-end illumina rna-seq data.
applied to  <dig> encode human rna-seq datasets, chimpipe identified  <dig> high confidence chimeras connecting the protein coding sequence of their parent genes.
cloning and sequencing of the three cases revealed several new chimeric transcript structures,  <dig> of which with the potential to encode a chimeric protein for which we hypothesized a new role.
chimeric transcripts are commonly defined as transcripts linking two or more different genes in the genome, and can be explained by various biological mechanisms such as genomic rearrangement, read-through or trans-splicing, but also by technical or biological artefacts.
benchmarking chimpipe together with four other state-of-the-art tools on this data showed chimpipe to be the top program at identifying exact junction coordinates for both kinds of datasets, and the one showing the best trade-off between sensitivity and precision.
other issues relate to simulated datasets restricted to fusion genes, real datasets with limited numbers of validated cases, result inconsistencies between simulated and real datasets, and gene rather than junction level assessment.
chimpipe combines discordant paired-end reads and split-reads to detect any kind of chimeras, including those originating from polymerase read-through, and shows an excellent trade-off between sensitivity and precision.
however outputs of different programs on the same dataset can be widely inconsistent, and tend to include many false positives.
in subsequent experiments, three out of four predicted chimeras, two of which recurrently expressed in a large majority of the samples, could be validated.
