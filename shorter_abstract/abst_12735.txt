the genome coverage of cnvrs in this study is  <dig> mb, which represents almost  <dig> % of the chicken genome.
detecting genetic variation is a critical step in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic diversity.
another type of variant, copy number variation , is emerging as a significant contributor to phenotypic variation in many species.
in particular large gene families such as the keratin gene family and the mhc show extensive cnv.
the average size of the cnvs detected was  <dig>  kb with the largest cnv, located on ggaz, being  <dig>  mb.
here we describe a genome-wide cnv study using array comparative genomic hybridization  in a wide variety of chicken breeds.
our results provide a valuable resource for the study of genetic and phenotypic variation in this phenotypically diverse species.
the chance that inter-specific cnvs fall into cnvrs detected in chicken is related to the evolutionary distance between the species.
