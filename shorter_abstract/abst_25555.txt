our results offer a framework in which to study the inversion median problem, faster algorithms to obtain good medians, and an approach to study characteristic events along an evolutionary path.
yet median-based approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction have been shown to be among the most accurate, especially in the presence of long branches.
in this paper, we formalize the problem of finding such sequences of inversions with what we call signatures and provide algorithms to find maximum cardinality sets of commuting and noninterfering inversions.
most existing approaches have used heuristics that attempt to find a longest sequence of inversions from one of the three permutations that, at each step in the sequence, moves closer to the other two permutations; yet very little is known about the quality of solutions returned by such approaches.
