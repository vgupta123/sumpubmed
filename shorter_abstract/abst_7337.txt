moving forward, these results suggest bioprocessing conditions which minimize exposure of chondrogenic cultures to fluid shear stress to avoid undesirable differentiation of the msc population.

given that environmental and bioprocessing parameters such as substrate stiffness, seeding densities, culture medium composition, and mechanical loading can result in undirected differentiation of the msc population, the objective of this study was to systematically investigate how hydrodynamic loading influences the differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  towards the osteochondral lineages both in the presence and absence of exogenous, inductive factors.
mesenchymal stem cells  are viewed as a having significant potential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies.
in the absence of exogenous supplementation, hydrodynamic loading had little effect on cell phenotype at either magnitude of stimulation.
this progression was enhanced by the presence of hydrodynamic loading, particularly under high shear conditions, but may point the chondrogenic cultures down a hypertrophic path toward osteogenesis reminiscent of endochondral ossification if tgf-β <dig> supplementation is insufficient.
