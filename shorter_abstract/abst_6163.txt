within the epithelium are ciliated sensory neurons, supporting cells, basal cells and microvillous cells, each of which is distinct in morphology and function.
arguably, the least understood, are the microvillous cells, a population of cells that are small in number and whose function is not known.
we show that the gfp-positive microvillous cells were morphologically diversified and scattered throughout the entire moe.
we provide morphological and immunocytochemical characterization of the trpm5-expressing microvillous cells in the main olfactory epithelium.
they did not immunoreact to antibodies that label cell markers and elements of the transduction pathways from olfactory sensory neurons and solitary chemosensory cells of the nasal cavity.
our data demonstrate that these cells are non-neuronal and in terms of chemosensory transduction do not resemble the trpm5-expressing olfactory sensory neurons and nasal solitary chemosensory cells.
here we examined the morphology and immunocytochemical properties of these microvillous-like cells using immunocytochemical methods.
the main olfactory epithelium  in the nasal cavity detects a variety of air borne molecules that provide information regarding the presence of food, predators and other relevant social and environmental factors.
we previously found that in a mouse strain in which the trpm <dig> promoter drives expression of the green fluorescent protein , a population of ciliated olfactory sensory neurons , as well as a population of cells displaying microvilli-like structures is labeled.
these cells immunoreacted to an antibody against trpm <dig>  confirming the expression of this ion channel in these cells.
