polyview-3d server features the pymol image rendering that provides detailed and high quality presentation of macromolecular structures, with an easy to use web-based interface.
thus, the polyview-3d server may become an important resource for researches and educators in the fields of protein science and structural bioinformatics.
we present a new tool for protein structure analysis, with the focus on annotation and visualization of protein complexes, which is an extension of our previously developed polyview web server.
the new server is available at .
by integrating the web technology with state-of-the-art software for macromolecular visualization, such as the pymol program, polyview-3d enables combining versatile structural and functional annotations with a simple web-based interface for creating publication quality structure rendering, as well as animated images for powerpointâ„¢, web sites and other electronic resources.
several examples of how polyview-3d can be used for structural and functional analysis in the context of protein-protein interactions are presented to illustrate the available annotation options.
for example, three dimensional  models help in exploring protein active sites and functional hot spots that can be targeted in drug design.
polyview-3d also provides a wide array of options for automated structural and functional analysis of proteins and their complexes.
