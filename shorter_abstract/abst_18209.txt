cluster  <dig> typical  and atypical  epec strains were characterized by the presence of oi- <dig> encoded genes and grouped together with  <dig> investigated ehec strains.
enterohaemorrhagic e. coli  can cause severe disease such as bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uraemic syndrome in humans.
ehec-plasmids, lee and non-lee effector genes have also been detected in some strains of enteropathogenic e. coli .
nle genes ent/espl <dig>  nleb and nlee , nlea, nlef and nleh1- <dig> , nleg5- <dig> and nleg6- <dig> , espk  and the ehec-plasmid encoded genes ehxa, espp, etpd and katp were searched in  <dig> typical and in  <dig> atypical enteropathogenic e. coli  strains.
the objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between ehec and epec for virulence genes encoded by genomic o-islands and by the ehec-plasmids.
the oi- <dig> encoded nleb gene was found to be most closely associated with cluster  <dig> strains and may serve as a diagnostic tool for the identification of virulent ehec and epec seropathotypes.
besides production of shiga toxins, the presence of lee  and non-lee  encoded effector genes harboured on o-islands oi- <dig>  oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> is associated with ehec virulence and their frequency in outbreaks.
ehec-plasmid, oi- <dig> and cp- <dig> associated genes showed only weak similarities with virulent cluster  <dig> ehec and epec strains.
typical and atypical epec each fall into two clusters.
atypical epec cluster  <dig> strains were characterized by serotypes related to ehec .
