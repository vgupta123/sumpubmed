in this paper we focus on the interpretation of logical values in terms of molecular concentrations.
this multi-functional behaviour is achieved by a) varying the meanings of inputs, and b) using branch predictions  to display a constrained output.
we describe the results of computational investigations of a novel circuit that is able to trigger specific differential responses depending on the input standard used.
a thorough computational study is performed, which provides valuable insights for the future laboratory validation.
