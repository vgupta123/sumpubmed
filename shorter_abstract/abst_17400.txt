a total of  <dig> proteins were identified from five age groups of worker bees,  <dig> of which were differentially expressed.
deps were identified among all the age groups, suggesting that changes in protein expression during hg ontogeny are concomitant with different states of worker development.
although generic protein composition of rj has been investigated, little is known about how age-dependent changes on hg secretion affect rj composition and their biological consequences.
in this study, we identified differentially expressed proteins  during hg development by using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification  labeling technique.
our approach demonstrates that hg experienced important changes in protein expression during its ontogenic development, which supports the secretion of proteins involved in diverse functions in adult workers beyond its traditional role in royal jelly production.
the results were validated by qpcr.
a total of  <dig> proteins were mapped to canonical signaling pathways found in the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , which were preferentially associated with metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.
most of the proteins contained in royal jelly  are secreted from the hypopharyngeal glands  of young bees.
