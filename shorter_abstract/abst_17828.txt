for the analysis all 16s sequences are blasted against the silva database.
there are two main approaches to metagenomics: amplicon sequencing, which involves pcr-targeted sequencing of a specific locus, often 16s rrna, and random shotgun sequencing.
several tools or packages have been developed for analyzing communities using 16s rrna sequences.
environmental samples are often studied using both targeted 16s rrna sequencing and random shotgun sequencing.
we describe an extension of the metagenome analysis tool megan, which allows one to analyze 16s sequences.
