map0261c is conserved in mycobacteria, showing a 95% amino acid identity in m. avium subspecies avium, 84% in m. intracellulare and 76% in m. bovis and m. tuberculosis.
ifn-γ production was measured from  <dig> naturally infected and  <dig> control cattle after peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were stimulated with a whole cell lysate  of m. avium subsp.
collectively, these results demonstrate that while the 19-kda protein from m. avium subsp.
to assess the humoral immune response to the 19-kda protein, sera from cattle with clinical johne's disease were used in immunoblot analysis.
paratuberculosis stimulates a humoral immune response and weak ifn-γ production in infected cattle, the elicited responses are not strong enough to be used in a sensitive diagnostic assay.
map0261c was cloned, expressed, and purified as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein  in escherichia coli.
paratuberculosis  19-kda lipoprotein as an immunomodulator in cattle with johne's disease, the gene encoding the 19-kda protein  was analyzed.
antibodies to the 19-kda protein were not observed in  <dig> of  <dig> control cows.
in order to evaluate the mycobacterium avium subsp.
