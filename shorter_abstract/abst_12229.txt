we found no differences in their short term upper thermal limit , similar to that of most organisms, or their lower thermal limit , higher than for most temperate insects and suggesting the absence of cryoprotectants.
in longer term tests  survival between 6-20째c was almost 100% for both species plus two outgroups of the same lineage, but all four died between 23-25째c, without significant differences between them.
one, troglocharinus fonti, is found in caves at 4-11째c in the ancestral pyrenean range.
the second, t. ferreri, inhabits the coastal area of catalonia since the early pliocene, and lives at 14-16째c.
our results suggest that species in this lineage have lost some of the thermoregulatory mechanisms common in temperate insects, as their inferred default tolerance range is larger than the thermal variation experienced through their whole evolutionary history.
caves offer an ideal model to test the adjustment of species to their surrounding temperature, as they provide homogeneous and simple environments.
a key question in evolutionary biology is the relationship between species traits and their habitats.
