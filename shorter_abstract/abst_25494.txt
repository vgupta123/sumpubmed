linkage maps are used to locate associations between genes and traits by breeders and geneticists.
we represent linkage maps as dendrograms and show that this has advantages in the comparison of different maps.
pergola can be used successfully to calculate linkage maps for diploid and polyploid species and outperforms existing tools.
we show that it creates correct linkage groups, marker orders and distances for simulated and real datasets.
a large share of agriculturally and horticulturally important plant species are polyploid.
we want to overcome this limitation and validate our results with simulation studies.
linkage map creation for polyploid species is not supported by standard tools.
