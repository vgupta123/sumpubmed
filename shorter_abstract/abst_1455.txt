using oro-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs collected from chickens experimentally exposed to the viruses we evaluated the effects of numerous aspects of sample collection and transport: 1) swab construction material , 2) transport media , 3) media volume , 4) transporting the swab wet in the vial or removing the swab prior to transport, or transporting the swab dry with no media, and 5) single swabs versus pooling  <dig> or  <dig> swabs per vial.
active and passive surveillance for avian influenza virus  and newcastle disease virus  is widespread in commercial poultry worldwide, therefore optimization of sample collection and transport would be valuable to achieve the best sensitivity and specificity possible, and to develop the most accurate and efficient testing programs.
using real-time rt-pcr , virus isolation  and commercial antigen detection immunoassays for aiv we observed statistically significant differences and consistent trends with some elements of sample collection and transport; media, dry transport and swab construction.
we observed that flocked and foam swabs were superior to non-flocked swabs, bhi media was better than pbs, and transporting swabs wet was better for virus recovery and detection than transporting them dry.
conversely, the number of swabs pooled  and whether the swab was removed prior to transport did not impact virus detection.
similarly, with ndv detection by both vi and rrt-pcr was not affected by the numbers of swabs collected in a single vial .
also, with both aiv and ndv, there was no observed difference in virus detection between pools of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> swabs.
