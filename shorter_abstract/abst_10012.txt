the mapkl package is accompanied with extra functionalities including  solid data import;  data sampling following a user-defined proportion;  preprocessing through several normalization and transformation alternatives;  classification with the aid of svm and performance evaluation;  network analysis of the significant genes , including degree of centrality, closeness, betweeness, clustering coefficient as well as the construction of an edge list table;  gene annotation analysis,  pathway analysis and  auto-generated analysis reporting.
mapkl is an open-source r/bioconductor package that implements the map-kl hybrid gene selection method.
here we present an r/bioconductor package that implements a hybrid gene selection method along with a bunch of functions to facilitate a thorough and convenient gene expression profiling analysis.
the advantage of this method is that selects a small number of gene exemplars while achieving comparable classification results to other well established algorithms on a variety of datasets and dataset sizes.
users are able to run a thorough gene expression analysis in a timely manner starting from raw data and concluding to network characteristics of the selected gene exemplars.
so far many algorithms have been proposed towards the detection of significant genes in microarray analysis problems.
besides, only some of those packages offer a complete suite of tools starting from initial data import and ending to analysis report.
several of those approaches are freely available as r-packages though their engagement in gene expression analysis by non-bioinformaticians is usually a frustrating task.
