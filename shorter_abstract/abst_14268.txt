the present work demonstrates the important roles of female mosquito infection rates from the previous season and climate factors  in dengue outbreaks.
female mosquitoes and seasons were strongly correlated with dengue cases.
the predictive power of the forecasting model-assessed by akaike’s information criterion , bayesian information criterion , and the mean absolute percentage error -is improved by including the new parameters for dengue outbreak prediction.
therefore, the dengue incidence trends provided by this model will assist the optimization of dengue prevention.
the time series analysis methodology, particularly arima and sarima, has been increasingly applied to the field of epidemiological research for dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and other infectious diseases.
incorporating these two factors in the model significantly improves the predictive power of dengue hemorrhagic fever forecasting models, as confirmed by aic, bic, and mape.

such drawbacks may consequently lower the predictive power for the outbreak.
the exclusive use of climate factors from similar locations decreases a model’s prediction power.
