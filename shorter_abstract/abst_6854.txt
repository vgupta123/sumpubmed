in this study, we report a method to magnify the effect of a single promoter by using a weak promoter-based selection system in transgenic rice.
the correlation between attenuated selection by a weak promoter and elevation of copy number and foreign gene expression was confirmed by using another relatively weak promoter from nopaline synthase .
the use of weak promoter derived selectable markers leads to a high t-dna copy number and then greatly increases the expression of the foreign gene.
techniques that enable high levels of transgene expression in plants are attractive for the commercial production of plant-made recombinant pharmaceutical proteins or other gene transfer related strategies.
the method described here provides an effective approach to robustly enhance the expression of heterogenous transgenes through copy number manipulation in rice.
however, in the resistant calli and regenerated transgenic plants selected by the use of tcup <dig>  the constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein  was dramatically increased as a result of the additive effect of multiple t-dna insertions.
the tcup <dig> promoter allowed the recovery of transformed rice plants and conferred tissue specific expression of the gus reporter, but was much weaker than the camv 35s promoter in driving a selectable marker for growth of resistant calli.
tcup <dig>  a fragment derived from the tobacco cryptic promoter , was tested for its activity in rice by fusion to both a Î²-glucuronidase  reporter and a hygromycin phosphotransferase  selectable marker.
