more efficient methods of controlling and detecting stiv infections are urgently needed.
these dna aptamers may thus be suitable antiviral candidates for the control of stiv infections.
we generated dna aptamers that bound stiv with a high level of specificity, providing an alternative means for investigating stiv pathogenesis, drug development, and medical therapies for stiv infection.

moreover, the selected aptamers inhibited stiv infection in vitro and in vivo, with aptamer qa- <dig> demonstrating the greatest protective effect against stiv and inhibiting stiv infection in a dose-dependent manner.
flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy of cell-aptamer interactions demonstrated that qa- <dig> was able to recognize both stiv-infected cells and tissues with a high level of specificity.
in this study, we generated eight single-stranded dna  aptamers against stiv using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment .
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and fluorescent localization showed that the selected aptamers had high binding affinity for stiv.
the aptamers formed representative stem-loop secondary structures.
