each of these tss is strongly homologous to a similar site in mouse chromosomal dna.
transcripts from tss i and ii are characterized by the presence of large and overlapping 5'-utr introns terminated at the same splice receptor site.
tss iii, located within  <dig> bp of the translational start codon, is upregulated by e2f <dig>  caat and nf-y binding elements.
transcription at tss ii is downregulated through the presence of adjacent consensus binding elements for interferon regulatory factors .
chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that irf- <dig> protein binds hpura promoter sequences at tss ii in vivo.
the viral infection alters the degree of splicing of the 5'-utr introns of tss ii transcripts.
viral infection alters not only the use of pura promoters but also the generation of different non-coding rnas from 5'-utrs of the resulting transcripts.
results provide evidence for a novel mechanism of transcriptional control by multiple promoters used differently in various tissues and cells.
purα is an evolutionarily conserved cellular protein participating in processes of dna replication, transcription, and rna transport; all involving binding to nucleic acids and altering conformation and physical positioning.
infection of nih 3t <dig> cells with mouse cytomegalovirus results in a rapid decrease in levels of mpura mrna and purα protein.
