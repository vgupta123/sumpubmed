these findings indicate that the capacity of neuromodulators to suppress network synchrony is constrained by slow-acting, reactive processes.
over the course of many hours, however, synchrony invariably reemerged, even when feedback was used to compensate for declining cholinergic efficacy.
importantly, cholinergic efficacy could be restored and preserved over extended time scales by periodically withdrawing cholinergic input.
using networks of cultured cortical neurons, acetylcholine microinjections and a novel closed-loop ‘synchrony-clamp’ system, we found that acetylcholine pulses strongly suppressed network synchrony.
network synchrony also reemerged following its initial suppression by noradrenaline, but this did not occlude the suppression of synchrony or its gradual reemergence following subsequent cholinergic input.
a multiplicity of neuromodulators and ultimately neuromodulator withdrawal periods might thus be necessary to cope with an inevitable reemergence of network synchrony.
