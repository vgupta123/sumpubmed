additional features are considered for the feature vector employed by the svm for classification as well: the addition of a single feature representing spike density is shown to notably improve classification results.
a non-standard implementation of an hmm, emission inversion, is used for improved classification.
a distinctive channel current blockade signal is created as individually "captured" dna molecules interact with the channel and modulate the channel's ionic current.
