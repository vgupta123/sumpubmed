the maximal syrinx width, height of the foramen magnum, length of cerebellar herniation and caudal cranial fossa volume increased over time.
chiari-like malformation  and syringomyelia is a neurological disease complex with high prevalence in cavalier king charles spaniels .
increased caudal cranial fossa volume may be associated with active resorption of the supraoccipital bone, which has previously been found in histology specimens from adult ckcs.
we hypothesise that active resorption of the supraoccipital bone occurs due to pressure from the cerebellum.
the results of this study suggest that syringomyelia progresses with time.
a retrospective morphometric analysis was undertaken in  <dig> ckcs with cm for which repeat magnetic resonance images were available without surgical intervention.
these findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis and variable natural clinical progression of cm and syringomyelia in ckcs.
the natural progression of this disease with time has not been described.
