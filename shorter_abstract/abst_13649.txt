the obtained results offer novel data on the systemic changes that are induced by the establishment of am symbiosis in the plant, and confirm the work hypothesis that am fungi may extend their influence from the root to the fruit.
mycorrhization has increased the amino acid abundance in the fruit from mycorrhizal plants, with glutamine and asparagine being the most responsive amino acids.
to this aim, a combination of phenological observations, transcriptomics  and biochemical analyses was used to unravel the changes that occur on fruits from micro-tom tomato plants colonized by the am fungus glomus mosseae.
this work investigated the influence of mycorrhization on the economically relevant part of the tomato plant, by analyzing its impact on the physiology of the fruit.
