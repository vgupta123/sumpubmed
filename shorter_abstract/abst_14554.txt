induction of anaesthesia caused a significant increase in heart rate, cardiac output and arterial co <dig> partial pressure and a decrease in mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate and ph.
subcutaneous premedication with medetomidine  was followed by iv administration of a mixture of  <dig>  Î¼g/ml sufentanil and  <dig>  mg/ml midazolam at a rate of  <dig>  ml/kg bw/h for anaesthetic induction.
tiva with sufentanil-midazolam provided smooth induction and recovery of anaesthesia in rabbits but with marked hypotension and respiratory depression, requiring mechanical ventilation.
following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained for  <dig> min with an infusion rate adjusted to supress the pedal withdrawal reflex.
anaesthesia was characterized by induction and recovery without excitation, with muscle relaxation, and absence of the pedal withdrawal reflex.
total intravenous anaesthesia  with drugs that provide cardiovascular stability and are rapidly metabolised could be of benefit for use in rabbits.
righting and pedal withdrawal reflexes were lost within  <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively.
