identifying disease gene from a list of candidate genes is an important task in bioinformatics.
the main strategy is to prioritize candidate genes based on their similarity to known disease genes.
results showed that the auc  values achieved by drs were comparable with ndos on most of the disease families.
when there are  <dig> candidate genes and  <dig> data sources, drs works more than  <dig> times faster than ndos.
we performed leave one out cross validation to compare it with n-dimensional order statistics  used in endeavour.
but drs worked much faster than ndos, especially when the number of data sources increases.
the weighted drs achieved significantly higher auc values than ndos.
the proposed drs algorithm is a powerful and effective framework for candidate gene prioritization.
in the framework of drs, we give different weights for different data sources.
if weights of different data sources are proper given, the drs algorithm will perform better.
