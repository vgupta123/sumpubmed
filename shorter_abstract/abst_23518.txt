bitter acids  are prenylated polyketides synthesized in lupulin glands of the hop plant  which are important contributors to the bitter flavour and stability of beer.
we used rna sequencing  to obtain the transcriptomes of isolated lupulin glands, cones with glands removed and leaves from high Î±-acid hop cultivars, and analyzed these datasets for genes involved in bitter acid biosynthesis including the supply of major precursors.
transcripts encoding all the enzymes of bcaa metabolism were significantly more abundant in lupulin glands, indicating that bcaa biosynthesis and subsequent degradation occurs in these specialized cells.
the biosynthetic pathway leading to bcaas in lupulin glands involves the plastidial enzyme, hlbcat <dig>  the mitochondrial enzyme hlbcat <dig> degrades bcaas as the first step in the catabolic pathway leading to branched chain-acyl-coas.
rna-seq analysis showed the gland-specific expression of the mep pathway, enzymes of sucrose degradation and several transcription factors that may regulate bitter acid biosynthesis in glands.
hlbcat <dig> is a plastidial enzyme likely involved in bcaa biosynthesis.
our analysis of the hop transcriptome significantly expands the genomic resources available for this agriculturally-important crop.
bitter acids are formed from acyl-coa precursors derived from branched-chain amino acid  degradation and c <dig> prenyl diphosphates from the methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathway.
we also measured the levels of bcaas, acyl-coa intermediates, and bitter acids in glands, cones and leaves.
branched-chain acyl-coas and bitter acids were present at higher levels in glands compared with leaves and cones.
this study provides evidence for the lupulin gland-specific biosynthesis of bcaas and prenyl diphosphates to provide precursors for the production of bitter acids.
phylogenetic analysis of the hop bcats and those from other plants showed that they group into distinct biosynthetic  and catabolic  clades.
