elymus nutans griseb., is an important alpine perennial forage of pooideae subfamily with strong inherited cold tolerance.
to get a deeper insight into its molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance, we compared the transcriptome profiling by rna-seq in two genotypes of elymus nutans griseb.
the dx-specific dehydrins may be promising candidates to improve cold tolerance.
the stronger transcriptional differentiation during cold stress in dx explains its better cold tolerance compared to gn.
qrt-pcr analysis of  <dig> genes confirmed the rna-seq results.
the identified fructan biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and dx-specific dehydrin-related genes may provide genetic resources for the improvement of cold-tolerant characters in dx.
our findings provide important clues for further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying cold stress responses in plants.
early cold responses involved numerous genes encoding transcription factors and signal transduction in both genotypes.
higher fold expressions of fructan, trehalose, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism-related genes were detected in dx.
the tolerant damxung  and the sensitive gannan  under cold stress.
the most significant transcriptomic changes in the later phases of cold stress are associated with oxidative stress, primary and secondary metabolism, and photosynthesis.
twenty-six hub genes played a central role in both genotypes under cold stress.

the ap2/erebp famliy of transcription factors was predominantly expressed in both genotypes.
