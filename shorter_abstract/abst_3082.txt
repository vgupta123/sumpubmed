pluripotent cells can be differentiated into many different cell types in vitro.
inhibition of brd4:histone h <dig> interaction by the bet domain inhibitor -jq <dig> in escs results in enhanced differentiation to the endodermal lineage, by disrupting the protein abundance dynamics.
together, our data demonstrate the fundamental role of brd <dig> in monitoring cell differentiation through its interaction with acetylated histone marks and disruption of brd <dig> may cause aberrant differentiation.
we observed dynamic changes of histone ptms including increased h3k <dig> methylation levels in agreement with previously reported results.
we observed that the protein levels of brd <dig> decreased upon differentiation together with global histone h <dig> acetylation.
genome-wide chip-seq mapping showed that brd <dig> and h <dig> acetylation are co-occupied in the genome, upstream of core pluripotency genes such as oct <dig> and nanog in escs and lineage-specific genes in embryoid bodies .
recent genome-wide studies have identified the distribution of different histone-post-translational modifications  in various conditions and during cellular differentiation.
here, we present a quantitative and comprehensive study of the abundance levels of histone ptms during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells  using mass spectrometry .

however, our understanding of the abundance of histone ptms and their regulatory mechanisms still remain unknown.
