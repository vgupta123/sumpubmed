rgg is an open source project licensed under the lesser general public license  and can be downloaded freely at
r is the leading open source statistics software with a vast number of biostatistical and bioinformatical analysis packages.
guis are generated in runtime from defined gui tags that are embedded into the r script.
rgg consists of an xml-based gui definition language and a java-based gui engine.
the rgg project further includes the development of a web-based repository for rgg-guis.
rgg files can be developed using any text editor.
the current version of rgg is available as a stand-alone software  and as a plug-in for jgr.
rgg aims to abstract the gui development from individual gui toolkits by using an xml-based gui definition language.
