the inheritance of atps, apr and the related 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase  are remarkable, with multiple origins in the lineages that comprise the opisthokonts, different isoforms in chlorophytes and streptophytes, gene fusions with other enzymes of the pathway, evidence a eukaryote to prokaryote lateral gene transfer, changes in substrate specificity and two reversals of cellular location of host- and endosymbiont-originating enzymes.
to obtain an insight into the evolution of the sulfate assimilation pathway in eukaryotes and relationships of the differently compartmentalized isoforms we determined the locations of the pathway in lineages for which this was unknown and performed detailed phylogenetic analyses of three enzymes involved in sulfate reduction: atp sulfurylase , adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase  and sulfite reductase .
whilst they shed light on the origin of some characterised novelties, such as a recently described novel isoform of apr from bryophytes and the origin of the pathway active in the mitochondria of euglenids, the many distinct and novel isoforms identified here represent an excellent resource for detailed biochemical studies of the enzyme structure/function relationships.
the sulfate assimilation pathway is present in photosynthetic organisms, fungi, and many bacteria, providing reduced sulfur for the synthesis of cysteine and methionine and a range of other metabolites.
our results reveal a complex history for the enzymes of the sulfate assimilation pathway.
in photosynthetic eukaryotes sulfate is reduced in the plastids whereas in aplastidic eukaryotes the pathway is cytosolic.
