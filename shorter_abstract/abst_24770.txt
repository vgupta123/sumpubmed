in addition, both attenuation of receptor palmitoylation  and inhibition of cholesterol synthesis  impaired receptor signaling, possibly by decreasing receptor homodimerization and gαi <dig> coupling; this was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence colocalization and fluorescence resonance energy transfer  analyses.
our findings suggest that this interaction contributes to oprm <dig> signaling by facilitating receptor homodimerization and g protein coupling.
we sought to investigate whether a similar phenomenon could be observed with μ-opioid receptor , and if so, to assess the role of cholesterol in this class of g protein-coupled receptor  signaling.
a computational model of the oprm <dig> homodimer structure indicated that a specific cholesterol-palmitoyl interaction can facilitate oprm <dig> homodimerization at the tmh4-tmh <dig> interface.
c <dig>  was determined to be the palmitoylation site of oprm <dig>  mutation of this cys to ala did not affect the binding of agonists, but attenuated receptor signaling and decreased cholesterol associated with the receptor signaling complex.
we demonstrate that c <dig>  is the palmitoylation site of oprm <dig> and identify a cholesterol-palmitoyl interaction in the oprm <dig> complex.
this conclusion is supported by computational modeling of the oprm <dig> homodimer.
a cholesterol-palmitoyl interaction has been reported to occur in the dimeric interface of the β2-adrenergic receptor crystal structure.
