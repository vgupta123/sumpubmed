we have constructed  <dig> disruption vectors to target genes of unknown function, highly conserved between dictyostelium and human, but absent from the genomes of s. cerevisiae and s. pombe.
disruption constructs were amplified by pcr and the products were directly transformed in dictyostelium cells.
development of the post-genomic age in dictyostelium will require the existence of rapid and reliable methods to disrupt genes that would allow the analysis of entire gene families and perhaps the possibility to undertake the complete knock-out analysis of all the protein-coding genes present in dictyostelium genome.
the selection of homologous recombination events was also performed by pcr.
here we present an optimized protocol based on the previously described construction of gene disruption vectors by in vitro transposition.
