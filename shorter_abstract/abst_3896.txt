we develop a statistical model for the analysis of beta values that is derived from a bivariate gamma distribution for the signal intensities m and u. by allowing for possible correlations between m and u, the proposed model explicitly takes into account the data-generating process underlying the calculation of beta values.
the proposed model contributes to an improved identification of associations between beta values and covariates such as clinical variables and lifestyle factors in epigenome-wide association studies.
the analysis of dna methylation is a key component in the development of personalized treatment approaches.
a common way to measure dna methylation is the calculation of beta values, which are bounded variables of the form m/ that are generated by illumina’s 450k beadchip array.
using simulated data and a real sample of dna methylation data from the heinz nixdorf recall cohort study, we demonstrate that the proposed model fits our data significantly better than beta regression and m-value regression.

the statistical analysis of beta values is considered to be challenging, as traditional methods for the analysis of bounded variables, such as m-value regression and beta regression, are based on regularity assumptions that are often too strong to adequately describe the distribution of beta values.
it is as easy to apply to a sample of beta values as beta regression and m-value regression.
