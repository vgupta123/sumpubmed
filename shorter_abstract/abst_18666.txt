conan provides a rapid, valid and straightforward software solution to identify genetic variation underlying the 'missing' heritability for complex traits that remains unexplained by recent gwas.
conan facilitates the performance of gwas based on cnvs and the visual analysis of calculated results.
conan is a freely available client-server software solution which provides an intuitive graphical user interface for categorizing, analyzing and associating cnvs with phenotypes.
genome-wide association studies  based on single nucleotide polymorphisms  revolutionized our perception of the genetic regulation of complex traits and diseases.
copy number variations  promise to shed additional light on the genetic basis of monogenic as well as complex diseases and phenotypes.
