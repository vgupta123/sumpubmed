in our study, two unsupervised knowledge-based matrix factorization methods, independent component analysis  and nonnegative matrix factorization  are integrated to identify significant genes and related pathways in microarray gene expression dataset of alzheimer’s disease.
by combining the significant genes identified by both ica and nmf, the biological analysis shows great efficient for elucidating the molecular taxonomy of alzheimer’s disease and enable better experimental design to further identify potential pathways and therapeutic targets of ad.
the main challenge now is to extract valuable biological information from the colossal amount of data to gain insight into biological processes and the mechanisms of human disease.
furthermore, they can group genes into different categories for identifying related diagnostic pathways and regulatory networks.
the simulation results shows that both of the methods can clearly classify severe ad samples from control samples, and the biological analysis of the identified significant genes and their related pathways demonstrated that these genes play a prominent role in ad and relate the activation patterns to ad phenotypes.
the difference between these two method lies in ica assume statistical independence of the expression modes, while nmf need positivity constrains to generate localized gene expression profiles.
unsupervised machine learning approaches provide new and efficient analysis of gene expression profiles.
