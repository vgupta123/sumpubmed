the expression patterns of hats, hdacs, and hmts suggest these genes are important in neoplastic transformation and have characteristic patterns of expression depending on tissue of origin, with implications for potential clinical application.
here we report characteristic patterns of expression of  <dig> members of  <dig> classes of chromatin modifier genes in  <dig> different cancer types: histone acetyltransferases - ep <dig>  crebbp, and pcaf; histone deacetylases - hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac7a, and sirt1; and histone methyltransferases - suv39h1and suv39h <dig>  expression of each gene in  <dig> samples  was analysedby qrt-pcr, normalized with  <dig> housekeeping genes, and given as a ratio by comparison with a universal reference rna.
using a linear discriminant classifier and internal cross-validation revealed that with as few as  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, sirt <dig>  crebbp, hdac7a, hdac <dig> and pcaf, most samples were correctly assigned.
supervised analysis and independent component analysis showed that expression of many of these genes was able to discriminate tumour samples from their normal counterparts.
post-translational modification of histones resulting in chromatin remodelling plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression.
clustering based on the normalized expression ratios of the  <dig> genes also showed that most samples were grouped according to tissue type.
