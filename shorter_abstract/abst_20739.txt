unlike conventional qtl discovery strategies, in which bi-parental populations  need to be developed, association mapping-based strategies can use plant breeding populations to synchronize qtl discovery and cultivar development.
this study demonstrated that association mapping using a reasonable number of markers, distributed across the genome and with application of plant materials that are routinely developed in a plant breeding program can detect significant qtls for traits of interest.
common bacterial blight , incited by xanthomonas axonopodis pv.
furthermore,  <dig> significant snp markers were co-localized with or close to the cbb-qtls identified previously in bi-parental qtl mapping studies.
of them,  <dig> lines were evaluated for cbb resistance at  <dig> and  <dig> dai  in the summer of  <dig> in an artificially inoculated cbb nursery in south-western ontario.
a population of  <dig> dry bean lines of different market classes representing plant materials routinely developed in a bean breeding program were used.
the best possible population structure was to assign 36% and 64% of the lines into andean and mesoamerican subgroups, respectively.
mlm  analysis, including population structure and kinship, was used to discover marker-trait associations.
host resistance is practically the most effective and environmentally-sound approach to control cbb.
kinship analysis also revealed complex familial relationships among all lines, which corresponds with the known pedigree history.
of the  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps had more than 20% missing data,  <dig> snps were monomorphic, and  <dig> snps had a maf  of less than  <dig> , therefore only  <dig> snps were used for association study, based on one snp per locus.
