its flowering and maturity time are controlled by genetic and environmental factors, as well the interaction between the two factors.
large-effect loci were detected on gm  <dig>  gm  <dig> and gm  <dig> as in previous reports.
association mapping was performed on  <dig> soybean cultivars from different maturity groups  using  <dig> ssr markers and  <dig> snps from the illumina soysnp6k iselectbeadchip.
previous studies have shown that both genetic and environmental factors, mainly photoperiod and temperature, control flowering time of soybean.
the objectives of the current study were to identify the effects of loci associated with flowering time under different photo-thermal conditions and to understand the effects of interaction between loci and environment on soybean flowering.
this study facilitates the understanding of the genetic mechanism of soybean flowering and molecular breeding for the improvement of soybean adaptability to specific and/or broad regions.
the variation of flowering time among the soybean cultivars mostly resulted from the epistasis × environment and additive × environment interactions.
number of loci associated with flowering time was more under the long day  than under the short day  condition.
most loci associated with flowering time are sensitive to photo-thermal conditions.
the effects of loci associated with the flowering time of soybean were dependent upon the photo-thermal conditions.
