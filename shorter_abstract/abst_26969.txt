our results demonstrate that genes related to important immune pathways such as antigen presentation, inflammation, apoptosis and response to virus  were upregulated as a result of virus infection.
to study these, the gene expression profile of veev infected mouse brains was investigated.
veev is highly infectious when transmitted by aerosol and has been developed as a bio-warfare agent, making it an important pathogen to study from a military and civilian standpoint.
changes in gene expression were correlated with histological changes in the brain.
in addition, a molecular framework of changes in gene expression associated with progression of the disease was studied.
