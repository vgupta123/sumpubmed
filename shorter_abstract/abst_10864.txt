we propose a probabilistic method for calling tilling-induced mutations, and their carriers, from high throughput sequencing data of overlapping population pools, where each individual occurs in two pools.
it also outperforms existing snp detection methods in detecting real mutations, especially at higher levels of coverage variability across sequenced pools, and in lower quality short reads sequence data.
we assign a probability score to each sequence position by applying bayes' theorem to a simplified binomial model of sequencing error and expected mutations, taking into account the coverage level.
we show that our method effectively discovers mutations in large populations with sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %.
