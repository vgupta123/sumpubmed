primary and secondary bronchi, epithelial hyperplasia and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria were also observed.
avian infectious bronchitis  is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry, affecting chickens of all ages and causing major economic losses in poultry flocks.
the specific histological lesions finding in all infected birds, exhibited tracheal lesions with mucosal thickening, hyperplasia of the surface epithelium, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate of lamina propria.
mass vaccination is conducted in morocco using a vaccine against massachusetts, which is the most dominant serotype; however no information about the pathogenesis and tissue distribution of the moroccan italy  <dig> genotype was reported.
the results demonstrated that the three strains italy <dig> genotype emerging in moroccan poultry farms have a wide distribution for respiratory system, without kidney damage and without causing mortality.
virus re-isolation from infected organs and amplification of the viral rna by real-time pcr proved the presence of the virus in lung and trachea of infected chicks.
tracheal lesions developed in all infected birds, confirm the ability of the three tested strains to induce respiratory disease.
the infected birds appeared lethargic, reluctant to move, with specific respiratory clinical signs and macroscopic lesions.
the results at  <dig> dpi also revealed that all strains were able to induce serological response.
<dig> one-day-old specific pathogen free chickens were divided randomly into four groups.
