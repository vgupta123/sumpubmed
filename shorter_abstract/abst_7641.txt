most identified peptides were more highly expressed in embryonic day  <dig>  the top candidates for ee <dig> exposure and sex effects were neuropeptide k , gastrin-releasing peptide  and gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone related protein  <dig> .
japanese quail is a commonly used bird model for studying sexual dimorphic brain development, especially adult male copulatory behavior in relation to manipulations of the embryonic endocrine system.
endogenous peptides such as neuropeptides are involved in numerous biological processes in the fully developed brain but very little is known about their role in brain development.
this study uses a label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry approach to analyze the influence of age , sex and embryonic day  <dig> ethinylestradiol exposure on the expression of multiple endogenous peptides in the developing diencephalon.
this study is the first larger study on endogenous peptides in the developing brain and implies a previously unknown role for a number of neuropeptides in middle to late avian embryogenesis.
it demonstrates the power of label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to analyze the expression of multiple endogenous peptides and the potential to detect new putative peptide candidates in a developmental model.
we also report a new potential secretogranin- <dig> derived neuropeptide and previously unknown phosphorylations in the c-terminal flanking protachykinin  <dig> neuropeptide.
