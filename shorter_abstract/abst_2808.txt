the average difference between the residue-specific distance deviation predicted by our method and the actual distance deviation on the test data is  <dig> Å. the global quality prediction accuracy of the tool is comparable to other good tools on the same benchmark.
it is important to predict the quality of a protein structural model before its native structure is known.
the smoq tool finally released uses the basic feature set trained on  <dig> casp <dig> targets.
moreover, smoq implemented a way to convert predicted local quality scores into a global quality score.
smoq uses support vector machines  with protein sequence and structural features , including amino acid sequence, secondary structures, solvent accessibilities, and residue-residue contacts to make predictions.
we developed a machine learning tool  that can predict the distance deviation of each residue in a single protein model.
the method that can predict the absolute local quality of individual residues in a single protein model is rare, yet particularly needed for using, ranking and refining protein models.
smoq is a useful tool for protein single model quality assessment.
we also trained a svm model with two new additional features  on  <dig> casp <dig> targets and found that including them can only improve the performance when real deviations between native and model are higher than 5Å.
