non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  —aspirin, naproxen, nimesulide, and piroxicam— lowered activation of type ii camp-dependent protein kinase a  in isolated rat adipocytes, decreasing adrenaline- and dibutyryl camp -stimulated lipolysis.
since insulin inhibits adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis, the effect of aspirin on isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in rat adipocytes was studied.
the molecular bases of insulin-like actions of nsaid were studied.
inhibition of aquaporin-mediated h2o <dig> transport with agno <dig> in adipocytes allowed nox activation but prevented the lipolysis inhibition promoted by nsaid: i.e., once synthesized, h2o <dig> must reach the lipolytic machinery.
nsaid, at micromolar range, induced an h2o <dig> burst in rat adipocyte plasma membranes and in whole adipocytes.
nsaids activate nox <dig> in adipocytes to produce h2o <dig>  which impairs camp-dependent pka-ii activation, thus preventing isoproterenol-activated lipolysis.
nsaid-mediated rise of h2o <dig> was abrogated in adipocyte plasma membranes by: diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of nadph oxidase ; the nox <dig> antibody; and cytochrome c, trapping the nox-formed superoxide.
