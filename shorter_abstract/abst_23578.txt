since existing fdr methods cannot be applied to this particular problem, we present an adapted fdr method that is suitable for the detection of barcoded reads as well as suggest possible improvements.
sensitivity improved to 99% at 99% precision when the adjacent primer sequence was incorporated in the analysis.
the matter is further complicated by coincidental similarities between barcode sequences and reference dna.
in our analysis, barcode sequences showed high rates of coincidental similarities with the mus musculus reference dna.
this method helps to establish the highest acceptable minimal distance between reads and barcode sequences.
for mass inference problems such as this one, false discovery rate  methods are powerful and balanced solutions.
the method presented in this paper controls the tail area-based false discovery rate to distinguish between barcoded and unbarcoded reads.
it is based on the false discovery rate statistics that allows a proper trade-off between sensitivity and precision to be chosen.
many reads start inside the genomic insert so that adjacent primers might be missed.
in some cases , the position of the barcode and dna context is not well defined.
therefore, a robust strategy is required in order to detect barcoded reads and avoid a large number of false positives or negatives.
this problem became more acute when the length of the barcode sequence decreased and the number of barcodes in the set increased.
