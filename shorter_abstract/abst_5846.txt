the store-operated calcium entry channel orai <dig>  has been suggested as a potential mechanism for the entry of ca2+ into mammary gland epithelial cells from the maternal blood supply during lactation.
the entry of calcium ions into mammary gland epithelial cells is one of the least well-understood processes in the transport of calcium into milk during lactation.
differentiation of hc <dig> mammary gland epithelial cells was associated with enhanced basal ca2+ influx.
these studies support the hypothesis that lactation is associated with a remodelling of ca2+ influx and this is associated with enhancement of basal ca2+ influx.
