the proposed method has the practical advantages, over existing approaches, to consider complex heterogeneities in the alternative hypothesis, to take into account prior information  by allowing a semi-supervised mode, and to deal with truncated distributions such as those obtained in monte-carlo simulations.
in this context we present a semi-parametric approach based on kernel estimators which is applied to different high-throughput biological data such as patterns in dna sequences, genes expression and genome-wide association studies.
as a result, the local fdr has been recently proposed to quantify the specific probability for a given null hypothesis to be true.
as an alternative to the too conservative family-wise error-rate , the false discovery rate  has appeared for the last ten years as more appropriate to handle this problem.
