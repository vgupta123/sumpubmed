when comparing the populations of cells with constant vs. stress-induced rate of telomere shortening we find that stress induced telomere shortening  increases longevity while reducing mutation rate.
mutations accumulate as a result of dna damage and imperfect dna repair machinery.
telomeres shorten at every cell division and cell stops dividing once the shortest telomere reaches a critical length.
our results for the first time show how non-equal distribution of metabolic load  combined with stress induced telomere shortening can delay aging and minimize mutations.
with the help of in silico model we investigate the effect of genotoxic stress on telomere attrition and apoptosis in a population of non-identical replicating cells.
interestingly, however, the effect takes place only when genotoxic stresses  are distributed non-equally among cells.

in higher eukaryotes the accumulation and spread of mutations is limited in two primary ways: through p53-mediated programmed cell death and cellular senescence mediated by telomeres.
