to investigate the relationship between glycemic modulation, seizure susceptibility and its neuropathological consequences, c57bl/ <dig> mice  were subjected to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, followed by systemic administration of kainic acid to induce seizures.
moreover, we found that exogenous administration of glucose following kainic acid seizures significantly reduced the extent of hippocampal pathology in fvb/n mice  following systemic administration of kainic acid.
these findings demonstrate that modulation of the glycemic index can modify the outcome of brain injury in the kainate model of seizure induction.
however, little is known about neither the effects of glycemic control on brain metabolism nor the effects of managing systemic glucose concentrations in epilepsy.
moreover, modulation of the glycemic index through glucose rescue greatly diminishes the extent of seizure-induced cell death following kainate administration.
in this study, we examined glycemic modulation of kainate-induced seizure sensitivity and its neuropathological consequences.
in particular, it has been suggested that the duration and extent of glucose dysregulation may be a predictor of the pathological outcome of status.
glycemic modulation resulted in minimal consequences with regard to seizure severity but increased hippocampal pathology, irrespective of whether mice were hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic prior to kainate administration.
metabolic disturbances are often associated with epileptic seizures, but the pathogenesis of this relationship is poorly understood.
our data support the hypothesis that deficient insulin signaling may represent a critical contributing factor in the susceptibility to seizure-induced cell death and this may be an important therapeutic target.
