we have developed a graphical java-based application  to assist with submission of microarray designs to public repositories.
the miame and mage-om standards defined by the mged society provide a specification and implementation of a software infrastructure to facilitate the submission and sharing of data from microarray studies via public repositories.
adamant will allow researchers to annotate and submit their own array designs to public repositories without requiring programming expertise, knowledge of the mage-om or xml.
