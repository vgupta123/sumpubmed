in silico analysis identified two cis-regulatory elements candidates   potentially involved the interplay between no3- and hormonal signals.
herein, a systems biology approach was developed to identify the components and role of cross-talk between nitrate and hormone signals, likely to be involved in the conditional response of no3- signaling.
this systems analysis enabled us to derive a hypothesis in which hormone signals are proposed to enhance the nitrate response, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the link between nitrate signaling and the control of plant development.
the genes in the latter group showed a no3- response that is significantly enhanced, compared to the former.
biclustering was used to identify a set of genes that are n-responsive across a range of nitrogen -treatment backgrounds  using a meta-dataset of  <dig> affymetrix ath <dig> chips from  <dig> different laboratories.
n-bicluster  <dig>  was selected for further analysis, as it was shown to be reproducibly responsive to no3- as a signal, across a wide-variety of background conditions and datasets.
for this, the  <dig> nitrate-regulated genes in n-bicluster  <dig> were biclustered over a meta-dataset of  <dig> ath <dig> chips spanning a variety of hormone treatments.
