in vari mutants, essential sj proteins neurexiniv and fascicliniii are mislocalized basally and epithelia develop a leaky paracellular seal.
varicose localizes to pleated septate junctions  of all embryonic, ectodermally-derived epithelia and peripheral glia.
in addition, vari mutants display irregular tracheal tube diameters and have reduced lumenal protein accumulation, suggesting involvement in tracheal morphogenesis.
we found that vari is distributed in the cytoplasm of the optic lobe neuroepithelium, as well as in a subset of neuroblasts and differentiated neurons of the nervous system.
we reduced vari function during the development of adult epithelia with a partial rescue, rna interference and generation of genetically mosaic tissue.
