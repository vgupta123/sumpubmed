moreover, in combination, our studies of the gene structure of the human pit <dig> and pit <dig> genes  and alignment of protein sequences of pit family members from all kingdoms, along with the studies of the dual functions of the human pit paralogs show that these proteins are excellent as models for studying the evolution of a protein's structure-function relationship.
further truncation of the human pit <dig> protein by additional removal of two predicted tm domains together with the large intracellular domain created a mutant that resembles a bacterial phosphate permease and an archaeal putative phosphate permease.
we show that the human pit <dig> histidine, h <dig>  and the human pit <dig> glutamate, e <dig>  - both conserved in eukaryotic pit family members - are critical for pi transport function.
alignment of protein sequences representing pit family members from all kingdoms reveals the presence of conserved amino acids and that bacterial phosphate permeases and putative phosphate permeases from archaea lack substantial parts of the protein sequence when compared to the mammalian pit family members.
we have here exploited the dual-function of pit <dig> and pit <dig> to study the structure-function relationship of pit proteins.
the results suggest that the overall structure of the pi-transporting unit of the pit family proteins has remained unchanged during evolution.
a human pit <dig> truncation mutant, which consists of the predicted  <dig> transmembrane  domain backbone without a large intracellular domain , was found to be a fully functional pi transporter.
noticeably, human pit <dig> h <dig> is located in the c-terminal pit family signature sequence, and human pit <dig> e <dig> is located in prodom domains characteristic for all pit family members.
