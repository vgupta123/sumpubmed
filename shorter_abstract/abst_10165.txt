here we present krona, a new visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of metagenomic classifications.
the current tools for visualizing metagenomic data, however, omit or distort quantitative hierarchical relationships and lack the facility for displaying secondary variables.
to illustrate krona's utility, we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis tools.
a critical output of metagenomic studies is the estimation of abundances of taxonomical or functional groups.
