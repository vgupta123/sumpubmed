transposon -mediated mutagenesis was used to create a library of escherichia coli mutants that was screened for hypersensitivity to the lethal action of quinolones and counter-screened to have wild-type bacteriostatic susceptibility.
the  <dig> mutants were killed more readily than wild-type cells by mitomycin c and hydrogen peroxide; nine were also more readily killed by uv irradiation, and several exhibited increased susceptibility to killing by sodium dodecyl sulfate.
nucleotide sequence analysis identified  <dig> genes, mostly of unknown function, as potential factors protecting from lethal effects of stress.
genes that protect against the lethal effects of antibiotic stress are potential targets of enhancers.
no mutant was more readily killed by high temperature.
the continuing emergence of antimicrobial resistance requires the development of new compounds and/or enhancers of existing compounds.
to distinguish such genes from those involved in drug uptake and efflux, a new susceptibility screen is required.
