putative activating xfls associate with the fcrÎ³ subunit, and their transmembrane domains are highly similar to those of activating mammalian kir-related receptors.
this mode of evolution raises the possibility that the ancestral function of these paired receptors was a direct interaction with pathogens and that many physiological functions found in the mammalian receptors were secondary acquisitions or specializations.
fcr- and kir-related receptors evolved through continual species-specific diversification, most likely by extensive domain shuffling and birth-and-death processes.
to better understand the evolutionary history of paired receptors, we extended the study of fcr-like genes in amphibian representatives xenopus tropicalis and xenopus laevis.
up to  <dig> domain architectures generated by combinatorial joining of six ig-domain subtypes and two subtypes of the transmembrane regions were found in xfls.
phylogenetic analysis shows that the entire repertoires of the xenopus and mammalian fcr-related proteins have emerged after the amphibian-amniotes split.
the allotetraploid x. laevis displays many similar genes primarily expressed in lymphoid tissues.
recent studies have revealed an unexpected diversity of domain architecture among fcr-like receptors that presumably fulfill regulatory functions in the immune system.
the diploid genome of x. tropicalis contains at least  <dig> genes encoding paired fcr-related receptors designated xfls.
this argues in favor of a common origin for the fcr and the kir families.
