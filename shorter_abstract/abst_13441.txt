in a proteomic screen we identified talinb as a potential rap <dig> effector in dictyostelium.
the small g-protein rap <dig> is an important regulator of cellular adhesion in dictyostelium, however so far the downstream signalling pathways for cell adhesion are not completely characterized.
in subsequent pull-down experiments we demonstrate that the ras association  domain of talinb interacts specifically with active rap <dig>  studies with a mutated ra domain revealed that the ra domain is essential for talinb-rap <dig> interaction, and that this interaction contributes to cell-substrate adhesion during single-celled growth and is crucial for cell-cell adhesion during multicellular development.
in mammalian cells the established rap1-talin interaction is indirect and acts through the scaffold protein - riam.
this interaction is critical for adhesion, which becomes essential for high adhesive force demanding processes, like morphogenesis during multicellular development of dictyostelium.
dictyostelium rap <dig> directly binds to talinb via the conserved ra domain.
interestingly, direct binding of mouse rap <dig> to the ra domain of talin <dig> has recently been demonstrated.
in mammalian cells talin is crucial for adhesion and rap <dig> was shown to be a key regulator of talin signalling.
