structure clustering  grouped similar compounds obtained from the first stage into clusters of similar structures; the lowest energy compound from each cluster being selected as a final candidate.
however, screening and retrieving appropriate candidates as well as handling false positives presents a challenge for all post-screening analysis methods employed in retrieving therapeutic and industrial targets.
using the tscc method, virtually screened compounds were clustered based on their protein-ligand interactions, followed by structure clustering employing physicochemical features, to retrieve the final compounds.
by representing interactions at the atomic-level and including measures of interaction strength, better descriptions of protein-ligand interactions and a more specific analysis of virtual screening was achieved.
the increasing numbers of 3d compounds and protein complexes stored in databases contribute greatly to current advances in biotechnology, being employed in several pharmaceutical and industrial applications.
