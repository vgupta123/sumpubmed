the medicago sativa gene index  <dig>  increases the expressed sequence data available for alfalfa by ninefold and can be expanded as additional experiments are performed.
due to its large and complex genome, there are few genomic resources available for alfalfa improvement.
transcripts from roots, nitrogen-fixing root nodules, leaves, flowers, elongating stem internodes, and post-elongation stem internodes were assembled into the medicago sativa gene index  <dig>   representing  <dig>  unique transcript sequences.
a de novo transcriptome assembly from two alfalfa subspecies, m. sativa ssp.
the msgi  <dig>  transcriptome sequences, annotations, expression profiles, and snps were assembled into the alfalfa gene index and expression database  at http://plantgrn.noble.org/aged/, a publicly available genomic resource for alfalfa improvement and legume research.
pair-wise comparisons of each tissue combination identified  <dig>  sequences differentially expressed in b <dig> and  <dig>  sequences differentially expressed in f <dig>  comparing transcript abundance in floral tissues of b <dig> and f <dig> identified expression differences in sequences involved in anthocyanin and carotenoid synthesis, which determine flower pigmentation.
modern alfalfa is the result of hybridization between tetraploid m. sativa ssp.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  unique to each m. sativa subspecies  were identified.
