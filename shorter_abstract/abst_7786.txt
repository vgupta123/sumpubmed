furthermore, we identified an enrichment of alu y sequences that likely results from increased integration of new copies of alu y sequence in the drug-resistant cell lines.
the alu y sequences showed remarkable variation in dna methylation states across the clinical samples.
irinotecan  and oxaliplatin are chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of colorectal cancer.
for the clinical samples, we applied a concept of ‘dna methylation entropy’ to estimate the diversity of dna methylation states of the identified resistance phenotype-associated methylation loci observed in the cell line models.
in the clinical samples, sox <dig> and other sox gene family members were shown to display variable dna methylation states in their gene regions.
moreover, we extended the rrbs analysis to tumor tissue from  <dig> patients with colorectal cancer who either did or did not benefit from capecitabine + oxaliplatin treatment.
genomic toxicity induced by carcinogens or drugs can reactivate alus by altering dna methylation.
interestingly, 53% of the identified loci were alu sequences- especially the alu y subfamily.
our findings imply a crucial role of alu y in colorectal cancer drug resistance.
we applied reduced representation bisulfite sequencing  to investigate the dna methylome in sn <dig> or oxaliplatin resistant colorectal cancer cell line models.
our study underscores the complexity of colorectal cancer aggravated by mobility of alu elements and stresses the importance of personalized strategies, using a systematic and dynamic view, for effective cancer therapy.
