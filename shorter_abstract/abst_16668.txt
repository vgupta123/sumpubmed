the pfge results showed diversity within and between the two most prevalent spa-types of ntsmai -mrsa .
the pfge patterns of st <dig> isolates showed more diversity than with spa-typing and/or mlst.
after optimizing and evaluating the cfr9i pfge, clear and reproducible banding patterns were obtained from all previously non-typeable mrsa  isolates.
furthermore, possible transmission among veterinarians and their family members was investigated and an outbreak of st <dig> mrsa in a residential care facility was confirmed with the cfr9i pfge.
livestock has recently been identified as a new reservoir of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus .
the adjustments in the pfge protocol using cfr9i are easy to implement to study the st <dig> clonal lineage in laboratories which already have a pfge facility.
no match was found, when comparing banding patterns of the ntsmai -mrsa with  <dig> different pfge types, obtained with smai digestion, in our database of more than  <dig> strains.
