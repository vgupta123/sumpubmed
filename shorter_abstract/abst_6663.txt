as sensitivity increases, an adaptive response as seen in escherichia coli becomes optimal and leads to 'perfect' chemotaxis with a low tumbling time.
we find that as tumbling time decreases and sensitivity increases, there exist a parameter regime where the chemotaxis performance of the linear and adaptive responses overlap, suggesting that evolution of chemotaxis responses might provide an example for the principle of functional change in structural continuity.
to achieve it, we need to understand the evolutionary routes leading to a specific response dynamics that can underlie a given function and how biophysical and environmental factors affect which route is taken.
our findings explain several results from diverse bacteria and lead to testable predictions regarding chemotaxis responses evolved in bacteria living under different biophysical constraints and with specific motility machinery.
we find that a linear response to attractant results in significant chemotaxis when sensitivity to attractant is low and when time spent tumbling is large.
we construct evolutionarily accessible response dynamics starting from a linear response to absolute levels of attractant, to those observed in current-day escherichia coli.
more importantly, such linear response is optimal in a regime where signalling has low sensitivity.
here, we apply such an evolutionary approach to the bacterial chemotaxis pathway, which is documented to display considerable complexity and diversity.
the ability to predict the function and structure of complex molecular mechanisms underlying cellular behaviour is one of the main aims of systems biology.
