phylogenetic analysis also revealed a complex history of lineage-specific expansions and attritions for the pl <dig> family.
furthermore, analysis of the gene expression profile of the wheat scab fungus fusarium graminearum revealed that most of the cazyme genes related to cell wall degradation were up-regulated during plant infection.
in addition, our results also showed that in general, plant pathogenic fungi have the highest number of cazymes.
among them, some families of ghs and ces are the most prevalent cazymes that are distributed in all of the fungi analyzed.
our study provides insights into the variety and expansion of fungal cazyme classes and revealed the relationship of cazyme size and diversity with their nutritional strategy and host specificity.
in this study, we systemically identified glycoside hydrolases , polysaccharide lyases , carbohydrate esterases , and glycosyltransferases  as well as carbohydrate-binding modules  in the predicted proteomes of  <dig> representative fungi from ascomycota, basidiomycota, chytridiomycota, and zygomycota.
comparative analysis of these cazymes that play major roles in plant polysaccharide degradation revealed that fungi exhibit tremendous diversity in the number and variety of cazymes.
however, a systematic comparative analysis of fungal cazymes across the entire fungal kingdom has not been reported.
biotrophic fungi tend to have fewer cazymes than necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi.
interestingly, besides yeasts, many saprophytic fungi that are highly active in degrading plant biomass contain fewer cazymes than plant pathogenic fungi.
importantly, cellulases of some gh families are present in fungi that are not known to have cellulose-degrading ability.
to date, over hundreds of fungal genomes are publicly available.
