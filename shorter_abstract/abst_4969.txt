three categories of lr <dig> mutants were identified that were either partial susceptible, fully susceptible or hyper-susceptible to stripe rust and leaf rust.
four independent lr <dig> mutants were recovered that were susceptible to stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust pathogens, including one possible hyper-susceptible lr <dig> mutant.
detailed study of lr <dig> mutants revealed that subtle changes in resistance response to multiple pathogens were correlated with mutational changes in the predicted protein.
recovery of independent lr <dig> mutants indicates that as for lr <dig>  a single gene at the lr <dig> locus is likely to confer resistance to multiple pathogens.
induced, susceptible mutants were characterised for both genes.
