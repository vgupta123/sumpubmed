malaria invasion of red blood cells involves multiple parasite-specific targets that are easily accessible to inhibitory compounds, making it an attractive target for antimalarial development.
here, we demonstrate that the clinically used macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, which is known to kill human malaria asexual blood-stage parasites by blocking protein synthesis in their apicoplast, is also a rapid inhibitor of red blood cell invasion in human  and rodent  malarias.
safe and effective macrolide antibiotics with dual modalities could be developed to combat malaria and reduce the parasiteâ€™s options for resistance.
however, no current antimalarial agents act against host cell invasion.
we identified derivatives of azithromycin and erythromycin that are better invasion inhibitors than parent compounds, offering promise for development of this novel antimalarial strategy.
