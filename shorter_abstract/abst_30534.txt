the analysis of tes in m. fijiensis suggests that tes play an important role in the evolution of this organism because the activity of these elements, as well as the rearrangements caused by ectopic recombination, can result in deletion, duplication, inversion and translocation.
repetitive sequences are ubiquitous components of fungal genomes.
mycosphaerella fijiensis is a ascomycete that causes black sigatoka in bananas.
recently, the m. fijiensis genome was sequenced.
some of the deleterious effects of tes may be due to ectopic recombination among tes of the same family.
the results of this study indicate that transposons were and are important ectopic recombination sites.
several genes encoding proteins involved in important metabolic pathways and with potential correlation to pathogenicity systems were identified upstream and downstream of transposable elements.
in most genomic analyses, repetitive sequences are associated with transposable elements .
in this study, the abundance, distribution and potential impact of tes in the genome of m. fijiensis were investigated.
a distribution analysis of a transposable element from each class of the m. fijiensis isolates revealed variable hybridization profiles, indicating the activity of these elements.
a total of  <dig> ltr-gypsy and  <dig> ltr-copia complete elements of the class i were detected.
among the class ii elements, a total of  <dig> mariner, five mutator and one harbinger complete elements were identified.
some of these changes can potentially modify gene structure or expression and, thus, facilitate the emergence of new strains of this pathogen.
to prevent possible damage caused by the presence of tes in the genome, some fungi possess te-silencing mechanisms, such as rip .
