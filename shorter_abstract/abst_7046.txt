basic leucine zipper proteins  play important roles in the ability of plants to withstand adverse environmental conditions.
based on these data, we suggest that thbzip <dig> confers abiotic stress tolerance through activating stress tolerance genes to modulate ros scavenging ability and other physiological changes involved in stress tolerance, and plays an important role in the aba-mediated stress response of t. hispida.
thbzip <dig> can specifically bind to acgt elements, with the highest binding affinity to the c-box, followed by the g-box and lastly the a-box.
compared with wild-type  arabidopsis, transgenic plants expressing thbzip <dig> had an increased tolerance to drought and salt, but had an increased sensitivity to aba during seed germination and root growth; meanwhile, ros level, cell death and water loss rate in transgenic plants were significantly reduced.
are woody halophyte, which are very tolerant to abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought, but little is known about their specific stress response systems.
in the current study, we functionally characterized a bzip gene  from tamarix hispida in response to abiotic stresses.
its upstream regulators, the cis-acting elements recognized by thbzip <dig>  and its downstream target genes.
microarray analyses showed that many ros scavenging genes were up-regulated by thbzip <dig> under salt stress conditions.
however, their exact roles in abiotic stress tolerance are still not fully known.
expression of thbzip <dig> is induced by aba, salt, drought, methyl viologen and cold.
