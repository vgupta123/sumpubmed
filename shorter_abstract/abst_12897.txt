the use of monoclonal antibodies would ensure the specific detection of the harmful food content for a sensitised person.
around 3â€“5% of the population suffer from ige-mediated food allergies in western countries and the number of food-allergenic people is increasing.
the allergen-specific fab fragments exhibited high affinity towards the target recombinant allergens.
interestingly, isolated mal d 1-specific antibody bound also to bet v  <dig>  the main allergen eliciting the cross-reactivity syndrome between the birch pollen and apple.
more detailed characterisation of the resulting antibodies was carried out using elisa, spr experiments and immunoprecipitation assays.
as an example a person sensitised to the major birch pollen allergen, bet v  <dig>  is often sensitised to its homologues, such as the major allergens of apple, mal d  <dig>  and celery, api g  <dig>  as well.
this study gives new preliminary insights to elucidate the mechanism behind the pollen-food syndrome and to study the igg epitope of the allergens.
furthermore, the fab fragments also recognised native allergens from natural sources.
