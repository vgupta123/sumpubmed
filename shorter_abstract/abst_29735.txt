the analytical testing of the assay was determined using a standard curve.
the possibility to characterize samples in a rapid, sensitive and reproducible way makes this assay a good option to establish a new standard in molecular identification and quantification of c. fetus species.
the aim of the present study was to develop a highly specific molecular assay to identify and quantify c. fetus strains.
this assay successfully detected all c. fetus strains, including those that were negative for the csta gene-based assay used as a standard for molecular c. fetus identification.
biochemical tests remain as the gold standard for identifying c. fetus but the fastidious growing requirements and the lack of reliability and reproducibility of some biochemical tests motivated the development of molecular diagnostic tools.
both c. fetus fetus and c. fetus testudinum are opportunistic pathogens for immune-compromised humans.
campylobacter fetus testudinum has been proposed recently based on genetically divergent strains isolated from reptiles and humans.
these methods have been successfully tested on bovine isolates but fail to detect some genetically divergent strains isolated from other hosts.
campylobacter fetus fetus affects a broad range of hosts and induces abortion in sheep and cows.
the species shows a great intraspecific variation, with three subspecies: c. fetus subsp.
we developed a highly sensitive real-time pcr assay that targets a unique region of the 16s rrna gene.
campylobacter fetus venerealis is restricted to cattle and causes the endemic disease bovine genital campylobacteriosis, which triggers reproductive problems and is responsible for major economic losses.
