in this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of pacific white shrimp , an important economic crustacean, to explore traces of ht events.
expression profile analyses of transcripts in two ncbi bioprojects revealed that transcripts involved in ht events are likely to play important roles in antiviral immunity.
sequences from parasites and microorganisms were also widely present, indicating their possible important roles in ht events.
horizontal transfer  of genetic materials is increasingly being found in both animals and plants and mainly concerns transposable elements .
more specifically, those transcripts might act as inhibitors of antiviral immunity.
phylogenetic analyses of 10â€‰l. vannamei te families and their homologues  revealed that l. vannamei te families were generally more close to sequences from aquatic species.
their habitat might offer them ample opportunities to exchange genetic materials with organisms that are ecologically close but taxonomically distant to them.
many crustaceans have big genome sizes and are thus likely to harbor high te contents.
furthermore, tes from other aquatic species also tend to group together, although they are often distantly related in taxonomy.
close ecological relationship, especially predation, might greatly facilitate ht events among aquatic species.
in total,  <dig> already known l. vannamei te families are likely to be involved in horizontal transfer events.
the occurrence of ht events may be largely incidental, but the effects could be beneficial for recipients.
