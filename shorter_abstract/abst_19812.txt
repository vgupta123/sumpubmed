even with increasing sizes of whole genome datasets, ensemble joint calling of snvs for low coverage data can be accomplished in a scalable, cost effective and fast manner by using heterogeneous computing platforms without compromising on the quality of variants.
we used amazon aws, a 4000-core in-house cluster at baylor college of medicine, ibm power pc blue biou at rice and rhea at oak ridge national laboratory  for the computation.
as a proof of principle, we present results of analysis on cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology  wgs freeze  <dig> dataset in which joint calling, imputation and phasing of over  <dig> whole genome samples was produced in under  <dig> weeks using four state-of-the-art callers.
we present a novel binning approach for large scale joint variant calling and imputation which can scale up to over  <dig>  samples while producing snv callsets with high sensitivity and specificity.
the entire operation used  <dig>  million core hours and only transferred a total of 6Â tb of data across the platforms.
the decreasing costs of sequencing are driving the need for cost effective and real time variant calling of whole genome sequencing data.
we present a high throughput framework including multiple variant callers for single nucleotide variant  calling, which leverages hybrid computing infrastructure consisting of cloud aws, supercomputers and local high performance computing infrastructures.
