given the efficacy of the muguga cocktail in inducing long-lasting protection against infections in the field, our results suggest that whole-organism vaccines against parasitic diseases can be highly efficacious despite considerable genome-wide differences relative to the isolates against which they protect.
differences among these three isolates, while extensive, represent only a small proportion of the genetic variation in the entire species.
east coast fever, caused by the protist theileria parva, kills one million cattle each year in sub-saharan africa, and contributes significantly to hunger and poverty in the region.

these genetic markers of the component stocks can be used to characterize the composition of new batches of the muguga cocktail.
we find that serengeti-transformed, originally isolated from the wildlife carrier, the african cape buffalo, is remarkably and unexpectedly similar to the muguga isolate.
here we sequence and compare the three component t. parva stocks within this vaccine, the muguga cocktail, namely muguga, kiambu <dig> and serengeti-transformed, aiming to identify genomic features that contribute to vaccine efficacy.
