soil collected was hence used for metagenomic dna extraction to study the capabilities of intrinsic microbial community in tolerating the oil perturbation.
16s rdna and lowest common ancestor.
to understand the impact of long-term oil contamination on microbial community structure soil samples were taken from oil fields located in different industrial regions across kadi, near ahmedabad, india.
the results indicated that long-term oil contamination significantly affects soil microbial community structure by acting as an environmental filter to decrease the regional differences distinguishing soil microbial communities.
our results indicated that soil microbial diversity  decreased significantly with contamination.
further, assignment of obtained metagenome reads to clusters of orthologous groups  of protein and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  hits revealed metabolic potential of indigenous microbial community.
the community profiling revealed the enrichment of phylum “proteobacteria” and genus “chromobacterium,” respectively for polluted soil sample.
to the best of our knowledge this is first study for influence of edible oil on soil microbial communities via shotgun sequencing.
