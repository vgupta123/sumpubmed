no thermal hyperalgesia was seen following the collagenase injection.
in the collagenase group, a significant decrease in mechanical allodynia threshold was observed.
central post-stroke pain is a neuropathic pain condition caused by a vascular lesion, of either ischemic or hemorrhagic origin, in the central nervous system and more precisely involving the spinothalamocortical pathway responsible for the transmission of painful sensations.
the objectives of this study were to evaluate different modalities of pain in a central neuropathic pain rat model and to assess the effects of ketamine administered at different doses.
an intrathalamic hemorrhage induced a bilateral mechanical allodynia in rats.
cold hyperalgesia was observed in 60% of these animals.
an alleviation of mechanical allodynia was achieved only with the high ketamine dose.
mechanical allodynia was alleviated with high doses of ketamine which corresponded with therapeutic plasmatic concentrations.
few animal models have been developed to study this problem.
no significant change in motor coordination was observed following surgery in either the saline or collagensae groups.
a significant decrease in motor coordination was seen only following the administration of 25â€‰mg/kg of ketamine in both groups.
ketamine was then tested as a potential therapeutic drug.
histopathological observations showed a well localized lesion with neuronal necrosis and astrocytosis following the collagenase injection that was localized within the vpl.
a sporadic and transient cold allodynia was also noted.
a very small hemorrhage was created by injecting a collagenase solution in the right ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus.
