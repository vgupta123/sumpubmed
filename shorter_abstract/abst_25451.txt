no significant differences between schematic and human faces were detected in the amygdala or fusiform gyrus.
the initial block within each run elicited the greatest activation  and the final block elicited greater activation than the preceding block.
the amygdala and fusiform gyrus had a within-run "u" response pattern of activity to facial expression blocks.
the "u" pattern of response in the amygdala and fusiform gyrus to facial expressions suggests an initial orienting, habituation, and activation recovery in these regions.
percent signal changes within anatomic regions-of-interest  were calculated to examine the temporal dynamics of neural response and any response differences based on face type.
the amygdala habituates in response to repeated human facial expressions; however, it is unclear whether this brain region habituates to schematic faces .
furthermore, this study is the first to directly compare brain responses to schematic and human facial expressions, and the similarity in brain responses suggest that schematic faces may be useful in studying amygdala activation.
