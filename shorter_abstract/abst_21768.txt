arabinogalactan-proteins  are ubiquitous components of cell walls throughout the plant kingdom and are extensively post translationally modified by conversion of proline to hydroxyproline  and by addition of arabinogalactan polysaccharides  to hyp residues.
the mutants also displayed several conditional phenotypes, including impaired root growth, and defective anisotropic growth of root tips under salt stress, as well as less sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of β-gal-yariv reagent in roots and pollen tubes.
further phenotypic analysis of these mutants demonstrated reduced root hair growth, reduced seed coat mucilage, reduced seed set, and accelerated leaf senescence.
three members of the gt <dig> family  were identified as hyp-o-galt genes by heterologous expression in tobacco leaf epidermal cells and examined along with two previously characterized hyp-o-galt genes, galt <dig> and galt <dig>  transcript profiling by real-time pcr of these five hyp-o-galts revealed overlapping but distinct expression patterns.
biochemical analysis of knock-out mutants for the five hyp-o-galt genes revealed significant reductions in both agp-specific hyp-o-galt activity and β-gal-yariv precipitable agps.
this study provides evidence that all five hyp-o-galt genes encode enzymes that catalyze the initial steps of agp galactosylation and that agp glycans play essential roles in both vegetative and reproductive plant growth.
agps are implicated to function in various aspects of plant growth and development, but the functional contributions of agp glycans remain to be elucidated.
transiently expressed galt <dig>  galt <dig> and galt <dig> fluorescent protein fusions were localized within golgi vesicles.
