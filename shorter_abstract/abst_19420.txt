inbreeding increases homozygosity and exposes deleterious recessive alleles, generally decreasing the fitness of inbred individuals.
inbreeding depression in males may be further reduced by sex chromosome hemizygosity, which affects the dominance of some mutations, as well as by the absence of sexual selection.
determining the relative contributions of sex-specific expression, genes on the sex chromosomes, and the environment they are filtered through—including opportunities for sexual selection—may explain the frequent though inconsistent records of sex differences in inbreeding depression, along with their implications for conservation and the evolution of mating systems.
these results suggest that females experience stronger selection on genes contributing to reproductive traits.
female nematodes consistently suffered greater fitness losses than their male counterparts, especially at high levels of inbreeding.
