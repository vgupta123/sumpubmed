micrornas  are small rna molecules  which have been shown to play an important role both in development and in maintenance of adult tissue.
analysis of gene expression profiles detected the effects of multiple mirnas in ce-rscs and retina.
we have previously shown that candidate mirnas affecting transcript levels in a tissue can be deduced from mrna microarray expression profiles.
the expression levels of mirnas correlated with the significance of their predicted effects upon mrna expression.
conditional inactivation of mirnas in the eye causes loss of visual function and progressive retinal degeneration.
misregulation of these mirnas might contribute to retinal degeneration and disease.
the purpose of this study was to predict mirnas which affect mrna levels in developing and adult retinal tissue and to confirm their expression.
highly expressed mirnas included mir- <dig>  mir-125a, mir-125b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  over-expression of three mirnas with significant predicted effects upon global mrna levels resulted in a decrease in mrna expression of five out of six individual predicted target genes assayed.
the validity of these observations is supported by the experimental confirmation of candidate mirna expression and the regulation of predicted target genes following mirna over-expression.
identified mirnas are likely to be important in retinal development and function.
microarray expression data from ciliary epithelial retinal stem cells , developing and adult mouse retina were generated or downloaded from public repositories.
the expression of  <dig> selected mirnas was confirmed by rt-pcr and the cellular distribution of representative candidates analyzed by in situ hybridization.
this study has detected the effect of mirnas upon mrna expression in immature and adult retinal tissue and cells.
