it allows both genbank accession number, file and fasta cut-and-paste admission of sequences .
it is possible to mask nonretroviral repetitive sequences in the submitted sequence, using host genome specific "brooms", which increase specificity.
the full rete requires a local installation with a mysql database.
rol  was implemented under the batchelor web interface .
results are text files, and can be viewed with the program, retrotectorviewer.jar , which has the full graphical capabilities of the basic rete program.
with the current server, a complete analysis of a  <dig> megabase sequence is complete in  <dig> minutes.
a "light" version of rete,  which does not require specific installation procedures is provided, via the world wide web.
more or less complete retroviral sequences, also called proviral or endogenous retroviral sequences; ervs, constitutes at least 5% of vertebrate genomes.
a detailed analysis of any retroviral sequences found in the submitted sequence is graphically presented, exportable in standard formats.
rol provides  <dig>  annotation and presentation of known retroviral sequences,  <dig>  detection of proviral chains in unknown genomic sequences, with up to  <dig> mbase per submission.
a better understanding of structure and function of these sequences can have profound biological and medical consequences.
retrotectorÂ©  is a platform-independent java program for identification and characterization of proviral sequences in vertebrate genomes.
up to ten submissions can be done simultaneously, allowing batch analysis of <=  <dig> megabases.
jobs are shown in an ip-number specific list.
after infecting the host, these retroviruses have integrated in germ line cells, and have then been carried in genomes for at least several  <dig> million years.
