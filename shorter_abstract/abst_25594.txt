a phylogenetic tree revealed that asgv and citrus tatter leaf virus  are the same virus, which was divided into two clades.
in addition, we compared the usability of two de novo assemblers, trinity and velvet, for virus identification and genome assembly.
taken together, our in silico analyses using ngs data provide a successful application of plant transcriptomes to reveal extensive information associated with viral genome assembly, snvs, phylogenetic relationships, and genetic recombination.

we de novo assembled nearly complete genomes of asgv isolates fuji and cuiguan from apple and pear transcriptomes, respectively, and identified single nucleotide variations  of asgv within the transcriptomes.
we demonstrated the application of ngs raw data to confirm viral infections in the plant transcriptomes.
recombination analyses identified six recombination events from  <dig> viral genomes.
in this study, we performed integrated analyses using plant transcriptome data for plant virus identification using apple stem grooving virus  as an exemplar virus.
