the techniques currently used for "absolute quantification" of cytokine mrna are based on a dna standard curve and do not take into account the critical impact of rt efficiency.
the real-time rt-pcr technique based on a rna standard curve, cyproquant-pcr, outlined here, allows for a genuine absolute quantification and a simultaneous analysis of a large panel of human cytokine mrna.
we showed that the beta- <dig> microglobulin  gene was suitable for data normalisation since the level of β2-mg transcripts in naïve pbmc varied less than  <dig> times between individuals and was not affected by lps or pha stimulation.
to overcome this pitfall, we designed a strategy using external rna as standard in the rt-pcr.
results obtained show that cyproquant-pcr is powerful enough to precociously detect slight cytokine induction.
cytokines mrna quantification is widely used in immunological research to dissect the early steps of immune responses or pathophysiological pathways.
finally, having demonstrated the reproducibility of the method, it was applied to malaria patients and asymptomatic controls for the quantification of tgf-β <dig> transcripts and showed an increased capacity of cells from malaria patients to accumulate tgf-β <dig> mrna in response to lps.
it represents a potent and attractive tool for immunomonitoring, lending itself readily to automation and with a high throughput.
