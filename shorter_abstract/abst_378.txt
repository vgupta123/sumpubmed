sub-acute ruminal acidosis  is a well-recognized digestive disorder found in particular in well-managed dairy herds.
a total of  <dig> phyla were observed, distributed amongst all cattle on both diets; however, only  <dig> phyla were observed in all animals regardless of dietary treatment, and considerable animal to animal variation was revealed.
further, our results indicated that the fecal volatile fatty acid  concentrations were significantly related to presence of some certain species of bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the feces.
our results suggest that particular bacteria and their metabolites in the feces appear to contribute to differences in host health between those given said and traditional cod feeding.
sara can result in increased flow of fermentable substrates to the hindgut, which can increase the production of volatile fatty acids, alter the structure of the microbial community, and have a negative effect on animal health and productivity.
a better understanding of these microbial populations will allow for improved nutrient management and increased animal growth performance.
this is, to our knowledge, the first study that has used barcoded dna pyrosequencing to survey the fecal microbiome of dairy cattle during sara.
samples of ruminal fluid and feces were collected on day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the treatment period, and the ph was measured in the ruminal and fecal samples; the fecal microbiota was determined by pyrosequencing analysis of the v1â€“v <dig> region of amplified 16s ribosomal rna .
the average abundance and its range of the  <dig> phyla were as follows: firmicutes , proteobacteria , actinobacteria , bacteroidetes  and tenericutes .
among the otus affected, the predominant species, including otu <dig> , otu <dig>  and otu <dig> , were increased, while the abundance of otu <dig>  and otu <dig>  was reduced in the said group compared with the cod.
feeding the said resulted in significant shifts in the structure of the fecal microbial community when compared with the traditional cod.
among the  <dig> otus detected in the present study,  <dig> otus were affected significantly by diet; and the proportion of these otus was  <dig> % and  <dig> % among the total number of sequences, respectively.
however, little is known about changes in the structure of the microbial community and its relationship with fatty acids during sara.
said decreased ruminal and fecal ph and increased the propionate, butyrate and total volatile fatty acid  concentration in feces when compared with the cod.
