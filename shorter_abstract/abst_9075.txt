results from the analysis of multiple gene signatures, which would previously have taken several days, can now be obtained in as little as  <dig> minutes, greatly facilitating candidate therapeutics discovery with high throughput.
modern cancer research often involves large datasets and the use of sophisticated statistical techniques.
cudamap will make a strong contribution in the discovery of candidate therapeutics by enabling speedy execution of heavy duty connectivity mapping tasks, which are increasingly required in modern cancer research.
here, we describe new software, cudamap, which has been implemented using cuda c/c++ to harness the computational power of nvidia gpus  to greatly reduce processing times for connectivity mapping.
cudamap is open source and can be freely downloaded from http://purl.oclc.org/net/cudamap.
together these add a heavy computational load to the analysis, which is often coupled with issues surrounding data accessibility.
on a normal desktop pc, it is common for the connectivity mapping task with a single gene signature to take > 2h to complete using sscmap, a popular java application that runs on standard cpus .
we are able to demonstrate dramatic speed differentials between gpu assisted performance and cpu executions as the computational load increases for high accuracy evaluation of statistical significance.
emerging ‘omics’ technologies are constantly increasing the volume of data and information to be processed in all areas of biomedical research.
