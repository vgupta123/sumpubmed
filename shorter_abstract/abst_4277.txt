precision medicine requires the tight integration of clinical and molecular data.
the i2b <dig> center  has developed a widely internationally adopted framework to use existing clinical data for discovery research that can help the definition of precision medicine interventions when coupled with genetic data.
we developed bigq, an extension of the i2b <dig> framework, which integrates patient clinical phenotypes with genomic variant profiles generated by next generation sequencing.
in this paper we describe a new i2b <dig> web service composed of an efficient and scalable document-based database that manages annotations of genomic variants and of a visual programming plug-in designed to dynamically perform queries on clinical and genetic data.
we report an evaluation of the query performance of our system on more than  <dig> million variants, showing that the implemented solution scales linearly in terms of query time and disk space with the number of variants.
the system therefore allows managing the fast growing volume of genomic variants and can be used to integrate heterogeneous genomic annotations.
