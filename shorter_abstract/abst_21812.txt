the development of successful esc differentiation protocols within suspension bioreactors demands a more complete understanding of the impacts of shear forces on the regulation of pluripotency and differentiation in pluripotent stem cells.
this study demonstrates that although cardiomyocyte differentiation can be achieved in stirred suspension bioreactors, the addition of medium enhancers is not adequate to force complete differentiation as fluid shear forces appear to maintain a subpopulation of cells in a transient pluripotent state.
the effect of mechanical forces and shear stress on esc pluripotency and differentiation has yet to be clarified.
remarkably, however, our results demonstrated that the bioreactor differentiated escs retained their ability to express pluripotency markers, to form esc-like colonies, and to generate teratomas upon transplantation, whereas the cells differentiated in adherent culture lost these characteristics.
embryonic stem cells  can proliferate endlessly and are able to differentiate into all cell lineages that make up the adult organism.
our results showed that the bioreactor differentiated cells displayed the characteristics of fully functional cardiomyocytes.
under particular in vitro culture conditions, escs can be expanded and induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes in stirred suspension bioreactors .
murine d3-mhc-neor escs formed embyroid bodies  and differentiated into cardiomyocytes over  <dig> days in static culture and suspension bioreactors.
the purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the suspension culture environment on esc pluripotency during cardiomyocyte differentiation.
