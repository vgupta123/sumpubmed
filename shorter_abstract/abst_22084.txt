consequently, a consortium of two bacteria species were evaluated for optimized bioflocculant yield following the inadequacies of axenic cultures.
in addition, bioflocculant yield was about  <dig> Â g/l.
nucleotide sequences showed 97% and 96% similarity to methylobacterium sp.
strain  <dig>  the second isolate, likewise, showed 98% similarity to actinobacterium or- <dig>  the sequences were deposited in genbank as methylobacterium sp.
16s rdna nucleotide sequencing and blast analysis of nucleotide sequences were used to identify the bacterial species, carbon and nitrogen sources optimally supporting bioflocculant production were assessed and the purified bioflocculant characterized.
