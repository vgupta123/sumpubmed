these results suggest that gps  and gp-ex  effectively attenuate the development of lid by modulating the biomarker activities of ∆fosb expression and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in the 6-ohda-lesioned rat model of pd.
in addition, the increases in ∆fosb expression and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in 6-ohda-lesioned rats induced by l-dopa administration were significantly reduced by co-treatment with gps  or gp-ex .
daily administration of l-dopa  in the 6-ohda-lesioned rat model of pd for 22 days induced expression of lid, which was determined by the body and locomotive aims scores and contralateral rotational behaviors.
gypenosides  and ethanol extract of gynostemma pentaphyllum  show anxiolytic effects on affective disorders in 1-methyl-4-phenyl- <dig> , <dig> -tetrahydropyridine-lesioned mouse model of parkinson’s disease .
the present study investigated the effects of gps and gp-ex on lid in a 6-hydroxydopamine -lesioned rat model of pd.
