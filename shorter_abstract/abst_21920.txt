the overexpression of the 5′utr markedly reduced rb mrna expression, and this reduction was fully dependent on the complementary element and was not compensated by irs- <dig> protein.
conversely, knockdown of fl-irs- <dig> mrna increased rb mrna expression and enhanced myoblast differentiation into myotubes.
the fl-irs- <dig> 5′utr contains a partial complementary sequence to rb mrna, which is a critical factor for myogenic differentiation.
in cultured skeletal muscle c2c <dig> cells, the fl-irs- <dig> transcript functioned as a bifunctional mrna.
fl-irs- <dig> mrna was highly expressed only in skeletal muscle tissue.
in this study, we identified a novel bifunctional rna that is transcribed from insulin receptor substrate- <dig>  gene with full-length 5′utr sequence .
the fl-irs- <dig> transcript produced irs- <dig> protein during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes; however, this transcript functioned as a regulatory rna in proliferating myoblasts.
our findings suggest that the fl-irs- <dig> transcript regulates myogenic differentiation as a regulatory rna in myoblasts.
