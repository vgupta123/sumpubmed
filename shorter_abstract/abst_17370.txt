tuberculosis  is an infectious, granulomatous disease caused by acid-fast bacilli of the genus mycobacterium.
the isolation of m. tuberculosis from pigs suggests a possible risk of transmission between humans and pigs.
although mammalian tuberculosis has been nearly controlled in many developed countries, it is still a serious problem in humans and domestic animals including pigs in developing countries.
of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig> were acid fast positive while five of the latter were confirmed by multiplex pcr as members of the m. tuberculosis complex.
therefore, this study was designed to estimate the prevalence of tb in pigs in central ethiopia and to characterize the causative agents using molecular techniques.
in contrast, an association of sex, floor type and water source with the prevalence could not be shown.
the disease affects practically all species of vertebrates.
culture positivity was confirmed in  <dig> %  of the tuberculous-like lesions.
hence, establishing feasible control methods is required.
speciation of the five isolates further confirmed that they were m. tuberculosis, belonging to sit <dig>  and sit <dig> .
