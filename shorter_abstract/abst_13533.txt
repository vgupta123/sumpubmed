genotyping, based on 16s rrna-its and concatenated housekeeping genes grouped the selected isolates into two clades, constituted by the chilean strains, while the canadian isolates form a branch in the phylogenetic tree.
two different strains of p. salmonis, in regards to genetic and phenotypic characteristics, can occur in the same contemporary outbreak of srs.
the latter consisted of two isolates that were different in both genetic and phenotypic characteristics.
the study presents the phenotypic and genetic characterization of selected p. salmonis isolates from atlantic salmon and rainbow trout suffering from srs  in chile and in canada.
the isolates included were heterogeneous in phenotypic tests.
the phenotypic characterization of the p. salmonis isolates were based on growth on different agar media , different growth temperatures, antibiotics susceptibility and biochemical tests.
this is the first study differentiating chilean p. salmonis isolates into two separate genetic groups.
the genotyping methods developed in this study provided a tool for separation of p. salmonis isolates into distinct clades.
the srs outbreaks in chile are caused by minimum two different genetic groups of p. salmonis.

this heterogeneity should be considered in future development of vaccines against this bacterium in chile.
