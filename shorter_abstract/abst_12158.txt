comus  is a mutation detection and deposition system for developing specific lsdbs.
to embody the comus system and to validate its clinical utility, we have chosen the disease hemophilia as a test database.
lsdbs made using comus will promote the clinical utility of lsdbs.

comus contains 1) a dna sequence mutation analysis method for clinicians' mutation data identification and deposition and 2) a curation system for variation detection from clinicians' input data.
a set of data files from bench experiments and clinical information from hemophilia patients were tested on the lsdb, kohemgene http://www.kohemgene.org, which has proven to be a clinician-friendly interface for mutation detection and deposition.
comus is a bioinformatics system for detecting and depositing new mutations from patient dna with a clinician-friendly interface.
