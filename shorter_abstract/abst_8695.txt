however, no significant difference was found between rabbits with transplanted autogenous mscs  and rabbits with transplanted allogeneic mscs  either in the femur length , or in its valgus deformity .
in animal group a  autogenous mscs were implanted; in animal group b  allogeneic mscs were implanted.
the transplantation of both autogenous and allogeneic mscs into a defect of the growth plate appears as an effective method of surgical treatment of physeal cartilage injury.
the aim of this experimental study on new zealand's white rabbits was to find differences in the results of treating the distal physeal femoral defect by the transplantation of autologous or allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells .
the treatment results were evaluated morphometrically  and histologically .
after the excision of a created bone bridge in the distal physis of the right femur, modified composite scaffold with mscs was transplanted into the defect.
four months after the transplantation, the right femurs of the animals in group a were on average longer by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm  than their left femurs, the right femurs of rabbits in group b were on average longer by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm  than their left femurs.
<dig> months after the therapeutic transplantation of mscs valgus deformity of the distal part of the right femur of animals in group a was significantly lower  than that of their left femur , in group b as well .
after the mscs transplantation the presence of a newly formed hyaline cartilage was demonstrated histologically in all the animals .
the ability of transplanted mscs to survive in the damaged physis was demonstrated in vivo by magnetic resonance, in vitro by perls reaction and immunofluorescence.
an iatrogenic physeal defect of the left femur of each animal not treated by mscs transplantation served as control.
