however, currently available implementations of spectral clustering methods mostly consist of a few loosely coupled matlab scripts that assume a fair amount of familiarity with matlab programming and hence they are inaccessible for large parts of the research community.
scps was tested on difficult sets of proteins whose relationships were extracted from the scop database, and its results were extensively compared with those obtained using other popular protein clustering algorithms such as tribemcl, hierarchical clustering and connected component analysis.
besides the spectral method, scps also implements connected component analysis and hierarchical clustering, it integrates tribemcl, it provides different cluster quality tools, it can extract human-readable protein descriptions using gi numbers from ncbi, it interfaces with external tools such as blast and cytoscape, and it can produce publication-quality graphical representations of the clusters obtained, thus constituting a comprehensive and effective tool for practical research in computational biology.
we also demonstrate the scalability of scps by clustering the entire scop database  and the complete genome of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae .
the method uses only pairwise sequence similarities, and is therefore practical when only sequence information is available.
an important problem in genomics is the automatic inference of groups of homologous proteins from pairwise sequence similarities.
source code and precompiled executables for windows, linux and mac os x are freely available at http://www.paccanarolab.org/software/scps.
it was shown recently that global methods such as spectral clustering have better performance on a wide variety of datasets.
