this study was undertaken to assess the relative role played by ihf and styr-p on the ure, and to clarify if pstya catabolite repression could rely on the interplay of these regulators.
the balance between the open and the closed promoter conformation would determine a fine modulation of the promoter activity.
an open conformation is operative in inducing conditions when styr-p is bound to sty <dig> site and ihf to the ure.
since styr and ihf protein levels do not vary in the different conditions, the key-factor regulating pstya catabolite repression is likely the kinase activity of the styr-cognate sensor protein stys.
under catabolite repression conditions styr-p cellular levels would increase, displacing ihf from the ure and closing the promoter in a repressed conformation.
pstya regulation relies on the stys/styr two-component system and on the ihf global regulator.
styr-p bound to both sty <dig> and sty <dig> sites oligomerizes, likely promoting the formation of a dna loop that closes the promoter in a repressed conformation.
a cis-acting element upstream of sty <dig>  named ure, contains a low-affinity styr-p binding site , overlapping the ihf binding site.
under catabolite repression conditions, styr-p binds the sty <dig> site, replacing ihf at the ure region.
we found that styr and ihf protein levels did not change in catabolite repression conditions, implying that pstya repression is achieved through an increase in the styr-p/styr ratio.
in pseudomonas fluorescens st, the promoter of the styrene catabolic operon, pstya, is induced by styrene and is subject to catabolite repression.
deletion of the ure led to a decrease of promoter activity in inducing conditions and to a partial release of catabolite repression.
styr-p and ihf compete for binding to the ure region.
we propose a model according to which the activity of the pstya promoter is determined by conformational changes.
