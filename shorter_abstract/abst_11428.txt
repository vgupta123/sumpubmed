mucosal epithelia, including those of the oviduct, secrete antimicrobial innate immune molecules .
even though the sbd- <dig> is an important aiim and it is regulated closely by estrogenic hormone, the regulation mechanism of 17β-estradiol has not been clearly established.
taken together, e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> expressions were gpr30-dependent during prophase and ers-dependent during later-stage in ovine oviduct epithelial cells, and we assume that the effect was completed by the pka, pkc, and nf-κb pathways simultaneous.
we investigated the effects of e <dig> and agonist or inhibitor on ovine oviduct epithelial cells in regard to sbd- <dig> expression using reverse transcription quantitative pcr .
17beta-estradiol  induced release of sbd- <dig> in ovine oviduct epithelial cells.
