we provide additional information by analyzing the situation of serpina <dig> in the bovine genome.
our experimental results update data of the bovine genome sequencing, substantially increase the bovserpina <dig> sub-family and enrich the phylogenetic tree of serpins.
finally, in the context of phylogenetic analyses, we improved our knowledge on mammalian serpinas evolution.
however, although there is a similar genic organization with a high degree of sequence conservation, the reactive-centre-loop domains, which are responsible for the protease specificity, show significant divergences.
a cluster of eight genes and one pseudogene sharing a high degree of identity and the same structural organization was characterized.
in the cluster, we described an original sub-group of six members with an unexpected high degree of conservation for the reactive-centre-loop domain, suggesting a similar peptidase inhibitory pattern.
the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors  is involved in numerous fundamental biological processes as inflammation, blood coagulation and apoptosis.
we provide new opportunities for future investigations to approach the biological functions of this unusual subset of serine proteinase inhibitors.
