current protocols for preparing dna for next-generation targeted sequencing are labor-intensive, require large amounts of starting material, and are prone to artifacts that result from necessary pcr amplification of sequencing libraries.
our method involves circularization of a specific genomic dna molecule that directly incorporates the necessary components for conducting sequencing in a single assay and requires only one pcr amplification step.
we also show that specific regions of the genome can be targeted and sequenced without any pcr amplification.
for next generation dna sequencing, we have developed a rapid and simple approach for preparing dna libraries of targeted dna content.
in this proof-of-concept study, we present an integrated approach that combines these two separate steps into one.
