using bioinformatics, we assessed the fate of the four dental proteins thought to be specific to enamel  and to dentin  in the chicken genome.
recently, tooth germs similar to crocodile rudimentary teeth were found in a chicken mutant.
however, experiments in chicken have revealed that the oral epithelium can respond to inductive signals from mouse mesenchyme, leading to reactivation of the odontogenic pathway.
the next odontogenetic step would have been tooth differentiation, involving deposition of dental proteins.
the ability to form teeth was lost in an ancestor of all modern birds, approximately 100- <dig> million years ago.
these findings not only imply that functional teeth with enamel covering, as present in ancestral aves, will never be obtained in birds, but they also indicate that these four protein genes were dental specific, at least in the last toothed ancestor of modern birds, a specificity which has been questioned in recent years.
these "chicken teeth" did not develop further, but the question remains whether functional teeth with enamel cap would have been obtained if the experiments had been carried out over a longer time period or if the chicken mutants had survived.
conservation of gene synteny in amniotes allowed definition of target dna regions in which we searched for sequence similarity.
ambn and enam disappeared after chromosomal rearrangements occurred in the candidate region in a bird ancestor.
