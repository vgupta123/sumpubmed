monosporascus cannonballus is the main causal agent of melon vine decline disease.
however, a detailed molecular view on the early interaction between m. cannonballus and melon roots in either susceptible or resistant genotypes is lacking.
our results indicate a dissimilar behavior of the susceptible vs. the resistant genotypes from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi.
transcriptional differences in the activation of the ja-mediated response in ‘pat 81’ compared to ‘ps’ suggested that ja response might be partially responsible for their observed differences in resistance.
at  <dig> dpi the total number of differentially expressed genes identified in ‘ps’ declined from  <dig> to  <dig>  while the total number of differentially expressed transcripts in ‘pat 81’ increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  several deregulated transcripts coded for components of ca2+ and jasmonic acid  signalling pathways, as well as for other proteins related to defence mechanisms.
several studies have been carried out mainly focused on the study of the penetration of this pathogen into melon roots, the evaluation of symptoms severity on infected roots, and screening assays for breeding programs.
this study was carried out at  <dig> and  <dig> days after infection  by m. cannonballus.
