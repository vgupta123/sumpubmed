of all detected cnvrs,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cnvrs directly overlapped with sus scrofa duplicated sequences and pig qtls, respectively.
recent studies have shown that copy number variation  in mammalian genomes contributes to phenotypic diversity, including health and disease status.
two hundred and fifty-nine cnvrs across chromosomes 1â€“ <dig> and x were identified, with an average size of  <dig>  kb and a median size of  <dig>  kb, covering  <dig>  mb or  <dig> % of the whole genome.
using  <dig> k array cgh  we described a map of porcine cnvs which facilitated the identification of structural variations for important phenotypes and the assessment of the genetic diversity of pigs.
concerning copy number status,  <dig>  cnvrs were called as gains,  <dig>  were called as losses and the remaining  <dig>  were called as both gains and losses.
