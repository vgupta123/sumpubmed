one important feature is that the user is guided during the alignment correction step by a consensus dotplot, which displays all thermodynamically optimal base pairs and the corresponding covariation.
moreover we use construct to predict tertiary interactions from sequences of the internal ribosome entry site of crp-like viruses.
to this purpose construct combines sequence alignment, thermodynamic data and various measures of covariation.
we present an extended version of construct, a semi-automatic, graphical tool suitable for creating rna alignments correct in terms of both consensus sequence and consensus structure.
once the initial alignment is corrected, optimal and suboptimal secondary structures as well as tertiary interaction can be predicted.
we demonstrate construct's ability to guide the user in correcting an initial alignment, and show an example for optimal secondary consensus structure prediction on very hard to align secis elements.
automatically created ncrna alignments often need manual corrections, yet this manual refinement is tedious and error-prone.
in addition we show that alignments specifically designed for benchmarking can be easily be optimized using construct, although they share very little sequence identity.
it combines several algorithms for prediction of secondary consensus structure and even tertiary interactions.
high quality alignments, however, are a prerequisite for most consensus structure prediction approaches, homology searches, and tools for phylogeny inference.
