verticillium dahliae is a phytopathogenic fungal pathogen that causes vascular wilt diseases responsible for considerable decreases in cotton yields.
the complex mechanism underlying cotton resistance to verticillium wilt remains uncharacterized.
we cloned the ribosomal protein l <dig>  gene, which mediates resistance to verticillium wilt, from a wilt-resistant cotton species .
our findings provide new insights into the role of garpl <dig>  indicating that it plays a crucial role in resistance to cotton “cancer”, also known as verticillium wilt, mainly regulated by an sa-related signaling pathway mechanism.

however, previous studies revealed that some ribosomal proteins are also inhibitory toward oncogenesis and congenital diseases in humans and play a role in plant disease defense.
the enhanced resistance of transgenic a. thaliana plants to v. dahliae is likely mediated by the sa pathway.
here, we observed that v. dahliae infections induce garpl <dig> expression.
wilt-resistant cotton species in which garpl <dig> was silenced became more susceptible to v. dahliae than the control plants because of a significant decrease in the abundance of immune-related molecules.
the plants overexpressing garpl <dig> were more resistant to v. dahliae infections than the wild-type col- <dig> plants.
furthermore, we determined that the garpl <dig> expression pattern is consistent with the disease resistance level of different cotton varieties.
