this study examines the role of igf <dig> in the yolk sac placenta of the tammar wallaby, macropus eugenii.
igf <dig> mrna levels were highest in the vascular region of the yolk sac placenta.
igf <dig> mrna and protein were produced in the marsupial placenta.
this is the first demonstration of a physiological role for any imprinted gene in marsupial placentation.
igf <dig> increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression in placental explant cultures, suggesting that igf <dig> promotes vascularisation of the yolk sac.
the conserved imprinting of igf <dig> in this marsupial and in all eutherian species so far investigated, but not in monotremes, suggests that imprinting of this gene may have originated in the placenta of the therian ancestor.
