erroneous sequences were pre-dominantly of correct length and contained single nucleotide substitutions.
however, a high association of errors with phred score, high relatedness of erroneous sequences with the parental sequence, dominance of specific nt substitutions, and skewed ratio of forward to reverse reads among erroneous sequences indicate approaches to filter erroneous sequences from repertoire data sets.
caution is needed in interpreting repertoire data due to potential contamination with mis-sequence reads.
filtering for lower quality sequences diminished but did not eliminate sequence errors, which occurred within 1-6% of sequences.
rates of specific substitutions varied dramatically in a position-dependent manner.
solid phase amplification and sequencing rather than liquid sample amplification and preparation appeared to be the primary sources of error.
recent advances in massively parallel sequencing have increased the depth at which t cell receptor  repertoires can be probed by >3log <dig>  allowing for saturation sequencing of immune repertoires.
