it is unclear in the γ-proteobacterium s. oneidensis whether tca is also regulated by fur and ryhb.
further experiments suggested that ryhb was up-regulated in fur mutant, but that acna and sdha were not controlled by ryhb.
in the present study, we showed that a fur deletion mutant of s. oneidensis could utilize tca compounds.
to explore this observation further, we identified a ryhb gene in shewanella species and experimentally demonstrated the gene expression.
these cumulative results delineate an important difference of the fur-ryhb regulatory cycle between s. oneidensis and other γ-proteobacteria.
consistently, expression of the tca cycle genes acna and sdha was not down-regulated in the mutant.
it is well established in e. coli and vibrio cholerae that strains harboring mutations in the ferric uptake regulator gene  are unable to utilize tricarboxylic acid  compounds, due to the down-regulation of key tca cycle enzymes, such as acna and sdhabcd.
this work represents a step forward for understanding the unique regulation in s. oneidensis.
