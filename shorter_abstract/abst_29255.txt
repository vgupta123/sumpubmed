results reveal that the following properties are effective in predicting the binding affinity of heterodimeric protein complexes: apparent partition energy based on buried molar fractions, relations between chemical structure and biological activity in principal component analysis iv, and normalized frequency of beta turn.
svm-bac yielded the training accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, auc and test accuracy of  <dig> %,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, better than existing machine learning algorithms.
the characterization analysis revealed that the average numbers of beta turns and hydrogen bonds at protein-protein interfaces in high binding affinity complexes are more than those in low binding affinity complexes.
this work proposes a support vector machine  based binding affinity classifier, called svm-bac, to classify heterodimeric protein complexes based on the prediction of their binding affinity.
most machine learning approaches have been developed for predicting the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes based on structure and functional information.
the  <dig> features and support vector regression were further used to estimate the binding affinities  of  <dig> heterodimeric protein complexes.
this work aims to predict the binding affinity of heterodimeric protein complexes from sequences only.
svm-bac identified  <dig> of  <dig> sequence descriptors  to classify  <dig> heterodimeric protein complexes into low and high binding affinity.
the proposed sequence-based prediction method svm-bac uses an optimal feature selection method to identify  <dig> informative features to classify and predict binding affinity of heterodimeric protein complexes.
prediction performance of a jackknife test was the correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and mean absolute error of  <dig> .
protein-protein interactions  are involved in various biological processes, and underlying mechanism of the interactions plays a crucial role in therapeutics and protein engineering.
we further analyze three informative physicochemical properties according to their contribution to prediction performance.
