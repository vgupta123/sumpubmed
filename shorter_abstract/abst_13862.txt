assays were repeated after addition of sodium azide, in order to block efflux pumps.
a decrease of the intensity of fluorescence of candida cells was systematically observed, as well as a significant reduced intracellular uptake of  itraconazole in cells treated with propofol infusion, even after the blockade of efflux pumps.
radioactivity assays were also performed in order to quantify the input of - itraconazole into the fungal cell in the presence of propofol.
this effect seems to be related to the reduced access and/or permeabilization to fungal cells by antifungals.
an increase of minimal fungicidal concentrations regarding both candida and aspergillus strains was found for all antifungals when incubated simultaneously with propofol infusion.
the results obtained when testing with the lipid vehicle were similar.
candida and aspergillus were studied regarding the ability to grow and its susceptibility profile to antifungals in the presence of propofol infusion   and its lipidic vehicle.
the intensity of fluorescence after staining with fun <dig>  in the presence and absence of propofol infusion, was determined by flow cytometry.
propofol infusion promoted budding of candida and the germination of aspergillus, latter forming a lipid layer around the hypha.
propofol infusion, due to its lipidic vehicle, increased the fungal germination and promoted resistance to antifungals.
propofol is often administered to intensive care units as a sedative.
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of propofol lipidic infusion upon the growth and susceptibility profile of pathogenic fungi.
