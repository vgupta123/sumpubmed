spatiotemporal expression studies revealed that this gene is also highly expressed in nodule primordia and subsequently becomes restricted to the meristem and distal infection zone of a mature nodules.
additionally, we show that mtd <dig> is co-expressed with mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig> in nodule primordia and in the infection zone of mature nodules.
our data show that the phosphate-starvation responsive strigolactone biosynthesis gene mtd <dig> is also rapidly induced by rhizobium lco signals in an mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp2-dependent manner.
we provide evidence that mtd <dig> is involved in strigolactone biosynthesis in m. truncatula roots upon phosphate stress.
strigolactones are a class of plant hormones whose biosynthesis is activated in response to phosphate starvation.
d <dig> expression is known to be responsive to phosphate starvation.
symbiotic expression of mtd <dig> requires components of the symbiosis signaling pathway; including mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi <dig>  mtdmi3/mtccamk and in part mtern <dig>  this in contrast to mtd <dig> expression upon phosphate starvation, which only requires mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig>

in medicago truncatula and rice  this transcriptional response requires the gras-type proteins nsp <dig> and nsp2; both proteins are essential for rhizobium induced root nodule formation in legumes.
a similar expression pattern was found for mtccd <dig> and mtccd <dig>  rhizobium lipo-chitooligosaccharide  application experiments revealed that of these genes mtd <dig> is most responsive in an mtnsp <dig> and mtnsp <dig> dependent manner.
in line with this, we questioned whether mtnsp1-mtnsp <dig> dependent mtd <dig> regulation is co-opted in rhizobium symbiosis.
