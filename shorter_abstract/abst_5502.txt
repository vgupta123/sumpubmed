genes for the production of a broad range of fungal secondary metabolites are frequently colinear.
co-expression group profiles were used to define positionally clustered genes and a number of members of these clusters encode proteins participating in secondary metabolism.
systematic searches revealed dispersed and compact clusters of co-expressed genes, often containing a transcription factor, and typically containing genes involved in biosynthetic pathways.
the topological structure of transcriptional networks was also examined to investigate control mechanisms for mycotoxin biosynthesis and other processes.
transcriptional networks exhibit a layered structure in which the position in the hierarchy of a regulator is closely linked to the dbd structural class.

analysis of the promoter regions of co-expressed genes showed enrichment for conserved dna-sequence motifs.
