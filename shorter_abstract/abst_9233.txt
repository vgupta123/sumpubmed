during its growth, high levels of dbt were removed in the first 24 hours, and a rapid dbt degradation within the first hour of incubation was observed when resting cells were used.
the presence of mgso <dig> in growth medium as an additional sulfur source has interfered with dbt degradation.
compared to other reported dbt-degrading strains, the rr- <dig> isolate showed the highest capacity for dbt degradation ever described in quantitative terms.
in this sense, we hypothesized that bacterial isolates from tropical landfarm soils can demonstrate the ability to degrade dibenzothiophene , the major sulfur-containing compound present in fuels.
nine bacterial isolates previously obtained from a tropical landfarm soil were tested for their ability to degrade dibenzothiophene .
detection of 2-hydroxybiphenyl , a marker for the 4s pathway, suggests this strain has metabolical capability for dbt desulfurization.
to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that a bacillus strain can metabolize dbt via the 4s pathway.
