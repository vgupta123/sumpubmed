we developed a method named kmerforest that used a random forest classifier with k-mer counts to predict accessible chromatin regions purely based on dna sequences.
we demonstrated that our method outperforms existing methods in distinguishing known accessible chromatin regions from random genomic sequences.
based on this model, we assessed importance of the k-mer features by a series of permutation experiments, and we characterized the risk of a single nucleotide polymorphism  on the function of the genome using the difference between the importance of the k-mer features affected by the occurrence of the snp.
particularly, our model correctly prioritized snps that are proved to be enriched for the binding sites ofÂ foxa <dig> in breast cancer cell lines from previous studies.
in spite of the common agreement that such variants may disrupt biological functions of their hosting regulatory elements, it remains a great challenge to characterize the risk of a genetic variant within the implicated genome sequence.
we conducted a series of experiments and showed that our model can well discriminate between pathogenic and normal snps.
furthermore, the performance of our method can further be improved with the incorporation of sequence conservation features.
most disease-associated variants identified by genome-wide association studies  exist in noncoding regions.
