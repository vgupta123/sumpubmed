the selectivity of this process may indicate that this uptake plays an important role in pathogen physiology or virulence during infection and the phenomenon itself may give rise to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
these findings were confirmed by detection of igg in the lysate of infected cells by western blot hybridization.
this report provides evidence that immunoglobulin, inherently present in the extracellular environment in vivo and in vitro, enters infected cells and accumulates within the chlamydial inclusion.
sequestration of a host cell-derived protein within the chlamydial inclusion, although unexpected, is not an unprecedented occurrence.
using epi-fluorescent and confocal microscopy, this selective uptake of ig is shown to occur among human leukocytes in vivo as well as cells cultured in vitro.
however, selective accumulation of an exogenous host protein, such as extracellular igg, has not been previously reported in connection with chlamydial infections.
obligate intracellular pathogens belonging to the chlamydiaceae family possess a number of mechanisms by which to manipulate the host cell and surrounding environment.
accumulation of these molecules within the inclusion and the failure of bovine serum albumin or f <dig> fragments to accumulate in a similar manner suggests the process of entry is specific for intact igg molecules and not a result of pinocytosis, diffusion, or any other mass endocytic event.
