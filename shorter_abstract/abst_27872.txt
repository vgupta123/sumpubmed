the fossil record and phylogenetics combine to predict the occurrence of molecular fossils of tooth-specific genes in the genomes of edentulous amniotes, and in every case these molecular fossils have been discovered.
previous studies have documented the molecular decay of tooth-specific genes in edentulous mammals, all of which lost their teeth in the cenozoic, and birds, which lost their teeth in the cretaceous.
we queried available genomes of testudines , aves , and enamelless mammals  for remnants of three enamel matrix protein  genes with putative enamel-specific functions.
among enamelless mammals, all three emp genes exhibit inactivating mutations in orycteropus and choloepus.
the widespread occurrence of emp pseudogenes in turtles, birds, and edentulous/enamelless mammals also provides compelling evidence that in amniotes, the only unique, non-redundant function of these genes is in enamel formation.
by contrast with mammals and birds, tooth loss in turtles occurred in the jurassic , providing an extended time window for tooth gene degradation in this clade.
our results highlight the power of combining fossil and genomic evidence to decipher macroevolutionary transitions and characterize the functional range of different loci involved in tooth development.
we also show that there are inactivated copies of ambn, amel and enam in representatives of divergent avian lineages including galloanserae, passeriformes, and psittaciformes, and that there are shared frameshift mutations in all three genes that predate the basal split in neognathae.
secondary edentulism  has evolved on multiple occasions in amniotes including several mammalian lineages , birds, and turtles.
the release of the painted turtle and chinese softshell turtle genomes provides an opportunity to recover the decayed remains of tooth-specific genes in testudines.
