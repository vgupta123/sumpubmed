the results of the spm analysis indicated that cbf in the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, frontal lobe, temporal lobe and cerebellum was significantly different among the five participants .
this method has great potential for locating the remodeled neuron regions of amputees with myoelectric hands after rehabilitation.
rehabilitation, which is essential for amputees with myoelectric hands, can improve the quality of daily life by remodeling the neuron network.
our study demonstrated that the cbf spect-ca method can detect the brain blood perfusion changes induced by rehabilitation with high sensitivity and accuracy.
moreover, spect-ca showed that the activated brain areas mainly included the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, cerebellum and extensive cerebral cortex.
