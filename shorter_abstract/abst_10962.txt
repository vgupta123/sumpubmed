a gene with carboxy-lyase activity and one of unpredicted function were significantly overexpressed in accessory glands of sexually mature males.
in this study, we investigated genes, which are preferentially expressed in male accessory glands of the ant leptothorax gredleri, to determine which proteins might be transferred in the seminal fluid.
our findings indicate that male accessory glands of l. gredleri express a series of genes that are unique to this species, possibly representing novel genes, in addition to conserved ones for which functions can be predicted.
identifying differentially expressed genes might help to better understand molecular mechanisms involved in reproductive processes in eusocial hymenoptera.
twelve had mutual best matches with genes predicted for apis mellifera and nasonia vitripennis.
during mating, insect males eject accessory gland proteins  into the female genital tract.
indeed, mating appears to increase female longevity in at least one ant species.
while the novel genes could account for rapidly evolving ones driven by intra-sexual conflict between males, conserved genes imply that rather beneficial traits might get fixed by a process described as inter-sexual cooperation between males and females.
by a suppression subtractive hybridization protocol we obtained  <dig> unique sequences .
six genes were further analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr in three life cycle stages of male ants.
whereas sexual conflict abounds in non-social species, the peculiar life history of social insects  with lifelong pair-bonding and no re-mating aligns the reproductive interests of the sexes.
