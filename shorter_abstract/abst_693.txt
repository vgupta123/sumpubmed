our results suggest a new level of regulation of hedgehog signaling by estrogen related receptor β, and indicate modulation of estrogen related receptor β can be a new strategy to regulate various functions driven by the hedgehog signaling pathway.
esrrb expression altered  <dig> genes, while hedgehog signaling activation alone altered  <dig> genes.
we hypothesize that estrogen related receptor β can modulate the hedgehog signaling pathway and affect hedgehog driven downstream gene expression.
