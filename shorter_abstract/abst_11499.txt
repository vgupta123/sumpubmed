we determine that median polish summarization is responsible for generating a large proportion of these over-similarity artifacts.
although these techniques have been widely benchmarked in the context of differential gene expression analysis, there are only few examples where their performance has been assessed in respect to coexpression-based studies such as sample classification.
we finally provide a correction to the rma/gcrma summarization procedure that massively reduces inter-array correlation artifacts, without affecting the detection of differentially expressed genes.
high-throughput measurement of transcript intensities using affymetrix type oligonucleotide microarrays has produced a massive quantity of data during the last decade.
in the present paper we benchmark the three most used normalization procedures  in the context of inter-array correlation analysis, confirming and extending the finding that rma and gcrma consistently overestimate sample similarity upon normalization.
