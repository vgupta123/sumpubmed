cnvscan consists of two steps: cnv screening and cnv annotation.
however, exonic cnv prediction programs have shown high false positive cnv counts, which is the major limiting factor for the applicability of these programs in clinical studies.
cnv screening evaluates cnv prediction using quality scores and refines this using an in-house cnv database, which greatly reduces the false positive rate.
the annotation step provides functionally and clinically relevant information using multiple source datasets.
with advances in next generation sequencing technology and analysis methods, single nucleotide variants  and indels can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity in exome sequencing data.
we assessed the performance of cnvscan on cnv predictions from five different prediction programs using  <dig> exomes from primary immunodeficiency  patients, and identified pidd-causing cnvs in three individuals from two different families.
we have developed a tool  to improve the clinical utility of computational cnv prediction in exome data.
this improves the clinical utility of cnv detection in exome data.
recent studies have demonstrated the ability to detect disease-causing copy number variants  in exome sequencing data.
