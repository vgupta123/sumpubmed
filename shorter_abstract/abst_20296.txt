beta-diversity estimates with double principle coordinate analysis  were more robust against errors introduced in processing than weighted unifrac.
even when using the same classification pipeline, the specific otu-generation strategy, reference database and downstream analysis methods selection can have a dramatic effect on the accuracy of taxonomic classification, and alpha- and beta-diversity estimation.
our synthetic data closely matched the composition and complexity of actual healthy human stool microbiomes.
the degree of miscall varied by clade of organism, pipeline and specific settings used.
here we evaluate the accuracy of operational taxonomic unit  generation, taxonomic classification, alpha- and beta-diversity measures for different settings in qiime, mothur and a pplacer-based classification pipeline, using a novel software package: decard.
species-level classification was less successful, ; miscall rates were comparable to those of genus-level targets .
even minor changes in settings adversely affected the accuracy of the results, bringing them far from the best-observed result.
miscall rates varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %.
genus-level taxonomic classification was correctly done for only  <dig> â€“ <dig> % of the source organisms.
in-silico we generated  <dig> synthetic bacterial communities approximating human stool microbiomes to be used as a gold-standard for evaluating the colligative performance of microbiome analysis software.
otu generation accuracy varied by strategy , reference database, algorithm and software implementation.
microbiome studies commonly use 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to characterize microbial communities.
thus, specific details of how a pipeline is used  should be specified in the methods section of all microbiome studies.
