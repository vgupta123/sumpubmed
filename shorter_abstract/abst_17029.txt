myb transcription factors are involved in plant development, secondary metabolism, hormone signal transduction, disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance.
gene structure analysis revealed that myb family genes possess relatively more number of introns in the middle as compared with c- and n-terminal regions of the predicted genes.
myb genes encoding r2r <dig> repeat myb proteins retained conserved gene structure with three exons and two introns, whereas genes encoding r1r2r <dig> repeat containing proteins consist of six exons and five introns.
a comparative analysis of myb family genes in rice and arabidopsis will help reveal the evolution and function of myb genes in plants.
a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of chromosomal distribution, tandem repeats and phylogenetic relationship of myb family genes in rice and arabidopsis suggested their evolution via duplication.
myb proteins are classified into four major groups namely, 1r-myb, 2r-myb, 3r-myb and 4r-myb based on the number and position of myb repeats.
plant myb proteins are characterized by a highly conserved myb dna-binding domain.
consensus motif analysis of 1kb upstream region  of myb gene orfs led to the identification of conserved and over-represented cis-motifs in both rice and arabidopsis.
genome-wide comparative analysis of myb genes and their expression analysis identified several mybs with potential role in development and stress response of plants.
real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed that several members of mybs are up-regulated by various abiotic stresses both in rice and arabidopsis.
the myb gene family comprises one of the richest groups of transcription factors in plants.
a genome-wide analysis identified at least  <dig> and  <dig> myb genes in rice and arabidopsis, respectively.
the splicing pattern is similar among r1r2r <dig> myb genes in arabidopsis.
