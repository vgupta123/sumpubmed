a single ancestral lineage evolved into about two-thirds of this enormous biodiversity  and is currently distributed throughout the world's continents except antarctica.
the present timetree demonstrates that survival of the ancestral lineages through the two consecutive mass extinctions on pangaea, and subsequent radiations during the jurassic through early cretaceous shaped the modern familial diversity of otophysans.
a relaxed molecular clock bayesian analysis of the divergence times and reconstruction of ancestral habitats on the timetree suggest a pangaean origin and mesozoic radiation of otophysans.
this formidable ghost range partially reflects a genuine difference between the estimated ages of stem group origin  and crown group morphological diversification ; the ghost range, however, would be filled with discoveries of older fossils that can be used as more reasonable time constraints as well as with developments of more realistic models that capture the rates of molecular sequences accurately.
to gain insight into the history of otophysan diversification, we constructed a timetree based on whole mitogenome sequences across  <dig> species representing  <dig> of the  <dig> families.
despite such remarkable species diversity and ubiquity, the evolutionary history of this major freshwater fish clade, otophysi, remains largely unexplored.
this evolutionary scenario is consistent with recent arguments based on biogeographic inferences and molecular divergence time estimates.
no fossil otophysan, however, has been recorded before the albian, the early cretaceous 100- <dig> ma, creating an over  <dig> million year time span without fossil evidence.
partitioned maximum likelihood analysis based on unambiguously aligned sequences  confidently recovered the monophyly of otophysi and the two constituent subgroups .
