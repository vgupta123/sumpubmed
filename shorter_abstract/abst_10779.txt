consensus building from sequences sharing the same tag enables inference of original template molecules thereby reducing effects of sequencing error and polymerase chain reaction bias.
mt-toolbox provides an accessible, user-friendly environment for analysis of molecule tagged reads thereby reducing technical errors and polymerase chain reaction bias.
short oligonucleotides can be used as markers to tag and track dna sequences.
for example, barcoding techniques  use short oligonucleotides to distinguish between reads from different dna samples pooled for high-throughput sequencing.
mt-toolbox includes a graphical user interface, command line interface, and options for speed and accuracy maximization.
a similar technique called molecule tagging uses the same principles but is applied to individual dna template molecules.
the resulting amplicon sequences can be traced back to their original templates by their oligonucleotide tag.
each template molecule is tagged with a unique oligonucleotide prior to polymerase chain reaction.
several independent groups have developed similar protocols for molecule tagging; however, user-friendly software for build consensus sequences from molecule tagged reads is not readily available or is highly specific for a particular protocol.
