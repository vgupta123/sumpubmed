a comprehensive analysis was undertaken for promoter sequences from arabidopsis thaliana, drosophila melanogaster, homo sapiens and oryza sativa, and a more extensive analysis of tissue-specific promoters in humans.
is there a structural relationship of these sequences in different tissues?
moreover, in humans, we found that different tissues use distinct classes of promoters, reflecting an emerging promoter network.
to fully understand the connections between gene promoters and gene expression, we analyzed thousands of promoter sequences using our kappa index of coincidence method and a specialized optical character recognition  neural network.
our conclusions are based on comprehensive data from three different databases and a new computer model whose core is using kappa index of coincidence.
in order to gain valuable insights into different promoter regions, we obtained a series of image-based patterns which allowed us to identify  <dig> generic classes of promoters.
generally, promoters have been classified in two major classes, namely tata and cpg.
the main function of gene promoters appears to be the integration of different gene products in their biological pathways in order to maintain homeostasis.

nevertheless, many genes using the same combinatorial formation of transcription factors have different gene expression patterns.
accordingly, we tried to ask ourselves some fundamental questions: why certain genes have an overall predisposition for higher gene expression levels than others?
furthermore, we also noticed the existence of some transitional states between these classes of promoters that may explain certain evolutionary mechanisms, which suggest a possible predisposition for specific levels of gene expression and perhaps for a different number of factors responsible for triggering gene expression.
