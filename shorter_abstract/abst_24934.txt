our analysis shows that the knockin alleles drive expression of cre or lacz in all tecs in the fetal thymus.
however, investigation of the mechanisms by which tecs perform these functions has been inhibited by the lack of genetic tools.
these data show that multiplex gene targeting into the 3' utr of the foxn <dig> locus is an efficient method to express any gene of interest in tecs from the earliest stage of thymus organogenesis.
the resulting alleles will make possible new molecular and genetic studies of tec differentiation and function.
since the foxn <dig> gene is expressed in all presumptive tecs from the early stages of thymus organogenesis and broadly in the adult thymus, it is an ideal locus for driving gene expression in differentiating and mature tecs.
thymic epithelial cells  promote thymocyte maturation and are required for the early stages of thymocyte development and for positive selection.
we simultaneously electroporated the two targeting vectors to generate the two independent alleles in the same experiment, demonstrating the feasibility of multiplex gene targeting at this locus.
