knowledge from pas should enable more accurate applications in several areas where sentence understanding is required like machine translation and text summarization.
a consensus in the ie community is emerging on the necessity for exploiting deeper knowledge structures such as through the relations between a verb and its arguments shown by predicate-argument structure .
the hypothesis we explore is that pas holds the key for understanding relationships describing the roles of genes and gene products in mediating their biological functions.
in the future we aim to expand the knowledge base to cover more verbs and the nominal form of each predicate.
the exploitation of information extraction , a technology aiming to provide instances of structured representations from free-form text, has been rapidly growing within the molecular biology  research community to keep track of the latest results reported in literature.
results confirm the necessity to analyze pas specifically for mb domain.
for this to be realized within ie a key knowledge component is the definition of pas frames.
pas frames for non-technical domains such as newswire are already being constructed in several projects such as propbank, verbnet, and framenet.
in this article, we explore the need to adapt pas for the mb domain and specify pas frames to support ie, as well as outlining the major issues that require consideration in their construction.
ie systems have traditionally used shallow syntactic patterns for matching facts in sentences but such approaches appear inadequate to achieve high accuracy in mb event extraction due to complex sentence structure.
we chose predicates describing gene expression, molecular interactions and signal transduction events with the aim of covering a number of research areas in mb.
