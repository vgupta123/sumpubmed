blood samples for complete blood count and serum biochemistry, and urine for urinalysis were collected and the dogs’ body weight was recorded at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the slit treatment.
our results demonstrate that the used peanut-slit protocol is well tolerated and safe in healthy dogs.
in order to assess the presence or absence of sensitization, dogs were challenged 6 months after the end of the study with 2000 μg of peanut extract daily for  <dig> to 14 days.
therefore, the objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the safety, tolerability and dispenser sterility of fa-slit in healthy dogs before testing it in food allergic dogs.
food allergies are increasing in prevalence but no treatment strategies are currently available to cure dogs with food allergy.
further studies should evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy in dogs with food allergy.

over the past decade, experimental food allergen-specific sublingual immunotherapy  has emerged as a potential treatment for food allergies in human medicine.
even though a significant increase in peanut-specific ige was also seen, intradermal tests were negative in all dogs before and after the experiment, and the challenge test did not trigger any adverse reactions in the treated dogs, which shows the protocol did not cause sensitization to peanut, but nevertheless primed the immune system as indicated by the humoral immune response.
sera for the determination of peanut-specific igg and ige were collected at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  intradermal tests were performed before  and after  the experiment.
peanut-specific igg significantly increased in treatment group.
subjects were monitored daily for local and systemic adverse effects.
