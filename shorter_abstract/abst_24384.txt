the patches of the decoys are significantly less compatible with the library than their corresponding native structures, allowing us to reliably distinguish native models from models generated by servers.
this trend, however, does not extend to the decoys themselves, as their similarity to the native structures does not correlate with compatibility with the library.
protein surfaces serve as an interface with the molecular environment and are thus tightly bound to protein function.
we demonstrate the biological significance of our method through the ability of the library to capture surface characteristics of native protein structures as opposed to those of decoy sets generated by state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods.
the surface patch library is the collection of all the cluster centroids; thus, each of the data set patches is close to one of the elements in the library.
we expect that this high-quality, generic surface patch library will add a new perspective to the description of protein structures and improve our ability to predict them.
we present a first step toward a general purpose representation of protein surfaces: a novel surface patch library that represents most surface patches  in a data set regardless of their functional roles.
surface patches, in this work, are small fractions of the protein surface.
as of today, there is no accepted general scheme to represent protein surfaces.
