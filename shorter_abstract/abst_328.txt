functional divergence analysis among teleost species revealed specific amino acid positions that have been subjected to altered functional constraints after duplications.
our results suggest functional divergence among paralogues which might result from long-term and differential selective pressures, and therefore, provide the indication that ucp genes may have diverse physiological functions in teleost fishes.
four ucp genes that are shared by five other fish species were identified in sea bass genome.
further experimental analysis of the critical amino acids identified here may provide valuable information on the physiological functions of ucp genes.
the exact number of uncoupling protein genes in the fish genome and their evolution is unresolved.
this work provides the first unambiguous evidence for the presence of a fourth ucp gene in teleost fish genome and brings new insights into the evolutionary history of the gene family.
here we report the first characterisation of ucp gene family members in sea bass, dicentrarchus labrax, and then retrace the evolution of the protein family in vertebrates.
phylogenetic reconstitution among vertebrate species and synteny analysis revealed that ucp <dig>  ucp <dig> and ucp <dig> evolved from duplication events that occurred in the common ancestor of vertebrates, whereas the novel fourth ucp originated specifically in the teleost lineage.
despite their importance in various physiological processes, their molecular function remains controversial.
