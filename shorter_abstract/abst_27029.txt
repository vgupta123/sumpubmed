feature selection not only enhances classification accuracy in fmri-based deception detection but also provides support for the biological hypothesis that brain activities in certain regions of the brain are important for discrimination of deception.
using  <dig> features selected from a set of  <dig>  original features as inputs for a support vector machine classifier, our results indicate that feature selection significantly enhanced the classification accuracy of the support vector machine in comparison to the models trained using all features and dimension reduction based models.
furthermore, the selected features are shown to form anatomic clusters within brain regions, which supports the hypothesis that specific brain regions may play a role during deception processes.
the high dimensionality of fmri data makes it a difficult task to directly utilize the original data as input for classification algorithms in detecting deception.
we subsequently investigated various feature selection methods including an ensemble method to identify discriminative features to detect deception.
functional magnetic resonance imaging  is a technology used to detect brain activity.
in this paper, we investigated the procedures of feature selection to enhance fmri-based deception detection.
detecting deception based on the pattern of brain activation characterized with fmri is getting attention â€“ with machine learning algorithms being applied to this field in recent years.
