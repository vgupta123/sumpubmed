specific regulatory elements regulate tardigrade mrna stability such as lox p dice elements whereas  <dig> other rna elements of higher eukaryotes are not found.
different protein clusters and regulatory elements implicated in tardigrade stress adaptations are analysed including unpublished tardigrade sequences.
to gain insights into their stress-specific adaptation potential, major clusters of related and similar proteins are identified, as well as specific functional clusters delineated comparing all tardigrades and individual species  and functional elements in tardigrade mrnas are analysed.
tardigrade-specific functional adaptations include strong protein, dna- and redox protection, maintenance and protein recycling.
