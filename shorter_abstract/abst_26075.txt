working with the mg-rast annotation server, we constructed the simple annotation of metatranscriptomes by sequence analysis  software package, a complete pipeline for the analysis of gut microbiome data.
designed for use by researchers with relatively little bioinformatics experience, samsa offers a breakdown of metatranscriptome transcription activity levels by organism or transcript function, and is fully open source.
each sample needs 40– <dig> million raw sequences, which can be expected to yield the 5– <dig> million annotated reads necessary for accurate abundance measures.
we were also able to detect significant differences between control and experimental groups in both organism transcriptional activity and specific cellular functions.
we also demonstrated that ribosomal rna depletion does not equally deplete ribosomes from all species within a sample, and remaining rrna sequences should be discarded.
samsa can summarize and evaluate raw annotation results, identifying abundant species and significant functional differences between metatranscriptomes.
we used this new tool to evaluate best practices for sequencing stool metatranscriptomes.
we further recommend that stool metatranscriptomes be ribodepleted and sequenced in a 100 bp paired end format with a minimum of  <dig> million reads per sample.
by making this new pipeline publicly available, we have created a powerful new tool for metatranscriptomics research, offering a new method for greater insight into the activity of diverse microbial communities.
