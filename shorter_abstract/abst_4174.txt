in response to treatment with a fungal elicitor, the biosynthesis and accumulation of sanguinarine is induced along with other plant defense responses in opium poppy cell cultures.
a cdna library was prepared for opium poppy cell cultures treated with a fungal elicitor for  <dig> h. using  <dig> gs-flx titanium pyrosequencing,  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  with an average length of  <dig> bp were generated.
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  of total protein extracts from cell cultures treated with a fungal elicitor for  <dig> h facilitated the identification of  <dig>  proteins.
transcripts encoding all known sanguinarine biosynthetic enzymes were identified in the est database,  <dig> of which were represented among the  <dig> most abundant transcripts.
query of an opium poppy-specific est database substantially enhanced peptide identification.
the transcript database contained full-length mrnas encoding most alkaloid biosynthetic enzymes, which is a key requirement for the functional characterization of novel gene candidates.
papaver somniferum  is the source for several pharmaceutical benzylisoquinoline alkaloids including morphine, the codeine and sanguinarine.
the transcriptional induction of alkaloid metabolism in cultured cells provides an opportunity to identify components of this process via the integration of deep transcriptome and proteome databases generated using next-generation technologies.
the integration of deep transcriptome and proteome analyses provides an effective platform to catalogue the components of secondary metabolism, and to identify genes encoding uncharacterized enzymes.
proteins were fractionated by one-dimensional sds-page and digested with trypsin prior to lc-ms/ms analysis.
eight out of  <dig> known sanguinarine biosynthetic enzymes and many relevant primary metabolic enzymes were represented in the peptide database.
the establishment of corresponding transcript and protein databases generated by next-generation technologies in a system with a well-defined metabolite profile facilitates an improved linkage between genes, enzymes, and pathway components.
