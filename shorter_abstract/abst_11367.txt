in addition, a very high data quality of up to  <dig>  Å resolution allowed distinguishing two discrete subconformations of h-ras p <dig>  expanding the knowledge about the intrinsic flexibility of ras-like proteins, which is important for their function.
in a complex of h-ras•gppnhp -triphosphate), a second mg2+ ion was found to be coordinated to the γ-phosphate group of gppnhp, which positions the hydrolytically active water molecule very close to the attacked γ-phosphorous atom.
the presented fluorescent form of h-ras p <dig> will be advantageous for fluorescence studies on h-ras p <dig> in which the use of fluorescent nucleotides is not feasible.
for this approach, a modified form of h-ras p <dig> was designed which allows reaction initiation and fluorescence readout of the initiated gtpase reaction within the crystalline state.
x-ray diffraction experiments on h-ras p <dig> in different states along the reaction pathway provide detailed information about the kinetics and mechanism of the gtpase reaction.
in kinetic crystallography, the usually static method of x-ray diffraction is expanded to allow time-resolved analysis of conformational rearrangements in protein structures.
this refinement provides an alternative and easy to interpret strategy to reflect the conformational variability within crystal structures of biological macromolecules.
