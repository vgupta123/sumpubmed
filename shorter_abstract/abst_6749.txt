at present, its dual activity as hemolysin and rna methyltransferase in m. tuberculosis has been indirectly proposed based on in vitro results.
three-dimensional modeling of tlya showed a consensus structure, having a common core formed by a six-stranded β-sheet between two α-helix layers, which is consistent with an rna methyltransferase structure.
the tlya protein has a controversial function as a virulence factor in mycobacterium tuberculosis .
altogether, our manual in silico curation suggested that tlya is involved in ribosomal biogenesis and that there is a functional annotation error regarding this protein family in several microbial and plant genomes, including the m. tuberculosis genome.
additionally, the nucleotide substitution rates suggested purifying selection during tlya gene evolution and the absence of a common ancestor between tlya proteins and bacterial pore-forming proteins.
phylogenetic analyses showed high conservation of the tlya gene among mycobacterium species.
subcellular localization prediction showed that tlya lacks a signal peptide and its hydrophobicity profile showed no evidence of transmembrane helices.
bioinformatics analysis of tlya identified a ribosomal protein binding domain , located between residues  <dig> and  <dig> as well as an ftsj-like methyltranferase domain encompassing residues  <dig> and  <dig>  all of which have been previously described in translation machinery-associated proteins.
