here, the role of jasmonates in ar formation on petunia cuttings has been studied by a reverse genetic approach.
diminished numbers of ar in ja-deficient cuttings suggest that jasmonates act as positive regulators of ar formation in petunia wild type.

however, wound-induced rise in jasmonate levels in petunia wild type cuttings seems not to be causal for increased auxin and ethylene levels and for sink establishment.
petunia is a model to study the process of adventitious root  formation on leafy cuttings.
excision of cuttings leads to a transient increase in jasmonates, which is regarded as an early, transient and critical event for rooting.
however, this effect was not accompanied by altered levels of auxin and aminocyclopropane carboxylate  or by impaired auxin and ethylene-induced gene expression.
the transgenic plants exhibited strongly reduced phaoc transcript and protein levels as well as diminished accumulation of cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine after wounding in comparison to wild type and empty vector expressing plants.
to reduce the endogenous levels of jasmonates, transgenic plants were generated expressing a petunia hybrida allene oxide cyclase -rnai construct.
