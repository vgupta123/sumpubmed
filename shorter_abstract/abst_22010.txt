to expand our understanding of stathmin function in normal cells, we compared gene expression profiles, measured by microarray and qrt-pcr, of mouse embryo fibroblasts isolated from stmn1+/+ and stmn1-/- mice to determine the transcriptome level changes present in the genetic knock-out of stathmin.
microarray analysis of stmn <dig> loss at a fold change threshold of â‰¥  <dig>  revealed expression changes for  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated.
stathmin over-expression has been correlated with cancer stage progression, while stathmin depletion leads to death of some cancer cell lines in culture.
these results support models indicating a role for stathmin in regulating cell locomotion, but also suggest that this functional activity may involve changes to the cohort of proteins expressed in the cell, rather than as a direct consequence of stathmin-dependent regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton.
microarray data and qrt-pcr analysis of mrna expression demonstrated changes in the message levels for stmn <dig>  encoding rb <dig>  a protein related to stathmin, and in alterations to many tubulin isotype mrnas.
kegg pathway analysis of the microarray data indicated changes to cell motility-related genes, and qrt-pcr plates specific for focal adhesion and ecm proteins generally confirmed the microarray data.
approximately 50% of genes up or down regulated  in stmn1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts function broadly in cell adhesion and motility.
several microtubule assembly regulators and motors were also differentially regulated in stmn1-/- cells, but these changes should not compensate for loss of stathmin.
several stathmin binding partners, in addition to tubulin, have been shown to affect cell motility in culture.
