the use of food-grade lactic acid bacteria  as dna delivery vehicles represents an attractive strategy to deliver dna vaccines at the mucosal surfaces as they are generally regarded as safe .
we previously showed that either native lactococcus lactis  or recombinant invasive ll expressing fibronectin binding protein a of staphylococcus aureus  or internalin a of listeria monocytogenes , were able to deliver and trigger dna expression by epithelial cells, either in vitro or in vivo.
moreover, the number of mice producing blg in isolated enterocytes after oral administration of ll-minla+blg in vivo was slightly higher than after oral administration of ll-blg.
after showing the expression of minla at the surface of ll-minla+ strain, in vitro gentamycin survival assay in caco- <dig> cells showed that ll-minla+ is  <dig> times more invasive than ll.
inla does not bind to its receptor, the murine e-cadherin, thus limiting the use of ll-inla+ in in vivo murine models.
in order to avoid the limitations of ll-inla+ and ll-fnbpa+, a new l. lactis strain was engineered to produce a previously described mutated form of inla  allowing the binding of minla on murine e-cadherin.

we confirmed in this study that the production of minla at the surface of l. lactis is a promising strategy for plasmid transfer in vitro and in vivo.
