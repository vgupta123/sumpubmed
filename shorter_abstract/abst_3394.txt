caesarean section of bitches is a well recognized painful condition in dogs and it can be classified as a soft tissue surgery.
blood and milk samples were collected from the bitches after each administration on day  <dig> and day  <dig> and blood samples were drawn from the pups after suckling on day  <dig>
after administration on d <dig>  the mean observed plasma cmax in bitches was  <dig>  μg/ml and the mean area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to the infinity, aucinf, was  <dig>  μg.h/ml.
cimicoxib, a newly registered nsaid in european union has a claim for the relief of pain in peri-operative conditions.
in milk, after administration on d <dig>  the mean observed cmax was  <dig>  μg/ml and the mean area under the concentration-time curve until the last measurable time point, auclast, was  <dig>  μg.h/ml.
however, in case of caesarean section, the main concerns of using nsaids are the transfer of the drugs into milk and its impact on the suckling pups.
the presented data show that cimicoxib given by oral route to lactating bitches at a single dose of 2 mg/kg had a high transfer rate into the milk with a milk to plasma ratio of  <dig>  to  <dig> .
out of  <dig> sampled pups on d <dig>  only  <dig> animals had a sample with very low cimicoxib concentrations slightly above the limit of quantification .
