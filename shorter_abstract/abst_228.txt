we have previously reported a cluster of retrogenes in the rat genome that encode putative traf- and poz-domain proteins.
exonisation of te sequences is a frequent event in the transcription of retrogenes during embryonic development and in the testis and may contribute to post-transcriptional regulation of expression of retrogenes.
most importantly, the t1/t <dig> locus is embedded within a dense field of relics of transposable element  derived mainly from line <dig> and erv sequences, and the te sequences are frequently exonised through alternative splicing to form the 5'-utr sequences of the t1/t <dig> transcripts.
we further demonstrate that the exonised 5'-utr te sequences could lead to the creation of upstream open reading frames resulting in translational repression.
the embryonic t1/t <dig> transcripts, characterised by rt-pcr-cloning and rapid amplification of cdna ends, are further found to have acquired one or more noncoding exons in the 5'-untranslated region .
