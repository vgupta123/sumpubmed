maternal yolk production, vitellogenesis, represents a significant maternal cost for reproduction and is suppressed under genetic and environmental conditions that extend lifespan.
evolutionary theories of aging propose that longevity evolves as a competition between reproduction and somatic maintenance for a finite pool of resources.
reproduction is thought to shorten lifespan by depleting resources from processes promoting somatic maintenance.
c. elegans vitellogenesis is regulated transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally in response to environmental and reproductive cues.
in order to identify mechanisms that suppress vitellogenesis under prolongevity conditions, we studied factors regulating vitellogenesis in c. elegans nematodes.
in c. elegans, vitellogenesis is depressed in the absence of insulin-like signaling .
we found that the c. elegans daf-2/iis pathway regulates vitellogenesis through two mechanisms.
