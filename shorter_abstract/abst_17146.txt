this panel was tested on  <dig> rats of  <dig> different strains and  <dig> wild rats to determine the level of polymorphism and to generate a phylogenetic network to show their genetic relationships.
snps were chosen to be equally spread along all chromosomes except y and to be polymorphic between brown norway and ss or wistar rat strains based on data from the rat hapmap eu project.
the laboratory rat  is an important model for human disease, and is extensively used for studying complex traits for example in the physiological and pharmacological fields.
we provide a fast and cost-effective platform for genome-wide snp typing, which can be used for first-pass genetic mapping and association studies in a wide variety of rat strains.
as a proof of principle we used this panel to map an obesity trait in zucker rats and confirmed significant linkage  to chromosome 5: 119â€“ <dig> mb, where the leptin receptor gene  is located .
