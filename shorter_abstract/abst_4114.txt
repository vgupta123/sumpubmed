among drr proteins, we found that proteins belonging to the nucleotide excision repair pathway were relatively more conserved than proteins needed for the other drr pathways.
the dna repair and recombination  proteins protect organisms against genetic damage, caused by environmental agents and other genotoxic agents, by removal of dna lesions or helping to abide them.
these results, altogether, provide a useful framework for further experimental studies in these organisms.
as expected, many of drr genes are very similar to those found in other eukaryotes.
beside these eukaryotes specific genes, several prokaryotes specific genes were also found to be well conserved in plants.
we identified genes potentially involved in drr mechanisms in arabidopsis and rice using similarity searches and conserved domain analysis against proteins known to be involved in drr in human, yeast and e. coli.
the similarities and dissimilarities in between plants and other organisms' drr pathways are discussed.
