the thick, viscous asm+, which contains mucin and extracellular dna levels similar to those found in the cf lung, supports the formation of biofilm-like structures similar to the aggregates described within cf airways.
alterations in environmental conditions or in the qs genes of p. aeruginosa, as occurs naturally during the progression of cf lung infection, affect the architecture and quantitative structural features of these bls.
using asm+ in a static microtiter plate culture system, we examined the roles of mucin, extracellular dna, environmental oxygen , and quorum sensing  in the development of biofilm-like structures  by p. aeruginosa; and the effect of eo <dig> and p. aeruginosa on s. aureus bls.
in an artificial mucin containing medium asm+, p. aeruginosa forms structures that resemble typical biofilms but are not attached to any surface.
under 20% eo <dig>  p. aeruginosa strain pao <dig> produced bls that resemble typical biofilms but are confined to the asm+ and not attached to the surface.
thus, asm+ provides an in vitro medium in which the effect of changing levels of substances produced by the host and the bacteria can be analyzed to determine the effect on such structures and on the susceptibility of the bacteria within the bls to various treatments.
the accumulation of thick stagnant mucus provides a suitable environment for the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus within the lung alveoli of cystic fibrosis  patients.
levels of mucin and extracellular dna within the asm+ were optimized to produce robust well developed bls.
