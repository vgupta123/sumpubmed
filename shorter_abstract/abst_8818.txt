a novel strategy for improving genome assembly from very short reads is proposed.
it can increase accuracies of assemblies by integrating de novo contigs, and produce comparative contigs by allowing multiple references without limiting to genomes of closely related strains.
comparative contigs are used to scaffold de novo contigs.
because of repetitive regions of genomes and some other factors, assembly of very short reads is still a challenging issue.
with more and more reference genomes available, our strategy will be useful to improve qualities of genome assemblies from very short reads.
using simulated and real datasets, it is shown that our strategy can effectively improve qualities of assemblies of isolated microbial genomes and metagenomes.
