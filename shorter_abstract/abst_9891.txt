plant mitochondrial dehydrin-like proteins are poorly characterized.
the mitochondrial dehydrin-like proteins observed in cauliflower and arabidopsis ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> kda and in lupin imbibed seeds and hypocotyls - from  <dig> to  <dig> kda.
cauliflower mitochondrial dehydrin-like proteins are localized mostly in the mitochondrial matrix; it seems that some of them may interact with mitochondrial membranes.
the purpose of this study was to extend previous reports on plant dehydrins by comparing the level of immunoprecipitated dehydrin-like proteins in cauliflower , arabidopsis thaliana and yellow lupin  mitochondria under cold and heat stress.
the impact of heat stress was less significant in lupin and arabidopsis than in cauliflower inflorescence mitochondria.
cold treatment increased mainly the accumulation of 10- <dig> kda cauliflower and arabidopsis dehydrin-like proteins, in the patterns different in cauliflower leaf and inflorescence mitochondria.
however, in lupin mitochondria, cold affected mainly 25- <dig> kda proteins and seemed to induce the appearance of some novel dehydrin-like proteins.
all the results reveal an unexpectedly broad spectrum of dehydrin-like proteins accumulated during some abiotic stress in the mitochondria of the plant species analyzed.
some small thermolabile dehydrin-like proteins were induced under stress conditions applied and therefore they are likely to be involved in stress response.
dehydrins represent hydrophilic proteins acting mainly during cell dehydration and stress response.
they display only limited similarity in size to those reported previously in maize, wheat and rye mitochondria.
all the analyzed plant species showed constitutive accumulation of thermostable mitochondrial putative dehydrins ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda.
