recent studies have identified the presence of a concomitantly induced haloacetate-uptake activity in mba <dig>  this uptake activity has also been found to transport acetate.
the haloacetate-uptake activity of mba <dig> was found to be induced by monochloroacetate  and monobromoacetate .
while the acetate-uptake activity was also induced by mca and mba, other alkanoates: acetate, propionate and 2-monochloropropionate  were also inducers.
while mca, mba, 2mcpa, and butyrate have no effect on acetate uptake they could significantly quenched the mca-induced mca-uptake activity.
here we showed that acetate- and mca- uptake in burkholderia species mba <dig> are two transport systems that have different induction patterns and substrate specificities.
competing solute analysis showed that acetate and propionate interrupted the acetate- and mca- induced acetate-uptake activities.
transmembrane electrochemical potential was shown to be a driving force for both acetate- and mca- transport systems.
it is envisaged that the shapes and the three dimensional structures of the solutes determine their recognition or exclusion by the two transport systems.
in burkholderia species mba <dig> haloacetate was utilized as a carbon and energy source for growth.
