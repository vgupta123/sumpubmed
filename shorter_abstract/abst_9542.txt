as such, an optimal microalgal transcriptomic database construction is a subject of urgent investigation.
there is significant increase in the number of transcriptomic data achieved and observable heterogeneity in the performance to identify differentially expressed genes in the nd treatment paradigm.
the new paralleled assembly and annotation method under hpc presented here allows the solution of large-scale data processing problems in acceptable computation time.
the high quality high-throughout sequencing data were explored using high performance computing  in a petascale data center and subjected to de novo assembly and parallelized mpiblastx search with multiple species.
dunaliella tertiolecta, a non-model oleaginous microalgal species, was sequenced via illumina miseq and hiseq  <dig> in rna-seq studies.
the results provide new insights as to how response to nd treatment in microalgae is regulated.
as a result, a transcriptome database of  <dig>  was constructed .
however, insufficient genomic or transcriptomic information of non-model microalgae has limited the understanding of their regulatory mechanisms and hampered genetic manipulation to enhance biofuel production.
this enlarged database constructed fueled the rna-seq data analysis, which was validated by a nitrogen deprivation  study that induces triacylglycerol  production.
rna-seq technology has received a lot of attention in recent years for microalgal global transcriptomic profiling.
