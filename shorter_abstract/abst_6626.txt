this first day - night study on heat stress adaption of the grapevine berry shows that the transcriptome of fleshy fruits is differentially affected by abiotic stress at night.
to date, all studies investigating the molecular regulation of fleshly fruit response to abiotic stress were only conducted during the day, overlooking possible critical night-specific variations.
the recently proposed microvine model  was grown in climatic chambers in order to circumvent common constraints and biases inevitable in field experiments with perennial macrovines.
important changes in cell wall modification related processes as well as indications for heat-induced delay of ripening and sugar accumulation were observed at véraison, an effect that was reversed at later stages.
the present results emphasize the necessity of including different developmental stages and especially several daytime points in transcriptomic studies.
the present study explores the night and day transcriptomic response of grapevine fruit to heat stress at several developmental stages.
short heat stresses  were applied at day and night to vines bearing clusters sequentially ordered according to the developmental stages along their vertical axes.
present work reveals significant differences in heat stress responsive pathways according to day or night treatment, in particular regarding genes associated with acidity and phenylpropanoid metabolism.
precise distinction of ripening stages led to stage-specific detection of malic acid and anthocyanin-related transcripts modulated by heat stress.
post-véraison berry heterogeneity within clusters was avoided by constituting homogenous batches following organic acids and sugars measurements of individual berries.
physiological processes underlying temperature response and tolerance of the grapevine fruit have not been extensively investigated.
