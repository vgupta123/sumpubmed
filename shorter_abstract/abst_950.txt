the sensitivity of the system was maximized by avoiding purification from cell lysis to amplified cdna and by optimizing the buffer conditions.
with  <dig> human embryonic stem cells  and their differentiated endothelial cells as input for high-throughput sequencing, the single-tube amplification  system revealed both well-known and other mirnas selectively enriched in each cell type.
the selective enrichment of the mirnas was further verified by qpcr with 293ft cells and a human induced pluripotent stem cell  line.
here we tried to develop a system capable of concurrently profiling both mrna and ncrna by polyadenylating rna in samples before reverse transcription.
to have a comprehensive understanding of the identities and functions of different cell types, a method to comprehensively quantify both mrna and ncrna in a sensitive manner is highly desirable.
in addition to messenger rna , noncoding rnas  are essential components in cellular machineries for translation and splicing.
besides their housekeeping functions, ncrnas are involved in cell type-specific regulation of translation, mrna stability, genome structure, and accessibility.
the single-tube amplification  system was applied to single to  <dig> cells of 293t cells, human pluripotent stem cells  and their differentiated endothelial progenies to validate its quantitative power and sensitivity by qpcr and high-throughput sequencing.
