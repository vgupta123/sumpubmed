we share experience acquired during the manual development of a lipoprotein metabolism ontology  to be used for text-mining.
ontology development for text mining should be performed in a semi-automatic way; taking atr results as input and following the guidelines we described.
the tfidf term recognition is available as web service, described at
in a corpus of  <dig> documents 53% of lmo terms are contained and 38% can be generated with one of the methods.
many of the ontology design steps remain manual and are based on personal experience and intuition.
there does not yet exist a well-defined theory and technology for ontology construction.
we compare the manually created ontology terms with the automatically derived terminology from four different automatic term recognition  methods.
the engineering of ontologies, especially with a view to a text-mining use, is still a new research field.
