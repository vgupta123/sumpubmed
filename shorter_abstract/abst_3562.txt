culicine and anopheline mosquitoes diverged ~ <dig> mya, and within the anophelines, the new world species diverged from those of the old world ~ <dig> mya.
mosquito saliva, consisting of a mixture of dozens of proteins affecting vertebrate hemostasis and having sugar digestive and antimicrobial properties, helps both blood and sugar meal feeding.
while the sialotranscriptome  of several species of the cellia subgenus of anopheles has been described thoroughly, no detailed analysis of any new world anopheline has been done to date.
darlingi proteins were found that match culicine but not anopheline proteins, indicating loss or rapid evolution of these proteins in the old world cellia subgenus.
on the other hand, several well represented salivary protein families in old world anophelines are not expressed in an.
gambiae reveals significant divergence of salivary proteins.
on average, salivary proteins are only 53% identical, while housekeeping proteins are 86% identical between the two species.
