two hundred and seven flocks of birds aged 1-20 weeks originating from different regions of the country were investigated between  <dig> and  <dig>  clinical samples  were duly processed and examined using molecular methods targeting the conservative regions of viral genomes: rna-dependent rna polymerase gene of astrovirus, non-structural  <dig> gene of parvovirus, non-structural protein  <dig> gene of rotavirus, and 5′ untranslated region fragment of turkey coronavirus.
enteric diseases are an important health problem for the intensive poultry industry, resulting in considerable economic losses.
apart from such microbiological agents associated with enteritis as bacteria and parasites, a lot of research has been recently conducted on viral origin of enteric diseases.
furthermore, our results statistically confirm that especially young birds are susceptible to infection with rotavirus and astrovirus.
however, the presented results provide valuable feedback which could help to evaluate the role of some enteric viruses in the etiology of enteritis in turkey.
applied statistical methods have indicated the dependence of rotavirus infection as well as the co-infection with multiple viruses and the health status of turkeys.
the present study aimed at determination of the prevalence of four enteric viruses, namely astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus in meat-type turkey flocks in poland as well as at statistical evaluation of the occurrence of the studied viruses and their relationships with the health status and the age of birds.
different statistical methods  were used to establish any relationships between the analyzed data.
however, enteric viruses have been identified in intestinal tract of not only diseased but also healthy poultry, so their role in enteritis is still unclear.
overall,  <dig>  of the  <dig> turkey flocks sampled were infected with one or more enteric viruses.
among the  <dig> flocks,  <dig>  were positive for one virus, whereas  <dig>  and  <dig>  were co-infected with two or three different enteric viruses, respectively.
the study demonstrated the presence of astrovirus, coronavirus, parvovirus and rotavirus infections in polish turkey farms.
the prevalence of astrovirus infection was  <dig> % , parvovirus  <dig> % , rotavirus  <dig> % , and coronavirus  <dig> % .
