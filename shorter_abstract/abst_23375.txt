this compound is known to induce death via a p53-independent pathway in several cancer cell lines.
camptothecin treatment reduced the dna relaxation activity of dna topoisomerase i in human fibroblasts.
in contrast, kinase activity of dna topoisomerase i was not affected by camptothecin, because levels of phosphorylated sr proteins were not decreased.
here, we examine the potential mechanism of camptothecin sensitivity in sma fibroblasts.
however, depletion of p <dig> by sirna did not lessen the camptothecin sensitivity in sma fibroblasts.
the smn protein is known to play a role in rna metabolism, neurite outgrowth, and cell survival.
previously, we have shown that skin fibroblasts from sma patients are more sensitive to the dna topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin, supporting a role for smn in cell survival.
even though p <dig> and smn are associated, the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin does not occur through a p53-dependent mechanism.
deletion or mutation of the survival motor neuron  <dig>  gene causes spinal muscular atrophy .
in addition, sma and control fibroblasts showed essentially identical sensitivity to this compound.
to determine if p <dig> plays a role in the increased sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to camptothecin, we analyzed the sensitivity of sma fibroblasts to another dna topoisomerase i inhibitor, β-lapachone.
by immunofluorescence staining, smn and p <dig> co-localized in gems within the nucleus, and this co-localization was overall reduced in sma fibroblasts.
we found that β-lapachone did not induce p <dig> activation in human fibroblasts.
upon camptothecin treatment, levels of p <dig> were markedly increased.
