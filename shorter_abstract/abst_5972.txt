data indicating no significant protein:protein interactions between parp- <dig> and xrcc <dig> likely results from the absence of poly in one or both binding partners, and further implicates a poly-dependent mechanism for localization of xrcc <dig> to sites of dna damage.
upon activation by encountering nicked dna, the parp- <dig> mediated trans-polyation of dna binding proteins occurs, facilitating access and accumulation of dna repair factors.
parp- <dig> also auto-ates its central brct-containing domain forming part of an interaction site for the dna repair scaffolding protein x-ray cross complementing group  <dig> protein .
the co-localization of xrcc <dig>  as well as bound dna repair factors, to sites of dna damage is important for cell survival and genomic integrity.
the parp- <dig> brct domain has the conserved brct fold that is known to be an important protein:protein interaction module in dna repair and cell signalling pathways.
here we present the solution structure and biophysical characterization of the brct domain of rat parp- <dig>  the parp- <dig> brct domain has the globular α/β fold characteristic of brct domains and has a thermal melting transition of  <dig> °c.
poly polymerase- <dig>  is one of the first proteins localized to foci of dna damage.
in contrast to a previous characterization of this domain, we demonstrate that it is monomeric in solution using both gel-filtration chromatography and small-angle x-ray scattering.
additionally, we report that the first brct domain of xrcc <dig> does not interact significantly with the parp- <dig> brct domain in the absence of adp-ribosylation.
