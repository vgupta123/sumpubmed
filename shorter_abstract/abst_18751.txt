the performance of plek was evaluated on well-annotated mrna and lncrna transcripts.
10-fold cross-validation tests on human refseq mrnas and gencode lncrnas indicated that our tool could achieve accuracy of up to  <dig> %.
we present an alignment-free tool called plek , which uses a computational pipeline based on an improved k-mer scheme and a support vector machine  algorithm to distinguish lncrnas from messenger rnas , in the absence of genomic sequences or annotations.
in addition, plek is approximately eightfold faster than a newly developed alignment-free tool, named coding-non-coding index , and  <dig> times faster than the most popular alignment-based tool, coding potential calculator , in a single-threading running manner.
plek also performed well using a simulated dataset and two real de novo assembled transcriptome datasets  with relatively high indel sequencing errors.
this requires tools that are not restricted by prior gene annotations, genomic sequences and high-quality sequencing.
high-throughput transcriptome sequencing  technology promises to discover novel protein-coding and non-coding transcripts, particularly the identification of long non-coding rnas  from de novo sequencing data.
plek is especially suitable for pacbio or  <dig> sequencing data and large-scale transcriptome data.
plek is an efficient alignment-free computational tool to distinguish lncrnas from mrnas in rna-seq transcriptomes of species lacking reference genomes.
