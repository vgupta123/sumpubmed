however, the specific position of microsporidia within the fungal tree of life is still debated.
this position of microsporidia was also strongly supported based on the combined analysis of  <dig> concatenated genes, and was robust to filters controlling for rate heterogeneity, compositional bias, long branch attraction and heterotachy.
due to the presence of accelerated evolutionary rates, phylogenetic analyses involving microsporidia are prone to methodological artifacts, such as long-branch attraction, especially when taxon sampling is limited.
once thought to be among the earliest diverging eukaryotes, the fungal nature of this group of intracellular pathogens is now widely accepted.
we show that microsporidians have a similar low level of conservation of gene neighborhood with other groups of fungi when controlling for the confounding effects of recent segmental duplications.
here we exploit the recent availability of six complete microsporidian genomes to re-assess the long-standing question of their phylogenetic position.
a combined analysis of thousands of gene trees supports a topology in which microsporidia is a sister group to all other sequenced fungi.
