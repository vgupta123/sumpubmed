however, the prevention does not interfere with bone synthesis, suggesting that mineralization occurs without the presence of mature osteoblasts.
aberrant stimulation of β-catenin leads to increases in expansion of skeletogenic precursors and the enhancement of bone ossification reminiscent to the loss of axin <dig>  the constitutively active signal promotes specification of osteoprogenitors, but prevents their maturation into terminally differentiated osteoblasts, along the osteoblast lineage.
haploid deficiency of β-catenin alleviates the calvarial phenotype caused by axin <dig> deficiency.
furthermore, genetic inactivation of the β-catenin transcriptional target, cyclin d <dig>  impairs expansion of the skeletogenic precursors contributing to deficiencies in calvarial ossification.
β-catenin signaling apparently plays a key role in suture development through modulation of calvarial morphogenetic signaling pathways.
here we utilize a gain-of-function analysis to further assess the role of β-catenin.
these findings advance our knowledge base of wnt signaling in calvarial morphogenesis, suggesting a key regulatory pathway of axin2/β-catenin/cyclin d <dig> in development of the suture mesenchyme.
there is a specific requirement for cyclin d <dig> in populating osteoprogenitor cell types at various developmental stages.
mouse genetic study has demonstrated that axin <dig> is essential for calvarial development and disease.
