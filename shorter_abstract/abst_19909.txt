to assist in these tasks, we present genomorama, a software program for interactively displaying multiple genomes and identifying potential dna hybridization sites for assay design.
useful features of genomorama include genome search by dna hybridization , efficient multi-scale display and manipulation of multiple genomes, support for many genome file types and the ability to search for and retrieve data from the national center for biotechnology information  entrez server.
genomorama provides an efficient computational platform for visualizing and analyzing multiple genomes.
