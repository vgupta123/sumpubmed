in this paper, we present tpms , a set of programs for handling and retrieving gene trees according to different criteria.
the information in large collections of phylogenetic trees is useful for many comparative genomic studies.
tpms is a powerful suite allowing to quickly retrieve sets of trees matching complex patterns in large collection or to root trees using more rigorous approaches than the classical midpoint method.
use of tpms is illustrated through three examples: systematic search for incongruencies in a large tree collection, a short study on the coelomata/ecdysozoa controversy and an evaluation of the level of support for a recently published mammal phylogeny.
