although we were not able to establish significant correlations between latencies and amplitudes of n <dig>  p <dig> and sw and the patients' performance in mmse, which is a psychometric test for classifying patients suffering from mci, our results point out that the disorganization of the aerp waveform in mci patients is a potential basis upon which a neurophysiologic methodology for identifying and "staging" mci can be sought.
within each group, correlation coefficients  between these characteristics of the different aerp waves were calculated.
we also found that delayed n <dig> latency not only identifies memory changes better than the mmse, but also may be a potential predictor of the mci patients who convert to ad.
patients presented with significantly higher n <dig> amplitudes, but no significant differences were observed in p <dig> amplitudes.
significant differences between follow-up and baseline measurements were found for p <dig> latency , n <dig> amplitude  and p <dig> amplitude .
the aim of this study was to determine if changes in latencies and amplitudes of the major waves of auditory event-related potentials , correlate with memory status of patients with mild cognitive impairment  and conversion to alzheimer's disease .
confirmatory factor analysis  was used to examine the underlying structure of waveforms both in the control and the patient groups.
moreover, the establishment of a n <dig> latency cut-off value of  <dig> ms resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 91% in the prediction of mci patients that converted to ad.
<dig> patients were re-examined after an average period of  <dig> months.
