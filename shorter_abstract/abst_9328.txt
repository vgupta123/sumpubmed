the medicago sequencing project began in  <dig> with the goal to decipher sequences originated from the euchromatic portion of the genome.
the heavily curated chromosomal sequences and associated gene models of medicago will serve as a better reference for legume biology and comparative genomics.
the allpaths-lg scaffolds were anchored onto the pseudomolecules on the basis of alignments to both the optical map and the genotyping-by-sequencing  map.
the mt <dig>  pseudomolecules encompass ~360 mb of actual sequences spanning 390 mb of which ~330 mb align perfectly with the optical map, presenting a drastic improvement over the bac-based mt <dig>  which only contained 70% sequences  of the current version.
a total of  <dig>  genes  are included in mt <dig>  which overlapped with ~82% of the gene loci annotated in mt <dig> .
medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa, is a preeminent model for studying nitrogen fixation, symbiosis, and legume genomics.
mt <dig>  and its associated resources, such as genome browsers, blast-able datasets and gene information pages, can be found on the jcvi medicago web site .
