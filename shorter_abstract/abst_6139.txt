chemical-genetic profiling of inhibitory compounds can lead to identification of their modes of action.
colony size reduction was used to investigate the chemical-genetic profile of cycloheximide, 3-amino- <dig> ,4-triazole, paromomycin, streptomycin and neomycin in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.
further investigations were carried out to assess the activity of three profiled genes in the process of protein biosynthesis using relative fitness of double mutants and other genetic assays.
this implies that novel genes involved in protein biosynthesis could be identified from these profiles.
as expected, the overall profiles of the tested compounds were similar, with deletions for genes involved in protein biosynthesis being the major category followed by metabolism.
our follow-up investigations into the activity of three profiled genes in the process of protein biosynthesis provided further evidence concerning the usefulness of chemical-genetic analyses for annotating gene functions.
chemical-genetic profiles provide insight into the molecular mechanism of the examined compounds by elucidating their potential primary and secondary cellular target sites.
these compounds target the process of protein biosynthesis.
