the epigenetic asymmetry between parental genomes remains at least until the 2-cell stage suggesting functional differences between paternal and maternal genomes during early cleavage stages.
parallel to the epigenetic asymmetry in dna methylation, chromatin modifications are also different between both parental genomes in the very first hours post fertilization.
in the mouse zygote the paternal genome undergoes dramatic structural and epigenetic changes.
whereas maternal chromatin maintains all types of histone h <dig> methylation throughout the zygotic development, paternal chromosomes acquire new and unmodified histones shortly after fertilization.
here we analyzed the timing of histone deposition on the paternal pronucleus and the dynamics of histone h <dig> methylation  immediately after fertilization.
histone h3/k9di-methylation is completely absent from the paternal pronucleus, including metaphase chromosomes of the first mitotic stage.
