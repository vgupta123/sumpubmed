qdc , a stochastic simulation software based on the well-known gillespie's ssa algorithm, was used.
quasi-cellular systems able to produce proteins directly from dna can be obtained by encapsulating the cell-free transcription/translation system puresystemâ„¢ in liposomes.
by varying the initial concentrations of the three main classes of molecules involved in the ps , we were able to stochastically simulate the time-course of gfp-production.
then we extended this study for small-volume liposomes , where it is more complex to infer the intra-vesicle composition, due to the expected anomalous entrapment phenomena.
thanks to our results, an experimental approach is now possible, aimed at recording the gfp production kinetics in very small micro-emulsion droplets or liposomes, and inferring, by using the simulation as a reverse-engineering procedure, the internal solutes distribution, and shed light on the still unknown forces driving the entrapment phenomenon.
thanks to suitable features specific of qdc, we successfully formalized the dynamical coupling between the transcription and translation processes that occurs in the real ps, thus bypassing the concurrent-only environment of gillespie's algorithm.

stochastic simulation is a valuable tool in the study of biochemical reaction at nanoscale range.
the entrapment of solutes in small-volume liposomes is a fundamental open problem.
