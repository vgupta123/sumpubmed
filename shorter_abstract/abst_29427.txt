most disease-causing mutations were predicted to impact protein function.
secondly, disease-causing nssnps can be identified very well by methods that predict the impact of mutations on protein function.
non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  alter the protein sequence and can cause disease.
here, we study predictions for functional impact of disease-annotated mutations from omim, pmd and swiss-prot and of variants not linked to disease.
firstly, annotations of disease-causing nssnps are on average so reliable that they can be used as proxies for functional impact.
however, it is surprising how well prediction methods developed for different purposes identify this link.
this implies that the existing prediction methods provide a very good means of choosing a set of suspect snps relevant for disease.
