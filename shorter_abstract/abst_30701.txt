the creation of specialised software tools and databases is requisite to allow this new kind of integrated analysis.
marine ecological genomics can be defined as the application of genomic sciences to understand the structure and function of marine ecosystems.
metalook allows scientists to investigate sequence data in their environmental context and to explore correlations between genes and habitat parameters.
we implemented the metalook software for visualisation and analysis of marine ecological genomic and metagenomic data with respect to habitat parameters.
this software is a step towards the creation of specialised tools to study constrained distributions and habitat specificity of genes correlated with specific processes.
to find similar sequences, the containers can be queried with either genes from the georeferenced database or user-imported sequences, using the blast algorithm.
water depth, physical and chemical parameters.
the user can define environmental containers to organise the sequences according to different habitat criteria.
metalook offers a three-dimensional user interface to interactively visualise dna sequences on a world map, based on a centralised georeferenced database.
