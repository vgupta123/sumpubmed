phylogenetic analyses of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> amino acid sequences revealed evolutionary partitioning of the dgat protein family into two major dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> clades.
triacylglycerides  are a class of neutral lipids that represent the most important storage form of energy for eukaryotic cells.
we found that the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes and are readily identifiable in all the major eukaryotic groups and genomes examined.
in fact, two different enzymes identified in several eukaryotic species, dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  are the main enzymes responsible for tag synthesis.
the phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses revealed that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> evolved separately, with functional convergence, despite their wide molecular and structural divergence.
the goal of this study was to examine the evolutionary relationship of the dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> genes across eukaryotic organisms in order to infer their origin.
these enzymes do not share high dna or protein sequence similarities, and it has been suggested that they play non-redundant roles in different tissues and in some species in tag synthesis.
dgat  is a transmembrane enzyme that acts in the final and committed step of tag synthesis, and it has been proposed to be the rate-limiting enzyme in plant storage lipid accumulation.
we have conducted a broad survey of fully sequenced genomes, including representatives of amoebozoa, yeasts, fungi, algae, musses, plants, vertebrate and invertebrate species, for the presence of dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> gene homologs.
overall, the data show that dgat <dig> and dgat <dig> are present in most eukaryotic organisms and belong to two different gene families.
the analysis also revealed that the mgat <dig> and awat genes may have arisen from dgat <dig> duplication events.
