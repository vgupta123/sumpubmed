these results demonstrate an important role for dcs and desmosomes in the early morphogenesis of the zebrafish embryo, provide a basis for more detailed analysis of their role and raise interesting questions relating to the evolution and functional significance of dc isoforms.
zebrafish possess two dsgs, designated zfdsgα and zfdsgβ, orthologues of mammalian dsg <dig>  they show  <dig> % amino acid identity and the α form has a  <dig> amino acid glycine-rich sequence of unknown function in its extracellular domain.
the desmosomal cadherins , desmocollin  and desmoglein , are the adhesion molecules of desmosomes, intercellular adhesive junctions of epithelia and cardiac muscle.
both the dcs and desmosomes have demonstrably essential roles in mammalian development.
in order to initiate their study in a more tractable developmental system we have characterised zebrafish dcs and examined their roles in early zebrafish development.
unlike mammalian dscs, zfdsc exists only as the "a" form since it lacks the alternatively-spliced mini-exon that shortens the cytoplasmic domain to produce the "b" form.
