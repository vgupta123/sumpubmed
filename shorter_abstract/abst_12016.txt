cardiomyocyte contraction is initiated by influx of extracellular calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels.
moreover, a different subset of spliced β <dig> transcript variants is detected in the embryonic heart compared to the adult.
zebrafish β <dig> genes show high conservation with mammals within the sh <dig> and guanylate kinase domains that comprise the "core" of maguk proteins, but β <dig>  is much more divergent in sequence than β <dig> .
in both β <dig> genes, alternative short atg-containing first exons are separated by some of the largest introns in the genome, suggesting that individual transcript variants could be subject to independent cis-regulatory control.
a subset of 5' exons appear to be unique to teleost genomes, while others are shared with mammals.
comparative analysis of the teleost and human β <dig> loci indicates that the short 5' exon sequences are highly conserved.
several β subunit family members are detected by rt-pcr in the embryonic heart.
however, a drawback of the mouse model is that embryonic heart rhythm is difficult to study in live embryos due to their intra-uterine development.
as a first step towards developing a model for contributions of β subunits to the onset of embryonic heart rhythm, we characterized the structure and expression of β <dig> subunits in zebrafish and other teleosts.
these studies refine our understanding of β <dig> subunit diversity arising from alternative splicing, and provide the groundwork for functional analysis of β <dig> subunit diversity in the embryonic heart.
these oligomeric channels utilize auxiliary β subunits to chaperone the pore-forming α subunit to the plasma membrane, and to modulate channel electrophysiology  <cit> .
null mutations in mouse β <dig>  but not in the other three β family members, are embryonic lethal at e <dig>  due to defects in cardiac contractility  <cit> .
alternative splicing occurs at the n-terminus and within the internal hook domain.
