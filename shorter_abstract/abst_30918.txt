a small number of prognostic and predictive tests based on gene expression are currently offered as reference laboratory tests.
here we present the first fully reproducible analysis of the data used to train and test mammaprint, an fda-cleared prognostic test for breast cancer based on a 70-gene expression signature.

as an example of the utility of this reproducible research resource, we develop a simple prognostic classifier that uses only  <dig> genes from the mammaprint signature and is equally accurate in predicting 5-year disease free survival.
