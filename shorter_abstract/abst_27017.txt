systematic analysis of lineage-specific evolution is becoming the cornerstone of comparative genomics.
new methods, like phyrex, extend the capabilities of comparative genomics by tracing the evolution of additional biomolecular processes.
a software package for reconstruction of continuous character traits, like relative gene expression levels or alternative splice site usage data is presented and is available for download at .
as genomes evolve after speciation, gene content, coding sequence, gene expression, and splicing all diverge with time from ancestors with close relatives.
this program was applied to a primate gene expression dataset to detect transcription factor binding sites that have undergone substitution, potentially having driven lineage-specific differences in gene expression.
