culturing myotubes from sm-biopsies enables investigating transcriptional defects and assaying therapeutic strategies.
gene ontology analysis showed that downregulated genes were mainly associated with cytoplasm, particularly mitochondria, and involved in metabolism and the muscle-system/contraction process.
cultured muscle cells display reductive metabolic and muscle-system transcriptome adaptations as observed in muscle atrophy and they activate tissue-remodeling and senescence/apoptosis processes.
upregulated genes were predominantly related to cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and extracellular matrix.
the most significantly regulated pathway was mitochondrial dysfunction.
changes in the expression of several genes were confirmed by quantigene plex assay or reverse transcription real-time pcr.
this study compares the transcriptome of aneurally cultured human sm cells versus that of tissue biopsies.
