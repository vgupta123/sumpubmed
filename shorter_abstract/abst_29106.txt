using the mutation outputs and the validation data from the cancer genome atlas endometrial study , we demonstrate how to build a statistical model that predicts the probability of each call being a somatic mutation, based on the detection status of multiple callers and a few associated features.
accurate somatic mutation-calling is essential for insightful mutation analyses in cancer studies.
therefore, fully utilizing multiple callers can be a powerful way to construct a list of final calls for oneâ€™s research.
using a set of mutations from multiple callers that are impartially validated, we present a statistical approach for building a combined caller, which can be applied to combine calls in a wider dataset generated using a similar protocol.
the approach allows us to build a combined caller across the full range of stringency levels, which outperforms all of the individual callers.
