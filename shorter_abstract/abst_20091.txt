in lakes with a deep-water algal maximum, herbivorous zooplankton are faced with a trade-off between high temperature but low food availability in the surface layers and low temperature but sufficient food in deep layers.
it has been suggested that zooplankton  faced with this trade-off distribute vertically according to an "ideal free distribution  with costs".
small individuals stayed higher in the water column than large ones, which conformed with the model for unequal competitors.
this concept is useful for the analysis of zooplankton distributions under a large suite of environmental conditions shaping habitat suitability.
an experiment has been designed to test the density  dependence of the vertical distribution as this is a basic assumption of ifd theory.
this is important as the vertical location of grazing zooplankton in a lake affects phytoplankton production and species composition, i.e.
fish predation causing diel vertical migrations can be incorporated as additional costs.
experiments were performed in large, indoor mesocosms  with a temperature gradient of 10Â°c and a deep-water algal maximum established below the thermocline.
the distribution spread asymmetrically towards the algal maximum when the density increased until  <dig> % of the population dwelled in the cool, food-rich layers at high densities.
as expected, daphnia aggregated at the interface between the two different habitats when their density was low.
