the flowers of c. vulgaris bud bloomers are male sterile, because the stamens are absent.
the flowers are characterised by an extremely extended flower attractiveness, since the flower buds remain closed throughout the complete flowering season.
so far, this unique flower type of c. vulgaris has not been reported in any other plant species.
a broad comparison was undertaken to identify genes differentially expressed in the bud flowering phenotype and in the wild type of c. vulgaris.
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  was performed to analyse the gene expression levels of two c. vulgaris b genes cvpi and calluna vulgaris apetala  <dig>  in both flower types.
differential expression patterns of the b-class genes cvap <dig> and cvpi were identified to cause the characteristic morphology of c. vulgaris flowers leading to the following hypotheses: ectopic expression of cvap <dig> is a convincing explanation for the formation of a completely petaloid perianth in both flower types.
in c. vulgaris, cvpi is essential for determination of petal and stamen identity.
among these differentially expressed genes, calluna vulgaris pistillata  which is the orthologue of the arabidopsis b gene pistillata  was considered as the most promising candidate gene.
cvpi expression was proven to be reduced in the bud blooming flowers.
the production of heather  in germany is highly dependent on cultivars with mutated flower morphology, the so-called diplocalyx bud bloomers.
cvap <dig> which is the orthologue of the arabidopsis b gene apetala  <dig>  turned out to be ectopically expressed in sepals of wild type and bud bloomer flowers.
transcript abundances were compared and  <dig> differentially expressed genes detected.
transcriptome sequence reads were generated using  <dig> sequencing of two flower type specific cdna libraries.
