using  <dig> polymorphic ssrs, we genotyped 213 m. rubra individuals  and compared the difference in genetic diversity between the female and the male populations.
female population had a slightly higher values of genetic diversity parameters  than the male population, but not significantly different.
the male and female populations of chinese bayberry have similar genetic diversity in terms of average number of alleles and level of heterozygosity, but were clearly separated by genetic structure analysis due to two markers associated with sex type, zju <dig> and zju <dig>  zhejiang province china could be the centre of diversity of m. rubra in china, with wide genetic diversity coverage; and the two representative cultivars ‘biqi’ and ‘dongkui’, and one landrace ‘fenhong’ in three female subpopulations.
neighbour-joining cluster analysis separated m. rubra from three related species, and the male from female populations within m. rubra.
by structure analysis, 178 m. rubra accessions were assigned to two subpopulations: male dominated  and female dominated .
generally dioecious, the female plants are cultivated for fruit and have been studied extensively, but male plants have received very little attention.
the ssr loci zju <dig> and zju <dig> showed an empirical fst value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which are significantly above the  <dig> % confidence level, indicating that they are outlier loci related to sex separation.
chinese bayberry  is an important subtropical evergreen fruit tree in southern china.
this research provides genetic information on male and female chinese bayberry and will act as a reference for breeding programs.
