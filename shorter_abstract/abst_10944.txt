the main contribution is three-fold: first, we develop a fast, automatic random walker method for cell segmentation.
the method we propose for cell segmentation is faster than the traditional random walker method or the level set method, and performs better on 3d time-series of neutrophil cells, which are comparatively noisy as stacks have to be acquired fast enough to account for cell motion.
the different tasks in the presented pipeline for 3d+time shape analysis of cells can be solved using laplacian approaches, opening the possibility of eventually combining individual steps in order to speed up computations.
second, a novel topology fixing method is proposed to fix segmented binary volumes without spherical topology.
we present a framework for 3d+time cell shape analysis.
third, we show that algorithms used for each individual step of the analysis pipeline  are closely related to the laplacian operator.
the framework is applied to the shape analysis of neutrophil cells.
