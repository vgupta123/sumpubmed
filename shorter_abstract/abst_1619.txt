microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays.
the movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition.
tno <dig> knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation.
the tgn-localized snare machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth.

our study identifies a role for a trans-golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.
we found that arabidopsis thaliana tno <dig> , a putative tethering factor localized at the trans-golgi network, affects root skewing.
in addition, tno <dig> is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls.
directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells.
microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno <dig> seedlings.
roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement.
