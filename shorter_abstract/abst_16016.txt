<dig>  the open reading frame of peln encodes a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide and a  <dig> amino acid mature protein belonging to the polysaccharide lyase family  <dig>  the maximum pel activity produced by e. coli in shake flasks reached  <dig> .
a pel gene  was cloned using degenerate pcr and inverse pcr from the chromosomal dna of paenibacillus sp.
<dig> u ml− <dig>  and the purified recombinant enzyme exhibits a specific activity of  <dig>  u mg− <dig> on polygalacturonic acid .
the maximum activity was observed in a buffer with 5 mm ca2+ at ph  <dig>  and 65°c.
this work represents the first study that describes the extracellular expression of a pel gene from paenibacillus species in e. coli.
the biochemical treatment achieved the maximal reduction of percentage weight  of the ramie bast fiber.
biotechnological applications of microbial pectate lyases  in plant fiber processing are considered as environmentally friendly.
the high yield of the extracellular overexpression, relevant thermostability and efficient degumming using combined treatments indicate its strong potential for large-scale industrial production.
