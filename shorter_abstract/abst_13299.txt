we also show that in many cases a simple sedimentation velocity measurement provides sufficient data to estimate both the oligomeric state and the detergent-to-protein ratio in pdcs, as well as to evaluate the homogeneity of the samples prior to crystallization screening.
seeking an effective and standardized means applicable to genomic approaches for the characterization of pdcs, we chose 1d-nmr spectroscopic analysis to monitor the detergent content throughout their purification: protein extraction, detergent exchange, and sample concentration.
furthermore, careful monitoring of the detergent content during the process of imp production allows for a high level of reproducibility.
the techniques presented here facilitate the screening and selection of the extraction detergent, as well as help to maintain reproducibility in the detergent exchange and pdc concentration procedures.
structural studies of integral membrane proteins  are hampered by inherent difficulties in their heterologous expression and in the purification of solubilized protein-detergent complexes .
