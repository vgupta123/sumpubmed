previous studies are limited in that they assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on the solubility of expressed proteins.
lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.
unlike many previous works, these models consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features.
meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the best.
recombinant protein production is a useful biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble proteins.
we collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant protein production core facility, where six different vectors were designed and studied.
in this paper, we show that a machine learning approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a target protein in a recombinant protein production system is promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study of the efficacy.
currently, the most widely used production system is to fuse a target protein into different vectors in escherichia coli .
however, the production efficacy of different vectors varies for different target proteins.
in this study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not express in e. coli.
trial-and-error is still the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a given target protein.
we show that a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes  outperforms a model that considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the best model.
we evaluate three different models based on the support vector machines  and their ensembles.
