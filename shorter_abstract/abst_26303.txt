in this study we utilized the p48-cre/lsl-krasg12d mouse model with age-matched wild type mice.
metabolomics analysis of the serum samples was conducted through uplc-tofms .
multivariate data analysis revealed distinct metabolic patterns in serum samples collected during malignant progression towards invasive pdac.
we conclude that metabolomics analysis of serum samples can identify the presence of early and late stage pancreatic cancer.
animals with early or late stage lesions were distinguished from their respective controls with  <dig> % and  <dig> % accuracy, respectively.
furthermore, serum metabolite signatures from animals with early stage lesions identified controls and animals with late stage lesions with  <dig> % accuracy  and vice-versa with  <dig> % accuracy .
one of the metabolites, citrate, was validated through tandem mass spectrometry and showed increased levels in serum with disease progression.
serum was collected from mice with early panin lesions  and with late panin or invasive pdac lesions , as determined by histopathology.
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with less than a 6% 5-year survival rate.
this model shows malignant progression to pdac analogous to the human disease stages via early and late pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasia  lesions.
