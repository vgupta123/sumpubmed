using transgenic fish expressing a fluorescently labeled novel component of zebrafish germ cell granules termed granulito, we followed the morphology and distribution of the granules.
our results suggest that zebrafish germ cell granules undergo a transformation process, which involves germ cell specific proteins as well as the microtubular network.
last, we show that the function of the germ cell granule resident protein the tudor domain containing protein- <dig>  is required for determination of granule morphology and number.
these structures share common features with polar granules in drosophila, germinal granules in xenopus and chromatoid bodies in mice germ cells, such as the localization of the zebrafish vasa, piwi and nanos proteins, among others.
zebrafish germ cells contain granular-like structures, organized around the cell nucleus.
