the target values of 3-log10-unit and 4-log10-unit reduction for auc24h/mpc were  <dig> and  <dig>  while the same efficacy for auc24h/mic were  <dig> and  <dig>  the copd deduced from monte carlo simulation  for marbofloxacin against h. parasuis was  <dig>  mg/l.
haemophilus parasuis  can invade the body and cause systemic infection under stress conditions.
an in vitro dynamic pk/pd model was established to study the pk/pd relationship of marbofloxacin against h. parasuis.

marbofloxacin has been recommended for the treatment of swine infections.
however, few studies have investigated the pk/pd characteristics and pk/pd cutoff  of this drug against h. parasuis.
mics of marbofloxacin against  <dig> h. parasuis isolates were determined.
the recommended dose of marbofloxacin against h. parasuis with mic ≤  <dig> mg/l was  <dig> mg/kg body weight .
