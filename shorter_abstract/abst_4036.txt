alignments of umd <dig>  and btau <dig>  to btom <dig>  reveal discordances commensurate with previous reports, and affirm the ncbi’s current designation of umd <dig>  sequence assembly as the “reference assembly” and the btau <dig>  as the “alternate assembly.” the cattle genome optical map, btom <dig> , when used as a comprehensive and largely independent guide, will greatly assist improvements to existing sequence builds, and later serve as an accurate physical scaffold for studies concerning the comparative genomics of cattle breeds.
however, past comparisons between these assemblies revealed substantial differences.
consequently, such discordances have engendered ambiguities when using reference sequence data, impacting genomic studies in cattle and motivating construction of a new optical map resource--btom <dig> --to guide comparisons and improvements to the current sequence builds.
accordingly, our comprehensive comparisons of btom <dig>  against the umd <dig>  and btau <dig>  sequence builds tabulate large-to-immediate scale discordances requiring mediation.
the optical map, btom <dig> , spanning the b. taurus genome  was assembled from an optical map dataset consisting of  <dig> , <dig>  single molecule optical maps  generated by the optical mapping system.
currently, there are two cattle genome sequence assemblies  from groups using dissimilar assembly algorithms, which were complemented by genetic and physical map resources.
btom <dig>  is a high-resolution physical map featuring an average restriction fragment size of  <dig>  kb.
the cattle  genome was originally selected for sequencing due to its economic importance and unique biology as a model organism for understanding other ruminants, or mammals.
