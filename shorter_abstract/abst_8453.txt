sequence alignment is one of the most important techniques to analyze biological systems.
in particular, an alignment for homologous sequences with low sequence similarity is not in satisfactory level.
moreover, we also showed that our algorithm works well together with a consistency-based progressive multiple alignment by modifying the tcoffee to use our measure.
especially for the sequences with sequence identity less than 15%, our method improves the alignment accuracy significantly.
we indicated that our method leads to a significant increase in alignment accuracy compared with other methods.
we introduced a new method of alignment, called mtrap by introducing a metric defined on compound systems of two sequences.
usual methods for aligning protein sequences in recent years use a measure empirically determined.
such a measure is determined on the assumption that there is no an intersite correlation on the sequences.
