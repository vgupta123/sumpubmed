atypical scrapie was first identified in norwegian sheep in  <dig> and has subsequently been identified in many countries.
the first successful challenge of a sheep with 'field' atypical scrapie from an homologous donor sheep was reported in  <dig>
however, atypical scrapie isolates have been shown to be infectious experimentally, through intracerebral inoculation in transgenic mice and sheep.
this study demonstrates that atypical scrapie has distinct clinical, pathological and biochemical characteristics which are maintained on transmission and sub-passage, and which are distinct from other strains of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in the same host genotype.
atypical scrapie is consistently transmissible within ahq homozygous sheep, and the disease phenotype is preserved on sub-passage.
retrospective studies have identified cases predating the initial identification of this form of scrapie, and epidemiological studies have indicated that it does not conform to the behaviour of an infectious disease, giving rise to the hypothesis that it represents spontaneous disease.
