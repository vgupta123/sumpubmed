the purpose of the present study was the development of a paradigm to investigate the affective modulation of cortical networks with a high temporal and spatial resolution.
statistical permutation analyses of the results of the complex demodulation procedure revealed increased steady-state visual evoked field amplitudes over occipital areas following presentation of affective pictures compared to neutral pictures.
it can be shown that stimulation with affective pictures leads to an enhanced activity in occipital region as compared to neutral pictures.
a combination of a complex demodulation procedure with a minimum norm estimation was applied to assess the temporal variation of the topography of cortical activity.
we assessed cortical activity with meg using a visual steady-state paradigm with affective pictures.
the affective and motivational relevance of a stimulus has a distinct impact on cortical processing, particularly in sensory areas.
this differentiation shifted in the time course from occipital regions to parietal and temporal regions.
thus, it can be crucial to carefully choose regions of interests and time intervals when analyzing the affective modulation of cortical activity.
however, the spatial and temporal dynamics of this affective modulation of brain activities remains unclear.
