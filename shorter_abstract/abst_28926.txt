we anticipate that our finding will enhance the understanding on the molecular mode of action of cur on s. cerevisiae.
hog <dig> was rapidly phosphorylated upon cur treatment, but unlike the response to hyperosmotic shock , it remains activated for an extended period of time.
we also observed a hog <dig> dependent transcriptional response to cur treatment that involved the up-regulation of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  <dig> , a factor that is essential for the hyperosmotic stress response.
a detailed analysis of hog pathway mutants revealed that pbs2p, ptc2p, and ssk2p are required for optimal cur-induced hog <dig> phosphorylation.
