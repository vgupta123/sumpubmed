molecular evolutionary analyses of protein-coding regions demonstrate that the rate of nucleotide substitution has increased among both allotetraploid genomes relative to the diploids, and that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions has increased in one of the two polyploid lineages we sampled.
in this paper we present a comprehensive est assembly derived from diploid and model allotetraploid cottons and demonstrate several evolutionary inferences regarding genic evolution that can be drawn from these data.
we also use these snps to show that a surprisingly high percentage of duplicate genes  show a signature of non-independent evolution in the allotetraploid nucleus, having experienced one or more episodes of nonreciprocal homoeologous recombination .
we demonstrate that cotton genes have experienced an increased rate of molecular evolution following duplication by polyploidy, and that polyploidy has enabled considerable levels of nonreciprocal exchange between homoeologous genes.
in this study we characterize the functional and mutational properties of the cotton transcriptome, produce a large genome-specific snp database, and detect illegitimate genetic exchanges between duplicate genomes sharing a common allotetraploid nucleus.
diploid a- and d-genome species can be compared to the a- and d-genomes found within these allotetraploids to make evolutionary inferences about polyploidy.
