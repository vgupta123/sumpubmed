fusing the xyn domain at either terminus increased the glucanase thermostability, and fusing the xyn domain at c-terminus shifted the glucanase ph property  <dig> units higher towards alkaline environments.
the glu-xyn glu moiety optimal ph was  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  for the xyn-glu glu moiety and the glu.
fusing the glu domain at c-terminus increased the xylanase thermostability, but fusing the glu domain at n-terminus decreased the xylanase thermostability.
when expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  the two chimeras exhibited bi-functional activities of xylanase and glucanase.
the xyn-glu xyn moiety had optimal reaction temperature  at 50 °c and thermal in-activation half-life  at 50 °c for  <dig>  min, compared to 47 °c and  <dig>  min for the xyn.
the glu-xyn xyn moiety had equivalent topt to and shorter t1/ <dig>  than the xyn.
domain-swapping created different effects on each moiety properties.
the issue was explored by swapping a mesophilic aspergillus niger gh <dig> xylanase  with a hyper-thermophilic thermotoga maritima glucanase  to construct two chimeras, xyn-glu and glu-xyn, with an intention to create thermostable xylanase containing glucanase activity.
