a conjunction analysis of all observation conditions showed that action observation activated distinct networks of premotor, parietal, and cerebellar structures.
an internal viewpoint led to higher activation of the dorsal premotor cortex.
the present results suggest that the ventral and dorsal premotor cortex adopt differential roles during action observation depending on the level of motor expertise and the viewpoint.
experts revealed increased activation in the ventral premotor cortex compared to novices.
action observation leads to neural activation of the human premotor cortex.
sixteen dance experts and  <dig> novices observed ballroom dance videos from internal or external viewpoints while lying in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner.
this study examined how the level of motor expertise  in ballroom dancing and the visual viewpoint  influence this activation within different parts of this area of the brain.
