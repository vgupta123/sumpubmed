the temporal sensitivity of the surveillance system  for bovine viral diarrhea  in danish dairy herds was evaluated.
for instance, with the current system, the median temsse was  <dig>  %, 90 days after a pi calf was introduced into eight dairy herds.
when a pi calf was introduced into one herd the median temsse was  <dig>  %, while the related pfree was  <dig>  %.
additionally we estimated the confidence in low  herd prevalence  and the confidence in complete freedom  from bvd .
for that purpose we considered: the risk of bvd introduction into the dairy population, the elisa used and the high risk period  from bvd introduction to testing .
those results could be used to optimize the danish bvd surveillance system.
furthermore, the approach proposed in this study, for including the effect of the hrp within the scenario tree methodology, could be applied to optimize early warning surveillance systems of different animal diseases.
the temsse, the plow, and the pfree were higher, when tests were performed 365 days after bvd introduction, than after 90 days.
currently, the danish antibody blocking elisa is used to test quarterly bulk tank milk .
information from data  and outputs from two published stochastic models were fed into a stochastic scenario tree to estimate the temsse.
to optimize the surveillance system as an early warning system, we considered the possibility of using the svanovir elisa, as this test has been shown to detect bvd-positive herds earlier than the blocking elisa in btm tests.
with the svanovir elisa these estimates were  <dig>  %;  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.
