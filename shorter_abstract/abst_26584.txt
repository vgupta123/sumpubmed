the results of this work suggest that metabolically engineered e. coli has the potential to be a microbial cell factory for large-scale production of hfas.
fatty acid composition analysis showed that the hfas mainly consisted of 9-hydroxydecanoic acid , 11-hydroxydodecanoic acid , 10-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid  and 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid .
through the coexpression of the acetyl-coa carboxylase  and the leadless acyl-coa thioesterase , and knockout of the endogenous acyl-coa synthetase , an engineered e. coli strain was constructed to efficiently synthesize free fatty acids .
fed-batch fermentation of this strain further increased the final titer of hfas to 548 mg/l.
although the microbial transformation pathway of hfas was extensively studied decades ago, these attempts mainly focused on converting fatty acids or vegetable oils to their hydroxyl counterparts.
hydroxy fatty acids  are valuable chemicals for a broad variety of applications.
then the fatty acid hydroxylase  from bacillus megaterium was introduced into this strain and high-level production of hfas was achieved.

the finally engineered strain bl21Δfadd/pe-a1’tesa&pa-acc accumulated up to  <dig>  mg/l of hfas in the culture broth.
however, commercial production of hfas has not been established so far due to the lack of low cost routes for their synthesis.
under shake-flask conditions,  <dig>  mg/l of ffas were obtained by a 12 h induced culture.
