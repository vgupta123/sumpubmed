several cell types are perturbed in this pathology, and underlying signaling events are complex and still poorly understood.
investigation of proteomics and transcriptomics data sets on psoriasis revealed versatility in regulatory machinery underlying pathology and showed complementarities between two levels of cellular organization.
we developed network-based methodology for integrative analysis of high throughput data sets of different types.
we also evaluated functional synergy between transcriptomics and proteomics results.
network-based analysis revealed similarities in regulation at both proteomics and transcriptomics level.
we identified a group of transcription factors responsible for overexpression of psoriasis genes and a number of previously unknown signaling pathways that may play a role in this process.
