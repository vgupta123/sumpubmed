we utilised a bayesian state-space approach allowing us to parameterise a stage-structured lefkovitch model.
it has been suggested that plethodontid salamanders are excellent candidates for indicating ecosystem health.
analysing the resulting parameterised lefkovitch matrices shows that the population growth is very close to  <dig>  and that at population equilibrium we expect half of the individuals present to be adults of reproductive age which is what we also observe in the data.
elasticity analysis shows that adult survival is the key determinant for population growth.
however, detailed, long-term data sets of their populations are rare, limiting our understanding of the demographic processes underlying their population fluctuations.
this analysis demonstrates how an understanding of population demography can be gained from structured population data even in a case where following marked individuals over their whole lifespan is not practical.
here we present a demographic analysis based on a  <dig> -  <dig> data set on an underground population of speleomantes strinatii  in nw italy.
