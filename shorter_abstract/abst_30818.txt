preliminary results have shown a protein phosphatase inhibitor activity resembling ppp1r <dig> in bovine and primate spermatozoa.
the conclusive identification and localization of sperm ppp1r <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> lays the basis for future studies on their roles in acrosome reaction, sperm motility and hyperactivation.
an intriguing possibility is that a switch in ppp1cc <dig> inhibitory subunits could be the trigger for sperm motility in the epididymis and/or sperm hyperactivation in the female reproductive tract.
