here we show that endogenous saps subunit pp6r <dig> co-precipitates half of pp <dig> in cell extracts, and the saps region of pp6r <dig> is sufficient for binding pp <dig>  the saps domain of recombinant gst-pp6r <dig> is relatively resistant to trypsin despite having many k and r residues, and the purified saps domain  has a circular dichroic spectrum indicative of mostly alpha helical structure.
we used sequence alignments and 3d-jury methods to develop alternative models for the saps domain, based on available structures of other helical repeat proteins.
the models were used to select sites for charge-reversal substitutions in the saps domain of pp6r <dig> that were tested by co-precipitation of endogenous pp6c with flag-tagged pp6r <dig> from mammalian cells.
the conserved saps domain in pp6r <dig> forms helical repeats similar to those in golgin p <dig> and negatively charged residues in interhelical loops are used to associate specifically with pp <dig>  the results advance understanding of how distinctive helical repeat subunits uniquely distribute and differentially regulate closely related ser/thr phosphatases.
helical repeat motifs are common among regulatory subunits for type- <dig> and type-2a protein ser/thr phosphatases.
yeast sit <dig> is a distinctive type-2a phosphatase that has dedicated regulatory subunits named sit4-associated proteins .
