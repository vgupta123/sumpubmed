of the  <dig> cnvs previously reported, only 21-kilobase deletions on 16p <dig>  showed evidence for association with bmi , with two cnvs nominally associated with class ii obesity, 1p <dig>  duplications  and 5q <dig>  deletions .
as the architecture of complex traits incorporates a widening spectrum of genetic variation, analyses integrating common and rare variation are needed.
models significantly predicted obesity classification with maximum discriminative ability for morbid-obesity .
the weighted snp-grss constructed from imputed probabilities of risk alleles performed best and was highly associated with bmi  accounting for 3% of the phenotypic variance.
results show that incorporating validated effect sizes and allelic probabilities improve prediction algorithms.
although rare-cnvs did not account for significant phenotypic variation, results provide a framework for integrated analyses.
genetic risk sum scores  were constructed using  <dig> bmi-validated snps and aggregate-risk methods were compared: count versus weighted and proxy versus imputation.
a combined analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and copy number variation  was performed using  <dig> european and  <dig> african-americans from the study of addiction: genetics and environment.
the combined model, including covariates, snp-grss, and 16p <dig>  deletion accounted for  <dig> % of phenotypic variance in bmi .
