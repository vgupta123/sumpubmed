the excited-state lifetime of egfp-mtor of ~ <dig> ps was reduced by energy transfer to ~ <dig> ps in the cytoplasm and to  <dig> ps in the nucleus when co-expressed with dsred-rheb, similar results being obtained for co-expressed egfp-mtor and dsred-raptor.
the mammalian target of rapamycin  signalling pathway has a key role in cellular regulation and several diseases.
the results illustrate the power of gfp-technology combined with fret-flim imaging in the study of the interaction of signalling components in living cells, here providing evidence for a direct physical interaction between mtor and rheb and between mtor and raptor in living cells for the first time.
in this study a cytoplasmic as well as a significant sub-cellular nuclear mtor localization was shown , utilizing green and red fluorescent protein  fusion and highly sensitive single photon counting fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy  of live cells.
