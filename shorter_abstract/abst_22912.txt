a total of  <dig>  bp from the bac contig were sequenced and compared with database sequences to identify genes, ests and repeat sequences, and to anchor the contig to the syntenic region of the human genome sequence .
the annotated contig, containing  <dig> genes and  <dig> ests, showed a complete conservation of linkage  with the human genome sequence, based on  <dig> anchor points.
the gene encoding the etec f4ab/ac receptors, involved in neonatal diarrhoea in pigs , is located close to the tf locus on sscr <dig>  in order to reveal and characterize possible candidate genes encoding these receptors, a porcine physical map of the tf region is indispensable.
