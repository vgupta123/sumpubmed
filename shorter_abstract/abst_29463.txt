for this reason, only  <dig> datasets are needed – reads from high-throughput sequencing platforms for parent generation  and f <dig> generation .
sex chromosomes present a genomic region which to some extent, differs between the genders of a single species.
reliable high-throughput methods for detection of sex chromosomes specific markers are needed, especially in species where genome information is limited.

to address this challenge, we established genetic cross of dioecious plant rumex acetosa and generated rna-seq data from both parental generation and male and female offspring.
our tools are present in the galaxy tool shed, from which they can be installed to any local galaxy instance.
we present a pipeline for detection of sex linked genes based on nucleotide polymorphism analysis.
thus, polymorphisms following segregation pattern can be easily visualized, which significantly enhances primer design and subsequent steps of wet-lab verification.
a combination of classical genetic segregation analysis along with rna-seq data can present an ideal tool to map and identify sex chromosome-specific expressed markers.
in our approach, tracking of nucleotide polymorphisms is carried out using a cross of preferably distant populations.
based on combination of genetic crosses and rna-seq data, we have designed a high-throughput, cost-effective approach for a broad community of scientists focused on sex chromosome structure and evolution.
