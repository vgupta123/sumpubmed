despite the virus' public health importance and a wealth of sequence data, basic aspects of hcv molecular evolution remain poorly understood.
this confirms that differences in molecular evolution between biological scales are not restricted to hiv and may represent a common feature of chronic rna viral infection.
there was also evidence for slightly higher evolutionary rate for hcv subtype 1a compared to subtype 1b.
we use a powerful bayesian inference framework that incorporates both among-lineage rate heterogeneity and phylogenetic uncertainty into estimates of evolutionary parameters.
most of the hcv genome evolves at ~ <dig>  substitutions/site/year, a rate typical of rna viruses.
here we investigate three sets of whole hcv genomes in order to directly compare the evolution of whole hcv genomes at different biological levels: within- and among-hosts.
we conclude that the elevated rate observed in the e1/e <dig> region during within-host evolution more likely results from the reversion of host-specific adaptations  than from the preferential transmission of slowly-evolving lineages.
hepatitis c virus  is a rapidly-evolving rna virus that establishes chronic infections in humans.
conversely, higher rates of evolution were seen among-hosts for functionally relevant parts of the ns5a gene.
using new statistical methods and comparable whole genome datasets we have quantified, for the first time, the variation in hcv evolutionary dynamics at different scales of organisation.
