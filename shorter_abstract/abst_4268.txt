to examine the pattern of intra-genomic gc heterogeneity in lepidosaurian genomes, we constructed a cytogenetic map of the japanese four-striped rat snake  with  <dig> cdna clones by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and examined the correlation between the gc-content of exonic third codon positions  of the genes and the size of chromosomes on which the genes were localized.
our results suggest that the chromosome size-dependent gc heterogeneity had already occurred before the lepidosaur-archosaur split,  <dig> million years ago.
our snake cytogenetic map also identified several conserved segments between the snake macrochromosomes and the chicken microchromosomes.
cross-species comparisons revealed that gc <dig> of most snake orthologs in such macrochromosomal segments were gc-poor  whereas those of chicken orthologs in microchromosomes were relatively gc-rich .
although gc <dig> distribution of snake genes was relatively homogeneous compared with those of the other amniotes, microchromosomal genes showed significantly higher gc <dig> than macrochromosomal genes as in chicken.
extant sauropsids  are divided into two major lineages, the lineage of testudines  and archosauria  and the lineage of lepidosauria .
in chicken, microchromosomes exhibit a higher gc-content than macrochromosomes.
this character was probably present in the common ancestor of lepidosaurs and but lost in the lineage leading to anolis during the diversification of lepidosaurs.
we also identified several genes whose gc-content might have been influenced by the size of the chromosomes on which they were harbored over the course of sauropsid evolution.
