this multi-label structured svm based approach is demonstrated to work well with this disorder recognition task.
there are six types of labels in our multi-label scheme, all of which are represented by 24-bit binary numbers.
we present a multi-label scheme which could be used in complicated entity recognition tasks.
the experiments show that our multi-label scheme surpasses the baseline.
especially for overlapping disorder mentions, the f1-score of our multi-label scheme is  <dig>  higher than the baseline biohd <dig> scheme.
the novel multi-label scheme we presented is superior to the baseline and it can be used in other models to solve various types of complicated entity recognition tasks as well.
our multi-label method can recognize not only disorder mentions in the form of contiguous or discontiguous words but also mentions whose spans overlap with each other.
information extraction in clinical texts enables medical workers to find out problems of patients faster as well as makes intelligent diagnosis possible in the future.

the experiments indicate that our multi-label structured svm model outperforms the condition random field  model for this disorder mention recognition task.
the binary digits of each label contain information about different disorder mentions.
there has been a lot of work about disorder mention recognition in clinical narratives.
but recognition of some more complicated disorder mentions like overlapping ones is still an open issue.
