a multiplex qpcr targeting a 128 bp region on the 23s rdna gene was developed for detection of brachyspira  hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli, the agents of swine dysentery  and porcine intestinal spirochaetosis , together with a triplet of apathogenic brachyspira spp.
the multiplex qpcr was evaluated against a duplex pcr .
using dna extracted from fecal culture, the multiplex qpcr showed excellent agreement with the duplex pcr .
the multiplex qpcr with a limit of detection of 5– <dig> genomic equivalents  per reaction  allows reliable detection of brachyspira species directly from fecal swab dna.
the novel multiplex qpcr is robust and has a high analytical sensitivity and is therefore suitable for high-throughput screening of porcine fecal swabs for the causative agents of sd.
in line with this, analysis of  <dig> fecal swabs in comparison with culture-based qpcr showed a high agreement for the causative agents of sd .
in fecal swabs within the scope of a monitoring program.
