two strains had the same sequence type  as reference strain pg <dig>  while the other twenty nine hungarian isolates formed a novel clade comprising five subclades.
the aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the multi locus sequence typing  and the multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis  through the genetic characterization of m. bovis isolates from hungary.
thirty one hungarian m. bovis isolates grouped into two clades by mlst.
mlst is generally considered an intermediate scale typing method and it was found to be discriminatory among the hungarian m. bovis isolates.
mlva proved to be an appropriate fine scale typing tool for m. bovis as this method was able to distinguish closely related strains isolated from the same farm.
we recommend the combined use of the two methods for the genotyping of m. bovis isolates.
strains have to be characterized first by mlst followed by the fine scale typing of identical sts with mlva.
mycoplasma bovis is an important pathogen causing pneumonia, mastitis and arthritis in cattle worldwide.
little congruence was found between the results of the two typing systems.
as this agent is primarily transmitted by direct contact and spread through animal movements, efficient genotyping systems are essential for the monitoring of the disease and for epidemiological investigations.
