factor graphs provide a flexible and general framework for specifying probability distributions.
we develop algorithms to efficiently compute the approximations and compare them to naive sampling and the normal approximation.
a guideline for choosing between the normal approximation, saddle-point approximation and importance sampling is also provided.

using the two methods we can substantially improve computational cost without compromising accuracy.
we here address the problem of evaluating statistical significance of observations from factor graph models.
two novel numerical approximations for evaluation of statistical significance are presented.
second a saddlepoint approximation based method.
the applicability of saddlepoint approximation and importance sampling is demonstrated on known models in the factor graph framework.
