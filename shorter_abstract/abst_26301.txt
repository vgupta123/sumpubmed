this means rapid iterations while exploring for emergent behavior, and full programmability of the filtering and clustering steps.
gepoclu is a useful data-mining tool for exploring relationships among transcriptional data deriving form different sources.
gepoclu provides expression-based gene selection from multiple experimental sources, position-based gene clustering and cluster visualization functionalities, all as parts of the same fully integrated, and interactive, package.
we developed a novel software tool gepoclu  that automatically selects genes based on expression values from multiple sources, including microarray, est and qrt-pcr, and performs positional clustering.
it provides an easy interactive environment for analyzing positional clustering behavior of co-expressed genes, and at the same time it is fully programmable, so that it can be customized and extended to support specific analysis needs.
