we have developed an algorithm that quantifies the quality of temporal biological signal rather than whether the signal illustrates a significant change over the experimental time course.
given the rising interest in utilizing predictive mathematical models to describe the biological response of an organism or analysis such as clustering and gene ontology enrichment, it is important to determine whether the dynamic progression of the data has been accurately captured despite the limited number of replicates, such that one can have confidence that the results of the analysis are capturing important salient dynamic features.
by doing this, we have demonstrated a marked and consistent improvement in the results of a clustering exercise over multiple experiments, microarray platforms, and experimental designs.
one of the challenges with modeling the temporal progression of biological signals is dealing with the effect of noise and the limited number of replicates at each time point.
by pre-selecting genes based upon quality before the identification of differential expression via algorithm such as edge, it was found that the percentage of statistically enriched ontologies  was improved.
