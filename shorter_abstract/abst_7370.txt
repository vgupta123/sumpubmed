the experiments demonstrate that our method could greatly improve the prediction accuracy and speed, thus allowing large-scale ngs data prediction to be practical.
this method would guide for the special protein identification with computational intelligence strategies.
firstly, we proposed novel fingerprint features for tbp based on pseudo amino acid composition, physicochemical properties, and secondary structure.
currently, pretata achieves  <dig> % tata-binding protein prediction accuracy, which is better than all other existing methods.

tata-binding protein  is a kind of dna binding protein, which plays a key role in the transcription regulation.
wet lab experimental procedures are not only time-consuming, but also costly, so predicting protein structure and function reliably based only on amino acid sequence has significant value.
