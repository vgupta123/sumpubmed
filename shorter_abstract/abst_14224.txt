here, we adopted an experimental approach to identify conserved and unique mirnas and characterize their expression patterns in diverse tissues of pig.
the expression patterns of pig-specific mirnas also varied among the tissues examined.
identification of  <dig> mirnas and determination of the spatial expression patterns of a sub-set of these in the pig is a valuable resource for molecular biologists, breeders, and biomedical investigators interested in post-transcriptional gene regulation in pig and in related mammals, including humans.
by sequencing a small rna library generated using pooled rna from the pig heart, liver and thymus; we identified a total of  <dig> conserved mirna homologs in pig.
several hundreds of mirnas have been identified from mammals, humans, mice and rats, but little is known about the mirna component in the pig genome.
mir- <dig>  mir-26b, mir-29c and mir-30c showed ubiquitous expression in diverse tissues.
expression analysis of conserved mirnas in  <dig> different tissue types revealed heart-specific expression of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and liver-specific expression of mir- <dig>  additionally, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the heart, mir-181a and mir-142-3p in the thymus, mir- <dig> in the liver, and mir- <dig> in the stomach showed the highest levels of expression.
