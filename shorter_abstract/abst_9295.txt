despite the diversity of ways phylogenies have been illustrated making the design of a fully automated tree recognition software difficult, treeripper is a step towards automating the digitization of past phylogenies.
we also provide a dataset of  <dig> tree images and associated tree files for training and/or benchmarking future software.
optical character recognition  is used to convert the tip labels into text with the freely available tesseract-ocr software.
whilst this may have been the best format for exchanging and sharing phylogenetic hypotheses during the 20th century, the worldwide web now provides faster and automated ways of transferring and sharing phylogenetic knowledge.
