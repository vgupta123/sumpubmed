the institute for genomic research rice genome annotation  is the product of an automated pipeline and, for this reason, will benefit from the input of biologists with expertise in rice and/or particular gene families.
the primary level of curation by community annotators  has been the annotation of gene families.
despite the improvements of tools for automated annotation of genome sequences, manual curation at the structural and functional level can provide an increased level of refinement to genome annotation.
the ca models are aligned to the rice pseudomolecules and the coordinates of these alignments, along with functional annotation, are stored in the mysql eucap gene model database.
upon approval by the pas, the ca models, along with the corresponding functional annotations, are integrated into the osa <dig> genome annotation.
as of july  <dig>  the structural and/or functional annotation of  <dig>  genes representing  <dig> families have been deposited and integrated into the current gene set.
this requires tools that facilitate 1) the submission of gene annotation to an annotation project, 2) the review of the submitted models by project annotators, and 3) the incorporation of the submitted models in the ongoing annotation effort.
the alignments are reviewed by the project annotators  in the context of experimental evidence.
web pages displaying the alignments of the ca models to the osa <dig> genome models are automatically generated from the eucap gene model database.
annotation can be submitted by email or through the eucap web tool.
we have developed the eukaryotic community annotation package , an annotation tool, and have applied it to the rice genome.
