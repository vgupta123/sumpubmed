in the present study, we investigated the expression and subcellular localization of dgkβ in the hippocampus, together with its functional implication using transfected hippocampal neurons.
overexpression of wild-type dgkβ promotes dendrite outgrowth at  <dig> d in vitro  and spine maturation at  <dig> div in transfected hippocampal neurons, although its kinase-dead mutant has no effect.
transfection experiments suggest that dgkβ may be involved in the molecular machineries of dendrite outgrowth and spinogenesis through its kinase activity.
recently, we have reported that dgkβ is expressed in medium spiny neurons of the striatum and is highly concentrated at the perisynapse of dendritic spines.
dgkβ is expressed not only in projection neurons but also in interneurons and is concentrated at perisynaptic sites of asymmetrical synapses.
in the hippocampus, dgkβ is expressed in both projection neurons and interneurons and is accumulated at the perisynapse of dendritic spines in asymmetrical synapses.
however, it remains elusive how dgkβ is implicated in pathophysiological role in neurons at the cellular level.
diacylglycerol kinase  is an enzyme that phosphorylates diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid and comprises multiple isozymes of distinct properties.
