the age-effect is reasonable, since younger cells, which are actively shaping their cell walls, are more vulnerable to altered mechanical stresses while in leaves older than  <dig> das, the walls are more robust and therefore can sustain the applied forces.
this effect occurs within  <dig> hours after applied external force and is age-dependent, whereby only cells of leaves up to  <dig> days after sowing  are susceptible to the applied pressure.
cortical microtubules form a dynamic network and continuously undergo shrinking , pausing and rebuilding .
microtubules are known to play a pivotal role in determining the orientation of the cellulose microfibril deposition in the plant cell wall.
as microtubules guide the cellulose synthase complexes, this observed reorganisation pattern probably affects the cellulose deposition, contributing to the reinforcement of the cell wall in a particular position to cope with the extra-applied pressure.
