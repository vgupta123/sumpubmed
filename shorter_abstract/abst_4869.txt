although the presence of the lipi- <dig> gene cluster is confined to lineage i isolates of l. monocytogenes, a corresponding gene cluster or its remnants have been identified in many l. innocua strains.
significantly, we can reveal that placing the l. innocua lls genes under the control of a constitutive promoter results in a haemolytic phenotype, confirming that the cluster is capable of encoding a functional haemolysin.
in total 64 l. innocua strains were screened for the presence of lipi- <dig>  here we report the identification of an intact lipi- <dig> in  <dig> isolates of l. innocua and the remnants of the cluster in several others.
up until now, this pathogenicity island has been identified exclusively in a subset of lineage i isolates of the pathogen listeria monocytogenes.
listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen which is the causative agent of listeriosis and can be divided into three evolutionary lineages i, ii and iii.
