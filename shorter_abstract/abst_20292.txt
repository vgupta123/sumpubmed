we also developed a robotic magnetic beads handling instrument for single cell-based cdna synthesis to amplify immunoglobulin variable genes by rapid amplification of 5' cdna ends pcr.
ts-jpcr is conducted using a pcr-amplified immunoglobulin variable gene and an immunoglobulin gene-selective cassette  that contains all essential elements for antibody expression and overlapping areas of immunoglobulin gene-specific homology.
although the single cell-based immunoglobulin variable gene cloning technique is a powerful tool, the current methods remain an obstacle to the rapid production of large numbers of recombinant antibodies.
using these methods, we were able to produce recombinant monoclonal antibodies from large numbers of single plasma cells within four days.
our system reduces the burden of antibody discovery and engineering by rapidly producing large numbers of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in a short period of time.
during the development of a therapeutic antibody, large numbers of monoclonal antibodies are required to screen for those that are best suited for the desired activity.
we have developed a novel overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, the target-selective joint polymerase chain reaction , and applied it to the generation of linear immunoglobulin gene expression constructs.
