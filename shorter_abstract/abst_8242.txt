however, most currently employed variants of coalescent theory only consider very simple demographic scenarios of population size changes, such as exponential growth.
coalescent theory is a general framework to model genetic variation in a population.
in this framework inference and model selection is done using reversible jump markov chain monte carlo .
here we develop a coalescent approach that allows bayesian non-parametric estimation of the demographic history using genealogies reconstructed from sampled dna sequences.
the new method provides a bayesian procedure for non-parametric estimation of the demographic history.
by construction it additionally provides confidence limits and may be used jointly with other mcmc-based coalescent approaches.
this method is computationally efficient and overcomes the limitations of related non-parametric approaches such as the skyline plot.
subsequently, we reanalyze hiv- <dig> sequence data from central africa and hepatitis c virus  data from egypt.
