tnf-α-targeted reporter activity reflected endogenous tnf-α mrna expression, whereas randomly integrated tnf-α reporter lines gave variable expression in response to transcriptional and epigenetic regulators.
<dig> -dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid , currently used in cancer clinical trials to induce tnf-α gene transcription, was only effective at inducing reporter expression from tnf-α gene-targeted cells.
we conclude that gene-targeted reporter cell lines provide predictive indexing of gene transcription for drug discovery.
drugs known to induce tnf-α expression were then used to compare the authenticity of gene-targeted and randomly integrated transcriptional reporters.
in this context, reporter expression is controlled by known genetic elements that may only partially capture gene regulation and by unknown features of chromatin specific to the integration site.
