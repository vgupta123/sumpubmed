the inverse problem of designing a sequence folding into a particular target structure has only more recently received notable interest.
it performed as well as or better at finding sequences which folded in silico into the target structure than all existing methods, without the heavy bias towards cg base pairs that was observed for all other top performing methods.
the design problem seems to become more difficult on larger structures when the target structures are real structures, while no deterioration was observed for predicted structures.
on the two structure targets it also performed well, generating a perfect design for about 80% of the targets.
our method illustrates that successful designs for the inverse rna folding problem does not necessarily have to rely on heavy biases in base pair and unpaired base distributions.
rna secondary structure prediction, or folding, is a classic problem in bioinformatics: given a sequence of nucleotides, the aim is to predict the base pairs formed in its three dimensional conformation.
in this paper we present a genetic algorithm approach to solve the inverse folding problem.
the genetic algorithm has been implemented as a python program called frnakenstein.
with a growing appreciation and understanding of the functional and structural properties of rna motifs, and a growing interest in utilising biomolecules in nano-scale designs, the interest in the inverse rna folding problem is bound to increase.
however, whereas the rna folding problem from an algorithmic viewpoint has an elegant and efficient solution, the inverse rna folding problem appears to be hard.
it was benchmarked against four existing methods and several data sets totalling  <dig> real and predicted single structure targets, and on  <dig> two structure targets.
design for two structure targets is considerably more difficult, but far from impossible, demonstrating the feasibility of automated design of artificial riboswitches.
