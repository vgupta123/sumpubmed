kinetic analysis using pressure sensitive walkways can be useful in follow-up assessment of surgically treated dogs regardless of the surgical technique employed.
increased pvf values in the forelimb and the contralateral hind limb pads of affected dogs suggest a compensatory effect.

our objective was to measure the vertical forces in the pads of pitbulls with cranial cruciate ligament rupture  using a pressure sensitive walkway.
a pressure sensitive walkway was used to collect vertical force data from the pads of  <dig> pitbulls affected with unilateral cclr.
ten healthy pitbulls were included in the study as controls.
cranial cruciate ligament rupture  is one of the most important stifle injuries and a common cause of lameness in dogs.
velocity varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  m/s and acceleration was kept below ±  <dig>  m/s <dig>  differences between groups and between pads in the same limb within groups were investigated using anova and the tukey test.
peak vertical forces  were lower in the affected limb, particularly in the metatarsal pad.
