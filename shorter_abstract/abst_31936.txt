the consequence of this elimination was total sterility of all individuals, despite the continuation of normal egg production.
wolbachia is an extremely widespread bacterial endosymbiont of arthropods and nematodes that causes a variety of reproductive peculiarities.
molecular assays confirmed that elimination of wolbachia was successfully achieved through continuous exposure of populations  to rifampicin administered as  <dig> % dry weight of their yeast food source.
microbial endosymbionts play an obligatory role in the reproduction of their diplodiploid host, most likely one in which the parthenogenetic process is facilitated by wolbachia.
