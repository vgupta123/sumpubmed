the unique properties of wheat flour primarily depend on gluten, which is the most important source of protein for human being.
alternatively, we classified γ-gliadins into two types based on the length of repetitive domain.
amino acid composition analyses indicate that there is a wide range of essential amino acids in γ-gliadins, and those γ-gliadins from subgroup sg- <dig> and sg- <dig> and γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional.
a screening of toxic epitopes shows that γ-gliadins with a pattern of c <dig> and γ-gliadins with a short repetitive domain almost lack any epitopes.
it is suggested that the genes with a short repetitive domain are more nutritional and valuable.
γ-gliadin sequences in wheat and closely related aegilops species are diverse.
a total of  <dig> γ-gliadin genes were isolated from common wheat and its closely related species, among which  <dig> sequences are putatively functional.
the orf lengths of these sequences range from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and the repetitive region is mainly responsible for the size heterogeneity of γ-gliadins.
phylogenic analyses indicate that there is no obvious discrimination between sitopsis and ae.
however, no systematic research has been conducted yet.
according to the number and placement of cysteine residues, we defined nine cysteine patterns and  <dig> subgroups.
each group/subgroup contributes differently to nutritional quality and epitope content.
the complex family structure of γ-gliadins complicates the determination of their function.
therefore, it is possible to breed wheat varieties, the γ-gliadins of which are less, even non-toxic and more nutritional.
