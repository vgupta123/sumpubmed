combined analysis of aflp, cpdna sequences and ploidy level variation revealed a hybrid origin of the p. alpicola populations from south tyrol  resulting from crosses between p. pusilla and two cytotypes of p. argentea.
populations of p. collina studied in addition, have been regarded rather as recent derivatives of the hexaploid p. argentea.
three lineages of different evolutionary origin comprising two ploidy levels were identified within p. alpicola.
the observation of clones within both p. alpicola and p. collina suggested a possible apomictic mode of reproduction.
the case study of p. alpicola supports that these processes played a significant role in the creation of polymorphism in the genus potentilla.
in the present study, the alpine taxon potentilla alpicola has been chosen in order to study its presumed hybrid origin, identify underlying evolutionary processes and infer the discreteness or taxonomic value of hybrid forms.
the potentilla collina group constitutes a particularly suitable model system to study these phenomena as it is morphologically extensively variable, exclusively polyploid and expresses apomixis.
the lineages differed in parentage and the complexity of the evolutionary process.
hybridisation is presumed to be an important mechanism in plant speciation and a creative evolutionary force often accompanied by polyploidisation and in some cases by apomixis.
