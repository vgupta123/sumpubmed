at the core of the tracker is a machine learning algorithm that provides immense flexibility to image various animals  under different experimental setups and conditions.
here, we present a multi-animal tracker  that provides a user-friendly, end-to-end solution for imaging, tracking, and analyzing complex behaviors of multiple animals simultaneously.
focusing on c. elegans worms, we demonstrate the vast advantages of using this mat in studying complex behaviors.
together, our tracker provides a powerful and simple system to study complex behaviors in a quantitative, high-throughput, and accurate manner.
next, we show that worms can integrate environmental information and that directional changes mediate the enhanced chemotaxis towards richer environments.
