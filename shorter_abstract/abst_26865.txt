in larval tissue expression is often restricted to specific cell types like keratinocytes, hair cells, ionocytes and olfactory receptor neurons as demonstrated by in situ hybridization.
many aspects of the genomic arrangement and location of mammalian s <dig> genes are retained in the teleost s <dig> gene family, including a completely conserved intron/exon border between the two ef hands.
individual species feature distinctive subsets of thirteen to fourteen genes that result from local gene duplications and gene losses.
eight of the fourteen s <dig> subfamilies are unique for teleosts, while six are shared with mammalian species and three of those even with cartilaginous fish.
despite a complex pattern of gene gains and losses the total repertoire size is remarkably constant between species.
zebrafish s <dig> genes exhibit highly specific and characteristic expression patterns, showing both redundancy and divergence in their cellular expression.
several s <dig> family members are found in jawless fish already, but none of them are clear orthologs of cartilaginous or bony fish s <dig> genes.
we report that the teleost s <dig> repertoire comprises fourteen different subfamilies which show remarkable similarity across six divergent teleost species.
we have performed an extensive search in several teleost genomes to establish the s <dig> gene family in fish.
the evolutionary origin of this family is still uncertain and most studies have examined mammalian family members.
all teleost s <dig> genes show the expected structural features and are subject to strong negative selection.
the origin of the s <dig> family predates at least the segregation of jawed from jawless fish and some extant family members predate the divergence of bony from cartilaginous fish.
