however, the relationship  between scub and intron number as well as exon position is at present rather unclear.
in the algal genomes, the frequency of synonymous codons of the form nng/nnc  was positively related to intron number, but that of nna/nnt was inversely correlated; the opposite was the case in the land plant genomes.

the frequency of nnc/nng was higher and that of nna/nnt lower in two terminal exons than in the interstitial exons in the land plant genes, but the rule showed to be opposite in the algal genes.
scub patterns in the interstitial and two terminal exons mirror the different evolutionary relationships between these plant species, while the first exon shows the highest level of conservation is therefore concluded to be the one which experiences the heaviest selection pressure.
these data provide some evidence of linkage between scub, the evolution of introns and dna methylation, which brings about a new perspective for understanding how genomic variation is created during plant evolution.
the phenomenon of scub may also be related to dna methylation induced conversion of cg to at.
to explore this relationship, the sequences of a set of genes containing between zero and nine introns was extracted from the published genome sequences of three algal species, one moss, one fern and six angiosperms .
