almost every flax bgal was expressed in fibres, the majority of which expressed predominately in fibres as compared to other tissues, suggesting an important role for the expansion of this gene family in the development of this species as a fibre crop.
in this study, we investigate the transcript expression patterns and inferred evolutionary relationships of the complete set of flax gh <dig> genes, to better understand the functions of these genes in flax and other species.
expression patterns of the flax bgals were investigated using qrt-pcr and publicly available microarray data.
phylogenetic analyses of their protein sequences clustered them into eight sub-families.
flax has a large number of bgal genes, which display a distinct distribution among the bgal sub-families, in comparison to other closely related species with available whole genome assemblies.
a number of flax bgals were also observed to contain non-consensus gh <dig> active sites.
all predicted flax bgals showed evidence of expression in at least one tissue.
the phloem fibres of flax  have gelatinous-type cell walls that are rich in crystalline cellulose and depend on β-galactosidase activity for their normal development.
using the recently published flax genome assembly, we identified  <dig> β-galactosidase-like  genes, based on the presence of a gh <dig> domain.
variations displayed in the canonical gh <dig> active site suggest a variety of roles unique to flax, which will require further characterization.
