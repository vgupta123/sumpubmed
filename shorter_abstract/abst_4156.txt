the de novo assembly, combined with automated gene-by-gene annotation, generates high quality draft genomes in which the majority of protein-encoding genes are present with high accuracy.

this unified system for cataloguing neisseria genetic variation in the genome was implemented and used for multiple analyses and the data are publically available in the pubmlst neisseria database.
genealogical relationships compatible with, but at a higher resolution than, those identified by multilocus sequence typing were obtained with core genome comparisons and ribosomal protein gene analysis which revealed a genomic structure for a number of previously described phenotypes.
the approach catalogues diversity efficiently, permits analyses of a single genome or multiple genome comparisons, and is a practical approach to interpreting wgs data for large bacterial population samples.
a core genome of  <dig> loci, present in at least 95% of the population, was determined using the genome comparator tool.
