treatment of the juice with  <dig>  mm carvacrol or p-cymene reduced the numbers of e. coli o157:h <dig> to undetectable levels within 1– <dig> days at both storage temperatures.
the results showed that the natural antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and p-cymene could potentially be used to extend the shelf life and improve the safety margins in un-pasteurised chilled fruit juices.
outbreaks of food poisoning associated with drinking un-pasteurised apple juice contaminated with enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h <dig> are a cause of serious illness and occasionally death.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the addition of very low concentrations  of carvacrol and p-cymene both individually and in combination as a novel means of controlling escherichia coli o157:h <dig> in un-pasteurised apple juice.
when inoculated at a level of  <dig> log cfu/ml into un-pasteurised apple juice , escherichia coli o157:h <dig> survived for up to  <dig> and  <dig> days at 25° and 4°c, respectively.
the phenolic compounds were biocidal against both spoilage yeasts and e. coli o157:h <dig> thereby increasing the shelf-life and improving the safety of un-pasteurised apple juice, particularly when stored at chill temperatures.
the effective concentrations of carvacrol could be reduced even further by combining it at  <dig>  mm with cymene at  <dig>  mm.
the addition of natural antimicrobial substances such as the phenolic substances carvacrol and p-cymene  provides a potential new route to assure safety and extend the shelf-life of raw fruit juices.
