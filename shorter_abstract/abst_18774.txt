the trematode parasitic castrator species  that were more likely to be killed by dominant species allocated less to growth and relatively more to current reproduction than did species with greater life expectancies.
these are eight trematode parasitic castrators—the individuals of which infect and take over the bodies of the same host species—and their uninfected host, the california horn snail.
broadly, this research illustrates that parasitic castrator guilds can allow unique comparative tests discerning the forces promoting adaptive evolution.
the specific findings of this study support the hypothesis that extrinsic mortality influences species differences in growth and reproduction.
increased extrinsic mortality should select for decreased allocation to growth and for increased reproductive effort.
i quantify growth, reproductive effort, and expected extrinsic mortality for several species that, despite being different species, use the same species' phenotype for growth and survival.
as predicted, across species, growth decreased with increased extrinsic mortality, while reproductive effort increased with increased extrinsic mortality.
both genders of uninfected snails fit into the patterns observed for the parasitic castrator species, allocating as much to growth and to current reproduction as expected given their probability of reproductive death .
this study presents perhaps the first clear cross-species test of this hypothesis, capitalizing on the unique properties offered by a diverse guild of parasitic castrators .
