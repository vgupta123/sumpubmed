especially, we find significant tfs and cooperative tfs responding to environmental changes.
the conventional methods to find these specific tfs and their interactivities are slow and laborious.
the proposed method requires only microarray data and information of all tfs that bind to the gene but it has superior resolution than the current methods.
in this study, we find significant stress-specific and cell cycle-controlled tfs via constructing a transcriptional dynamic model to regulate the expression profiles of genes under different environmental conditions through microarray data.
moreover, tfs can be ranked, so that we can identify the major tfs to a stress.
we have applied this tf activity and interactivity detection method to many stress conditions, including hyper- and hypo- osmotic shock, heat shock, hydrogen peroxide and cell cycle, because the available expression time profiles for these conditions are long enough.
in this study, a novel efficient method is proposed to detect the tfs and their interactivities that regulate yeast genes that respond to any specific environment change.
in order to increase the activities of stress-protection functions in response to an environmental change, the internal cell mechanisms need to induce certain specific gene expression patterns and pathways by changing the expression levels of specific transcription factors .
in addition, the cross-talks and interactivities among different stress-induced pathways are specified by the proposed scheme to gain much insight into protective mechanisms of yeast under different environmental stresses.
our method may also be applicable to other stresses if the gene expression profiles have been examined for a sufficiently long time.
our method not only can find stress-specific tfs but also can predict their regulatory strengths and interactivities.
