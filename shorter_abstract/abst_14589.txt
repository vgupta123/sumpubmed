we were also able to identify proteins expressed and translated in the digestive system, which until now had been exclusively associated to venom glands.
we here report on our investigations of both md and df of the spider nephilingis  cruentata through the use of next generation sequencing and shotgun proteomics.
the results of a comparative study of spiders in distinct physiological conditions allow us to propose some digestion mechanisms in this interesting animal taxon.
besides that, data analyses show a large gene duplication event in araneae digestive process evolution, mainly of astacin genes.
whereas many high throughput  techniques focus on biomolecules in spider venom, so far this approach has not yet been applied to investigate the protein composition of spider midgut diverticula  and digestive fluid .
we identified enzymes involved in the extracellular and intracellular phases of digestion.
phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding transcript in arachnida suggests that astacins have acquired an unprecedented role for extracorporeal digestion in araneae, with different orthologs used by each family.
they do this by combining both extracorporeal and intracellular digestion.
