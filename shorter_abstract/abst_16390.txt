wnt signaling affects fundamental development pathways by regulating cell proliferation and differentiation.
instead, spiperone increases intracellular calcium levels in a similar manner to thapsigargin, that also impedes wnt signal transduction.
it inhibits wnt signaling by enhancing intracellular calcium levels.
inhibition of protein kinase c had no effect on spiperone-mediated antagonism of wnt signaling.
we identified spiperone, a psychotropic drug, as a novel wnt inhibitor, which specifically blocks canonical wnt signaling prior to the activation of Î²-catenin.
