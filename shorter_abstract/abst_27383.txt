to accomplish this, twelve salmonella strains from the broiler production continuum were transformed with the broad host range plasmid paklux <dig>  and a chicken skin attachment model was developed.
this study demonstrated that bioluminescence is a sensitive and effective tool to detect salmonella on food products in real-time.
salmonella strains carrying paklux <dig> constitutively expressed the luxcdabe operon and were therefore detectable using bioluminescence.
strains were characterized in terms of bioluminescence properties and plasmid stability.
the effect of washing on attachment of salmonella strains to chicken skin was tested using bioluminescent strains, which revealed the attachment properties of each strain.
to assess the usefulness of bioluminescent salmonella strains in food safety studies, we developed an attachment model using chicken skin.
in this research, we developed bioluminescent salmonella strains that can be used for real-time monitoring of the pathogen's growth on food products.
bioluminescence imaging is a promising technology that can be utilized to evaluate new food safety measures for reducing salmonella contamination on food products.
