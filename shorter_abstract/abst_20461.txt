fruits from several species of the rosaceae family are reported to cause allergic reactions in certain populations.
this study was to characterize putative peach allergen genes for their genomic sequences and linkage map positions, and to compare them with previously characterized homologous genes in apple .
the insight gained will help to identify key genes causing differences in allergenicity among different cultivars of peach and other prunus species.
in peach , these allergen gene families are denoted as pru p  <dig> to  <dig> and for almond pru du  <dig> to  <dig>  genetic analysis using current molecular tools may be helpful to establish the cause of allergenicity differences observed among different peach cultivars.
these families of putative allergen genes in apple  have been mapped on linkage maps and subsequent genetic study on allelic diversity and hypoallergenic traits has been carried out recently.
the allergens identified belong to mainly four protein families: pathogenesis related  <dig> proteins, thaumatin-like proteins, lipid transfer proteins and profilins.
five pru p/du  <dig> genes were mapped on four different linkage groups, two very similar pru p/du  <dig>  genes  were on g <dig>  pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig> pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig> and pru p/du  <dig>  on g <dig>  there were differences in the intron and exon structure in these pru p/du  <dig> genes and in their amino acid composition.
a total of  <dig> putative peach/almond allergen genes have been mapped on five linkage groups.
