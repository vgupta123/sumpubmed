previous studies showed that the amygdala not only has an excitatory effect on the hpa axis but also plays a key role in fear-related behaviors.
wistar rats were divided into  <dig> d,  <dig> d,  <dig> d groups after single prolonged stress  and control group.
the expression of mr- and gr-ir intensity, mrna and protein within the amygdala decreased after sps at  <dig> day, and then gradually recovered by  <dig> days, although the degree of decrease and recovery were different amongst techniques.
morphological changes of the ultrastructure of the amygdala neurons were assessed by transmission electron microscopy .
in our previous study, down-regulation of mr and gr in the hippocampus of ptsd rats was found.
open field test  and elevated plus maze tests  were performed to examine fear-related behaviors.
but the roles of mr and gr in the amygdala of ptsd rats is incompletely understood.
of and epm showed enhanced fear in sps rats.
abnormal neuronal morphology was discovered in the amygdala of sps rats.
post-traumatic stress disorder  is an anxious disorder associated with low levels of corticosterone and enhanced negative feedback of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal  axis.
but more cytoplasmic distribution and decreased colocalization of mr- and gr-ir were observed in the amygdala after  <dig> days of sps.
