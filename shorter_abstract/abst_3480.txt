in a survey for early transcriptionally activated plant genes we identified a n. benthamiana gene specifically induced at infected root tips that encodes a peptide with danger-associated molecular features.
phytophthora palmivora, a tropical relative of the potato late blight pathogen, causes rotting diseases in many tropical crops including papaya, cocoa, oil palm, black pepper, rubber, coconut, durian, mango, cassava and citrus.
these results constitute a major advance in our understanding of p. palmivora diseases and establish extensive resources for p. palmivora pathogenomics, effector-aided resistance breeding and the generation of induced resistance to phytophthora root infections.
plant-pathogenic oomycetes are responsible for economically important losses in crops worldwide.
de novo assembly of p. palmivora transcriptome and semi-automated prediction and annotation of the secretome enabled robust identification of conserved infection-promoting effectors.
despite the importance of p. palmivora diseases, genetic resources to allow for disease resistance breeding and identification of microbial effectors are scarce.
time-resolved dual transcriptomics revealed different pathogen and host transcriptome dynamics.
