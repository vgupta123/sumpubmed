the tec-family kinase itk plays an important role during t-cell activation and function, and controls also conventional versus innate-like t-cell development.
the signatures of cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total cd3+ cells.
cyclosporin a -treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of tcr-mediated calcineurin/nfat-activation is dependent on itk.
finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of itk-deficient t-cells with that of btk-deficient b-cells and a common set of transcripts was found.
we have characterized the transcriptome of itk-deficient cd3+ t-cells, including cd4+ and cd8+ subsets, using affymetrix microarrays.
the largest difference between itk-/- and wt cd3+ t-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g.
