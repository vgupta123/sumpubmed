however, no significant difference in allelic frequency was observed for other snps between cases and controls.
il-1a and il-1b are important inflammatory cytokines that mediate the inflammation and initiate the immune response against virus infection.
four snps  in il1a gene and three snps  in il1b gene were genotyped by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight  mass spectrometry platform, and the associations of the genetic variants of il- <dig> with susceptibility to apdm <dig> were then assessed.
this study provides a new insight into pathogenesis of apdm <dig>  suggesting that genetic variants of il-1a and il-1b may exert a substantial impact on the susceptibility of apdm <dig> virus infection.
the polymorphisms of rs <dig> in il1a gene and rs <dig> in il1b gene were found to be associated with susceptibility to apdm <dig> with p values of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively.
in this study, we investigated the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms  of interleukin-1a  and interleukin-1b  and the susceptibility to  <dig> pandemic a/h1n <dig> influenza pdm09).
