terrestrial rabies is not present in the united kingdom and has been eliminated from western europe.
thus, the disease control strategy has to target both host populations.
if populations of both host species are sufficiently large, epizootics are driven by within-species transmission, while cross-species-infection appears to be of minor importance.
with the aim to analyse the spread and emergency control of rabies in this two species host community, a simulation model was constructed.
the model confirmed that both fox and badger populations, separately, were competent hosts for the spread of rabies.
rabies is a fatal viral disease that potentially can affect all mammals.
the combined species community was a very strong rabies host.
different control strategies involving anti-rabies vaccination and population culling were developed, considering control application rates, spatial extent and timing.
thus, the drivers of epidemiology depend on the potential of separate host species to sustain the disease.
however, disease spread within species appeared to be more important than cross-species infection.
realistic vaccination levels were not sufficient to control rabies in high-density badger populations.
although fox and badger populations in the uk are exceptionally dense, an outbreak of rabies can be controlled with a higher than 90% chance, if control response is quick and follows a strict regime.
to control a rabies outbreak in the two species, both species had to be targeted.
in contrast, an uncontrolled rabies outbreak in the south of england would quickly develop into a strong epizootic involving tens of thousands of rabid foxes and badgers.
