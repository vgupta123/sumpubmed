extensive gene annotation can be added to both sequences using a standardized general feature format  file.
for example, enhancers contain clusters of transcription factor binding sites that change in number, orientation, and spacing during evolution yet the enhancer retains its activity.
several problems exist with current methods used to align dna sequences for comparative sequence analysis.
gata uses the ncbi-blastn program in conjunction with post-processing to exhaustively align two dna sequences.
to address some of these issues, we created a stand alone, platform independent, graphic alignment tool for comparative sequence analysis .
it provides researchers with a fine-grained alignment and visualization tool aptly suited for non-coding, 0â€“ <dig> kb, pairwise, sequence analysis.
since the alignment is visual and does not contain gaps, gene annotation can be added to both sequences to create a thoroughly descriptive picture of dna conservation that is well suited for comparative sequence analysis.
yet dot plots do not actually align sequences and thus cannot account well for base insertions or deletions.
lastly, dot plots and dynamic programming text outputs fail to provide an intuitive means for visualizing dna alignments.
dot plot analysis is often used to estimate non-coding sequence relatedness.
