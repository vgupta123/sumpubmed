most of these genes might have transferred from bacterial species through horizontal gene transfer.
compared to other available francisella genomes, it is most similar to the genome of francisella philomiragia subsp.
the genome is rearranged compared to the available francisella genomes even though we found no is-elements in the genome.
comparing the novel genome with other available francisella genomes, we found around  <dig> % of unique genes present in francisella noatunensis subsp.
evolutionary analysis of the francisella genomes, strongly suggests that human and fish pathogenic francisella species have evolved independently from free-living metabolically competent francisella species.
comparative analysis between human and fish pathogen also provide insights into genes responsible for pathogenecity.
the fish pathogen has lost non-essential genes some time ago.
recently francisella species have been reported to cause mortality in aquaculture species like atlantic cod and tilapia.
these findings will contribute to understanding the evolution of francisella species and pathogenesis.
our analysis of pseudogenes indicates that the evolution of francisella subspeciesâ€™s pseudogenes from tilapia is old with large number of pseudogenes having more than one inactivating mutation.
computational pathway analysis indicates that a number of the metabolic pathways are disrupted due to pseudogenes.
we have completed the sequencing and draft assembly of the francisella noatunensis subsp.
francisella is a genus of gram-negative bacterium highly virulent in fishes and human where f. tularensis is causing the serious disease tularaemia in human.
