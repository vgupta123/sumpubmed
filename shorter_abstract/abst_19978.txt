in this paper we have proposed an integrated framework for nsclc computer-aided diagnosis and survival analysis using novel image markers.
the entire biomedical imaging informatics framework consists of cell detection, segmentation, classification, discovery of image markers, and survival analysis.
the survival analysis demonstrates strong prediction power of the statistical model built from the discovered image markers.

significant image markers have been discovered using the bootstrap analysis and the survival prediction performance of the model is also evaluated.
based on cell segmentation results, a set of extensive cellular morphological features are extracted using efficient feature descriptors.
the results show that the random forest and adaboost offer the best classification performance for nsclc.
non-small cell lung cancer , the most common type of lung cancer, is one of serious diseases causing death for both men and women.
computer-aided diagnosis and survival prediction of nsclc, is of great importance in providing assistance to diagnosis and personalize therapy planning for lung cancer patients.
the proposed model have been applied to a lung cancer dataset that contains  <dig> cases with complete clinical information.
finally, a cox proportional hazards model is fitted by component-wise likelihood based boosting.
next, eight different classification techniques that can handle high-dimensional data have been evaluated and then compared for computer-aided diagnosis.
the classification performance exhibits high correlations between the discovered image markers and the subtypes of nsclc.
