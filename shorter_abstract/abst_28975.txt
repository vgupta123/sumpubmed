likewise, the cngcs from all plant lineages clustered into four groups , where group ii was conserved in all land plants.
the various cis-acting regulatory elements in the upstream sequences may be responsible for responding to multiple stimuli, including hormonal, biotic and abiotic stresses.
prediction of cis-acting regulatory elements in 5′ upstream sequences and expression analyses through quantitative qpcr demonstrated that oscngc genes were highly responsive to multiple stimuli including hormonal , biotic  and abiotic  stress.
there are  <dig> cngc genes in rice, which were probably expanded through chromosomal segmentation and tandem duplications and comprise a pbc and a “hinge” region in the cnbd domain, featured by a stringent motif.
to date there has not been a genome-wide overview of the cngc gene family in any economically important crop, including rice .
there is an urgent need for a thorough genome-wide analysis and experimental verification of this gene family in rice.
gene duplication analysis revealed that both chromosomal segmentation  and tandem duplications  significantly contributed to the expansion of this gene family.

in addition, oscngc proteins also contain various other functional motifs and post-translational modification sites.
we successively built a stringent motif: --x--x-g- <cit> -ell-x-w-x-sa-x-t-x--af-x-l) that recognizes the rice cngcs specifically.
they have been implicated in the uptake of both essential and toxic cations, ca2+ signaling, pathogen defense, and thermotolerance in plants.
