the resilient mycobacterial cell wall, the presence of tissue debris and the paucibacillary nature of some cattle vl tissue may all contribute to this observation.
the is <dig> pcr is a realistic screening method for rapid identification of positive cases but the sensitivity of single copy methods, like rd <dig> and also of spoligotyping will need to be improved to make these applicable for direct testing of tissue extracts.
underlying these series of experiments was the need for a versatile dna extraction protocol which could handle tissue samples and with the potential for automation.
following modification of the extraction protocol, detection rate with the is <dig> and rd <dig> methods increased to 91% and 59% respectively.
we have evaluated a sensitive screening assay for mycobacterium tuberculosis  complex organisms and a specific assay for detecting mycobacterium bovis dna in lymph nodes taken from cattle with evidence of bovine tuberculosis.
initial testing of field samples of bovine lymph nodes with visible lesions  highlighted two shortfalls of the molecular approach.
a series of further experiments indicated that the discrepancy between sensitivity of detection found with purified mycobacterial dna and direct testing of field samples was due to limited mycobacterial dna recovery from tissue homogenates rather than pcr inhibition.
for confirmation of m. bovis we used primers flanking a specific deletion in the genome of m. bovis known as region of difference  <dig> .
the minimum detection limits of the is <dig> method was < i genome copy and for the rd <dig> pcr was  <dig> genome copies.
a simple means of increasing the efficiency of mycobacterial dna recovery was assessed using a further pool of  <dig> cattle vl.
both methods can be readily adapted for quantitative pcr with the use of sybr green intercalating dye on the rotorgene  <dig> platform .
secondly, the success rate of spoligotyping applied directly to clinical material was 51% compared with cultures.
