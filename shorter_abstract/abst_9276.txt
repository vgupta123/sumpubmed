a rose genetic database will enable comprehensive analysis of gene expression and regulation via mirna among different rosa cultivars.
statistical analyses of mirna profiles revealed both shared and species-specific mirnas, which presumably effect flower development and phenotypes.
the database provides a comprehensive genetic resource which can be used to better understand rose flower development and to identify candidate genes for important phenotypes.
in this study, we constructed a rose mirna and transcriptome database, and we analyzed the mirnas and transcriptome generated from the flower tissues of four rosa cultivars.
roses , which belong to the family rosaceae, are the most economically important ornamental plantsâ€”making up 30% of the floriculture market.
