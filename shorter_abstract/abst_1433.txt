in contrast, the knockout of the male-specific dpy-30l <dig> gene results in male sterility, as does the double knockout of dpy-30l <dig> and dpy-30l <dig>  a closer inspection showed that dpy-30l <dig> is expressed in elongated spermatids but not in early or mature sperm.
constitutive expression of the stronger interactor, dpy-30l <dig> , in transgenic flies inhibits mtf- <dig> activity and results in elevated sensitivity to cd and zn, an effect that could be rescued by co-overexpression of dmtf- <dig>  electrophoretic mobility shift assays  suggest that dpy-30l <dig> interferes with the binding of mtf- <dig> to its cognate mre binding site.
the results from these studies reveal an inhibitory effect of dpy-30l <dig> on mtf- <dig> and an essential role for dpy-30l <dig> in male fertility.
a drosophila interactome analysis revealed two candidate dmtf- <dig> interactors, both of which are related to the small regulatory protein dumpy- <dig>  of the worm c. elegans.
mutants affect mating type in yeast and male mating in c. elegans.
targeted gene disruption by homologous recombination revealed that dpy-30l <dig> knockout flies are viable and show no overt disruption of metal homeostasis.
dpy-30l <dig> is expressed in the larval brain, gonads, imaginal discs, salivary glands and in the brain, testes, ovaries and salivary glands of adult flies.
dpy- <dig> is the founding member of a protein family involved in chromatin modifications, notably histone methylation.
mutant sperm had impaired motility and failed to accumulate in sperm storage organs of females.
