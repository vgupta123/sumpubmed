our study suggests that membrane trafficking and compartmentalization were not only key features for the emergence of eukaryotic cells but also drove the separation of the eukaryotes in the different taxa.
our in silico analysis of this enth/anth/vhs superfamily, consisting of proteins gathered from  <dig> complete genomes representative of the different eukaryotic taxa, revealed that genomic distribution of this superfamily allows to discriminate fungi and metazoa from plantae and protists.
