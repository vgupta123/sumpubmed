these results demonstrate the complex effect of single or multiple contaminants exposure at cellular and molecular level, with significant implications that might lead to the activation of pathological mechanisms.
data analysis identified  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes as a response to e. coli exposure, while for zea treated cells,  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated.
the altered gene expression pattern was further classified into  <dig> functional groups.
after treating the cells with the two contaminants, either separately or in combination, the differential gene expression between groups was assessed, using the microarray technology.
the gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of toxin interaction, an interface between the organism and its surroundings.
