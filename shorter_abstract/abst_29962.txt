comparative linkage mapping of an estimated 35% of the deer mouse genome was done with respect to the rattus and mus genomes.
the linkage analysis revealed the peromyscus genome to have a higher degree of synteny and gene order conservation with the rattus genome.
these data suggest that:  <dig>  the rattus and peromyscus genomes more closely represent ancestral muroid and rodent genomes than that of mus.
<dig>  the high level of genome rearrangement observed in muroid rodents is especially pronounced in mus.
deer mice  and congeneric species are the most common north american mammals.
