by systematically screening the sncrna mutant library, we show that the sncrna gcvb is a novel regulator of acid resistance in e. coli.
we demonstrate that gcvb enhances the ability of e. coli to survive low ph by upregulating the levels of the alternate sigma factor rpos.
acid resistance in e. coli is hierarchically controlled by numerous regulators among which are small noncoding rnas .
gcvb positively regulates acid resistance by affecting rpos expression.
these data advance our understanding of the sncrna regulatory network involved in modulating acid resistance in e. coli.
in this study, we individually deleted seventy-nine sncrna genes from the e. coli k12-mg <dig> chromosome, and established a single-sncrna gene knockout library.
the low ph environment of the human stomach is lethal for most microorganisms; but not escherichia coli, which can tolerate extreme acid stress.
