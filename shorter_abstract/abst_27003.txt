cyclophosphamide pre-treatment augments the anti-tumor effect by increasing the proliferation of interferon-gamma producing cells in the adoptive host.
the predominant mediators of tumor regression are cd8+ and derived from cd62l- t cells.
we hypothesized that tumor regression is mediated by a subset of the transferred t lymphocytes, which selectively infiltrate the tumor draining lymph nodes and proliferate in vivo.
adoptively transferred cells preferentially migrated to and/or proliferated in the tumor draining lymph nodes, peaking at day  <dig>  and remained up to day  <dig>  cfse-stained cells were seen in tumors, also peaking at day  <dig> .
bryostatin and ionomycin-activated cells proliferated vigorously in vivo, with  <dig> generations evident in the tumor draining lymph nodes on day  <dig>  cfse-stained cells found in the tumor draining lymph nodes on day  <dig> were 30% cd8+, 72% cd4+, 95% cd44+, and 39% cd69+.
these cells infiltrate 4t <dig> tumors, track preferentially to tumor draining lymph nodes, have an activated phenotype, and proliferate in vivo.
adoptive transfer of b/i activated tumor draining lymphocytes induces regression of advanced 4t <dig> tumors, and depletion of cd <dig>  but not cd <dig> t cells, abrogated tumor regression in mice.
adoptively transferred cd8+ cd62llow t cells are the principal mediators of tumor regression, and host t cells are not required.
regression of established tumors can be induced by adoptive immunotherapy with tumor draining lymph node lymphocytes activated with bryostatin and ionomycin.
