adult protobothrops venom promotes hemorrhage, hypotension, incoagulable blood, and prey digestion, consistent with mammalian predation.
the protobothrops transcriptome contained transcripts for  <dig> venom-related proteins, while the ovophis transcriptome contained  <dig>  in both, transcript abundances spanned six orders of magnitude.
mass spectrometry identified peptides from 100% of transcripts that occurred at higher than contaminant  levels, including a number of proteins never before sequenced from snakes.
ovophis venom composition is less readily interpreted, owing to insufficient pharmacological data for venom serine and metalloproteases, which comprise more than  <dig> % of ovophis transcripts, but only  <dig> % of protobothrops transcripts.
ovophis venom apparently represents a hybrid strategy optimized for frogs and small mammals.
here, both illumina cdna sequencing and lc/ms were used to compare the transcriptomes and proteomes of two pit vipers, protobothrops flavoviridis and ovophis okinavensis, which differ greatly in their biology.
advances in dna sequencing and proteomics have facilitated quantitative comparisons of snake venom composition.
the former quantifies transcript composition, allowing detection of novel proteins, but cannot indicate which proteins are actually secreted, as does ms. we show, for the first time, that transcript and peptide abundances are correlated.
this study illustrates the power of cdna sequencing combined with ms profiling.
these transcriptomes reveal fundamentally different envenomation strategies.
