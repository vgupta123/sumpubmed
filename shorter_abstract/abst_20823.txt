we specifically proposed that the metabolic responses to contraction would be modified under such circumstances, revealing endogenous strategies engaged to protect the muscle adenine nucleotide pool.
despite such contrasting metabolic responses, muscle tension and oxygen consumption were identical during all contraction periods from  <dig> to  <dig> min.
repeated periods of muscle contraction, with low blood flow, results in cessation of muscle ammonia production which is suggestive of a dramatic reduction in flux through amp deaminase.
patients suffering from intermittent claudication  experience repeated periods of muscle contraction with low blood flow, throughout the day and this may contribute to the hypothesised skeletal muscle abnormalities.
however, no study has evaluated the consequences of intermittent contraction with low blood flow on skeletal muscle tissue.
utilizing a canine gracilis model , the muscle was stimulated to contract  for three  <dig> min periods  under low blood flow conditions , followed by  <dig> hr recovery and then a fourth period of  <dig> min stimulation.
direct arterio-venous sampling allowed for the calculation of muscle metabolite efflux and oxygen consumption.
muscle biopsies were obtained prior to and following the first and fourth contraction periods.
during the fourth contraction period no ammonia efflux or change in muscle atp content occured.
subsequently, lactate efflux was similar during the first three periods, while ammonia efflux was reduced by the third period.
during this period there was also a  <dig> fold increase in muscle lactate concentration and a substantial increase in muscle lactate and ammonia efflux.
