the encoded orthologous proteins share 75-85% amino acid identity, and the genes for hc-toxin biosynthesis are duplicated in both fungi.
a set of representative housekeeping proteins show a similar high level of amino acid identity between c. carbonum and a. jesenskae, which is consistent with the close relatedness of these two genera within the family pleosporaceae .
hc-toxin, a cyclic tetrapeptide, is a virulence determinant for the plant pathogenic fungus cochliobolus carbonum.
the major genes  involved in the biosynthesis of hc-toxin were identified from a. jesenskae by genomic sequencing.
the genes may have moved by horizontal transfer between the two species, but it cannot be excluded that they were present in a common ancestor and lost from other species of alternaria and cochliobolus.
it was recently discovered that another fungus, alternaria jesenskae, also produces hc-toxin.
this is the first report that the plant virulence factor hc-toxin is made by an organism other than c. carbonum.
