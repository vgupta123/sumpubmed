although some genetic linkage maps of these populations have been aligned with each other using publicly available dna markers, the number of common markers among genetic maps is still low, limiting the ability to compare candidate gene and qtl locations across germplasm.
est-ssr markers polymorphic in multiple populations served as anchor markers and allowed the construction of the first comprehensive consensus map for ryegrass.
genetic markers and linkage mapping are basic prerequisites for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning.
a set of  <dig> expressed sequence tag -derived simple sequence repeat  markers has been assigned to map positions using eight different ryegrass mapping populations.
the consensus linkage map for ryegrass based on eight mapping populations and constructed using a large set of publicly available lolium est-ssrs mapped for the first time together with previously mapped ssr markers will allow for consolidating existing mapping and qtl information in ryegrass.
map and markers presented here will prove to be an asset in the development for both molecular breeding of ryegrass as well as comparative genetics and genomics within grass species.
in the case of the key grassland species lolium spp., numerous mapping populations have been developed and characterised for various traits.
the integrated map was complemented with  <dig> ssrs from previously published linkage maps and finally contained  <dig> est-derived and genomic ssr markers.
