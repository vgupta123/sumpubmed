very little is known about transcriptional activity of individual hml- <dig> loci in human tissues, though.
our study furthermore shows that expressed sequence tag  data are insufficient to describe transcriptional activity of hml- <dig> and other herv loci in tissues of interest.
moreover, large-scale, specialized studies are indicated to better comprehend transcriptional activity and regulation of hervs.
presence of gag and env antibodies in gct patients is not correlated with activation of individual loci.
by employing private nucleotide differences between loci, we assigned ~ <dig> hml- <dig> cdnas to individual hml- <dig> loci, identifying, in total,  <dig> transcriptionally active hml- <dig> proviruses.
hml- <dig> proviruses previously reported capable of forming an infectious hml- <dig> variant are transcriptionally active in germ cell tissue.
several hml- <dig> rec-encoding loci are expressed in gct and non-gct tissues.
our, to date, largest-scale study reveals in greater detail expression patterns of individual hml- <dig> loci in human tissues of clinical interest.
we thus emphasize the need for a specialized herv transcriptome project.
expression of proviruses of the herv-k family has been associated with development of human tumors, in particular germ cell tumors .
herv transcripts are found in every human tissue.
several loci are active in various human tissue types.
a significant proportion of the human genome is comprised of human endogenous retroviruses .
