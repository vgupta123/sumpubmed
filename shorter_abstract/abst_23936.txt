populus is one of favorable model plants because of its small genome.
population of pnfl cdna clones represents 44% of the predicted genes in the populus genome.
reaching the post genome era, functional genomics of populus is getting more important for well-comprehended plant science.
development of bioresorce serving functional genomics is making rapid progress.
we promoted collection and annotation of the ests from populus full-length enriched cdna clones as part of functional genomics of tree species.
our resource of p. nigra full-length enriched clones is expected to provide valuable tools to gain further insight into genome annotation and functional genomics in populus.
huge efforts have achieved deposits of expressed sequence tags  in various plant species consequently accelerating functional analysis of genes.
structural genomics of populus has reached a breakpoint as nucleotides of the entire genome have been determined.
