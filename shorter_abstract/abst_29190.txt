after individual tryptic digests of the most abundant coomassie-stained protein spots, partial peptide sequence information was deduced from tandem mass spectrometric  fragmentation spectra and subsequently used for protein identifications by database searches.
only recently it was noticed that in addition to mineral salts, xylem sap contains organic nutrients and even proteins.
this study provides a comprehensive overview of the most abundant proteins present in xylem sap of brassica napus.
substance transport in higher land plants is mediated by vascular bundles, consisting of phloem and xylem strands that interconnect all plant organs.
since brassica napus, a close relative of the fully sequenced model plant arabidopsis thaliana, was used as the experimental system, our results provide a large number of candidate proteins for directed molecular and biochemical analyses of the physiological functions of the xylem under different environmental and developmental conditions.
these identifications include different proteins potentially involved in defence-related reactions and cell wall metabolism.
this approach will allow exploiting many of the already established functional genomic resources, like i.e.
a number of  <dig> proteins could be identified from which many previously were not known to be localized to this compartment in any other plant species.
we used root-pressure xylem exudate, collected from cut brassica napus stems, to extract total proteins.
