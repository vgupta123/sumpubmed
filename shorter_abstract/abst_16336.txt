using in-situ hybridization, we showed that spg <dig>  afg3l <dig> and afg3l <dig> have a similar cellular pattern of expression, with high levels in mitral cells, purkinje cells, deep cerebellar nuclei cells, neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and brainstem motor neurons.
using quantitative rt-pcr, we measured the expression levels of spg <dig>  afg3l <dig>  and afg3l <dig> in the mouse brain.
neurons involved in sca <dig> and hereditary spastic paraplegia display high levels of expression, but similar or even higher expression is also present in other types of neurons, not involved in these diseases, suggesting that the selective cell sensitivity should be attributed to other, still unknown, mechanisms.
in all regions afg3l <dig> is the most abundant transcript, followed by spg <dig>  and afg3l <dig>  with a ratio of approximately 5:3: <dig> in whole-brain mrna.
