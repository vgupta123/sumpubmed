the near identity of backbone structures of this pair of proteins entails that the significant differences in their thermal stabilities are encoded exclusively by the identity of the amino acid side-chains.
of particular interest are pairs of homologous structures that are structurally very similar, but differ significantly in thermal stability.
classification of the amino acid substitutions as a function of structure therefore allows the identification of amino acids which potentially contribute to the observed thermal stability of tterbp in the absence of large structural heterogeneities.
furthermore, the degree of sequence divergence is strongly correlated with structure; with a high degree of conservation in the core progressing to increased diversity in the boundary and surface regions.
comparison of experimentally determined mesophilic and thermophilic homologous protein structures is an important tool for understanding the mechanisms that contribute to thermal stability.
different factors that may possibly contribute to thermal stability appear to be differentially encoded in each of these regions of the protein.
the tterbp/ecrbp pair therefore offers an opportunity to dissect contributions to thermal stability by side-chains alone in the absence of large structural differences.
