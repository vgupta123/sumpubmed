we studied sequences and copy number variation of rhoxf <dig> in humans and  <dig> nonhuman primate species as well as the expression patterns in human, chimpanzee, white-browed gibbon and rhesus macaque.
as male reproductive system is often the target of natural and/or sexual selection during evolution, in this study, we aim to dissect the pattern of molecular evolution of rhoxf <dig> in primates and its potential functional consequence.
gene expression analysis demonstrated that besides the preferential expression in the reproductive system, rhoxf <dig> is also expressed in the brain.
the rapid evolution and copy number changes of rhoxf <dig> had been driven by darwinian positive selection acting on the male reproductive system and possibly also on the central nervous system, which sheds light on understanding the role of homeobox genes in adaptive evolution.
our evidence suggests that  <dig> nonhuman primate species have one rhoxf <dig> copy, and two copies are present in humans and four old world monkey species, and at least  <dig> copies in chimpanzees.
the quantitative data suggests expression pattern divergence among primate species.
the gene copy number analysis showed that there had been parallel gene duplications/losses in multiple primate lineages.
homeobox genes are the key regulators during development, and they are in general highly conserved with only a few reported cases of rapid evolution.
rhoxf <dig> is an x-linked homeobox gene in primates.
rhoxf <dig> is a fast-evolving homeobox gene in primates.
coding sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggested multi-lineage strong positive selection on rhoxf <dig> during primate evolution, especially during the origins of humans and chimpanzees.
