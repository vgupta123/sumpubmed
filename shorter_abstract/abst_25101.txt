our results do not imply a functional relation of the trans-nat arising from pseudogenes over their respective parental genes but add evidence for it and stress the importance of duplication mechanisms of genetic material in the generation of non-coding rnas.
naturally occurring antisense transcripts  are non-coding rnas that may regulate the activity of sense transcripts to which they bind because of complementarity.
pseudogene formation may be one evolutionary mechanism that generates trans-nats to the parental gene.
for example, this could occur if the parental gene is regulated by a cis-nat that is copied as a trans-nat in the pseudogene.
to support this we identified human pseudogenes with a trans-nat to the parental gene in their antisense strand by analysis of the database of expressed sequence tags .
instead, we found higher similarity to the parental gene in a region nearby the 3' end of the trans-nats.
we found that the mutations that appeared in these trans-nats after the pseudogene formation do not show the flat distribution that would be expected in a non functional transcript.
we also provide a plausible explanation for the large transcripts that can be found in the antisense strand of some pseudogenes.
