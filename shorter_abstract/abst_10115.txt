the method uses boosted ensembles of deep networks to make predictions and participated in the casp <dig> experiment.

a number of proteins contain regions which do not adopt a stable tertiary structure in their native state.
these results are achieved in part by a boosting procedure which is able to steadily increase balanced accuracy and the area under the roc curve over several rounds.
this work presents a new sequence based approach for the prediction of protein disorder.
in a  <dig> fold cross validation procedure on a dataset of  <dig> proteins, the method achieved an average balanced accuracy of  <dig>  and an area under the roc curve of  <dig> .
the method also compared competitively when evaluated against a number of state-of-the-art disorder predictors on casp <dig> and casp <dig> benchmark datasets.
