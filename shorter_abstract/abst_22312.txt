dna fragments were amplified from  <dig> regions of c. intestinalis sp.
in c. intestinalis, these two genes have lost their archetypal topology within the cluster, such that hox <dig> is located between hox <dig> and hox <dig>  a subset of the above primers was used to perform successful amplification in c. intestinalis sp.
linkage disequilibrium between the aforementioned loci was calculated in the backcross generation.
this latter result represents an important platform for future studies on hox genes showing deviations from the archetypal topology.
a snp subset was used to determine the genetic distance between hox- <dig> and - <dig> genes.
the genetic distance of the hox- <dig> and - <dig> loci, computed combining a classical backcross approach with the application of snp markers, was found to be  <dig>  cm .
we provide the first reliable computation of genetic distance in this important model chordate.
the highest snp frequency was detected in the hox <dig> and hox <dig> intragenic regions.
the tunicate ciona intestinalis , a major model system for evolutionary and developmental genetics of chordates, harbours two cryptic species.
b. in this cryptic species,  <dig> snps were identified within  <dig> bp:  <dig> in non-coding and  <dig> in coding regions.
snps here described allow analysis and comparisons within and between c. intestinalis cryptic species.
to assess the degree of intra- and inter-specific genetic variability, we report the identification and analysis of c. intestinalis snp  markers.
