these findings highlight the strengths of systems biology approaches to the refinement of sequence-based annotations, and to provide new insight into fundamental genome-level biology for this important human pathogen.
the increasing number of infections caused by strains of klebsiella pneumoniae that are resistant to multiple antibiotics has developed into a major medical problem worldwide.

through the acquisition and simultaneous analysis of multiple sample-matched â€“omics data sets from two growth conditions, we detected  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> binding sites for rna polymerase, rpod, and rpos, respectively,  <dig> rna polymerase-guided transcript segments, and  <dig> transcription start sites throughout the genome.
moreover, analysis of the transcription start site data identified  <dig> probable leaderless mrnas, while analysis of unannotated transcripts suggested the presence of  <dig> putative open reading frames,  <dig> small rnas, and  <dig> antisense transcripts that are not currently annotated.
