semia <dig> was analyzed within the mesorhizobium groups to define the underlying causes of taxonomic identification.
the results of the phylogenetic analysis clearly show semia <dig> is part of the mesorhizobium group and suggest a reclassification is warranted.
an improved understanding of bacterial strains such as the mesorhizobium genus would increase our knowledge of classification and evolution of these species.
the genomes of isolated semia <dig> showed several orthologs with m. huakuii, m. erdmanii and m. loti.
evidence based on genomic sequences is extremely important to confirm the phylogenetic relationships within the rhizobium group.
our ortholog, 16s rrna gene and average nucleotide identity values  analysis all demonstrate semia <dig> is not rhizobium leguminosarum bv.
we previously used biochemical tests and phenotypic taxonomic methods to identify bacteria, which can lead to erroneous classification.
in this study, we sequenced the complete genome of semia <dig> and compared it with five other mesorhizobium and two rhizobium genomes.
we identified semia <dig> as a mesorhizobium by comparing the 16s rrna gene and the complete genome.
