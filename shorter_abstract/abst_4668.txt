protein-protein docking for proteins with large conformational changes was analyzed by using interaction fingerprints, one of the scales for measuring similarities among complex structures, utilized especially for searching near-native protein-ligand or protein-protein complex structures.
here, we have proposed a combined method for analyzing protein-protein docking by taking large conformational changes into consideration.
for each ligand,  <dig> cam-ligand complexes were generated in the docking step and the relationship between their energy profiles and structural similarities to the native complex were analyzed using interaction fingerprint and rmsd.
this combined method consists of ensemble soft docking with multiple protein structures, refinement of complexes, and cluster analysis using interaction fingerprints and energy profiles.
near-native clusters were obtained in the case of cng and camkk.
to test for the applicability of this combined method, various cam-ligand complexes were reconstructed from the nmr structures of unbound cam.
the interaction fingerprint method discriminated near-native structures better than the rmsd method in cluster analysis.
