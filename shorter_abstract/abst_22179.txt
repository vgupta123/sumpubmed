to test whether such endogenous sirnas are present in t. brucei and to probe the individual role of the two dicer-like enzymes, we affinity purified tbago <dig> from wild-type procyclic trypanosomes, as well as from cells deficient in the cytoplasmic  or nuclear  dicer, and subjected the bound rnas to illumina high-throughput sequencing.
production of these newly described sirnas is strictly dependent on the nuclear dcl <dig>  notably, our data indicate that putative centromeric regions, excluding the cir <dig> repeats, are not a significant source for endogenous sirnas.
in wild-type cells the majority of reads originated from two classes of retroposons.
