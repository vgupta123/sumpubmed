cn was evaluated in  <dig> and in  <dig> at rayong province, and in  <dig> at lop buri province, thailand.
cn08r1from  <dig> at rayong, cn09r1and cn09r <dig> from  <dig> at rayong, and cn09l <dig> and cn09l <dig> from  <dig> at lop buri were mapped on linkage group  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.
among all the identified qtl, cn09r <dig> was the most significantly associated with the cn trait with lod score  <dig>  and explained the greatest percentage of phenotypic variation  of 26%.
qtl analysis affecting cn was performed with  <dig> ssr markers.
the linkage map consisted of  <dig> ssr markers, on  <dig> linkage groups with a map that encompassed  <dig>  cm.
that ability was called the cyanogenic potential .
the phenotypic values showed continuous variation with transgressive segregation events with more  and less cn  than either parent .
this project aimed to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with the cn in an outbred population derived from 'hanatee' Ã— 'huay bong 60', two contrasting cultivars.
