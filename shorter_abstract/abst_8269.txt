angiostrongylus vasorum infection was diagnosed in two stoats and one weasel: in stoats infections were patent and the lung lesions were likely of clinical significance.
pleuritis and pyothorax was seen in two polecats, in one case due to a migrating grass awn.
cases showing numerous granulomata but few or no adiaspores were ziehl-neelsen-stain negative for acid-fast bacilli and ihc negative for mycobacterium spp.
adiaspore diameter in all three species was similar ; these are markedly smaller than that normally recorded for e. crescens.
histological examination of lungs showed granulomata in stoats , weasels  and polecats .
these are believed to be the first records of a. vasorum in small mustelids.
little is known about the health status of these species nationally.
stoats, weasels and polecats in south-west england share several respiratory diseases, often of high prevalence, but the pathology would appear insufficient to impact on the health status of the populations and other ultimate causes of death should be investigated when examining these species.
however, in some cases pcr analyses revealed mycobacteria, including mycobacterium kumamotonense and mycobacterium avium complex.
trauma caused by road traffic, predator attack or being trapped was the predominant cause of death in  <dig> stoats,  <dig> weasels and  <dig> polecats; most were in good physical condition.
stoat  and weasel  populations in south-west england are declining whilst polecats , absent for over a century, are increasing.
this study aimed at investigating respiratory disease in specimens found dead in south-west england.
skrjabingylus nasicola was present in all species  and infected animals showed no evidence of loss of body condition.
