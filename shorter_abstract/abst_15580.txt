diversity presented an increase along with animal body mass following a power law with a slope z of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , whatever the age, phylogeny, diet or digestive tract structure.
the results presented here suggest that gut volume cannot be neglected as a major driver of gut microbial diversity.
the characteristics of the gut microbiota follow general principles of biogeography that arise in many ecological systems.
this study explicitly challenges the underexplored relationship connecting gut volume and bacterial diversity.
the bacterial diversity of  <dig> faeces produced by  <dig> vertebrate species covering a body mass range of  <dig>  log.
the diversity was evaluated based on the simpson diversity index extracted from 16s rdna gene fingerprinting patterns.
