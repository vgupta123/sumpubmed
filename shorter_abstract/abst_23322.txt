pathway enrichment and expression patterns were used to characterize differentially expression genes.
for example, cad gene expression levels, encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, were only  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in le apricot compared with jg cultivar at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  49 days after full bloom .
however, the ‘liehe’  apricot cultivar has a thin, soft, cleavable endocarp that represents  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the thickness and lignin content, respectively, of the ‘jinxihong’  apricot .
the degs encoding key enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were significantly down-regulated in le apricot.
transcription factors such as nst <dig> may regulate genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway and affect development and lignification of the endocarp.
furthermore, transcription factors regulating secondary wall and lignin biosynthesis were identified.
especially for secondary wall thickening promoting factor  <dig> , its expression levels in le apricot were merely  <dig> % and  <dig> % compared with jg cultivar at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb, respectively.
this new apricot genomic resource and the candidate genes provide a useful reference for further investigating the lignification during development of apricot endocarp.

a complete and hardened endocarp is a typical trait of drupe fruits.
