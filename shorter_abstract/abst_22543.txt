we also show that the linc complex proteins known to serve a tethering function in the nuclear envelope are excluded from endoplasmic reticulum stacks.
finally, using cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections methodology that preserves cellular architecture in a hydrated, native-like state, we show that the sheet stacks are highly regular and may contain ordered arrays of macromolecular complexes.
our results provide evidence in favour of the hypothesis of endoplasmic reticulum sheet stabilization by intermembrane tethering.
tubules and sheets of endoplasmic reticulum perform different functions and undergo inter-conversion during different stages of the cell cycle.
some of these complexes decorate the cytosolic surface of the membranes, whereas others appear to span the width of the cytosolic or luminal space between the stacked sheets.
