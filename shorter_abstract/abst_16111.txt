the latter species is known to be infected with wolbachia -inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility in its host- but the presence of other endosymbionts has not been demonstrated.
besides wolbachia, a co-infection of  <dig> rickettsia species was detected in all m. pygmaeus populations.
both m. caliginosus and m. pygmaeus are commercially available for the augmentative biological control of arthropod pests in european greenhouses.
in the present study, the microbial diversity was examined in various populations of m. caliginosus and m. pygmaeus by 16s rrna sequencing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
all m. caliginosus populations were infected with the same wolbachia and limoniae-like rickettsia strain as m. pygmaeus, but did not harbour the bellii-like rickettsia strain.
a pcr assay on the ovaries of m. pygmaeus and m. caliginosus indicated that all endosymbionts are vertically transmitted.
independent of the origin, all tested populations of both m. pygmaeus and m. caliginosus were infected with three and two endosymbionts, respectively.
there was no indication that infection with endosymbiotic bacteria had a fitness cost in terms of development and fecundity of the predators.
the predatory mirids of the genus macrolophus are key natural enemies of various economically important agricultural pests.
a bio-assay comparing an infected and an uninfected m. pygmaeus population suggested that the endosymbionts had minor effects on nymphal development of their insect host and did not influence its fecundity.
the presence of wolbachia and rickettsia in oocytes was confirmed by a fluorescence in situ hybridisation.
based on a concatenated alignment of the 16s rrna gene, the glta gene and the coxa gene, the first is phylogenetically related to rickettsia bellii, whereas the other is closely related to rickettsia limoniae.
