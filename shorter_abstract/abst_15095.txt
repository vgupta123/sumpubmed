these results together suggest that the salmonid myostatin gene family is a novel resource for investigating mechanisms that regulate duplicate gene fate as paralog specific differences in gene expression, transcript processing and protein structure are all suggestive of active divergence.
for example, the specific indels within the onchorhynchus tshawytscha and o. nerka genes were remarkably similar and differed equally from other mstn2b orthologs.
furthermore, mstn <dig> introns all lacked conserved splice site motifs, suggesting that the tissue-specific processing of mstn2a transcripts, but not those of mstn2b, is due to alternative cis regulation and is likely a common feature in salmonids.
gene organization and sequence conservation was particularly evident among paralog groupings and within salmonid subfamilies.
it also suggests that limited transcript processing may have contributed to mstn2b nonfunctionalization.
previous studies revealed divergence within gene promoters while the current studies provide evidence for relaxed or positive selection in some coding sequence lineages.
a phylogenetic analysis weakly established a mstn2b clade including only these species, which coupled with a shared  <dig> base pair deletion might suggest a history involving hybridization or a shared phylogenetic history.
