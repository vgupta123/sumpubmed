extensive trpc <dig> transcript alternative splicing was observed, with exons  <dig>   <dig> and 5- <dig> frequently omitted, leading to variants containing premature termination codons.
however it was notable that control of the variants by nmd was prominent in human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells but not human vascular smooth muscle cells.
the data suggest:  extensive nmd-sensitive transcripts of trpc1;  inefficient clearance of aberrant transcripts and enhanced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in part because of low upf <dig> expression.
consistent with the predicted sensitivity of such variants to nonsense-mediated decay  the variants were increased by cycloheximide.
