sequential feeding strategy was applied using xylose as the growth substrate and octanoic acid as the precursor for mcl-pha production.
a yield of  <dig>  g mcl-pha per g octanoic acid was achieved under the employed conditions.
the genes encoding xylose isomerase  and xylulokinase  from escherichia coli w <dig> were introduced into p. putida kt <dig>  the recombinant kt <dig> exhibited a xyla activity of  <dig>  u and a xylb activity of  <dig>  u when grown on a defined medium supplemented with xylose.
to reduce the substrate cost, which represents nearly 50% of the total pha production cost, xylose, a hemicellulose derivate, was tested as the growth carbon source in an engineered p. putida kt <dig> strain.
this study is the first reported attempt to produce mcl-pha by using xylose as the growth substrate.
the cells reached a maximum specific growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> and a final cell dry weight  of  <dig>  g l- <dig> with a maximal yield of  <dig>  g cdw g- <dig> xylose.
since no mcl-pha was accumulated from xylose, mcl-pha production can be controlled by the addition of fatty acids leading to tailor-made pha compositions.
sequential feeding of relatively cheap carbohydrates and expensive fatty acids is a practical way to achieve more cost-effective mcl-pha production.
pseudomonas putida kt <dig> is able to synthesize large amounts of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates .
these scientific exercises will undoubtedly contribute to the economic feasibility of mcl-pha production from renewable feedstock.
