we characterized mirna during different developmental stages and in juvenile tissues using next generation sequencing.
our results suggest that a further rise in seas temperature might affect life history of atlantic cod.
we have asked whether the temperature and its shift during the early ontogeny  affect the mirna repertoire of atlantic cod , and if thermal experience has long-term consequences in the mirna profile.

long-term effect of embryonic incubation temperature was revealed on expression of some mirnas in juvenile pituitary , gonad , and liver , but not in brain.
understanding the molecular mechanisms of temperature acclimation and adaptation of marine organisms is of the uttermost importance for ecology, fisheries, and aquaculture, as it allows modeling the effects of global warming on population dynamics.
temperature elevation by several degrees during embryonic and larval developmental stages significantly alters the mirna profile, both short-term and long-term.
the effect of temperature on methylation status of selected mirna promoter regions was mostly inconclusive.
we identified  <dig> putative mirna precursor loci,  <dig> novel precursor mirnas, and  <dig> mature mirnas.
environmental temperature has serious implications in life cycle of aquatic ectotherms.
some mirnas showed stage- or tissue-enriched expression and mirnas, such as the mir-17 ~  <dig> cluster, myomirs , neuromirs , mir-130b, and mir- <dig> showed differential expression in different temperature regimes.
