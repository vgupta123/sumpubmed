complete mitochondrial genome of laevipilina antarctica
although recent studies have greatly advanced understanding of deep molluscan phylogeny, placement of some taxa remains uncertain as different datasets support competing class-relationships.
under both serialian or aculiferan-conchiferan scenarios, the observed gene cluster inversion appears to be a convergent evolution of gene arrangements in molluscs.
our reanalyses of recently published polyplacophoran mitogenomes show, however, that this feature is also present in some chiton species.
although we could not shed light on deep evolutionary traits of mollusca we found unique patterns of gene arrangements that are common to monoplacophoran and chitonine polyplacophoran species but not to acanthochitonine polyplacophora.
our phylogenetic results are inconclusive and sensitive to taxon sampling.
traditionally, morphologists have placed monoplacophora, a group of morphologically simple, limpet-like molluscs as sister group to all other conchiferans , a grouping that is supported by the latest large-scale phylogenomic study that includes laevipilina.
however, molecular datasets dominated by nuclear ribosomal genes support monoplacophora + polyplacophora .
