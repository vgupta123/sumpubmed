exon junctions in coding regions were less prone to splicing errors than those in non-coding regions, indicating purifying selection on splice donor and acceptor efficiency.
here we use long-read sequencing technology combined with unique molecular identifiers  to reveal patterns of alternative full-length isoform expression in single cells from the mouse brain.
we found a surprising amount of isoform diversity, even after applying a conservative definition of what constitutes an isoform.
our findings indicate that mrna isoform diversity is an important source of biological variability also in single cells.
alternative mrna isoform usage is an important source of protein diversity in mammalian cells.
