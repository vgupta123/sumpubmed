in this study,  <dig> completed genomes were examined for the genes involved in the synthesis and detection of ai- <dig>  except for some symbionts and parasites, all organisms have a pathway to recycle sah, either using a two-step enzymatic conversion by the pfs and luxs enzymes or a one-step conversion using sah-hydrolase .
the genomic analysis indicates that the luxs enzyme required for ai- <dig> synthesis is widespread in bacteria, while the periplasmic binding protein luxp is only present in vibrio strains.
in all  <dig> organisms, only the three vibrio strains had strong, bidirectional matches to the periplasmic ai- <dig> binding protein luxp and the central signal relay protein luxu.
<dig> organisms including most gamma-, beta-, and epsilonproteobacteria, and firmicutes possess the pfs-luxs pathway, while archaea, eukarya, alphaproteobacteria, actinobacteria and cyanobacteria prefer the sahh pathway.
thus, other organisms may either use components different from the ai- <dig> signal transduction system of vibrio strains to sense the signal of ai- <dig>  or they do not have such a quorum sensing system at all.
recently, it has been proposed that autoinducer- <dig> , a furanosyl borate diester derived from the recycling of s-adenosyl-homocysteine  to homocysteine, serves as a universal signal for interspecies communication.
