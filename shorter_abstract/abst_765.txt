in the so-called loop model, the icl <dig> region that is missing in available crystal structures was modeled as an unstructured loop of 32-residues length, whereas in the clipped model, the two open ends were covalently bonded to each other.
after around 600 ns, the loop model started a transition to a “very inactive” conformation, which is characterized by a further movement of the intracellular half of transmembrane helix  <dig>  towards the receptor core, and a close packing of icl <dig> underneath the membrane completely blocking the g-protein’s binding site.
the essential dynamics analysis indicated a strong coupling between the extracellular and intracellular parts of the intact receptor, implicating a functional relevance for allosteric regulation.
to understand the effect of the long intracellular loop  <dig>  on the intrinsic dynamics of human β2-adrenergic receptor, molecular dynamics  simulations were performed on two different models, both of which were based on the inactive crystal structure in complex with carazolol .
in contrast, no such transition to the “very inactive” state, nor any structural correlation, was observed in the clipped model without icl <dig>  furthermore, elastic network analysis using different conformers for the loop model indicated a consistent picture on the specific icl <dig> conformational change being driven by global modes.
concurrently, the binding site at the extracellular part of the receptor expanded slightly with the ser207-asp <dig> distance increasing to 18 Å from 11 Å, which was further elaborated by docking studies.
