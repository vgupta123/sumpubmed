while general web search engines and specialized information retrieval  systems have made important strides in recent decades, the problem of accurate knowledge extraction from the biomedical literature is far from solved.
in this work we propose a novel methodology for qa based on semantic relations extracted from the biomedical literature.
we conducted an extensive evaluation of the proposed methodology in order to estimate the accuracy of extracting a particular semantic relation from a particular sentence.
we extracted semantic relations with the semrep natural language processing system from  <dig> , <dig> sentences, which came from  <dig> , <dig> medline citations .
a typical question is answered within a few seconds.
the tool has some extensions that make it especially useful for interpretation of dna microarray results.
this tedious and time-consuming work can be lessened with automatic question answering  systems, which aim to provide users with direct and precise answers to their questions.
the system is implemented as a web-based application that is able to provide precise answers to a wide range of questions.
in this work we propose an innovative methodology for biomedical qa.
