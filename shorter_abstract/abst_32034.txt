in the leaf, transcripts related to biotic stress signalling and secondary metabolism were activated.
the sub-localization, transcriptional network, and physiological regulation demonstrate the tissue-specific manner of cd response, and provide a novel insight into in early response of tree species to cd exposure.
the cd transcriptome results were consistent with observed physiological changes.

the main response in the root involved up-regulation of genes associated with defence response via callose deposition in the cell wall and cell wall thickening.
analysis of the response profiles demonstrate the existence of a complex transcriptional network in the root and leaf when exposed to cd.
transcriptomic analysis in early response to high  cd levels was investigated in leaf and root of cd-resistant s. matsudana koidz..
is a fast growing tree species.
