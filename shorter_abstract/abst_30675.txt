the algorithm was tested on three datasets which include several ncrna families taken from the rfam database.
one of the most important computational problems regarding ncrna is to predict the secondary structure of a molecule from its sequence.
in particular, we attempted to predict the secondary structure for a set of unaligned ncrna molecules that are taken from the same family, and thus presumably have a similar structure.
we developed the rnaspa program, which comparatively predicts the secondary structure for a set of ncrna molecules in linear time in the number of molecules.
we also show that rna secondary structures can be compared very rapidly by a simple string edit-distance algorithm with a minimal loss of accuracy.
in recent years, rna molecules that are not translated into proteins  have drawn a great deal of attention, as they were shown to be involved in many cellular functions.
the shortest path in this graph is the basis for structural predictions for the molecule.
the suboptimal solutions of each molecule are represented as a layer of vertices in a graph.
we observed that in a list of several hundred suboptimal minimal free energy  predictions, as provided by the rnasubopt program of the vienna package, it is likely that at least one suggested structure would be similar to the true, correct one.
