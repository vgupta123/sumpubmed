both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of a classifier could be enhanced by performing the classification based only on selected discriminative genes.
microarray technology, as well as other functional genomics experiments, allow simultaneous measurements of thousands of genes within each sample.
this method results in a novel measure, called proportional overlapping score , of a feature’s relevance to a classification task.
the experimental results of classification error rates computed using the random forest, k nearest neighbor and support vector machine classifiers show that pos achieves a better performance.
we propose a statistical method for selecting genes based on overlapping analysis of expression data across classes.
we apply pos, along‐with four widely used gene selection methods, to several benchmark gene expression datasets.
it robustly defines a mask for each gene that allows it to minimize the effect of expression outliers.
