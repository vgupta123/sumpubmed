the molecular recognition based on the complementary base pairing of deoxyribonucleic acid  is the fundamental principle in the fields of genetics, dna nanotechnology and dna computing.
we developed a new software tool called egnas for the design of unique nucleic acid sequences.
the presented exhaustive algorithm allows to generate greater sets of sequences than with previous software and equal constraints.
self-complementarity and hairpin structures of certain length can be avoided.
the design of sequences for specific attachment of molecular constructs to dna origami is presented.

we present an exhaustive dna sequence design algorithm that allows to generate sets containing a maximum number of sequences with defined properties.
egnas  offers the possibility of controlling both interstrand and intrastrand properties.
tag sequences can be generated and combined with primers for single-base extension reactions, which were described for multiplexed genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
this option reduces the risk of “fraying” of dna strands.
the guanine-cytosine content can be adjusted.
the algorithm is realized in a c++ program.
