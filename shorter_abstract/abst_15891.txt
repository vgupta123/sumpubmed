thus, we hypothesized that benefits of pharmacological zn supplementation result from changes in gene expression that could be further affected by supplemental phytase.
in addition, interrogation of a  <dig>  element oligonucleotide microarray revealed  <dig> annotated transcripts  affected by pharmacological zn supplementation.
seven transcripts exhibiting differential expression in pigs fed pharmacological zn with sequence similarities to genes encoding glo <dig>  prdx <dig>  acy <dig>  orm <dig>  cpb <dig>  gstm <dig>  and hsp <dig>  were selected for confirmation.
results suggest that feeding pharmacological zn  affects genes involved in reducing oxidative stress and in amino acid metabolism, which are essential for cell detoxification and proper cell function.
zn supplementation has been used to treat diarrheal disease in children, and in the u.s. swine industry at pharmacological levels to promote growth and fecal consistency, but underlying mechanisms explaining these beneficial effects remain unknown.
moreover, adding supplemental phytase improves zn bioavailability.
however, zn bioavailability from commonly consumed plants may be reduced due to phytic acid.
expressed sequence tags for  <dig> putatively differentially expressed transcripts were cloned and sequenced.
the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of feeding newly weaned pigs dietary zn  as zn oxide with or without phytase  for  <dig> d on hepatic gene expression.
