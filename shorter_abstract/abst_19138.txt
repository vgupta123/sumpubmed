we hypothesized that p <dig> contributed to pc <dig> differentiation through the regulation of gene targets distinct from its known transcriptional targets for apoptosis or dna repair.
using a genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning technique, we identified and validated  <dig> novel p53-regulated genes following ngf treatment.
within the pc <dig> neuronal context, putative p53-occupied genomic loci spanned the entire rattus norvegicus genome upon ngf treatment.
furthermore, we describe stimulus-specific regulation of a subset of these target genes by p <dig>  the most salient differentiation-relevant target genes included wnt7b involved in dendritic extension and the tfcp2l4/grhl <dig> grainyhead homolog implicated in ectodermal development.
we studied the transcriptional role of p <dig> during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation of the pc <dig> line into neuron-like cells.
p <dig> is recognized as a critical regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis.
the data show p <dig> protein was transcriptionally activated and contributed to ngf-mediated neurite outgrowth during differentiation of pc <dig> cells.
