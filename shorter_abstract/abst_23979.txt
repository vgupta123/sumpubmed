galaxy not only provides a user friendly interface allowing the interested biologist to manipulate obo ontologies, it also opens up the possibility to perform further biological  analyses by using other tools available within the galaxy environment.
obof, rdf and owl are among the most used ontology formats to capture terms and relationships in the life sciences, opening the potential to use the semantic web to support data integration and further exploitation of integrated resources via automated retrieval and reasoning procedures.
the biosciences increasingly face the challenge of integrating a wide variety of available data, information and knowledge in order to gain an understanding of biological systems.
the resulting onto-toolkit supports the analysis and handling of obo-formatted ontologies via the galaxy interface, and we demonstrated its functionality in different use cases that illustrate the flexibility to obtain sets of ontology terms that match specific search criteria.

moreover, it provides tools to translate obo-formatted ontologies into semantic web formats such as rdf and owl.
we extended the perl suite onto-perl and functionally integrated it into the galaxy platform.
