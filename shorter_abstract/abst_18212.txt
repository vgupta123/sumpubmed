these were demonstrated by applying the mmv technology to searching lysozyme-crystallizing conditions and selecting peptides aimed for aβ-binding or cathepsin e-inhibition.
however, as it depends basically on the surface reaction, it is hard to perform bulk reactions and sequential multistep reactions.
on the other hand, the popular microplate technology, which has a great merit of being able to perform parallel multistep reactions, has come to its limit in increasing the number of wells  and reducing the volume to deal with due to the difficulty in operations.
by developing the mmv plate, accompanying devices and techniques, generation of multiple conditions  and performance of parallel multistep reactions, including pcr and in vitro translation reactions, have been made possible.
with the introduction of a novel concept microarray  technology, parallel and multistep reactions in sub-μl scale have become possible.
