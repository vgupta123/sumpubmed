we compared the excitatory frequency-level receptive fields  of neurons in the rat primary auditory cortex determined under both quiet and preceding noise conditions.
in a natural environment, contextual noise frequently occurs with a signal sound for detection or discrimination in a temporal relation.
therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the impact of contextual noise on the cortical tuning to signal sound frequency in order to better understand the mechanism of cortical frequency coding in a complex acoustical environment.
the results indicate that the cortical representation of sound frequency is dynamically modulated by contextual acoustical environment, and that there are cortical neurons whose characteristic frequencies were resistant to the interference of contextual noise.
if the preceding noise level was constant, the modulation decreased when the interstimulus interval was increased.
however, the representation of sound frequency by auditory cortical neurons in a noisy environment is not fully understood.
when the interstimulus interval between noise and the probe tone was constant, the modulation of the flrf increased as the level of noise was increased.
based on the changes of minimum threshold and the extent of flrf of auditory cortical neurons, we found that the flrfs of a cortical neuron were modulated dynamically by a varying preceding noise.
