of the  <dig> clones obtained after pcr amplification,  <dig> corresponded to cns samples  and the remaining to mammary gland, blood cells, bronchoalveolar lavage cells and/or lung.
bayesian approach inferences suggested that proviruses from broncoalveolar lavage cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells represented the common ancestors  in the animal and that neuroinvasion in the outbreak involved microevolution after initial infection with an a-type strain.
outbreak sequences were of genotype a, clustering per animal and compartmentalizing in the animal tissues.
this study demonstrates virus compartmentalization in the cns and other body tissues in sheep presenting the neurological form of srlv infection.
a central nervous system  disease outbreak caused by small ruminant lentiviruses  has triggered interest in spain due to the rapid onset of clinical signs and relevant production losses.
the diversity of the env sequences from cns was  <dig> - <dig> % between animals and  <dig> - <dig> % within each animal, except in one animal presenting two sequence types  in the cns , indicative of cns virus sequence heterogeneity.
