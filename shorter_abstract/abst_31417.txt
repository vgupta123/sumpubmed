through screening of a Î» genomic library and pcr amplification, we recovered  <dig> u <dig> snorna gene variants, defined by sequence heterogeneities that are mostly located in the u <dig> 3'-stem-loop domain.
the multiple u <dig> snorna-u <dig> snrna gene linkages, which cluster into distinct families based on sequence similarities within the intergenic spacer, presumably arose by genome, chromosome, and/or locus duplications.
variability in the signal intensities of the multiple southern hybridization bands raises the possibility that euglena contains a naturally aneuploid chromosome complement.
in the euglenozoon euglena gracilis, a distant relative of the kinetoplastid protozoa, southern analysis had previously revealed at least  <dig> bands hybridizing with u <dig> snorna, suggesting the existence of multiple copies of u <dig> snorna genes.
in arrangement ii), the u <dig> snorna gene is positioned upstream of two identical trnaarg genes that are convergently transcribed relative to the u <dig> gene.
we identified three different genomic arrangements of euglena u <dig> snorna genes: i) stand-alone, ii) linked to trnaarg genes, and iii) linked to a u <dig> snrna gene.
we discuss possible reasons for the existence of the unusually large number of u <dig> snorna genes in the euglena genome.
