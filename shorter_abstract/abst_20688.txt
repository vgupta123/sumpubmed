kegg pathway analysis indicated that these genes were involved in  <dig> pathways related to the pro-inflammatory response and apr, but also identified significant representation of two unexpected pathways: natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway  and the rig-i-like receptor signalling pathway .
in order to develop new strategies to prevent escherichia coli-induced mastitis, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the host immune response to an e. coli infection is necessary.
to this end, we performed a global gene-expression analysis of mammary gland tissue collected from dairy cows that had been exposed to a controlled e. coli infection.
up to 25% of the de immune response genes common to the three e. coli mastitis studies at t =  <dig> h were independent of e. coli strain and dose, cow lactation stage and number, tissue collection method and gene analysis method used.
bovine mastitis is one of the most costly and prevalent diseases affecting dairy cows worldwide.
up-regulated transcripts  were largely associated with immune response functions, while the down-regulated transcripts  were principally involved in fat metabolism.
comparison of t =  <dig> h de genes detected in the three e. coli mastitis studies revealed  <dig> were common and mainly involved immune response functions.
in e. coli-induced mastitis, infected mammary gland tissue was found to significantly up-regulate expression of genes related to the immune response and down-regulate genes related to fat metabolism.
to represent the acute phase response  and chronic stage, respectively.
hence, these de genes likely represent important mediators of the local apr against e. coli in the mammary gland.
differentially expressed  genes for each stage were analyzed and the de genes detected at t =  <dig> h were also compared to data collected from two previous e. coli mastitis studies that were carried out on post mortem tissue.
