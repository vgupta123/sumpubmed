it should be valuable in phylogenetic studies of large protein families.
based on species tree information and hugo gene names, it summarizes "monophyla".
our automatic simplification tool for gene trees is fast, accurate, and effective.
it yields results of similar quality as manual simplification.
comparing the simplified tree to a "cartoon tree" created manually, we note that both agree to a high degree.
in the genomic age, gene trees may contain large amounts of data making them hard to read and understand.
we present a simplification tool for gene trees called treesimplifier.
these monophyla correspond to subtrees of the gene tree where the evolution of a gene follows species phylogeny, and they are simplified to single leaves in the gene tree.
such a simplification may fail, for example, due to genes in the gene tree that are misplaced.
