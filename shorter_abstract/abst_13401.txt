treatment of quiescent hiec with serum induced erk1/ <dig> activation, e2f <dig> phosphorylation, e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition while inhibition of mek/erk signaling by u <dig> prevented these events.
e2f <dig> localization in normal human intestinal epithelial cells  is cell cycle-dependent, being cytoplasmic in quiescent differentiated cells but nuclear in proliferative cells.
the present results indicate that mek/erk activation and gsk <dig> inhibition are both required for e2f <dig> phosphorylation as well as its nuclear translocation and s phase entry in hiec.
stimulation of hiec with epidermal growth factor  also led to the activation of erk1/ <dig> but, in contrast to serum or lysophosphatidic acid , egf failed to induce e2f <dig> phosphorylation, e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition.
importantly, e2f <dig> phosphorylation, e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition were all observed in response to egf when gsk <dig> activity was concomitantly inhibited by sb <dig>  finally, e2f <dig> was found to be overexpressed, phosphorylated and nuclear localized in epithelial cells from human colorectal adenomas exhibiting mutations in apc and kras or braf genes, known to deregulate gsk3/Î²-catenin and mek/erk signaling, respectively.
this finding suggests that dysregulated e2f <dig> nuclear localization may be an instigating event leading to hyperproliferation and hence, of tumor initiation and promotion in the colon and rectum.
the transcription factor e2f <dig> controls proliferation of normal and cancerous intestinal epithelial cells.
