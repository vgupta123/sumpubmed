we present a theoretical model for retinocollicular map development, which can account for intriguing behaviors observed in gain-of-function experiments by brown et al., including bifurcation in heterozygous isl2/epha <dig> knock-ins.
in our model the map undergoes a series of reconstructions with probabilities dependent upon a set of chemical cues.
we study the map formation using stochastic model based on markov chains.
first, the inhomogeneous gradient of endogenous receptor in retina makes the impact of exogenous receptor less significant in temporal retina.
we examine results of gain-of-function experiments on retinocollicular maps in knock-in mice .
the model is based on known chemical labels, axonal repulsion/competition, and stochasticity.
possible mapping in isl2/ephb knock-ins is also discussed.
the established map is single-valued, which implies that each point in retina maps to a unique termination zone in superior colliculus.
in homozygous isl2/epha <dig> knock-in mice the map is double-valued, which means that each point on retina maps to two termination zones in superior colliculus.
in wild-type mice the temporal-nasal axis of retina is mapped to the rostral-caudal axis of superior colliculus.
second, the gradient of ephrin in the corresponding region of superior colliculus is smaller, which reduces the chemical signal-to-noise ratio.
we predict that if gradient of ephrin is reduced by a genetic manipulation, the single-valued region of the map should extend to a larger portion of temporal retina, i.e.
