gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database analysis suggest that target genes are related with biological processes associated to the regulation of dna-dependent transcription, signal transduction and multicellular organismal development as well as with the enrichment of pathways involved in cancer, focal adhesion, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis and mapk and wnt signaling pathways, respectively.
all this considered, these observations suggest that individual mirnas could act as potential mediators of the epigenetic switch linking transcriptomic dynamics and cell phenotypes mediated by tia proteins.
some up-regulated and unchanged mirnas were validated and previous results confirmed by reverse transcription and real time pcr.
go and kegg database analyses showed that the enrichment categories of biological processes and cellular pathways were related with innate immune response, signal transduction, response to interleukin- <dig>  glomerular basement membrane development as well as neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, endocytosis, lysosomes and apoptosis, respectively.
by target prediction of the mirnas and combined analysis of the genome-wide expression profiles identified in tia-depleted hela cells, we detected connections between up-regulated mirnas and potential target genes.
when the collection of experimentally defined differentially expressed genes in tia-depleted hela cells was intersected with potential target genes only  <dig> out of  <dig>  up- and  <dig> out of  <dig>  down-regulated genes were shared.
herein we identified a microrna signature associated to transiently tia-depleted hela cells and analyzed the potential role of mirnas combining genome-wide analysis data on mrna and mirna profiles.
using high-throughput mirna expression profiling, transient depletion of tia-proteins in hela cells was observed to promote significant and reproducible changes affecting to a pool of up-regulated mirnas involving mir-30b-3p, mir125a-3p, mir-193a-5p, mir-197-3p, mir-203a, mir- <dig>  mir-371-5p, mir-373-5p, mir-483-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-503-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-615-3p, mir- <dig>  mir-625-5p, mir-629-5p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-663a, mir-671-5p, mir-769-3p and mir-744-5p.
