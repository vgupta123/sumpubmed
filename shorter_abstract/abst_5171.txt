by combining in silico analysis with drna-seq data of a. aeolicus we predict nearly  <dig> novel ncrna candidates.
we present several classical ncrnas and riboswitch candidates.
in this work, we compare the available genomes, extend their protein annotation, identify regulatory sequences, annotate non-coding rnas  of known function, predict novel ncrna candidates, show idiosyncrasies of the genetic decoding machinery, present two different types of transfer-messenger rnas and variations of the crispr systems.
furthermore, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the aquificales based on entire genome sequences, and extended this by a classification among all bacteria using 16s rrna sequences and a set of orthologous proteins.
we have here re-analyzed the aquificales, a group of bacteria thriving in extreme environments, sharing the feature of a small, compact genome with a reduced number of protein and ncrna genes.
combining several in silico features  with an in vivo drna-seq transcriptome analysis of aquifex aeolicus, we predict roughly  <dig> novel ncrna candidates in this bacterium.
