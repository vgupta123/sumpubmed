the cabbage beetle, colaphellus bowringi, is a serious insect pest of cruciferous vegetables in china and other asian countries.
we assembled the antennal transcriptome of c. bowringi by using illumina sequencing technology and identified  <dig> candidate chemosensory genes by analyzing transcriptomic data, which included transcripts encoding  <dig> odorant-binding proteins ,  <dig> chemosensory proteins , four sensory neuron membrane proteins ,  <dig> odorant receptors , nine ionotropic receptors , and ten gustatory receptors .
these candidate chemosensory genes and their expression profiles in various tissues provide further information on understanding their function in c. bowringi as well as other insects, and identifying potential targets to disrupt the odorant system in c. bowringi so that new methods for pest management can be developed.
the data obtained are similar to those found in other coleopteran species, suggesting that our approach successfully identified the chemosensory genes of c. bowringi.
our study revealed that a large number of chemosensory genes are expressed in c. bowringi.

since chemosensory genes play key roles in insect behaviour, they can potentially be used as new targets for pest control.
however, a systematic identification of the chemosensory genes expressed in the antennae has not been reported.
