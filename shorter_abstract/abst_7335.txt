we found that despite pregnancy-associated expression levels of wnt <dig>  mammary glands did not display the side-branching typical of early pregnancy.
taken together, we propose that wnt <dig> is necessary, but not sufficient, to induce side-branch development.
indeed, using qpcr-based array analyses, we found that a specific transcriptional target of wnt <dig>  namely wnt <dig>  was induced in wnt4-expressing transgenic glands, to levels equivalent to that of early pregnant glands.
though ectopic wnt <dig> signaling is known to be mitogenic and oncogenic, no endogenously expressed wnt ligands have ever been directly implicated in mammary growth and morphogenesis.
