we therefore undertook an extensive survey of this family to find members with the intron and to learn more about the evolutionary history of this exceptionally mobile genetic element.
this is consistent with previous evidence that horizontal transfer in plants is biased towards phylogenetically local events.
despite strong overall incongruence of cox <dig> intron phylogeny with angiosperm phylogeny, two of these clades possess nearly identical intron sequences and are monophyletic in intron phylogeny.
these two clades, and possibly the third also, contain a co-conversion tract  downstream of the intron that is extended relative to all previously recognized ccts in angiosperm cox <dig>  re-examination of all published cox <dig> genes uncovered additional cases of extended co-conversion and identified a rare case of putative intron loss, accompanied by full retention of the cct.
our findings provide further support for the rampant-transfer model of cox <dig> intron evolution and recommend the solanaceae as a model system for the experimental analysis of cox <dig> intron transfer in plants.
the most frequent case of horizontal transfer in plants involves a group i intron in the mitochondrial gene cox <dig>  which has been acquired via some  <dig> separate plant-to-plant transfer events among  <dig> diverse angiosperms examined.
the discovery of extended co-conversion suggests that other cox <dig> conversions may be longer than realized but obscured by the exceptional conservation of plant mitochondrial sequences.
