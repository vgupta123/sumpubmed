despite the indispensable need of thorough domain knowledge in ontology construction, most software tools for ontology construction are designed for knowledge engineers and not for domain experts to use.
the differences in the opinions of different domain experts and in the terminology usages in source literature are rarely addressed by existing software.
being open source software, the application can be modified to fit varied term organization needs for different domains.
the software is open source and built in java.
ontology term organizer  is a user-friendly, web-based, consensus-promoting, open source application for organizing domain terms by dragging and dropping terms to appropriate locations.
specifically oto can be used to establish is_a, part_of, synonym, and order relationships among terms in any domain that reflects the terminology usage in source literature and based on multiple expertsâ€™ opinions.
through iterations of software release and user feedback, new features are added and existing features modified to make the tool more intuitive and efficient to use for small and large data sets.
user feedback indicates that the tool is efficient and user friendly.
the application is designed for users with specific domain knowledge such as biology but not in-depth ontology construction skills.
the organized terms may be fed into formal ontologies to boost their coverage.
