mechanisms of long chain fatty acid uptake across the plasma membrane are important targets in treatment of many human diseases like obesity or hepatic steatosis.
overexpression of fat/cd <dig> and fatp <dig> increased long chain fatty acid uptake.
antibody cross-linking increased drm association of fat/cd <dig> and accelerated the overall fatty acid uptake in a cholesterol dependent manner.
as increased raft association of fat/cd <dig> leads to an increased fatty acid uptake, dynamic association of fat/cd <dig> with lipid rafts might regulate the process.
however, we now can provide further evidence that not only proteins but also lipid microdomains play an important part in the regulation of the facilitated uptake process.
lipid raft integrity was modulated by cholesterol depletion using methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin and sphingolipid depletion using myriocin and sphingomyelinase.
dynamic association of fat/cd <dig> a candidate fatty acid transporter with lipid rafts was analysed by isolation of detergent resistant membranes  and by clustering of lipid rafts with antibodies on living cells.
there is no direct interaction of fatp <dig> with lipid rafts or raft associated fat/cd <dig>  thus, lipid rafts have to be considered as targets for the treatment of lipid disorders.
our observations suggest the existence of two pools of fat/cd <dig> within cellular membranes.
the uptake of long chain fatty acids was cholesterol and sphingolipid dependent.
fat/cd <dig> co-localized with the lipid raft marker plap in antibody-clustered domains at the plasma membrane and segregated away from the non-raft marker gfp-tmd.
another candidate transporter, fatp <dig>  was neither present in drms nor co-localized with fat/cd <dig> at the plasma membrane.
