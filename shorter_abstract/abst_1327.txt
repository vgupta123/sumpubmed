preliminary exploration of the use of joint edge probabilities to rank paths is largely inconclusive.
the edge weights used are the negative log-transformed probabilities of directness derived from the posterior joint distributions of pairwise mutual information between gene expression levels.
one alternative unit of regulatory interactions is a linear path between genes.
this paper explores a strategy to infer linear pathways by converting the path inference problem into a shortest-path problem.
the algorithm is evaluated using simulated expression data and is compared to extraction of shortest paths from networks inferred by two alternative methods, aracne and a minimum spanning tree algorithm.
this produces results that are rich in information and yet so complex that they are often of limited usefulness for researchers.
since criteria for inferring networks generally differs from criteria for inferring paths, indirect and direct inference of paths may achieve different results.
directness is inferred using the data processing inequality.
a method is proposed for achieving this by ranking paths according to the joint probability of directness of each path's edges.
linear paths are more comprehensible than networks and still contain important information.
