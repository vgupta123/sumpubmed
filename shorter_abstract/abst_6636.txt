mitochondrial genomes  of multicellular animals  with bilateral symmetry  are compact and usually carry  <dig> protein-coding genes for subunits of three respiratory complexes and atp synthase.
to shed more light on this phenomenon, a pcr-based screen was conducted to assess fast-evolving mtdnas of apocritan hymenoptera  for genomic rearrangements that might be associated with the modification of mitochondrial gene content.
in campsomeris mtdna, cox2a and cox2b loci are separated by a 3-kb large cluster of several antiparallel overlapping orfs, one of which, qnu, seems to encode a nuclease that may have played a role in cox <dig> fission.
sequencing of segmental inversions, identified in the screen, revealed that the cytochrome oxidase subunit ii gene  of campsomeris   was split into two genes coding for coxiia and coxiib.
however, occasionally reported exceptions to this typical mtdna organization prompted speculation that, as in protists and plants, some bilaterian mitogenomes may continue to lose their canonical genes, or may even acquire new genes.
the coxii-derived complementary polypeptides apparently form a heterodimer, have reduced hydrophobicity compared with the majority of mitogenome-encoded cox subunits, and one of them, coxiib, features increased content of cys residues.
