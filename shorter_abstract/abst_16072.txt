we designed a computational method to detect multi-disease associated co-functional microrna pairs and conducted cross disease analysis on a reconstructed disease-gene-microrna  tripartite network.
the prediction method uses a set of reliable negative samples of disease-microrna association and a pre-computed kernel matrix instead of kernel functions.
we are interested in those multi-disease associated co-functional micrornas that regulate their common dysfunctional target genes cooperatively in the development of multiple diseases.
from this reconstructed dgr tripartite network, multi-disease associated co-functional microrna pairs are detected together with their common dysfunctional target genes and ranked by a novel scoring method.
dysfunctions of these co-functional micrornas can play significant roles in disease development.
we also confirmed that the regulation of the micrornas for the development of cancers is more complex and have more unique properties than those of non-cancer diseases.
the construction of the dgr tripartite network is by the integration of newly predicted disease-microrna associations with those relationships of diseases, micrornas and genes maintained by existing databases.
