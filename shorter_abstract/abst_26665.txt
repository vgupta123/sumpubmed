a perfect example of the utility of this ecotilling platform is its application in searching for new virus-resistant alleles in capsicum genus.
high variability in the coding sequences of the eif4e and eif4e genes was detected using the cdna platform.
to evaluate the functional relevance of this variability,  <dig> possible eif4e/eif4e combinations were tested against potato virus y. the results showed that five new eif4e variants  were related to pvy-resistance responses.
mutations in translation initiation factors 4e, eif4g and eif4g) break the cycle of several rna viruses without affecting the plant life cycle, which makes these genes potential targets to screen for resistant germplasm.
a high level of polymorphism has been identified for initiation factors, showing the high genetic variability present in our collection and its potential use for other traits, such as genes related to biotic or abiotic stresses, quality or production.
the ecotilling technique allows polymorphisms in target genes of natural populations to be quickly analysed or identified and facilitates the screening of genebank collections for desired traits.
ecotilling was optimised in different capsicum species to detect allelic variants of target genes.
moreover, the new eif4e and eif4e alleles are an excellent collection for searching for new resistance against other rna viruses.
this work is the first to use cdna instead of genomic dna in ecotilling.
this approach avoids intronic sequence problems and reduces the number of reactions.
