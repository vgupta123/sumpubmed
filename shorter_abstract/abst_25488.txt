however, evidence of molecular adaptations specific to naked mole rat and myotis lucifugus highlight functionally significant regions in genes that may alter the way in which telomeres are regulated and maintained in these longer-lived species.
species such as naked mole rat, human and certain bat species all exhibit extreme longevity with respect to body size.
although these signatures of selection overall are not significantly correlated with either longevity or body size we do identify positive selection in the microbat species myotis lucifugus in functionally important regions of the telomere maintenance genes dkc <dig> and tert, and in naked mole rat in the dna repair gene brca <dig>
our results show that regardless of the longevity of a species, these proteins have evolved under positive selection thereby removing increased longevity as the single selective force driving this rapid rate of evolution.
placental mammals display a huge range of life history traits, including size, longevity, metabolic rate and germ line generation time.
in general we observe a large number of instances of positive selection acting on telomere genes.
these results demonstrate the multifarious selective pressures acting across the mammal phylogeny driving lineage-specific adaptations of telomere associated genes.
it has long been established that telomeres and telomere maintenance have a clear role in ageing but it has not yet been established whether there is evidence for adaptation in telomere maintenance proteins that could account for increased longevity in these species.
here we carry out a molecular investigation of selective pressure variation, specifically focusing on telomere associated genes across placental mammals.
