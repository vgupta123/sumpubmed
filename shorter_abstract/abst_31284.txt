redefinition of the recognition site and reaction conditions makes this prototype endonuclease a useful tool for dna manipulation; as yet, this enzyme has no practical applications.
finally, we developed and propose a new version of the fidelity index - the fidelity index for partial cleavage .
the reaction conditions  were designed either to minimize  or to enhance star activity .
enzyme family that we propounded previously within type iis restriction endonucleases, containing related thermophilic bifunctional endonucleases-methyltransferases from various thermus sp.
these enzymes show significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities, a rare phenomenon among restriction endonucleases, along with similarities in biochemical properties, molecular size, dna recognition sequences and cleavage sites.
the extension of the fidelity index will be helpful for dna manipulation with enzymes only partially cleaving dna.
the taqii enzyme is a member of the thermus sp.
we used four independent methods, namely, shotgun cloning and sequencing, restriction pattern analysis, digestion of particular custom substrates and genescan analysis, to demonstrate that the recombinant enzyme recognizes only 5'-gaccga-3' sites and cleaves 11/ <dig> nucleotides downstream.
they also feature some characteristics of types i and iii.
the dna recognition sequence of the bifunctional prototype taqii endonuclease-methyltransferase from thermus aquaticus has been redefined as recognizing only 5'-gaccga-3' cognate sites.
