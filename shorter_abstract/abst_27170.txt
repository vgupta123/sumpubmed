transcriptome analysis of rice roots revealed that glutamine induced the expression of at least  <dig> genes involved in metabolism, transport, signal transduction, and stress responses within 30 min.
glutamine also rapidly induced the expression of the dreb1a, iro <dig>  and nac <dig> transcription factor genes, which are involved in the regulation of stress responses.
the rapid induction of transcription factor genes suggests that glutamine may efficiently amplify its signal and interact with the other signal transduction pathways to regulate plant growth and stress responses.
glutamine is a major amino donor for the synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and other nitrogen-containing compounds in all organisms.
thus, glutamine is a functional amino acid that plays important roles in plant nutrition and signal transduction.
in addition to its role as a metabolic fuel, glutamine may also function as a signaling molecule to regulate gene expression in plants.

interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> early glutamine responsive genes encode putative transcription factors, including two lbd37-like genes that are involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism.
in glutamine-treated rice roots, the glutamine contents increased dramatically, whereas levels of glutamate remained relatively constant.
we demonstrated that glutamine could effectively support the growth of rice seedlings.
