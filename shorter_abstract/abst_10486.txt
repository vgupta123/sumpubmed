truncated and full-length hydh <dig> proteins were all able to bind and lyse s. aureus sa <dig> cells as shown by binding assays, zymogram analyses and cfu reduction analysis.
the complete hydh <dig> protein and truncated proteins containing only each catalytic domain were overproduced in e. coli and purified from inclusion bodies by subsequent refolding.
hydh <dig> demonstrated high antibiotic activity against early exponential cells, at 45Â°c and in the absence of divalent cations .
in this context, bacteriophage lytic enzymes such as endolysins and structural peptidoglycan  hydrolases have received considerable attention as possible antimicrobials against gram-positive bacteria.
two putative lytic domains were identified: an n-terminal chap  domain , and a c-terminal lyz <dig>  domain .
the increase in the resistance of this pathogen to antibacterials has made necessary the development of new anti-staphylococcal agents.
the virion-associated pg hydrolase hydh <dig> has lytic activity against s. aureus, which makes it attractive as antimicrobial for food biopreservation and anti-staphylococcal therapy.
s. aureus bacteriophage vb_saus-phiipla <dig>  contains a virion-associated muralytic enzyme  encoded by orf <dig>  which is located in the morphogenetic module.
