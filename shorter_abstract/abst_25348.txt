a set of  <dig> agents  that induce apoptosis was first identified by screening of a chemical library.
intracellular free calcium  is a key element in apoptotic signaling and a number of calcium-dependent apoptosis pathways have been described.
using p <dig>  ap- <dig>  nfat and nf-Îºb reporter cell lines, these bioprobes were verified to induce different patterns of signaling.
our study shows that calcium signaling is generally not an early event during the apoptosis process and suggests that a camkii/ask <dig> signaling mechanism is important for sustained jnk activation and apoptosis by some types of stimuli.
further studies showed that the calmodulin pathway was an important mediator of the apoptotic response.
inhibition of calmodulin kinase ii  resulted in more effective inhibition of apoptosis compared to inhibition of calpain, calcineurin/pp2b or dap kinase.
we here used a chemical biology strategy to elucidate the relative importance of such different pathways.
experiments using the calcium chelator bapta-am showed that ca2+ was involved in induction of apoptosis by the majority of the bioprobes and that ca2+ was in general required several hours into the apoptosis process.
