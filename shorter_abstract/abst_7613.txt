the genome of serotype m <dig> group a streptococcus  strain mgas <dig> contains a novel genetic element named region of difference  <dig>  that encodes seven putative secreted extracellular proteins.
the copy number of the rd <dig> element was rapidly and significantly increased following treatment of strain mgas <dig> with mitomycin c, a dna damaging agent.
using a pcr-based method, we also identified rd2-like regions in multiple group c and g strains of streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp.equisimilis cultured from invasive human infections.
rd2-like regions were identified in publicly available genome sequences of strains representing three of the five major group b streptococcal serotypes causing human disease.
