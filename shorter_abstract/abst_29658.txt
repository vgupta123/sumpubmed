we introduce a novel method, called puffin, that takes advantage of paired-end short reads to build genome-wide nucleosome maps with larger numbers of detected nucleosomes and higher accuracy than existing tools.
puffin builds genome-wide nucleosome maps using a multi-scale  approach.

we report comprehensive experimental results that compares puffin with recently published tools  on several synthetic datasets as well as real data for s. cerevisiae and p. falciparum.
experimental results show that our approach produces more accurate nucleosome maps with a higher number of non-overlapping nucleosomes than other tools.
our algorithm relies on a set of nucleosome "landscape" functions at different resolution levels: each function represents the likelihood of each genomic location to be occupied by a nucleosome for a particular value of the smoothing parameter.
after a set of candidate nucleosomes is computed for each function, puffin produces a consensus set that satisfies non-overlapping constraints and maximizes the number of nucleosomes.
