g23d extends the fraction of variants for which structural analysis is applicable and provides better and faster accessibility for structural data to biologists and geneticists who routinely work with genomic information.
g23d allows mapping of genomic positions/variants on evolutionary related  protein three dimensional  structures as well as on theoretical models.
to facilitate interpretation of the variant consequence, pathogenic variants, functional sites and polymorphism sites are displayed on protein sequence and structure diagrams alongside the input variants.
g23d also provides modeling of the mutant structure, analysis of intra-protein contacts and instant access to functional predictions and predictions of thermo-stability changes.
we present g23d, a tool for conversion of human genomic coordinates to protein coordinates and protein structures.
the main reasons can be attributed to the partial structural coverage of the human proteome and the lack of tools which conveniently convert genomic positions, which are the frequent output of genomic pipelines, to proteins and structure coordinates.
structural information however is still not routinely exploited during this evaluation process.
evaluation of the possible implications of genomic variants is an increasingly important task in the current high throughput sequencing era.
