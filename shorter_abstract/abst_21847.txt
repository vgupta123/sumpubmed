the best such methods use information from the background distribution of amino acids and substitution tables either when constructing the profiles or in the scoring.
profile-profile methods have been used for some years now to detect and align homologous proteins.
this makes the methods dependent on the quality and choice of substitution table as well as the construction of the profiles.
this new method derives a scoring function that is mainly dependent on the actual alignment of residues from a training set, and it does not use any additional information about the background distribution.
the main difference between the new scoring function and a traditional profile-profile scoring function is that conserved residues on average score higher with the new function.
here, we introduce a novel method called profnet that is used to derive a profile-profile scoring function.
