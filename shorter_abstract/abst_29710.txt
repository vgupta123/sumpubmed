by applying our system to extract all short form-long form pairs from all available pubmed abstracts, we have constructed bioadi.
mining bioadi reveals many interesting trends of bio-medical research.
abbreviation recognition is related to ner and can be considered as a pair recognition task of a terminology and its corresponding abbreviation from free text.
our approach to abbreviation recognition  is based on machine-learning, which exploits a novel set of rich features to learn rules from training data.
to automatically process large quantities of biological literature for knowledge discovery and information curation, text mining tools are becoming essential.
besides, we also provide an off-line ar software in the download section on http://bioagent.iis.sinica.edu.tw/bioadi/.
