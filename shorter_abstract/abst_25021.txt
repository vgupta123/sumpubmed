this novel lrr domain has  <dig> residues with the consensus sequence of lxxlxlxxnxlxxldlxxxx or lxxlxcxxnxlxxldlxxxx.
all known structures of repeated lrrs adopt an arc shape.
the "irreko" lrr is predicted to adopt an arc shape with smaller curvature in which Î²-strands are formed on both concave and convex surfaces.
however, other lrr classes remains to be characterized.
it is suggested that irreko@lrr evolved from a common ancestor with "sds22-like" and "bacterial" classes and that the ancestor of irreko@lrr is  <dig> or  <dig> residues of lxxlxlxxnx.
here we describe a novel lrr domain, or nested repeat observed in  <dig> proteins from  <dig> bacterial species.
this lrr domain is characterized by a nested periodicity; it consists of alternating 10- and 11- residues units of lxxlxlxxnx.
the first unit of the "irreko" lrr domain is frequently occupied by an "sds22-like" lrr with the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxlxxlxxlxx or a "bacterial" lrr with the consensus of lxxlxlxxnxlxxlpxlpxx.
proteins having "irreko" lrr domain are almost exclusively found in bacteria.
