however, the effect of antibiotic application on the adaptive evolution of microorganisms, especially to probiotic bacteria, has not been well characterized.
however, whether this is a species-specific or universal characteristic for all probiotic bacteria remains to be explored.
our study has shown that the probiotic species, l. casei zhang, has high genome stability even in the presence of long-term antibiotic stresses.
we found an approximately 4-fold increase in the genome mutation frequency of l. casei zhang, i.e.
<dig>  × 10- <dig> per base pair per generation under either amoxicillin or gentamicin stress, when compared with the parallel controls grown without application of any antibiotics.
thus, the objective of the current work was to investigate how antibiotic selection forces might drive genome adaptation using lactobacillus  casei zhang as a model.
two antibiotics, amoxicillin and gentamicin, were consistently applied to the laboratory culture of l. casei zhang.
the rate of de novo mutations, i.e.
<dig> per genome, remained low and stable throughout the long-term cultivation.
we then monitored the mutations in the bacterial genome and changes in the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of these two antibiotics along a 2000-generation-cultivation lasted over  <dig> months.
the increase in mutation frequency is significantly lower than that previously reported in escherichia  coli.
