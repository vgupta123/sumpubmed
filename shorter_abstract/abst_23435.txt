the genomic organization and phylogeny analysis support the hypothesis of a common ancestry between the vertebrate ucps.
the converse expression pattern was observed for ucp2a mrna which decreased during fasting, suggesting different metabolic roles for ucp2a and ucp2b in rainbow trout muscle.
these genes are 93% similar in their predicted amino acid sequences and display the same genomic structure as other vertebrates  spanning  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively.
we characterized two ucp <dig> genes in rainbow trout with similar genomic structures, amino acid sequences and distribution profiles.
in fry muscle we observed an increase in ucp2b expression in response to fasting and a decrease after refeeding in agreement with previous studies in human, mouse, rat, and marsupials.
these genes appeared to be differentially regulated in response to fasting and refeeding in fry muscle.
it has been determined that ucp <dig> plays a role in several physiological processes such as energy expenditure, body weight control and fatty acid metabolism in several vertebrate species.
uncoupling protein  <dig>  belongs to the superfamily of mitochondrial anion carriers that dissociate the respiratory chain from atp synthesis.
two ucp <dig> genes were identified in the rainbow trout genome, ucp2a and ucp2b.
phylogenetic analysis including other genes from the ucp core family located rainbow trout ucp2a and ucp2b with their orthologs and suggested an early divergence of vertebrate ucps from a common ancestor gene.
ucp2a and ucp2b were widely expressed in all tissues of the study with a predominant level in macrophage-rich tissues and reproductive organs.
we report the first characterization of ucp2s in rainbow trout .
