the risk of trypanosome infection was significantly associated with cattle age .
our results indicate that the prevalence and intensity of trypanosome infections are highly heterogeneous being associated with cattle age, location and sex.
a pearson chi-squared test and logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between location, age, sex, and prevalence of trypanosome infections.
livestock trypanosomiasis, transmitted mainly by tsetse flies of the genus glossina is a major constraint to livestock health and productivity in the sub-saharan africa.
trypanosoma vivax infection accounted for  <dig> % of infections detected by its-pcr, t. congolense , t. brucei s.l  and mixed  infections .
the objectives of this study were to  assess the prevalence and intensity of trypanosome infections in cattle, and  to investigate the reasons for the heterogeneity of the disease in the tsetse infested districts of amuru and nwoya, northern uganda.
in addition, the risk of trypanosome infection was significantly associated with sex , and males had a significantly higher prevalence of infections  than females .
