we show that mpss libraries are significantly less complex than much smaller sage libraries, revealing a serious bias in the generation of mpss data unlikely to have been circumvented by later technological improvements.
we used a single longsage library of  <dig>  tags and a "classic" mpss library of  <dig> , <dig> tags, both prepared from the same t cell-derived rna sample, to compare the ability of each method to probe, at considerable depth, a human cellular transcriptome.
deep transcriptome analysis will underpin a large fraction of post-genomic biology.
analysis of two additional mpss libraries shows that each library samples a different subset of transcripts, and that in combination the three mpss libraries  still only detect 73% of the genes identified in our test set using sage.
our results emphasize the need for the rigorous testing of new expression profiling technologies.
we show that even though longsage is more error-prone than mpss, our longsage library nevertheless generated  <dig> -fold more genome-matching  tags than the mpss library.
tag-based technologies are capable of identifying all possible transcripts, including those that were previously uncharacterized.
the source of the loss of complexity in mpss libraries compared to sage is unclear, but its effects become more severe with each sequencing cycle .
