the tempo of intron gains and losses has been irregular and several factors may explain why some genomes are intron-poor whereas other are intron-rich.
we studied the dynamics of intron gains and losses in an Î±-amylase gene, whose product breaks down starch and other polysaccharides.
moreover, a few species exhibited a high number of both specific intron gains and losses in recent periods.
the results indicate a high rate of intron insertions soon after the gene settled in the fungal genome.
since most basidiomycetes have intron-rich genomes and this richness was ancestral in fungi, long before the transfer event, we suggest that the new gene was shaped to comply with requirements of the splicing machinery, such as short exon and intron sizes, in order to be correctly processed.
increasing genome data show that introns, a hallmark of eukaryotes, already existed at a high density in the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes.
there was little variation of intron size.
