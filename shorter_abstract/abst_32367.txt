the  <dig> -bp double-stranded dna genome of zz <dig> has the lowest gc content  of the sequenced t4-like acinetobacter phages.
forty-three percent of the predicted zz <dig> proteins share up to 73% amino acid identity with t <dig> proteins, and the homologous genes generally retained the same order and transcriptional direction.
of the zz <dig> proteins,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 56% share up to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 83% amino acid identity with acj <dig>  acj <dig>   <dig>  and ac <dig> proteins, respectively.
zz <dig> has a different number and types of trnas than the other  <dig> acinetobacter phages, although some of the zz1-encoded trnas share high sequence similarity with the trnas from these phages.
however, this correlation was not present in any of the other  <dig> acinetobacter phages.
the comparative genomic analysis of these phages provided some new insights into the evolution and diversity of acinetobacter phages, which might elucidate the evolutionary origin and host-specific adaptation of these phages.
beyond the conserved structural and dna replication modules, t <dig> and zz <dig> have diverged substantially by the acquisition and deletion of large blocks of unrelated genes, especially in the first halves of their genomes.
to gain a better understanding of the genetic characteristics of zz <dig>  bioinformatics and comparative genomic analyses of the t <dig> phages were performed.

in addition, zz <dig> and the four other t4-like acinetobacter phage genomes  share a well-organised and highly conserved core genome, particularly in the regions encoding dna replication and virion structural proteins.
over half of zz1-encoded trnas  are related to optimal codon usage for zz <dig> proteins.
