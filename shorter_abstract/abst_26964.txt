an exometabolomics approach was applied to systematically identify inhibitors in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates.
inhibitory compounds in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates were successfully identified using a non-targeted systematic approach: metabolomics.
dilute acid, mild alkaline, alkaline/peracetic acid and concentrated acid.
to create diversity, the  <dig> hydrolysates were prepared from six different biomass types, namely sugar cane bagasse, corn stover, wheat straw, barley straw, willow wood chips and oak sawdust, and with four different pretreatment methods, i.e.
inhibitors are formed that reduce the fermentation performance of fermenting yeast during the pretreatment process of lignocellulosic biomass.
we studied the composition and fermentability of  <dig> different biomass hydrolysates.
their composition and that of fermentation samples generated with these hydrolysates were analyzed with two gc-ms methods.
using multivariate pls-2cv and npls-2cv data analysis models, potential inhibitors were identified through establishing relationship between fermentability and composition of the hydrolysates.
the identified inhibitors include both known ones, such as furfural, hmf and vanillin, and novel inhibitors, namely sorbic acid and phenylacetaldehyde.
