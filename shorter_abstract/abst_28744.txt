the first structure of d <dig> bound to a truly non-specific undamaged double-stranded dna suggests that initial binding of dna may involve multiple non-specific interactions between the protein and the phosphate backbone.
in the asymmetric unit two d <dig> subunits bind simultaneously to complementary strands of the dna double helix.
however, vaccinia virus uracil-dna glycosylase , also serves as an intrinsic and essential component of the processive dna polymerase complex during dna replication.
this manuscript describes the first structure of a dna-complex of a uracil-dna glycosylase from the poxvirus family.
dna binds to the opposite side of the a20-binding surface on d <dig>  comparison of the present structure with the structure of uracil-containing dna-bound human uracil-dna glycosylase suggests that for dna binding and uracil removal d <dig> employs a unique set of residues and motifs that are highly conserved within the poxvirus family but different in other organisms.
