acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as a significant global pathogen, with a surprisingly rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance and spread within hospitals and health care institutions.
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multi-locus sequence typing and antibiotic resistance profiles demonstrated genotypic and phenotypic variation.
this method identified genomic regions unique to both those isolates found on the surface of the skin or in wounds, termed colonization isolates, and those identified from body fluids, termed invasive isolates; these regions may play a role in the pathogenesis and spread of this important pathogen.
isolates from blood, peri-anal, and wound sources were examined in an attempt to identify genetic features that could be correlated to each isolation source.
a pcr-based screen of  <dig> a. baumanii isolates demonstrated that these unique genes are not exclusive to either phenotype or isolation source; however, a conserved genomic region exclusive to all sequenced a. baumannii was identified and verified.
the results of the comparative genome analysis and pcr assay show that a. baumannii is a diverse and genomically variable pathogen that appears to have the potential to cause a range of human disease regardless of the isolation source.
each isolate was sequenced to high-quality draft status, which allowed for comparative genomic analyses with existing a. baumannii genomes.
this study examines the genomic content of three a. baumannii strains isolated from distinct body sites.
a high resolution, whole genome alignment method detailed the phylogenetic relationships of sequenced a. baumannii and found no correlation between phylogeny and body site of isolation.
