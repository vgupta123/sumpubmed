interspersed in the human genome, alu repeats occupy 5% of the 3' utr of mrna sequences.
a significant portion  of mammalian mrna sequences contains au  rich elements or ares at their 3' untranslated regions .
these mrna sequences are usually stable.
from the 3' utr of the ncbi's reference mrna sequence database, we found nearly 40%  of are  were associated with alu sequences  within one mismatch allowance in are sequences.
it has been found that ares are present at the poly-t regions.
we found that half of the longest ares were derived from the poly-t regions of the complementary alu.
we analyzed the occurrences of ares and alu and propose a possible mechanism for how human mrna could acquire and keep ares at its 3' utr originating from alu repeats.
however, an increasing number of observations have been made of unstable species, possibly depending on certain elements such as alu repeats.
at each are class, random distribution was simulated  <dig>  times, and it was shown that there is a special relationship between are patterns and the alu repeats.
