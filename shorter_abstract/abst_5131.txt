the f363l mutation in the s <dig> transmembrane segment, analogous to the sca <dig> mutation f448l, alters channel gating.
when co-expressed with wild type, r335h subunits suppress kv <dig>  activity by a dominant negative mechanism.
here, we have identified zebrafish orthologs of voltage-dependent kv <dig>  k+ channels.
to assess the potential usefulness of the zebrafish as a model system for sca <dig>  we have characterized the functional properties of zebrafish kv <dig>  channels with and without mutations analogous to those that cause sca <dig>
the functional properties of zebrafish kv <dig>  channels are consistent with a role in facilitating fast, repetitive firing of action potentials in neurons.
the functional effects of sca <dig> mutations are well conserved between human and zebrafish kv <dig>  channels.
the zebrafish has been suggested as a model system for studying human diseases that affect nervous system function and motor output.
the high degree of homology between human and zebrafish kv <dig>  channels suggests that the zebrafish will be a useful model system for studying pathogenic mechanisms in sca <dig>
