however, little is known on expression of intestinal transport and phase i/ii metabolism genes during fasting and the role the fatty acid-activated transcription factor pparÎ± may play herein.
after  <dig> hours of fasting, expression levels of  <dig> of the  <dig> analyzed transporter and phase i/ii metabolism genes were changed.
upregulated genes were involved in transport of energy-yielding molecules in processes such as glycogenolysis  and mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids .
differentially expressed genes are involved in a variety of processes, which functionally can be summarized as a) increased oxidation of fat and xenobiotics, b) increased cholesterol secretion, c) increased susceptibility to electrophilic stressors, and d) reduced intestinal motility.
we therefore investigated the effects of fasting on expression of these genes using affymetrix genechip moe430a arrays and quantitative rt-pcr.
we have characterized the response to fasting on expression of transporters and phase i/ii metabolic enzymes in murine small intestine.
