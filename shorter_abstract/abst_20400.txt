we believe that our study provides valuable information to understand important role of c-terminal region that affects enzymatic properties for 5α-dht, and further molecular mechanism for the enzyme kinetics of akr1c <dig> proteins.
the results of the enzyme kinetics revealed that vmax and kcat values of the t-type were  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds higher than those of the c-type.
also, the c-terminal region significantly contributes to the nadph-dependent reductase activity for 5α-dht reduction.
our results showed that 5α-dht binding in t-type was more favorable for catalytic reaction to facilitate hydride transfer from the cofactor, and were consistent with experimental results.
the structural comparisons between c-type and t-type showed that 5α-dht formed strong hydrogen bonds with catalytic residues such as tyr <dig> and his <dig> in t-type.
moreover, catalytic efficiency was also  <dig>  fold higher in t-type compared to c-type.
molecular modeling studies combined with kinetic experiments were performed to investigate structural and enzymatic differences between wild-type akr1c <dig> c-type and t-type.
previously we have reported two paralogous pig akr1c1s, wild-type akr1c <dig>  and c-terminal-truncated akr1c <dig> .
pig aldo-keto reductase family  <dig> member c <dig>  belongs to akr superfamily which catalyzes the nadh-dependent reduction of various substrates including steroid hormones.
