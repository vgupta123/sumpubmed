strand bias in nucleotide frequency is reversed in both isopod species compared to other malacostraca.
sequence data and other characters from mitochondrial genomes  are useful in phylogenetic studies among metazoan animals from population to phylum level.
this is probably due to a reversal of the replication origin, which is further supported by the fact that the hairpin structure typically found in the control region shows a reversed orientation in the isopod species, compared to other crustaceans.
about different mechanisms of gene translocation, gene duplication and gene loss, or concerning nucleotide frequency biases.
the two isopod species ligia oceanica and idotea baltica show a similarly derived gene order, compared to the arthropod ground pattern and to the amphipod parhyale hawaiiensis, suggesting that most of the translocation events were already present the last common ancestor of these isopods.
beyond that, the positions of three trna genes differ in the two isopod species.
some of the transfer rnas show secondary structures which derive from the usual cloverleaf pattern.
the mitochondrial genome of ligia oceanica is a circular double-stranded dna molecule, with a size of  <dig>  bp.
while some trna genes are putative targets for rna editing, trnr could not be localized at all.
an overview about mitochondrial gene order of all crustacean taxa yet sequenced is also presented.
the largest non-coding part  of the mitochondrial genome of ligia oceanica is unexpectedly not at-rich compared to the remainder of the genome.
ligia oceanica is a terrestrial isopod living at rocky seashores of the european north sea and atlantic coastlines.
it bears two repeat regions , and a gc-rich hairpin-like secondary structure.
it shows several changes in mitochondrial gene order compared to other crustacean species.
gene order is not conserved among peracarida, not even among isopods.
