the phosphatidylethanolamine -conjugation of the atg <dig> protein plays an important role in the yeast autophagy process.
autophagy is a conserved cellular process that degrades and recycles cytoplasmic components via a lysosomal pathway.
all of them can be conjugated to pe through a ubiquitin-like conjugation system, and be located to autophagosomes.
these results suggest arg <dig> is an essential residue for the c-terminal cleavage of atg <dig> family proteins during the autophagy process.
in this study, we found  <dig> new alternative splicing isoforms in lc3b, gabarap, and gabarapl <dig>  .
interestingly, compared with lc3b, lc3b-a has a single amino acid  deletion due to the nagnag alternative splicing in intron  <dig>  through structural simulations, we found that the c-terminal tail of lc3b-a is less mobile than that of lc3b, thus affecting its c-terminal cleavage by human atg <dig> family proteins.
furthermore, we found that arg <dig> is an essential residue facilitating the interaction between human atg <dig> family proteins and atg4b by forming a salt bridge with asp <dig> of atg4b.
depletion of this salt bridge reduces autophagosomes formation and autophagic flux under both normal and nutrition starvation conditions.
