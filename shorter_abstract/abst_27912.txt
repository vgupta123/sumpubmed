using reporter genes in c. albicans, the activities of this gag-pol junction promoter and the tca <dig> long terminal repeat  promoter were compared.
luc expression was instead being driven by a previously unknown minor promoter activity within the gag-pol junction region.
it is unclear how the tca <dig> gag uga codon is bypassed to allow pol expression.
however, in other retroelements, translational readthrough of the gag stop codon can be directed by its flanking sequence, including a 3' pseudoknot.
the hypothesis was tested that in tca <dig>  gag stop codon flanking sequences direct translational readthrough and synthesis of a gag-pol fusion protein.
in the c. albicans retrotransposon tca <dig>  the gag and pol orfs are separated by a uga stop codon, 3' of which is a potential rna pseudoknot.
tca <dig> pol protein, epitope-tagged in c. albicans to allow detection, was also heat-shock induced, indicating that pol proteins were expressed from a gag-uga-pol rna.
of the two promoters, only the ltr promoter was induced by heat-shock, which also triggers retrotransposition.
this is the first demonstration that the ltr promoter directs tca <dig> pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol rna, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass.
evidence together indicated that junction sequence alone cannot direct uga readthrough.
however, in contrast to most other retroelement and viral readthrough signals, immediate gag uga-flanking sequences were insufficient to direct stop readthrough in s. cerevisiae, indicating non-canonical mechanisms direct gag uga bypass in tca <dig>
