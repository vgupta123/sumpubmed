catmap allows researchers to synthesize data to assess evidence for association in studies of genetic polymorphisms, facilitating the use of pooled data analyses which may increase power to detect moderate genetic associations.
although many software options are available for meta-analysis of genetic case-control data, no currently available software implements the method described by kazeem and farrall , which combines data from independent family-based and case-control studies.
meta-analyses of several independent studies may be helpful to increase the ability to detect association when effect sizes are modest.
