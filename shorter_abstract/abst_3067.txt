the genome organization into early, intermediate and late regions is similar to hadv-a <dig>  sequence analysis of the prototype strain showed unique sequence features such as an immunoglobulin-like domain in the species a specific gene product e <dig> cr <dig> beta and a potentially integrin binding rgd motif in the c-terminal region of the protein ix.
the genome size of hadv-a <dig> is  <dig> base pairs  in length with a gc content of  <dig> %.
overall, amino acid sequences of clinical isolates were highly conserved compared to the prototype , but a synonymous/non synonymous ratio  of  <dig>  in e <dig> cr <dig> beta suggested positive selection.
human adenoviruses  are causing a broad spectrum of diseases.
we sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of the hadv-a <dig> prototype strain to uncover unique sequence motifs associated with its high virulence.
moreover, we sequenced coding regions known to be essential for tropism and virulence  of hadv-a <dig> clinical isolates from patients with disseminated disease.
these features were conserved in all analyzed clinical isolates.
moderate evolution of clinical isolates did not indicate the emergence of new hadv-a <dig> subtypes in the recent years.
several reports in recent years have identified hadv- <dig> from species a  as a cause of disseminated disease in children following haematopoetic stem cell transplantation  and liver transplantation.
unique sequence features of hadv-a <dig> may enhance its ability to escape the host's immune surveillance and may facilitate a promiscuous tropism for various tissues.
