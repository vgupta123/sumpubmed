rates of resistance to macrolide antibiotics in streptococcus pneumoniae are rising around the world due to the spread of mobile genetic elements harboring mef and erm genes and post-vaccine clonal expansion of strains that carry them.
all dual-positive isolates are multidrug-resistant clonal lineages of taiwan19f- <dig>  mostly multilocus sequence type  <dig>  carrying the recently described transposon tn <dig>  the remainder of the macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae collection includes 31% mef-positive, and 9% erm-positive strains.
the largest portion of the macrolide-resistant population, 52%, is dual mef/erm-positive.
