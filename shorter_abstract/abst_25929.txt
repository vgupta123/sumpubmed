this approach facilitates visualisation of patterns of linkage disequilibrium across genomic regions, analysis of the relationships between different alleles of multiallelic markers and inferences about patterns of evolution and selection.
midas is a linkage disequilibrium analysis program with a comprehensive graphical user interface providing novel views of patterns of linkage disequilibrium between all types of multiallelic and biallelic markers.
we have developed a software package  for the estimation and graphical display of interallelic linkage disequilibrium.
however, these approaches are limited in their use of data from multiallelic markers and provide limited information in a graphical form.
linkage disequilibrium is analysed for each allelic combination , between all pairwise combinations of any type of multiallelic loci in a contig  of many loci .
