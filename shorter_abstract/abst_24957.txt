the five taas identified  are those whose expression is linearly related to the tumor mass increase in balb-neut mammary glands.
although the number of putative taas identified is limited, this pilot study suggests that meta-analysis of expression profiles produces results that could assist in the designing of pre-clinical immunopreventive vaccines.
identification of overexpressed genes provides an unprecedented opportunity to address the immune system against antigens typical of defined stages of neoplastic transformation.
moreover, they have a low expression in normal tissues and are generally expressed in human breast tumors, though at a lower level than her <dig>
