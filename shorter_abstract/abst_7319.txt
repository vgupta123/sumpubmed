as sclerotium rolfsii is known to be a good producer of cdh, the aim of this paper was to simplify its production and secondly to systematically study its purification aiming for a high yield.
purification was moderate, yielding a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg .
simultaneously, cdh production was increased by 21%.
subsequent purification using hydrophobic interaction chromatography was done at  <dig>  m ammonium sulfate concentration.
glucose and lactulose could be identified to have a high lyoprotective effect while loss of enzyme activity was high  when using no additives.
however, as could be shown in a preliminary experiment, purity of the obtained enzyme solution was sufficient for its intended use to oxidize lactose to lactobionic acid.
by simplifying the cultivation medium of sclerotium rolfsii, the costs of cellobiose dehydrogenase production could be reduced.
the enzyme cellobiose dehydrogenase  can be used to oxidize lactose to lactobionic acid.
the production of lactobionic acid from lactose is possible using partially purified and unpurified enzyme.

production of cellobiose dehydrogenase was optimized leading to a more simplified medium composition.
two preservation methods  and the influence of several protectants were investigated.
various sugars and sugar alcohols were investigated to study their protective effect during lyophilisation and freezing at -20°c.
