for half of these complexes a near-native structure can be predicted within the first  <dig> proposed structures and for more than 86% of all enzyme-inhibitor complexes within the first  <dig> predicted structures.
we developed a weighted geometric correlation based on optimised atom specific weighting factors and combined them with our previously published amino acid specific scoring and with a comprehensive svm-based scoring function.
the scoring with the atom specific weighting factors yields better results than the amino acid specific scoring.
especially for the enzyme-inhibitor complexes the results of the ranking are excellent.
docking algorithms are developed to predict in which orientation two proteins are likely to bind under natural conditions.
we were able to develop a combination of different scoring schemes which considers a series of previously described and some new scoring criteria yielding a remarkable improvement of prediction quality.
in combination with svm-based scoring functions the percentage of complexes for which a near native structure can be predicted within the top  <dig> ranks increased from 14% with the geometric scoring to 54% with the combination of all scoring functions.
