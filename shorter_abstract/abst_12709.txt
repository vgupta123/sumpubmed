gmapho1genes had diverse expression patterns in soybean, indicating their dramatic functional diversification.
class i sequence losses in other lineages may be attributed to gene loss after duplication events in land plant evolution.
phosphate <dig>  gene family members have diverse roles in plant growth and development, and they have been studied in arabidopsis, rice, and physcomitrella.
introns varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  and ancestral state reconstruction analyses revealed that genes with  <dig> introns were ancestral, thus suggesting that the intron loss was a chief constituent of pho <dig> gene evolution.
class i genes were only present and expanded in dicotyledonous plants and selaginella moellendorffii; class ii genes were found in all land plants.
class i genes were more broadly expressed than class ii.
these genes display tissue-specific or tissue-preferential expression patterns during soybean plant and fruit development.
our study revealed that pho <dig> genes originated from a eukaryotic ancestor and that two major classes formed in land plants.
our data show that pho <dig> genes could be classified into two major groups .
therefore, we surveyed the evolutionary patterns of genomes within the plant pho <dig> gene family, focusing on soybean  due to its economic importance.
in the soybean genome, only  <dig> pho1-like genes  were detected at the mrna level.
class i genes are only present in dicots and lycophytes.
