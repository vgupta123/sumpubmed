the objective of this study was to characterize pathogenic e. coli isolated from post-weaning piglets and growers with respect to their antibiograms, carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, pathotypes, production of hemolysins and fimbrial adhesins, serotypes, and genotypes.
postweaning diarrhea caused by pathogenic escherichia coli, in particular verotoxigenic e. coli , has caused significant economic losses in the pig farming industry worldwide.
pcr detection of virulence factors associated with different e. coli pathotypes  revealed that vtec was the only pathotype identified from six swine farms located at north-western peninsular malaysia.

a low prevalence rate of vtec was found among the swine samples  and all  <dig> vtec isolates were multidrug resistant.
two other serotypes, o130: h <dig>  and o168: h <dig>  carrying virulence factors were also identified.
the occurrence of vtec with infrequently encountered serotypes that are multidrug resistant and harbouring virulence factors may be of public health concern.
