the aim of this study was to test the utility of a mammalian methylation-free cpg island to drive ubiquitous expression of the sensitive doxycycline  inducible rtta2s-m <dig> tet-transactivator in transgenic mice.
the ubiquitously expressing rtta2s-m <dig> transgenic mouse line described here provides a very useful tool for studying the effects of the widespread, inducible overexpression of genes during embryonic development and in adult mice.
the utility of this rtta2s-m <dig> line for inducible expression in mouse embryos was also demonstrated using a gata- <dig> tet-inducible transgene to show specific phenotypes in the embryonic lung, as well as broader effects resulting from the inducible widespread overexpression of the transgene.
using this line we also show highly sensitive quantitative induction with low doses of dox of an assayable plasma protein transgene under the control of a tet responsive element .
