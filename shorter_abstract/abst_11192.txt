small animal mri at  <dig> tesla  provides a useful tool for adiposity research.
however the pragmatic time constraints and the practical resolution ranges are known for small animal imaging at 7t.
we designed a fat segmentation method based on optimizing a variety of factors relevant to small animal imaging at 7t.
on one hand, the weighted image is precisely divided into different regions with optimized smoothing and segmentation methods; and on the other hand, a confidence image is deduced from the parametric image according to the distribution of relaxation time relationship of typical adipose.
with the assistance of the confidence image, a useful software feature was implemented to which enhances the data and in the end results in a more reliable and flexible method for adipose evaluation.
the feasibility of the proposed method is tested on both simulated and real data in this preliminary research.
combining the full t <dig> parametric information with the optimized first echo image information, the research tool enhances the reliability of the results while providing more flexible operations than previous methods.
thus it is impossible to predict what accuracy and what spatial resolution will be required in all cases and even difficult what accuracy and resolution will be useful in most cases.
in contrast to most previously described mri methods based on signal intensity of t <dig> weighted image alone, we chose to use parametric images based on multi-spin multi-echo  bruker pulse sequence which has proven to be particularly robust in our laboratory over the last several years.
ultimately our flexible software lets the researcher define key aspects of the fat segmentation and quantification.
