in arabidopsis thaliana  heynh and oryza sativa l., a large number of genes encode proteins of unknown functions, whose characterization still remains one of the major challenges.
we have found that the transcript levels of some members of this family are altered in response to various stresses such as salinity, drought, cold, high temperature, uv, wounding and genotoxic stress, in both root and shoot tissues.
in order to investigate the role of these cdcps, we have carried out their detailed analysis in whole genomes of arabidopsis and oryza, including their classification, nomenclature, sequence analysis, domain analysis, chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships and their expression patterns using public databases .
a comprehensive analysis of expression patterns for cdcps using the already existing transcriptome profiles and mpss database reveals that a few cdcps may have an important role in stress response/tolerance and development in plants, which needs to be validated further through functional genomics.
cbs domain as such has no defined function but plays a regulatory role for many enzymes and thus helps in maintaining the intracellular redox balance.
our analysis has identified  <dig> cbs domain containing proteins  in arabidopsis and  <dig> in oryza.
in most of these proteins, cbs domain coexists with other functional domain, which may indicate towards their probable functions.
this data would be helpful in exploring the so far obscure functions of cbs domain and cbs domain-containing proteins in plant stress responses.
