the oral administration of l. casei crl  <dig> induces variations in the cytokine profile and in the tlrs expression previous and also after the challenge with s. typhimurium.
these changes show some of the immune mechanisms implicated in the protective effect of this probiotic strain against s. typhimurium, providing an alternative way to reduce the severity of the infection.
diarrheal infections caused by salmonella, are one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries.
the aim of the present work was to deep into the knowledge about how this probiotic bacterium exerts its effect, by assessing its impact on the expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory  and anti-inflammatory  cytokines in the inductor and effector sites of the gut immune response, and analyzing toll-like receptor  expressions in both healthy and infected mice.
probiotic administration to healthy mice increased the expression of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> and improved the production and secretion of tnfα, ifnγ and il- <dig> in the inductor sites of the gut immune response .
post infection, the continuous probiotic administration, before and after salmonella challenge, protected the host by modulating the inflammatory response, mainly in the immune effector site of the gut, decreasing tnfα and increasing ifnγ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> production in the lamina propria of the small intestine.
previously we demonstrated that continuous lactobacillus casei crl  <dig> administration to balb/c mice before and after challenge with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  decreased the severity of salmonella infection.
