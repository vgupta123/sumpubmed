we demonstrate an implementation of the k-opls algorithm for matlab and r, licensed under the gnu gpl and available at .
the kernel-based orthogonal projections to latent structures  method offers unique properties facilitating separate modelling of predictive variation and structured noise in the feature space.
the properties of the k-opls method are well suited for analysis of biological data, which in conjunction with the availability of the outlined open-source package provides a comprehensive solution for kernel-based analysis in bioinformatics applications.
incorporated is also a set of diagnostic tools and plot functions to simplify the visualisation of data, e.g.
while providing prediction results similar to other kernel-based methods, k-opls features enhanced interpretational capabilities; allowing detection of unanticipated systematic variation in the data such as instrumental drift, batch variability or unexpected biological variation.
the utility of the software package is demonstrated by means of a metabolic profiling data set from a biological study of hybrid aspen.
kernel-based classification and regression methods have been successfully applied to modelling a wide variety of biological data.
