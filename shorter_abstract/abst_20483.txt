the urinary se to creatinine ratio and serum se concentration were significantly lower in dogs consuming the low se diet from week  <dig> onwards, by 84 %  and 7 %  respectively.
this study demonstrated that urinary se to creatinine ratio, serum se and serum and whole blood glutathione peroxidase can be used as biomarkers of selenium status in dogs.
urinary se to creatinine ratio and serum se concentrations responded faster to decreased dietary se than the other parameters.
the first group remained on the adequate se diet, the second were offered a semi-purified diet with a low se concentration  for 8 weeks.
serum and whole blood glutathione peroxidase were also significantly lower in dogs consuming the low se diet from weeks  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.
none of the other biomarkers  responded significantly to the low se diet over the 8 week period.
in view of the owner’s desire for healthy longevity of companion animals, the impact of dietary se provision on long term health effects warrants investigation.
inadequate dietary selenium  intake in humans and animals can lead to long term health problems, such as cancer.
in this study, selected biomarkers were assessed for their suitability to detect changes in dietary se in adult dogs within eight weeks.
weekly urine and blood was collected and hair growth measurements were performed.
this makes these biomarkers candidates for early screening of long term effects of dietary se provision on canine health.
little is currently known regards biomarkers, and rate of change of such biomarkers in relation to dietary selenium intake in dogs.
