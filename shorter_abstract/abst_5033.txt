to assess scale accuracy,  <dig> lame, presa canario dogs with osteoarthritis  associated with bilateral hip dysplasia were first treated with mesenchymal stem cells.
these data were compared with similar data collected using a force platform with the same animals during a period of 6 months after treatment.
although subjective pain assessment showed improvement after 6 months, force platform data demonstrated those same animals had returned to the initial lameness state.
use of pain assessment scales to measure lameness associated with oa did not have great accuracy and concordance when compared with quantitative force platform gait analysis.
