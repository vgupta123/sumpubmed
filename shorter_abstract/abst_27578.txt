despite the prevalence and importance of allorecognition systems, the genetic basis of allorecognition has rarely been characterized outside the well-known mhc  in vertebrates and si  in plants.
these results are likely due to selection rather than demography, given that  <dig> of the housekeeping loci have no populations with significant values for any of the polymorphism statistics.
the distribution of variation within and among populations points towards balancing selection and away from directional selection.
while these data do not provide unambiguous support for a specific type of selection, they contribute to our evolutionary understanding of a critical biological process by determining the forces that affect loci involved in allorecognition.
nearly all of the variation in the fester locus resides within populations.
all polymorphism statistics  are significantly negative for the east coast a-type alleles, and fu and li's f* statistic is significantly negative for the west coast a-type alleles.
the ω statistics show that the majority of the protein is experiencing purifying selection , but that 15– <dig> codons are undergoing either balancing or directional selection: ω >  <dig> is compatible with either scenario.
the majority of codons in the fester proteins have ω values <  <dig>  but 15– <dig> codons have > 95% posterior probability of ω values >  <dig>
the polymorphism statistics are consistent with either purifying selection or directional selection.
in b. schlosseri, colonies sharing  <dig> or more alleles of a gene called fuhc  will fuse.
protein products of a locus called fester, located ~ <dig> kb from fuhc, have been shown to play multiple roles in the histocompatibility reaction, as activating and/or inhibitory receptors.
we have previously identified the genes involved in self/non-self recognition in the colonial ascidian botryllus schlosseri, and we can now begin to investigate their evolution.
