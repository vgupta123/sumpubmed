considerably divergent data have been published from attempts to model the e. coli vs. s. aureus specific immune reaction of the udder using primary cultures of bovine mammary epithelial cells from cows .
our data cross validate the correctness of previously published divergent data on the pathogen-specific induction of key immune genes in pbmec.
some groups reported a swift, strong and transient inflammatory response against challenges with e. coli and only a weak and retarded response against s. aureus, in agreement with the respective reaction of the udder.
we challenged pbmec with proteins from heat killed e. coli or s. aureus pathogens or purified tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> ligands.
withdrawal of fcs slowed down and decreased the extent by which e. coli or lps enhanced the expression of cyto- and chemokine encoding genes through impaired tlr <dig> signalling but enforced their expression during stimulation with s. aureus.
s. aureus strain specific differences in the reaction of the pbmec could only be recorded in sm <dig>  nf-κb factors were activated by e. coli in all stimulation media, but only to a small extent by s. aureus, solely in sm <dig>  purified ligands for tlr <dig> stimulated expression of those genes and activated nf-κb equally well in sm <dig> and sm <dig>  the mrna destabilizing factor tristetraproline was only induced by e. coli in sm <dig> and by purified pamps.
sm milk strongly quenched the induction of those genes.
the stimuli were applied in normal growth medium with  or without  10 % fetal calf serum, or in the basal medium supplemented with 10 mg/ml milk proteins .
presence or absence of fetal calf serum distinguished the experimental setting between both groups.
rather, receptors distinct from tlrs perceive the presence of s. aureus and control the immune response against this pathogen in mec.
