the differentially expressed genes belonged to nine functional categories: cell wall/membrane biogenesis genes, hemolysin genes, heat shock proteins genes, intracellular trafficking and secretion genes, two-component system and transcriptional regulator genes, information storage and processing genes, chemotaxis and flagellar genes, metabolism genes and genes with no known homologue.
real-time reverse transcription-pcr assays confirmed the microarray data.
microarray analyses demonstrated that l. interrogans responds globally to temperature alteration.
dna microarray analyses were used to investigate the influence of temperature on global gene expression in l. interrogans grown to mid-exponential phase at 28°c and 37°c.
the data delineate the spectrum of temperature-regulated gene expression in an important human pathogen and provide many new insights into its pathogenesis.
