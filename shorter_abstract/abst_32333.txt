recent studies suggest that by combining existing calls into meaningful sequences, animals can increase the information content of their vocal repertoire despite these constraints.
the first being stable and individually distinct, and the second being graded and correlating with the current behavior of the individual, whether it is digging, searching or moving.
our study indicates that temporal segregation and segmental concatenation of vocal signatures or cues is likely a common, but so far neglected, dimension of information coding in animal vocal communication.
this provides evidence of marler's hypothesis on temporal segregation of information within a single syllable call type.
we argue that temporal segregation of vocal signatures and cues evolves in species where communication of multiple unambiguous signals is crucial, but is limited by the number of call types produced.
our study provides the first evidence of segmental concatenation of information within a single syllable in non-human vocalizations.
