from e <dig>  into postnatal life there is progressively more severe retinal dysplasia and microphthalmia.
pax <dig> overexpression does not obviously impair the initial formation of the eye and its major cell-types but prevents normal development of the retina from about e <dig> , leading eventually to severe retinal degeneration in postnatal life.
increasing dosage increases the proportion projecting ipsilaterally regardless of the size of the total projection.
at e <dig>  and e <dig> , quantitative rt-pcr with probes for a range of molecules associated with retinal development showed only one significant change: a slight reduction in levels of mrna encoding the secreted morphogen shh at e <dig> .
at e <dig> , tract-tracing with carbocyanine dyes in pax77+/+ embryos revealed errors in intraretinal navigation by rgc axons, a decrease in the number of rgc axons reaching the thalamus and an increase in the proportion of ipsilateral projections among those rgc axons that do reach the thalamus.
a survey of embryos with different pax6/pax <dig> gene dosage  showed that  the total number of rgc axons projected by the retina and  the proportions that are sorted into the ipsilateral and contralateral optic tracts at the optic chiasm vary differently with gene dosage.
before the onset of severe retinal dysplasia, pax <dig> overexpression causes defects of retinal axons, preventing their normal growth and navigation through the optic chiasm.
analyses of patterns of gene expression indicated that pax77+/+ retinae produce a normal range of cell types, including retinal ganglion cells .
eyes form in pax77+/+ embryos but subsequently degenerate.
from e <dig>  on, we observed malformations of the optic disc.
