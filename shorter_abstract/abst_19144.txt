overall, our work proposes that systematic application of this genetic approach could determine the functional significance of individual lncrnas in yeast and other complex organisms.
we subsequently performed sga screens on a set of uncharacterised lincrnas and uncover their connection to diverse cellular processes.
we first validate this approach by demonstrating that the telomerase rna tlc <dig> displays a gi network that corresponds to its well-described function in telomere length maintenance.
however, only a few lncrnas have been ascribed a cellular role thus far, with most regulating the expression of adjacent genes.
here, we employ synthetic genetic array  in saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify gis between long intergenic non-coding rnas  and protein-coding genes.
transcriptome studies have revealed that many eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed producing numerous long non-coding rnas .

furthermore, the gi profile of sut <dig> is distinct from that of its neighbouring genes suggesting a function independent to its genomic location.
one of these lincrnas, sut <dig>  exhibits a gi profile associating it to telomere organisation and we consistently demonstrate that sut <dig> is required for telomeric overhang homeostasis through an exo1-dependent pathway.
accordingly, we show that ectopic expression of this lincrna suppresses telomeric overhang accumulation in sut457Δ cells assigning a trans-acting role for sut <dig> in telomere biology.
therefore, the function of lncrnas could be illuminated through systematic analysis of their synthetic genetic interactions .
