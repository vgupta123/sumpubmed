new molecular methods of detecting clostridium difficile infection  provide the routine lab with a sensitive random access method to produce results that are available in a shorter time than traditional methods.
in this prospective study a total of  <dig> stool specimens were tested over a period of 16 months in parallel using two isothermal amplification assays, amplivue®  and illumigene®  and the results compared to those from toxigenic culture.

the respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value compared to toxigenic culture were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 98 % for amplivue® and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 98 % for illumigene®.
<dig>  specimens were positive in toxigenic culture.
in addition all specimens were tested using a cytotoxic cell neutralisation assay  and three different real-time pcr targeting a c. difficile-specific 16s rdna sequence or the toxin genes tcda, tcdb/tcdb <dig> or cdtb.
