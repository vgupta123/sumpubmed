we developed the program package func that includes and expands on currently available methods to identify significant associations between gene sets and ontological annotations.
it is freely available under the gpl license and also accessible via a web service.
relationships between the gene sets identified by experimental methods and biological knowledge can be made explicit and used in the interpretation of results.
implemented are several tests in particular well suited for genome wide sequence comparisons, estimates of the family-wise error rate, the false discovery rate, a sensitive estimator of the global significance of the results and an algorithm to reduce the complexity of the results.
func is a versatile and useful tool for the analysis of genome-wide data.
