equally surprising, mice engineered to express only zymogen-locked endogenous matriptase, unlike matriptase null mice, were viable, developed epithelial barrier function, and regenerated the injured epithelium.
matriptase is a membrane serine protease essential for epithelial development, homeostasis, and regeneration, as well as a central orchestrator of pathogenic pericellular signaling in the context of inflammatory and proliferative diseases.
the study demonstrates that the matriptase zymogen is biologically active and is capable of executing developmental and homeostatic functions of the protease.
here, we used gain and loss of function genetics to investigate the possible biological functions of zymogen matriptase.
unexpectedly, transgenic mice mis-expressing a zymogen-locked version of matriptase in the epidermis displayed pathologies previously reported for transgenic mice mis-expressing wildtype epidermal matriptase.
matriptase is an unusual protease in that its zymogen displays measurable enzymatic activity.
