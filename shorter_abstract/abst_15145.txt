nonetheless, there was no induction of biofilm formation or genes involved in mutagenesis.
while an adaptive response was induced nevertheless, colicin m application did not increase biofilm formation, nor induce sos genes, adverse effects that can be provoked by a number of traditional antibiotics, providing support for colicin m as a promising antimicrobial agent.
here the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of colicin m on whole genome transcription in e. coli were investigated, to gain insight into its ecological role and for purposes related to antimicrobial therapy.
transcriptome analysis revealed that exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of colicin m altered expression of genes involved in envelope, osmotic and other stresses, including genes of the crebc two-component system, exopolysaccharide production and cell motility.
at subinhibitory concentrations colicin m induces an adaptive response primarily to protect the bacterial cells against envelope stress provoked by peptidoglycan damage.
among the first induced were genes of the crebc two-component system known to promote increased resistance against colicins m and e <dig>  providing novel insight into the ecology of colicin m production in natural environments.
one of the most prevalent colicins, colicin m, can kill susceptible cells by hydrolyzing the peptidoglycan lipid ii intermediate, which arrests peptidoglycan polymerization steps and provokes cell lysis.
bacteriocins are protein antimicrobial agents that are produced by all prokaryotic lineages.
due to the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance and the lack of novel antimicrobial agents, colicin m has recently received renewed attention as a promising antimicrobial candidate.
