simulate_pcr is the only freely available software that can be run from the command line for high throughput applications which can calculate all products from large lists of primers and probes compared to a large sequence database such as nt.
the software is a command line perl script freely available as open source.
fragment length distributions are calculated to predict electrophoretic gel banding patterns.
amplicons hit by taqman速/luminex速 probes are indicated, and products may be annotated with gene information from ncbi.
degenerate bases are allowed and entire amplicon sequences are extracted and annotated with gene information.
it predicts and extracts all amplicon sequences in a large sequence database from a list of primers and probes, allowing degenerate bases and user-specified levels of primer-target mismatch tolerance.
pairing up primers to amplify desired targets and avoid undesired cross reactions can be a combinatorial challenge.
examples are provided for sets of taqman速/luminex速 pcr signatures predicted to amplify all hiv- <dig> genomes, all coronaviridae genomes, and a group of antibiotic resistance genes.
