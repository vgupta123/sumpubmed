we present an algorithm that determines the smallest perturbations required for manipulating the dynamics of a network formulated as a petri net, in order to cause or avoid a specified phenotype.
mathematical modeling of biological networks is an essential part of systems biology.
by modifying mcmillan's unfolding algorithm, we handle partial knowledge and reduce computation cost.
developing and using such models in order to understand gene regulatory networks is a major challenge.
the methodology is demonstrated on a glioma network.
