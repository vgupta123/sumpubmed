in the present study, blood neutrophils were isolated from  <dig> early lactating heifers with different cxcr <dig> genotype at position  <dig> or  <dig>  the cells were incubated with different concentrations of recombinant bovine il- <dig>  for  <dig> or 6 h and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  or opsonized zymosan particles .
in the present study no association could be detected between superoxide production by isolated bovine neutrophils during early lactation and cxcr <dig> gene polymorphism.
il- <dig> showed to possess inhibitory effects on ros generation in bovine neutrophils.
potential association between cxcr <dig> genotype and production of reactive oxygen species  was studied.

although on single nucleotide polymorphisms  may potentially affect cxcr <dig> function, snps c.735c > g and c.980a > g showed no association with ros production with or without incubation of rbil- <dig>  neutrophils incubated with rbil- <dig> for  <dig> or 6 h showed higher pma- and lower ozp-induced ros production compared to control without rbil- <dig>
