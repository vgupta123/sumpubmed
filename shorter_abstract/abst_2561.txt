we were able to detect  <dig> different plant taxa in total, of which 95% were classified at the species level.
together with the laboratory protocol, we also present an update of the reference database used by the classifier software, which increases the total number of covered global plant species included in the database from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .
we applied this protocol to  <dig> pollen samples collected by solitary bees and sequenced all samples together on a single illumina miseq v <dig> flow cell.
although only tested for pollen samples, it is furthermore applicable to other research questions requiring plant identification in mixed and challenging samples.
meta-barcoding of mixed pollen samples constitutes a suitable alternative to conventional pollen identification via light microscopy.
separate steps for amplification and sample indexing.
according to rarefaction curves,  <dig> – <dig>  high quality reads per sample were sufficient to assess the complete diversity of 95% of the samples.
we thus developed a new primer-adapter design for high throughput sequencing with the illumina technology that remedies these issues.
