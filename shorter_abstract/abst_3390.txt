hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia  is an autosomal dominant disease with a varying range of phenotypes involving abnormal vasculature primarily manifested as arteriovenous malformations in various organs, including the nose, brain, liver, and lungs.
rather than filtering the data down to a single value, these data are analyzed in the context of a network model of metabolism, in order to simulate the biochemical phenotypic differences between healthy and disease states; the results then guide the therapy.
fasting serum samples from  <dig> individuals  were metabolomically profiled.
in this 'individualized case study' of personalized medicine, we carry out untargeted metabolomic profiling of a patient and healthy controls.
a global metabolic network reconstruction, recon  <dig>  was used to help guide the choice of medication via analysis of the differential metabolism between the patient and healthy controls using metabolomic data.
flux balance analysis highlighted changes in metabolic pathway activity, notably in nitric oxide synthase , which suggested a potential link between changes in vascular endothelial function and metabolism.
this presents one approach to achieving the goals of individualized medicine through systems biology and causal models analysis.
