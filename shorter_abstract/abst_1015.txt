therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the tissue specificity of somatic instability may provide novel routes to therapies.
using tissue instability quantified in  <dig> tissues as a phenotype and tissue microarray gene expression as a predictor, we built a mathematical model and identified a gene expression signature that accurately predicted tissue instability.
in addition, we searched for genes and pathways that correlated with tissue instability.
in addition, our quantitative, genome-wide approach is readily applicable to high-throughput assays and opens the door to widespread applications with the potential to accelerate the discovery of drugs that alter tissue instability.
interestingly, the hd cag repeat, whose length determines age at onset, undergoes tissue-specific somatic instability, predominant in the striatum, suggesting that tissue-specific cag length changes could modify the disease process.
here we describe a novel approach to gain insight into the factors responsible for the tissue specificity of somatic instability.
using the predictive ability of this signature we found that somatic instability was not a consequence of pathogenesis.
in support of this, genetic crosses with models of accelerated neuropathology failed to induce somatic instability.
we found that expression levels of dna repair genes did not explain the tissue specificity of somatic instability.
our study clearly demonstrates that multiple tissue factors reflect the level of somatic instability in different tissues.
using accurate genetic knock-in mouse models of hd, we developed a reliable, high-throughput method to quantify tissue hd cag repeat instability and integrated this with genome-wide bioinformatic approaches.
instead, our data implicate other pathways, particularly cell cycle, metabolism and neurotransmitter pathways, acting in combination to generate tissue-specific patterns of instability.
