we trained several different classification models within the weka framework using various statistics derived from overlaps of reads available from prior sequencing projects.
we present an approach that extends the minimus assembler by a data driven step to classify overlaps as true or false prior to contig construction.
these statistics included percent mismatch and k-mer frequencies within the overlaps as well as a comparative genomics score derived from mapping reads to multiple reference genomes.
we show that in real whole-genome sequencing data from the e. coli and s. aureus genomes, by providing a curated set of overlaps to the contigging phase of the assembler, we nearly doubled the median contig length  without sacrificing coverage of the genome or increasing the number of mis-assemblies.
machine learning methods that use comparative and non-comparative features to classify overlaps as true or false can be used to improve the quality of a sequence assembly.
but no overlapping algorithm to date takes a rigorous approach to separating aligned but non-overlapping read pairs from true overlaps.
