the score is implemented in the ash structure alignment package, for which the source code and a web service are freely available from the pdbj website .
in this study we construct a training set of sequence-unique cath and scop domains, from which we develop a scoring function that can reliably identify domains with the same cath topology and scop fold classification.
also, a subset of domain pairs is identified that exhibit high similarity, even though their cath and scop classification differs.
finally, we show that the ranking of alignment programs based solely on geometric measures depends on the choice of the quality measure.
ash shows high selectivity and sensitivity with regard to domain classification, an important step in defining distantly related protein sequence families.
structure alignment methods offer the possibility of measuring distant evolutionary relationships between proteins that are not visible by sequence-based analysis.
