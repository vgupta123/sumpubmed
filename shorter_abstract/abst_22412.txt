by combining the tspg method and repeated random sampling, a robust common cancer signature has been identified from large-scale microarray data integration.
these  <dig> genes are naturally divided into two distinct groups; those in one group are typically expressed less than those in the other group for cancer tissues.
we then apply a statistical method, referred to as the top-scoring pair of groups  classifier, and a repeated random sampling strategy to the integrated training data sets and identify a common cancer signature consisting of  <dig> genes.
dna microarrays provide a means for measuring gene expression signatures which can then be used as components of genomic-based diagnostic tests to determine the presence of cancer.
in this study, we collect and integrate ~  <dig> microarray gene expression profiles from  <dig> published cancer data sets across  <dig> major human cancer types.
this signature is then validated by applying this decision rule to independent test data.
given a new expression profile, the classifier discriminates cancer from normal tissues by ranking the expression values of the  <dig> genes in the cancer signature and comparing the average ranks of the two groups.
