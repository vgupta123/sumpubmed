the modelling suggests a novel definition of important nodes in the network, namely social, as revealed based on the local sociality parameters of the model.
moreover, the sociality parameters help to reveal organizational principles of the network.
the network analysis indicated that protein disorder has a positive effect on the connectivity of proteins in the network, but do not fully explains the interactivity.
we predicted the fold group  of proteins in the network from their primary sequences.
we present a statistical method of analysis of biological networks based on the exponential random graph model, namely p2-model, as opposed to previous descriptive approaches.
the approach opens a perspective to study effects of biological properties of individual entities on the structure of biological networks.
the model is capable to capture generic and structural properties of a network as emergent from local interdependencies and uses a limited number of parameters.
bayesian approach for the estimation of the parameters was employed.
we deduced social proteins, essential for the formation of the network, while incorporating into the model information on protein disorder.
an inherent advantage of our approach is the possibility of hypotheses testing: a priori knowledge about biological properties of the nodes can be incorporated into the statistical model to investigate its influence on the structure of the network.
we applied the statistical modelling to the human protein interaction network obtained with y2h experiments.
here, we consider one global parameter capturing the density of edges in the network, and local parameters representing each node's contribution to the formation of edges in the network.
