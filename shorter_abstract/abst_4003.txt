a cdna library constructed from cucumber plants sprayed with  <dig> μm bth was screened to get corresponding full length cdnas.
the time course of accumulation of the three corresponding mrnas was analysed by northern blotting in plants treated by bth or in plants infected by colletotrichum lagenarium.
infection of plants by necrotizing pathogens can lead to the rapid and localized induction of a complex set of defense responses resulting in a restriction of pathogen growth and spread.
we tested on cucumber different compounds known to induce systemic acquired resistance.
to identify components of the transduction pathway, we cloned and analysed the expression pattern of several mrnas accumulating in cucumber plants after induction of systemic acquired resistance.
mrna rt-pcr differential display was used to identify mrna sequences induced  <dig> hours after the application of  <dig> μm bth to cucumber plants.
among the identified cdnas were those coding for a putative ras-related gtp-binding protein, a putative beta- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyltranferase iii and a putative pathogenesis related protein.
subsequently, an increase of plant resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens is observed systemically.
