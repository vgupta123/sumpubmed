no obvious morphological phenotypes were exhibited under normal growth conditions.
within the arabidopsis genome, there are  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase  genes.
furthermore, metabolite profiling analysis revealed some differences between wild type and cyp709b <dig> mutant plants, supporting the salt intolerance phenotype of the cyp709b <dig> mutant.
when the responses to aba and salt stress were studied in these mutants, only the cyp709b <dig> mutant showed sensitivity to aba and salt during germination.
under moderate salt treatment , cyp709b <dig> showed a higher percentage of damaged seedlings, indicating a lower tolerance to salt stress.
under salt stress condition, cyp709b <dig> gene expression was induced after 24Â hr and remained at high expression level.
these results suggest that cyp709b <dig> plays a role in aba and salt stress response and provides evidence to support the functions of cytochrome p <dig> enzymes in plant stress response.
expression of the wild type cyp709b <dig> gene in the cyp709b <dig> mutant fully complemented the salt intolerant phenotype.
the cyp709b family of p450s includes three gene members, cyp709b <dig>  cyp709b <dig> and cyp709b <dig>  which have high amino acid sequence similarity and lack reports elucidating biological functions.
however, the biological functions of the majority of these p450s remain unknown.
we identified t-dna insertion-based null mutants of the cyp709b subfamily of genes.
