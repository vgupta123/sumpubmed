the bacillus genus of firmicutes bacteria is ubiquitous in nature and includes one of the best characterized model organisms, b. subtilis, as well as medically significant human pathogens, the most notorious being b. anthracis and b. cereus.
the most populated phams were those encoding proteins involved in dna metabolism, virion structure and assembly, cell lysis, or host function.
host analysis of these clusters supports host boundaries at the subcluster level and suggests phages as vectors for genetic transfer within the bacillus cereus group, with b. anthracis as a distant member.
thus, the identification and analysis of bacillus phages is critical to understanding the evolution of bacillus species, including pathogenic strains.
whole genome nucleotide and proteome comparison of the  <dig> extant, fully sequenced bacillus phages revealed  <dig> distinct clusters,  <dig> subclusters and  <dig> singleton phages.
this analysis provides a basis for understanding and characterizing bacillus and other related phages as well as their contributions to the evolution and pathogenicity of bacillus cereus group bacteria.
