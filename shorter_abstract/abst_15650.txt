such method consists of fitting whole-genome regression models by subsampling observations in each round of a markov chain monte carlo.
on average, losses on predictive properties imposed by subsampling were negligible, usually below 1%.
genome-wide assisted selection is a critical tool for theÂ genetic improvement of plants and animals.
we propose the use of subsampling bootstrap markov chain in genomic prediction.
fitting such models with a large number of observations involves a prohibitive computational burden.
the investigation indicates that the subsampling bootstrap markov chain algorithm substantially reduces computational burden associated with model fitting, and it may slightly enhance prediction properties.
subsampling provided a substantial decrease in computation time, reducing the time to fit the model by half.
