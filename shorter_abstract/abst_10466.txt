we show that the ltr-rts found in diatoms form two new phylogenetic lineages that appear to be diatom specific and are also found in environmental samples taken from different oceans.
comparative expression analysis in p. tricornutum cells cultured under  <dig> different conditions demonstrate high levels of transcriptional activity of ltr retrotransposons in response to nitrate limitation and upon exposure to diatom-derived reactive aldehydes, which are known to induce stress responses and cell death.
the genomes of a centric diatom, thalassiosira pseudonana, and a pennate diatom, phaeodactylum tricornutum, that likely diverged around  <dig> mya, have recently become available.
transposable elements  are mobile dna sequences present in the genomes of most organisms.
in the present work, we establish that ltr retrotransposons  are the most abundant tes inhabiting these genomes, with a much higher presence in the p. tricornutum genome.
they have been extensively studied in animals, fungi, and plants, and have been shown to have important functions in genome dynamics and species evolution.
diatoms, which belong to the heterokont group, are unicellular eukaryotic algae responsible for around 40% of marine primary productivity.
regulatory aspects of p. tricornutum retrotransposon transcription also include the occurrence of nitrate limitation sensitive cis-regulatory components within ltr elements and cytosine methylation dynamics.
