secondly, we propose a hypothetical feedback loop from the response regulator to htr methylation made from the chec proteins, ched and cheb, which might contribute to adaptation analogous to the chec/ched system of b. subtilis.
the interaction analysis revealed that the core signaling proteins are involved in different protein complexes and our data provide evidence for dynamic interchanges between them.
fifteen of the eighteen taxis receptors  can be assigned to four different groups depending on their interactions with the core signaling proteins.
we studied the protein interactions in the hbt.
salinarum might have the capability to dynamically adjust the impact of certain htrs or htr clusters depending on its current needs or environmental conditions.
chey connects the core signaling structure to a subnetwork consisting of the two chef proteins , ched , two chec complexes and the receptor methylesterase cheb.
