in this class, we confirm bidirectional promoters  as a configuration capable to reduce coupling by abating noise but also reveal an important trade-off, since bipromoters also decrease plasticity.
a number of factors, such as transcription re-initiation, strong chromatin regulation or genome neighboring organization, underlie this coupling.
here we first show that strong chromatin regulation, commonly viewed as a source of coupling, can lead to plasticity without noise.
this additionally implies that genome neighboring organization –as modifier– appears only effective in highly plastic genes.
contrarily, in genes exhibiting poor transcriptional control, it is translational efficiency what separates noise from plasticity, a pattern related to transcript length.
this presents ultimately a paradox between intergenic distances and modulation, with short intergenic distances both associated and disassociated to noise at different plasticity levels.
balancing the coupling among different types of expression variability appears as a potential shaping force of genome regulation and organization.
