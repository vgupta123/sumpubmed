two out of the  <dig> snps exhibited differential promoter activity in several human cell lines.
over  <dig> million single nucleotide polymorphisms  are currently reported to exist within the human genome.
ten such snps were selected for mobility shift assays , resulting in  <dig> of them exhibiting a reproducible shift.
some snps behave differently in different cell types.
only a small fraction of these snps alter gene function or expression, and therefore might be associated with a cell phenotype.
information related to functional snps in candidate disease genes is critical for cost effective genetic association studies, which attempt to understand the genetics of complex diseases like diabetes, alzheimer's, etc.
we propose a method for effective selection of functional, regulatory snps that are located in evolutionary conserved 5-prime flanking regions  regions of human genes and influence the activity of the transcriptional regulatory region.
these functional snps are consequently important in understanding human health.
allelic pairs resulting in a significant score difference were predicted to influence the binding of transcription factors .
