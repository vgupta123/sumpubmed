here we demonstrate that a bayesian model for comparing medical diagnostics without a gold standard can be successfully applied in the bioinformatics domain, to genomic scale data sets.
the examples demonstrate the methods are suitable for both small and large data sets, applicable to the wide range of bioinformatics classification problems, and robust to dependence between classifiers.
a classifier can be evaluated in terms of sensitivity and specificity using benchmark, or gold standard, data, that is, data for which the true classification is known.
in all three test cases, the globally optimal logical combination of the classifiers was found to be their union, according to three out of four ranking criteria.
in all cases, run times were feasible, and results precise.
given multiple classifiers, two crucial questions arise: how does their performance compare, and how can they best be combined to produce a better classifier?
lastly, classifiers for a genome-wide association study of macular degeneration with  <dig> snps were analysed.
diagnostic tests for swine flu were then compared on a small data set.
we apply this model, for the first time, to the problem of finding the globally optimal logical combination of classifiers.
the optimal logical combination of classifiers was also determined for all three data sets.

we compared three classifiers of protein subcellular localisation, and evaluated our estimates of sensitivity and specificity against estimates obtained using a gold standard.
