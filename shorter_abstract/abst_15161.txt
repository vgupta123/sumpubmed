the massive accumulation of protein sequences arising from the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing, coupled with automatic annotation, results in high levels of incorrect annotations.
here, we applied motif-based sequence analyses to identify enzymes possessing conserved gdsl motifs in selected proteomes across the plant kingdom.
in particular, the natural abundance of gdsl enzymes reported recently in plants indicates that they could be a good source of novel gdsl enzymes.
based on these analyses we provide a curated list of gdsl enzymes from the selected plants.
in addition, analyses of selected proteomes showed a remarkable expansion of gdsl enzymes in the lycophyte, selaginella moellendorffii.
our results show that scanning with a carefully parameterized motif-hmm is an effective approach for annotation of protein families with low sequence similarity and conserved motifs.
the results of this study expand current knowledge and provide new insights into the evolution of the large gdsl-lipase family in land plants.
in this study, we describe an approach to decrease annotation errors of protein families characterized by low overall sequence similarity.
moreover, our scanning approach successfully detected protein sequences lacking at least one of the essential motifs  annotated by pfam profile search  as gdsl.
motif-based hmm scanning  and the here described pd/vd protocol were successfully applied on  <dig> selected plant proteomes to identify sequences with gdsl motifs.

a significant number of identified gdsl sequences were novel.
clans clustering and phylogenetic analysis helped us to gain a better insight into the evolutionary relationship of all identified gdsl sequences.
three novel gdsl subfamilies as well as unreported variations in gdsl motifs were discovered in this study.
