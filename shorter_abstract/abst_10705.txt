pasta  is a splice junction detection algorithm specifically designed for rna-seq data, relying on a highly accurate alignment strategy and on a combination of heuristic and statistical methods to identify exon-intron junctions with high accuracy.
compared to similar programs, it has the ability to identify a higher number of real splicing junctions, and provides highly annotated output files containing detailed information about their location and characteristics.
pasta is a highly efficient and sensitive tool to identify splicing junctions from rna-seq data.
