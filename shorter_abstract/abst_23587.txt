using this strategy we were able to detect about seven thousand potential snps from the transcriptomes of several clonal lines of rainbow trout.
when directly compared to a pre-validated set of snps in polyploid wheat, we were also able to estimate the false-positive rate of this strategy as  <dig> to 28% depending on parameters used.
the common ancestor of salmonid fishes, including rainbow trout , experienced a whole genome duplication between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, and many of the duplicated genes have been retained in the trout genome.
this method is especially well suited for identifying snps in polyploids, both outbred and inbred, but would tend to be conservative for diploid organisms.
this strategy has an advantage over traditional techniques of snp identification because another dimension of sequencing information is utilized.
