the predicted gene ontology  term revealed that 55% of the clones in the ra-induced gene library were associated with genes involved in common defence mechanisms, including thirty four genes homologous to arabidopsis genes implicated in r-gene-triggered resistance in the programmed cell death  pathway.
to understand the roles of ra and its functional coupling to light signalling, we constructed the ra-induced gene library using the suppression subtractive hybridisation  technique and present a comparative investigation of gene regulation in radish seedlings in response to short-term ra and blue-light exposure.
the transcriptome analysis revealed that, among the fifty genes from various functional categories selected from  <dig> independent genes of the ra-induced library,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated.
the results described herein suggest a link between ra and cellular defence and light signalling, and thereby contribute to further our understanding of how ra is involved in light-mediated mechanisms of plant defence.
overall, the library was enriched with transporters, hydrolases, protein kinases, and signal transducers.
the transcriptional profiles, coupled with the transcriptional regulation of early blue light, have provided the functional roles of many genes expected to be involved in the light-mediated defence mechanism.
this study is the first comprehensive survey of transcriptional regulation in response to ra.
raphanusanin  is a light-induced growth inhibitor involved in the inhibition of hypocotyl growth in response to unilateral blue-light illumination in radish seedlings.
the comparative analysis showed that, among the transcriptional profiles of  <dig> highly ra-inducible genes,  <dig> ests were commonly regulated by different intensities and duration of blue-light irradiation.
