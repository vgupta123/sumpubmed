in silico analysis of human norovirus ns1- <dig> protein showed that it shares features with the murine ns1- <dig> protein, including a disordered region, a transmembrane domain and h-box and nc sequence motifs.
rnaseq analysis showed that ns1- <dig> proteins from human and murine noroviruses affect multiple immune systems  and intracellular pathways  in murine monocytes.
<dig> sydney  <dig> strain of human norovirus  is a pandemic strain that is responsible for the majority of norovirus outbreaks in healthcare settings.

in this study, rna transcripts of human and murine norovirus full-length and the disordered region of ns1- <dig> were transfected into monocytes, and next generation sequencing was used to analyse the transcriptomic profile of cells expressing virus proteins.
the profiles were then compared to the transcriptomic profile of mnv-infected cells.
comparison to the transcriptomic profile of mnv-infected cells indicated the pathways that ns1- <dig> may affect during norovirus infection.
