our results demonstrate that tetrapods can live by expressing either one or both erk isoforms, supporting the notion that erk1/ <dig> act interchangeably.
two erk isoforms have been described, erk <dig> and erk2; erk <dig> being regarded by many as essential due to the embryonic lethality of erk <dig> knock-out mice, whereas mice lacking erk <dig> are viable and fertile.
to investigate this question we used a novel approach based on comparing the evolution of erk isoforms’ sequences and protein expression across vertebrates.
erk isoforms appeared by a single gene duplication at the onset of vertebrate evolution at least  <dig> mya.
we suggest that future erk research should shift towards understanding the role and regulation of total erk quantity, especially in light of newly described erk <dig> gene amplification identified in tumors.
finally, phylogenetic analysis revealed that erk <dig> amino acids sequences evolve faster than erk2’s likely due to genomic factors, including a large difference in gene size, rather than from functional differences since amino acids essential for function are kept invariant.
we gathered and cloned erk <dig> and erk <dig> coding sequences and we examined protein expression of isoforms in brain extracts in all major clades of vertebrate evolution.
to demonstrate the unexpected squamates’ lack of erk <dig> expression, we targeted each erk isoform in lizard primary fibroblasts by specific sirna-mediated knockdown.
substrate recognition sites and catalytic cleft are nearly invariant in all vertebrate erks further suggesting functional redundancy.
the controversial question of why we have two erks and whether they have differential functions or display functional redundancy has not yet been resolved.
