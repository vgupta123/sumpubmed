mir394a/b are conserved small rnas and its target gene lcr  encodes an f-box protein  but whether mir394a/b and its target gene lcr are involved in regulation of plant response to abscisic acid  and abiotic stresses is unknown.
the silencing of lcr mrna by mir <dig> is essential to maintain a certain phenotype favorable for the adaptive response to abiotic stresses.
mir394a/b over-expression  and lcr  mutant plants are hypersensitive to salt stress, but lcr over-expressing  plants display the salt-tolerant phenotype.
if the balance is perturbed in case of the abiotic stress, an identical phenotype related to the stress response occurs, resulting in either aba sensitive or insensitive response.
over-expression of mir394a in abi4- <dig> or abi5- <dig> background resulted in loss of aba-sensitivity in 35s::mir394a plants.
thus, mir394-regulated lcr abundance may allow plants to fine-tune their responses to aba and abiotic stress.
the contrasting phenotypes of salt and drought responses may be mediated by a functional balance between mir <dig> and lcr.
expressions of aba- and stress-responsive genes, abi <dig>  abi <dig>  abi <dig>  abf <dig>  and abf <dig> are up-regulated in mir394a/b over-expressing plants but down-regulated in 35s::m5lcr plants.
by contrast, lcr expression is depressed by aba.
analysis of lcr and its promoter  revealed that lcr is expressed at all development stages.
over-expression of mir394a/b led to aba hypersensitivity and aba-associated phenotypes, whereas 35s::m5lcr plants show aba resistance phenotypes.
both 35s::mir394a/b and lcr plants are highly tolerant to severe drought stress compared with wild-type, but 35s::m5lcr plants are susceptible to water deficiency.
moreover, 35s::mir394a/b plants accumulated higher levels of aba-induced hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals than wild-type and 35s::m5lcr plants.
