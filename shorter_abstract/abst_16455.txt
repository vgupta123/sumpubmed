we then use maximum-likelihood methods to compute phylogenetic trees from a concatenation of representative sequences.
we then use our methodology to compute a robust and well-resolved phylogenetic tree for a diverse set of sequenced bacteria.
although there are now about  <dig> complete bacterial genomes in genbank, deep bacterial phylogeny remains a difficult problem, due to confounding horizontal gene transfers and other phylogenetic "noise".
we validate the use of representative proteins on a number of small phylogenetic questions with accepted answers.
representative proteins provide an effective solution to the problem of selecting phylogenetic characters.
a representative protein family is one that, taken alone, gives an organismal distance matrix in good agreement with a distance matrix computed from all sufficiently conserved proteins.
we describe an algorithm that automatically picks "representative" protein families from entire genomes for use as phylogenetic characters.
