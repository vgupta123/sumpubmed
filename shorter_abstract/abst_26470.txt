in the protease-mediated allele-specific extension , the protease constrains the elongation reaction and thus prevents incorrect nucleotide incorporation to mismatched 3'-termini primers.
ten polymorphic positions suggested as prothrombotic genetic variations were analyzed with pyrosequencing and prase technologies in  <dig> samples and  <dig>  % concordance was achieved.
a script automatically visualizes the results in cluster diagrams and assigns the genotypes.
the results of this study strongly indicate that the prase technology can offer significant improvements in terms of accuracy and robustness and thereof increased number of typeable snps.
the assay is automated for  <dig> genotyping reactions in parallel followed by a tag-microarray detection system.
