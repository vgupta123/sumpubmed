the proposed method is general and can be potentially used to identify genes which have the same patterns or biological processes, and help facing the present and forthcoming challenges of data analysis in functional genomics.
this work aims to identify genes that show different gene expression profiles across time.
finally, we cluster the remaining gene profiles using a model-based approach in the fourier domain.
the key elements of the proposed methodology:  representation of gene profiles in the fourier domain;  automatic screening of genes based on the fourier coefficients and taking into account autocorrelation in the data, while controlling the false discovery rate ;  model-based clustering of the remaining gene profiles.
we evaluate the screening results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, fdr and fnr, compare with the gaussian process regression screening in a simulation study and illustrate the results by application to yeast cell-cycle microarray expression data with alpha-factor synchronization.
time course gene expression experiments are an increasingly popular method for exploring biological processes.
since time series expression is a temporal process, its unique features such as autocorrelation between successive points should be incorporated into the analysis.
much of the early work on analyzing time series expression data relied on methods developed originally for static data and thus there is a need for improved methodology.
in particular, we first represent each profile in terms of a fourier basis, and then we screen out genes that are not differentially expressed based on the fourier coefficients.
