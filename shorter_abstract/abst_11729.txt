the mechanisms of immune response are structured within a highly complex regulatory system.
genetic associations with variation in the immune response to rubella vaccine have typically been assessed one locus at a time.
we simultaneously assessed the associations between  <dig> snps tagging  <dig> candidate immune response genes and rubella-specific antibody levels.
single-snp assessments identified  <dig> snps that appeared to be univariately associated with rubella antibody levels: rs <dig>  and rs <dig>  in the 5'utr of the lta gene, rs <dig> in the 5'utr of the il <dig> gene , and rs <dig> in the 5'utr of the il4r gene .
while there was not significant evidence in favor of epistatic genetic associations among the candidate snps, multigenic analyses identified  <dig> snps significantly associated with rubella antibody levels when selected as a group .
for the first time, multigenic assessment of associations between candidate snps and rubella antibody levels identified a broad number of genetic associations that would not have been deemed important univariately.
associations between rubella-specific antibody levels and  <dig> candidate tagsnps were assessed both one snp at a time and in a variety of multigenic analyses.
