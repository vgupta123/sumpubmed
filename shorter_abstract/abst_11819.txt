accordingly, we used the data obtained with either methods or their intersection to number the orthologs that are adjacent in for each pair of genomes, the positional orthologous genes , and to further study their properties.
this is a complex and difficult problem in the field of comparative genomics but will help to better understand the way prokaryotic genomes are evolving.
once all these synteny blocks have been detected, we showed that pogs are subject to more evolutionary constraints than orthologs outside synteny groups, whichever the taxonomic distance separating the compared organisms.
we have developed a suite of programs that automate three essential steps to study conservation of gene order, and validated them with a set of  <dig> bacteria and archaea that cover the majority of the prokaryotic taxonomic space.
the suite of programs described in this paper allows a reliable detection of orthologs and is useful for evaluating gene order conservation in prokaryotes whichever their taxonomic distance.
the first computes the reciprocal smallest distance  using the pam distances separating pairs of homologs.
detecting synteny blocks requires reliable methods to determining the orthologs among the whole set of homologs detected by exhaustive comparisons between each pair of completely sequenced genomes.
we applied two strategies to extract from the set of homologs a collection of valid orthologs shared by at least two genomes.
the second method groups homologs in families and reconstructs each family's evolutionary tree, distinguishing bona fide orthologs as well as paralogs created after the last speciation event.
we identified the whole set of shared homologs between two or more species and computed the evolutionary distance separating each pair of homologs.
