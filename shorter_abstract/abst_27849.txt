evaluation of the intra-assay coefficient of variation showed ranges of  <dig> - <dig> % and  <dig> - <dig> % for days  <dig> and  <dig> sera samples respectively, following vaccination.
the measured concentrations obtained in the standard curve correlated with the known concentration at each dilution.
mean correlation coefficient  of the standard curve was  <dig> .
the use of such related immunoassays can serve as potential adjuncts to potency tests for sterne and other vaccine types under development in ruminant species.
this was compared with the anthrax toxin neutralization assay  which measures a functional subset of toxin neutralizing anti-pa igg.
the quantitative anti-anthrax igg elisa in this study describes a method of enumerating the concentration of anti-pa specific igg present in sera of immunized goats, with the aid of an affinity-purified caprine polyclonal anti-anthrax pa- <dig> igg standard.
spearmanâ€™s rank correlation of log-transformed igg concentrations and tna titres showed strong positive correlation .
various adaptation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  have been developed in studies to assess immune response following vaccination, albeit mostly in laboratory rodent models.
