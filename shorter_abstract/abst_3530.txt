in t <dig> cells, we find digitonin-resistant clic <dig> is present in an intracellular compartment which is concentrated immediately below the apical plasma membrane and the extent of apical polarization is enhanced with forskolin, which activates transepithelial chloride transport and apical membrane traffic in these cells.
we find clic <dig> is expressed in the apical domains of several simple columnar epithelia including glandular stomach, small intestine, colon, bile ducts, pancreatic ducts, airway, and the tail of the epididymis, in addition to the previously reported renal proximal tubule.
distribution of clic <dig> was examined in panc <dig> cells, a relatively undifferentiated, non-polarized human cell line derived from pancreatic cancer, and t <dig> cells, a human colon cancer cell line which can form a polarized epithelium that is capable of regulated chloride transport.
we find that digitonin-resistant clic <dig> is primarily present in the plasma membrane of panc <dig> cells.
the distribution of clic <dig> in normal tissues is largely unknown and conflicting data have been reported regarding the cellular membrane fraction in which clic <dig> resides.
in certain polarized columnar epithelia, it may play a role in apical membrane recycling.
clic <dig> is expressed in a non-polarized distribution in the basal epithelial cell layer of the stratified squamous epithelium of the upper gastrointesitinal tract and the basal cells of the epididymis, and is present diffusely in skeletal muscle.
clic <dig> is a chloride channel whose cellular role remains uncertain.
digitonin extraction was used to distinguish membrane-inserted clic <dig> from the soluble cytoplasmic form of the protein.
