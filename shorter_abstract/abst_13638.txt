cysteinyl residues in actin are glutathionylated, ie.
we conclude that glutathionylation of β-actin may occur via spontaneous oxidation of a cysteinyl residue to a sulfenic acid that readily reacts with gsh to form a mixed disulfide.
glutathionylation inhibits actin polymerization and reversible actin glutathionylation is a redox dependent mechanism for regulation of the cytoskeleton structure.
β-actin glutathionylation by gsh was inhibited by arsenite and dimedone suggesting that the mechanism involved formation of a cysteinyl sulfenic acid residue in β-actin.
form a mixed disulfide with glutathione, even in the absence of exogenous oxidative stress.
we have studied glutathionylation of α- and β-actin in vitro using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay with a monoclonal anti-glutathione antibody.
the molecular mechanism that mediates actin glutathionylation in vivo is unclear.
glutathionylation of β-actin by gssg is likely to be mediated by a thiol-exchange mechanism whereas glutathionylation by gsh requires thiol oxidation.
however, β-actin was also glutathionylated by both glutathione disulfide  and gsh in the absence of diamide whereas α-actin was poorly glutathionylated by gsh or gssg.
