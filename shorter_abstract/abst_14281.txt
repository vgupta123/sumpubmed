in human vaccine manufacturing some pathogens such as modified vaccinia virus ankara, measles, mumps virus as well as influenza viruses are still produced on primary material derived from embryonated chicken eggs.
qualitatively, the observed flux distribution of this avian cell line was similar to distributions found for mammalian cell lines .
results were compared to literature dealing with mammalian and insect cell culture metabolism focusing on the question whether cultured avian cells differ in metabolism.
in particular, glucose was catabolized inefficiently and glycolysis and tca cycle seem to be only weakly connected.
to better understand vaccine production processes, we developed a stoichiometric model of the central metabolism of age <dig> cr.pix cells and applied flux variability and metabolic flux analysis.

a distinguishing feature of the avian cell line is that glutaminolysis plays only a minor role in energy generation and production of precursors, resulting in low extracellular ammonia concentrations.
