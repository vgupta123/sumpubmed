isoflavones are polyphenols with estrogenic activity found mainly in soy and soy-derived products that need to be metabolised in the intestine by the gut bacteria to be fully active.
there is little knowledge about isoflavone bioconversion and equol production in the human intestine.
the application of high-throughput dna sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons revealed the composition of the faecal cultures to be modified by the addition of isoflavones, with enrichment of some bacterial gut members associated with the metabolism of phenolics and/or equol production, such as collinsella, faecalibacterium and members of the clostridium clusters iv and xiva.
although limited by the low number of faecal cultures analysed and the inter-individual bacterial diversity, the in vitro results obtained in this work tend to indicate that soy isoflavones might provide an alternative energy source for the increase of equol-producing taxa and enhancement of scfas production.
in the faecal anaerobic batch cultures of this study bioconversion of isoflavones into equol was possible, suggesting the presence of viable equol-producing bacterial taxa within the faeces of menopausal women with an equol producer phenotype.
in this work, we developed an in vitro anaerobic culture model based on faecal slurries to assess the impact of isoflavone supplementation on the overall intestinal bacterial composition changes and associated metabolic transformations.
in addition, the concentration of short-chain fatty acids  detected in the isoflavone-containing faecal cultures was higher in those inoculated with faecal slurries from equol-producing women.
