plants carrying a t-dna insertion in one of the genes encoding ateaf <dig> showed decreased flc expression and early flowering, similarly to atyaf <dig> mutants.
we report on the identification and molecular characterization of ateaf <dig>  a new subunit of arabidopsis nua <dig> complex which shows many similarities to the platform protein of the yeast nua <dig> complex.
our work provides evidence for the existence of a yeast-like eaf <dig> platform protein in a. thaliana, filling an important gap in the knowledge about the subunit organization of the plant nua <dig> complex.
ateaf <dig> copurifies with arabidopsis homologues of nua <dig> and swr1-c subunits arp <dig> and swc <dig> and interacts physically with atyaf9a and atyaf9b, homologues of the yaf <dig> subunit.
it is currently not known what protein complexes are formed by the plant homologues of nua <dig> and swr1-c subunits.
chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the single mutant ateaf1b- <dig> and artificial mirna knock-down ateaf <dig> lines showed decreased levels of h4k <dig> acetylation in the promoter regions of major flowering regulator genes, further supporting the role of ateaf <dig> as a subunit of the plant nua <dig> complex.
for example, the human tip60-p <dig> complex consists of homologues of both yeast nua <dig> and swr1-c subunits, combining subunits necessary for histone acetylation and histone variant exchange.
