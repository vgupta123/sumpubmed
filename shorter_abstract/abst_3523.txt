we recorded electroencephalograms  over the bilateral sensorimotor cortex from a patient suffering from chronic writerâ€™s cramp.
the current pilot study suggests that a brain-computer interface can give explicit feedback of ongoing cortical excitability to patients with dystonia and allow them to suppress exaggerated neural activity, resulting in functional recovery.
in addition to these pharmacological or neurosurgical measures, a new noninvasive treatment concept, functional modulation using a brain-computer interface, was tested for feasibility.
