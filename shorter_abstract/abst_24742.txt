this classification includes new, resurrected, and modified subfamilies within gymnophthalmid and scincid lizards, and boid, colubrid, and lamprophiid snakes.
we present a new large-scale phylogeny of squamate reptiles that should be a valuable resource for future comparative studies.
the tree also includes many relationships that differ from previous molecular estimates and many that differ from traditional taxonomy.
the extant squamates  are one of the most diverse and conspicuous radiations of terrestrial vertebrates, but no studies have attempted to reconstruct a phylogeny for the group with large-scale taxon sampling.
the tree provides important confirmation for recent estimates of higher-level squamate phylogeny based on molecular data , estimates that are very different from previous morphology-based hypotheses.
the analysis is based on up to  <dig> base pairs of sequence data per species  from  <dig> genes, including seven nuclear loci , and five mitochondrial genes .
