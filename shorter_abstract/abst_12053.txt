to better assess its capabilities, the complete genome sequence of s. espanaensis was established.
saccharothrix espanaensis produces both saccharomicins a and b of the promising new class of heptadecaglycoside antibiotics, active against both bacteria and yeast.
besides a predicted core genome of  <dig> genes shared in the family, s. espanaensis has a large number of accessory genes:  <dig>  singletons when compared to the family, of which  <dig>  have no clear orthologs in the refseq database.
s. espanaensis is the first completely sequenced species of the genus saccharothrix.
moreover, the genome revealed  <dig> additional putative secondary metabolite gene clusters further suggesting the strainâ€™s potential for natural product synthesis.
the genome analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> biosynthetic gene clusters potentially encoding secondary metabolites.
