recognition of microbial pathogens by plants triggers the hypersensitive reaction, a common form of programmed cell death in plants.
we delineate the nrp-gene in soybean, which is specifically induced during this programmed cell death and contains a novel protein domain, which is commonly found in different plant proteins.
the sequence analysis of the protein, encoded by the nrp-gene from soybean, led to the identification of a novel domain, which we named dcd, because it is found in plant proteins involved in development and cell death.
it is tempting to speculate, that the dcd domain mediates signaling in plant development and programmed cell death and could thus be used to identify interacting proteins to gain further molecular insights into these processes.
the molecular mechanisms behind the hypersensitive reaction are largely unknown except for the recognition process of pathogens.
these dying cells generate signals that activate the plant immune system and alarm the neighboring cells as well as the whole plant to activate defense responses to limit the spread of the pathogen.
