to enhance our appreciation of the epidemiological status of serotype sat  <dig> virus in the region, we inferred its evolutionary and phylogeographic history by means of genealogy-based coalescent methods using  <dig> vp <dig> coding sequences covering a sampling period from 1948- <dig>
two virus groups with probable independent introductions from southern africa were identified from a maximum clade credibility tree.
our results provide a baseline characterization of the inter-regional spread of sat  <dig> in sub-saharan africa and highlight the importance of a regional approach to trans-boundary animal disease control in order to monitor circulating strains and apply appropriate vaccines.
the vp <dig> coding sequence of  <dig> serotype sat  <dig> fmd viruses from east africa has been determined and compared with known sequences derived from other sat  <dig> viruses from sub-saharan africa.
purifying  selection and low substitution rates characterized the sat  <dig> virus isolates in east africa.
