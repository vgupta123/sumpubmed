pmes play an important role in plant development, including seed germination.
transcriptome studies have suggested that members of this family are involved in seed development and germination processes.
our results indicated that the duf <dig> proteins encoded by at4g <dig> and at5g <dig> could be positive regulators of pme activity during several developmental processes.
our results suggested that the duf <dig> family contributes to the complexity of the methylesterification process by participating in the fine regulation of pectin status during plant development.
duf <dig> proteins constitute a highly conserved family of proteins that are associated with the cell wall and are specific to spermatophytes.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the function of the duf <dig> gene at4g <dig> during seed germination and plant development and to determine its relation to pme activity regulation.
transgenic lines overexpressing these proteins showed increased pme activity during seed germination, and improved seed germination performance.
in plants expressing at4g <dig> antisense rna, pme activity was decreased in the leaves, and the siliques were very short and contained no seeds.
previous in vitro studies have revealed that at4g32460- and at5g11420-encoded proteins interact with the catalytic domain of pectin methyl esterase  <dig> .
