the anti-thrombin activity of the six mutants and rgd-hirudin was tested.
recombinant rgd-hirudin and six mutant variants , designed based on molecular simulations, were expressed in pichia pastoris.
further, we evaluated the binding of the mutant variants and rgd-hirudin to thrombin using biacore surface plasmon resonance analysis .
it is a powerful and specific thrombin inhibitor.
kinetics and affinity constants showed that the kd values of all six mutant proteins were higher than that of rgd-hirudin.
the proteins were refolded and purified to homogeneity as monomers by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography.
hirudin is an anti-coagulation protein produced by the salivary glands of the medicinal leech hirudomedicinalis.
