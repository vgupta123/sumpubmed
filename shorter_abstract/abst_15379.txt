we examined medium-spiny neuron autaptic connections in postnatal cultures from the nucleus accumbens, the ventral part of the striatal complex.
d1-like receptors mediated either inhibition or facilitation, while d2-like receptors predominantly mediated inhibition.
many connections showed both d <dig> and d <dig> modulation, consistent with a significant functional colocalization of d <dig> and d2-like receptors at presynaptic sites.
differential trafficking of dopamine receptors to different presynaptic varicosities could explain the many controversial studies reporting widely varying degrees of dopamine receptor colocalization in medium-spiny neurons, as well as more generally the diversity of dopamine actions in target areas.
in particular, they make autaptic connections that provide access to single, identified medium-spiny to medium-spiny neuron synaptic connections.
longer-term changes in the modulatory actions of dopamine in the striatal complex could be due to plasticity in the presynaptic distribution of dopamine receptors on medium-spiny neuron varicosities.
in some instances, autaptic connections had two components that were differentially modulated by dopamine agonists, suggesting that dopamine receptors could be distributed heterogeneously on the presynaptic varicosities making up a single synaptic  connection.
the striatal complex is the major target of dopamine action in the cns.
