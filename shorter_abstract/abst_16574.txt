the inward rectifier channels  are sensitive to 4-aminopyridine  but not tetra-ethyl ammonium , whereas the delayed rectifier mutants are sensitive to tea but not 4-ap.
this canonical pore is opened or closed by conformational changes that originate in the voltage sensor , a transmembrane helix with a series of positively charged amino acids.
several mutations of two amino acids in the voltage sensing  transmembrane helix change the phenotype to a typical delayed rectifier.
the inward rectifier channels also manifest low cation selectivity.
voltage-gated ion channels are membrane proteins containing a selective pore that allows permeable ions to transit the membrane in response to a change in the transmembrane voltage.
the typical selectivity filter in potassium channels is formed by a tetrameric arrangement of the carbonyl groups of the conserved amino-acid sequence gly-tyr-gly.
n.at-kv <dig> , a naturally occurring potassium channel of the kv <dig> sequence family, mediates ion permeation through a modified gating pore, not the canonical, highly selective pore typical of potassium channels.
