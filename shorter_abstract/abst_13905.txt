over  <dig>  parameter combinations are examined, and best-performing parameters for each system-ontology pair are presented.
there are many recognizers for specific ontologies, but a general approach for concept recognition is an open problem.
baselines for concept recognition by three systems on eight biomedical ontologies are established .
default parameters are not ideal for most systems on most ontologies; by changing parameters f-measure can be increased by up to  <dig> .
three dictionary-based systems  are evaluated on eight biomedical ontologies in the colorado richly annotated full-text  corpus.
