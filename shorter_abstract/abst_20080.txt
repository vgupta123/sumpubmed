the workflow generator encapsulates a user-friendly javascript-based visual tool that allows users to design customized workflows even for those without a technical background.
a lims is a complex software platform that helps researchers to have a complete knowledge of the laboratory activities at each step encouraging them to adopt good laboratory practices.
we have designed and implemented quality and traceability data system - qtreds, a software platform born to address the specific needs of the crs <dig> sequencing and genotyping platform .
qtreds provides a system for privileges management and authorizations to create different user roles, each with a well-defined access profile.
to enhance the level of quality control over the laboratory activities and efficiently handle the large amounts of data produced, a laboratory management information system  is highly-recommended.
qtreds was designed to address the specific needs of the csgp laboratory, where it has been successfully used for over a year, but thanks to its flexibility it can be easily adapted to other "omics" laboratories.

the wizard-based sample handler allows to manage one or multiple samples at a time, tracking the path of each sample and providing a full chain of custody.
the system written in the ruby programming language and developed using the rails framework is based on four main functional blocks: a sample handler, a workflow generator, an inventory management system and a user management system.
with the inventory management system, reagents, laboratory glassware and consumables can be easily added through their barcodes and minimum stock levels can be controlled to avoid shortages of essential laboratory supplies.
