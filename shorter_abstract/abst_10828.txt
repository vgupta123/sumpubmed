dictyostelium discoideum, a soil-dwelling social amoeba, is a model for the study of numerous biological processes.
we present dictyexpress , a web application designed for exploratory analysis of gene expression data, as well as data from related experiments such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing .
dictyostelium biologists now face the widespread challenges of analyzing and exploring high dimensional data sets to generate hypotheses and discovering novel insights.
the application features visualization modules that include time course expression profiles, clustering, gene ontology enrichment analysis, differential expression analysis and comparison of experiments.
in addition, we introduce a companion application called genboard, an intuitive graphic user interface for data management and bioinformatics analysis.
the entire information flow, from raw sequence data to hypothesis testing, can be accomplished in an efficient workspace.
to encourage more wide usage, the backend is open-source, available for extension and further development by bioinformaticians and data scientists.
