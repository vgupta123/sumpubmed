bioconductor is now not solely reserved to r users.
the bioconductor project, based on the r language, has become a reference for the numerical processing and statistical analysis of data coming from high-throughput biological assays, providing a rich selection of methods and algorithms to the research community.
computer languages can be domain-related, and in the case of multidisciplinary projects, knowledge of several languages will be needed in order to quickly implements ideas.
to demonstrate this, we have implemented such python representations for key infrastructure packages in bioconductor, letting a python programmer handle annotation data, microarray data, and next-generation sequencing data.
moreover, each computer language has relative strong points, making some languages better suited than others for a given task to be implemented.
the data structures and functions from bioconductor can be exposed to python as a regular library.
moreover, similar principles can be applied to other languages and libraries.
this allows a fully transparent and native use of bioconductor from python, without one having to know the r language and with only a small community of translators required to know both.
