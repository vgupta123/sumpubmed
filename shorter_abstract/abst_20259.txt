the proteogenomic mapping tool includes a java implementation of the aho-corasick string searching algorithm which takes as input standardized file types and rapidly searches experimentally observed peptides against a given genome translated in all  <dig> reading frames for exact matches.
high-throughput mass spectrometry  proteomics data is increasingly being used to complement traditional structural genome annotation methods.
allowing the selection of different genetic codes for different organisms allows researchers to easily customize the tool to their own research interests and is recommended for anyone working to structurally annotate genomes using ms derived proteomics data.
