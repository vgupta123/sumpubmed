the results of such procedure were used as a starting point to analyze the structure of pka pathway-encoding genes promoters, leading to identification of specific combinations of transcription factor binding sites, which are neatly consistent with available experimental data and help to clarify the relation between gene expression, transcriptional factors and oncogenes in our case study.
then, in order to identify mutation-dependent transcriptional signatures, we classified cancer cells as a function of their mutational state.
in fact we have been able to detect a strong transcriptional repression of genes encoding proteins of camp/pka pathway in cancer cells of different genetic origins.
here we sequentially apply web-based and statistical tools to a case study: the role of oncogenic activation of different signal transduction pathways in the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in the camp-pka pathway.
to this end, we first re-analyzed available genome-wide expression data for genes encoding proteins of the downstream branch of the pka pathway in normal tissues and human tumor cell lines.
in particular, integration of microarray-derived transcriptome data with other high-throughput analyses  may allow us to unravel transcriptional regulatory networks under a variety of physio-pathological situations, such as the alteration in the cross-talk between signal transduction pathways in transformed cells.
such integration, which leads to a more complete view of cellular processes, offers the opportunity to rationalize better the high amount of "omics" data freely available in several public databases.
