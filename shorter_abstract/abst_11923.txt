based upon our estimates, t. grallator and t. californicum express a large inventory of protein-coding genes.
here, as a first necessary step towards identifying the genetic basis for this trait we present the near complete transcriptomes of two species: the hawaiian happy-face spider theridion grallator and theridion californicum.
mining for pigment-associated drosophila melanogaster genes indicated the presence of all ommochrome pathway genes and most pteridine pathway genes and de analyses further indicate a possible role for the pteridine pathway in theridiid color patterning.
we mined the gene complement for pigment-pathway genes and examined differential expression  between morphs that are unpatterned  and patterned .
by deep sequencing both rna-seq and normalized cdna libraries from pooled specimens of each species we were able to assemble a comprehensive gene set for both species that we estimate to be 98-99% complete.
our comprehensive assembly illustrates the continuing value of sequencing normalized cdna libraries in addition to rna-seq in order to generate a reference transcriptome for non-model species.
a number of spider species within the family theridiidae exhibit a dramatic abdominal  color polymorphism.
