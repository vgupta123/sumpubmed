recombinant momp  expressed in e. coli cytoplasm forms inclusion bodies and rmomp extracted from inclusion bodies results in a reduced level of protection compared to the native momp in a mouse challenge model.
successful surface expression was achieved with codon harmonization, utilization of low copy number vectors and promoters with moderate strength, suitable leader sequences and optimization of cell culture conditions.
the om expressed and purified rmomp is immunogenic in mice and elicits antibodies that react to the native antigen, chlamydia elementary body .
we sought to target the recombinant expression of momp to the e. coli outer membrane .
c. trachomatis momp was functionally expressed on the surface of e. coli outer membrane.
the om expressed and purified rmomp elicits antibodies that react to the native antigen, chlamydia eb, in a mouse immunogenicity model.
prevention of infection and disease control might be achieved through vaccination; however, a safe, efficacious and cost-effective vaccine against c. trachomatis infection remains an unmet medical need.
c. trachomatis major outer membrane protein , a β-barrel integral outer membrane protein, is the most abundant antigen in the outer membrane of the bacterium and has been evaluated as a subunit vaccine candidate.
rmomp was extracted from e. coli outer membrane, purified, and characterized biophysically.
surface expression of momp could provide useful reagents for vaccine research, and the methodology could serve as a platform to produce other outer membrane proteins recombinantly.
