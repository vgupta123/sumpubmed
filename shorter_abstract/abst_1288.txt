these results are compatible with the known growth inhibitory and pro-differentiating effects of ra.
the incidence of malignant melanoma has significantly increased over the last decade.
pathway analysis of the  <dig> gene set revealed four major hubs of connectivity: cdc <dig>  chek <dig>  cdc45l and mcm <dig>
pathway analysis suggests that cdc <dig>  chek <dig>  cdc45l and mcm <dig> are key players in mediating the biological activity of ra in b <dig> melanoma cells.
in an analysis of sequential global gene expression changes during a 4â€“ <dig> h ra treatment of b <dig> mouse melanoma cells, we found that ra increased the expression of  <dig> genes and decreased the expression of  <dig> genes.
by intersecting these two gene sets, we discovered a common set of  <dig> genes whose rna levels were significantly different between b <dig> and melan-a cells and whose expression was altered by ra treatment.
within this set, ra treatment altered the expression of  <dig>  genes toward the melan-a expression level.
in addition, hierarchical clustering showed that after  <dig> h of ra treatment expression of the  <dig> genes was more closely related to the melan-a gene set than any other ra treatment time point.
conversely, it stimulated genes involved in cell-cell signaling, cell adhesion and cell differentiation/embryonic development.
some of these malignancies are susceptible to the growth inhibitory and pro-differentiating effects of all-trans-retinoic acid .
functional analysis of the  <dig> gene set indicated that ra decreased expression of mrnas that encode proteins involved in cell division/cell cycle, dna replication, recombination and repair, and transcription regulation.
our analysis of common genes in the  <dig> h ra-treatment of b <dig> melanoma cells and untreated b <dig> vs. melan-a data set show that ra "normalized" the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, dna replication, dna repair and differentiation.
