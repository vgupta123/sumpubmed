forty-five  had detectable mp dna in oropharynx.
during a community outbreak of mp infection, we compared semi-nested and real-time pcr of oropharyngeal swabs with serology for diagnosis of mp infection at different time points after disease onset.
adequate antibiotic treatment did not shorten the period of persistence.
pcr-positive individuals were followed longitudinally to assess the persistence of mp dna in throat secretions.
persistence of mp dna in the throat was common.
median time for carriage of mp dna was  <dig> weeks after disease onset .
persistent, sometimes long-term, carriage of mp dna in the throat is common following acute infection, and is not affected by antibiotic therapy.
we also studied carriage of mp among household contacts and school children.
eighteen of  <dig>  symptomatic household contacts were mp pcr positive.
two mp pcr-positive patients lacked antibody responses.
during the first three weeks after disease onset the performance of pcr was excellent and all patients but one were detected.
asymptomatic carriage of mp even during an outbreak is uncommon.
bacterial load, measured by quantitative real-time pcr declined gradually, and all followed patients eventually became pcr-negative.
mp infection was diagnosed in  <dig> of  <dig> patients with respiratory tract infection.
in contrast, only 21% of the patients with confirmed mp infection were positive by serum  <dig> during the first symptomatic week .
pcr is superior to serology for diagnosis of mp infection during the early phases of infection.
only 1/ <dig>  school children was positive by pcr.
