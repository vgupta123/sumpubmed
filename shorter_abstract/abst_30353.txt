the model  correctly predicts experimentally observed transducer demethylation  in response to attractant and repellent stimuli of wildtype cells, a chey deletion mutant, and a mutant in which the stimulated transducer species is methylation-deficient.
we provide a kinetic model for signal processing in photo- and chemotaxis in the archaeon h. salinarum suggesting an essential role of receptor cooperativity, antagonistic reversible methylation, and a chey-dependent feedback on transducer demethylation.
both, methylation and demethylation reactions are involved in sensory adaptation and are modulated by the response regulator chey.
receptor activation by light or a change in receptor occupancy by chemical stimuli results in reversible methylation of glutamate residues of the transducer proteins.
by mathematical modeling we infer the kinetic mechanisms of stimulus-induced transducer methylation and adaptation.
photo- and chemotaxis of the archaeon halobacterium salinarum is based on the control of flagellar motor switching through stimulus-specific methyl-accepting transducer proteins that relay the sensory input signal to a two-component system.
