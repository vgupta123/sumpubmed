we cloned and characterized the buffalo smoc- <dig>  including its copy number status, in-vitro protein expression, tissue & age specific transcription/translation, chromosomal mapping and localization to the basement membrane zone.
besides its anticipated role in embryogenesis, smoc- <dig> has been characterized only in a few mammalian species.
in buffalo, this single copy gene consisted of  <dig> exons and was mapped onto the acrocentric chromosome  <dig>  though this gene was found to be evolutionarily conserved, the buffalo smoc- <dig> showed conspicuous nucleotide/amino acid changes altering its secondary structure compared to that in other mammals.
further, we unveiled two transcript variants of this gene, varying in their 3'utr lengths but both coding for identical protein.
these data added to our understandings about the tissue, age and species specific functions of the smoc- <dig>  it also enabled us to demonstrate varying expression of the two transcript variants of smoc- <dig> amongst different somatic tissues/gonads and ages, in spite of their identical coding frames.
moreover, expression of smoc- <dig>  though modest during the early ages, was conspicuously enhanced after  <dig> year and remained consistently higher during the entire life span of buffalo with gradual increment in expression of variant- <dig>  immunohistochemically, smoc- <dig> was localized in the basement membrane zones and extracellular matrices of various tissues.
in silico analysis of the smoc- <dig> proposed its glycoprotein nature with a calcium dependent conformation.
we made use of the consensus sequence  of  <dig>  repeat loci to explore the buffalo transcriptome and uncovered the smoc- <dig> transcript tagged with this repeat.
secreted modular calcium binding protein- <dig>  belongs to the bm- <dig> family which has been implicated with tissue remodeling, angiogenesis and bone mineralization.
pursuance of these variants for their roles in various disease phenotypes such as hepatocellular carcinoma and angiogenesis is envisaged to establish broader biological significance of this gene.
the main objective of this study was to gain an insight into its structural and functional organization, and expressional status of smoc- <dig> in water buffalo, bubalus bubalis.
