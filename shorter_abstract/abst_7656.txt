this method first extracts the neurite signal  from a noisy image by using anisotropic filtering and automated thresholding.
then, df-tracing executes a coupled distance-field  algorithm on the extracted foreground neurite signal and reconstructs the neuron morphology automatically.
two distance-transform based “force” fields are used: one for “pressure”, which is the distance transform field of foreground pixels  to the background, and another for “thrust”, which is the distance transform field of the foreground pixels to an automatically determined seed point.
