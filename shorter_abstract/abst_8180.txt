the goal of the work reported in this communication was to understand how the integral membrane constituents of abc uptake transporters with different numbers of predicted or established transmembrane segments  evolved.
all of the  <dig> currently recognized families of abc uptake proteins except for one  were shown to be homologous using quantitative statistical methods.
these results provide structural information and plausible evolutionary pathways for the appearance of most integral membrane constituents of abc uptake transport systems.
intragenic duplication events occurred multiple times during the evolution of these porters.
in a few cases, high resolution 3-dimensional structures were available, and in these cases, their structures plus primary sequence analyses allowed us to predict evolutionary pathways of origin.
evolutionary pathways for their appearance are proposed.
