statistical analyses incorporating genotypes of  <dig> field-sampled individuals from all populations on the major islands indicate that e <dig> is most probably a hybrid between an española female tortoise and a male from the island of pinzón, likely present on española due to human transport.
giant galápagos tortoises on the island of española have been the focus of an intensive captive breeding-repatriation programme for over  <dig> years that saved the taxon from extinction.
despite this detected single contamination, it is highly noteworthy to emphasize the success of this repatriation program conducted over nearly  <dig> years and involving release of over  <dig> captive-bred tortoises that now reproduce in situ.
the incorporation of molecular genetic analysis of the program is providing guidance that will aid in monitoring the genetic integrity of this ambitious effort to restore a unique linage of a spectacular animal.
however, analysis of  <dig> samples from released individuals indicated that the bias sex ratio and large variance in reproductive success among the  <dig> breeders has severely reduced the effective population size .
