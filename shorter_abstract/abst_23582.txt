allergic airway inflammation was suppressed, which was exemplified by the reduction of leucocytes, eosinophils, il- <dig> and il- <dig> in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
currently, type i hypersensitivities are treated either with glucocorticoids, anti-histamines, or mast cell stabilizers.
these results and the excellent safety profile of beta-escin suggest a therapeutic potential of this compound for a novel treatment of allergic diseases.
in both models, the inhibitory effect of beta-escin was comparable to the benchmark dexamethasone.
in a model of the early phase of allergic reactions, the murine passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model, beta-escin inhibited the effects of mast cell activation and degranulation in the skin and dose-dependently prevented the extravasation of fluids into the tissue.
histopathological examinations further confirmed the reduced inflammation of the lung tissue.
although these drugs exert a strong anti-allergic effect, their long-term use may be problematic due to their side-effects.
it manifests as allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma or atopic dermatitis if mast cells are activated in the respective organs.
here we tested beta-escin in two mouse models to confirm this anti-allergic effect in vivo.
type i hypersensitivity is characterized by the overreaction of the immune system against otherwise innocuous substances.
we demonstrated in two independent murine models of type i hypersensitivity that beta-escin has potent anti-allergic properties.
