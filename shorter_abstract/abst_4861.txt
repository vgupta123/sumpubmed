we analyzed the sequences and structures for sets of endoglucanase proteins drawn from the carbohydrate-active enzymes  database.
strikingly, these compositional differences are specific to protein folds and enzyme families, and lead to differences in intramolecular interactions in a fold-dependent fashion.
in this study, we present a detailed comparative analysis of both thermophilic and mesophilic endoglucanases in order to gain insights into origins of thermostability.
our results demonstrate that thermophilic endoglucanases and their mesophilic counterparts differ significantly in their amino acid compositions.
