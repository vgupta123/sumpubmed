in a performance test with simulated data, our algorithm shows >90% sensitivity and >90% precision in detecting a single copy number change that contains approximately  <dig> reads for the normal sample.
these data can be used to characterize a variety of genomic features, including the dna copy number profile of a cancer genome.
we develop a method for identification of copy number alterations in a tumor genome compared to its matched control, based on application of smith-waterman algorithm to single-end sequencing data.
we propose rsw-seq as an efficient method for detecting copy number changes in the tumor genome.
we also compare the sequencing-based profiles to microarray-based results.
a robust and reliable method for screening chromosomal alterations would allow a detailed characterization of the cancer genome with unprecedented accuracy.
we further refine the algorithm to develop rsw-seq,  to identify alterations in a complex configuration, which are commonly observed in the human cancer genome.
