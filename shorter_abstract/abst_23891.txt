whey permeate is a lactose-rich effluent remaining after protein extraction from milk-resulting cheese whey, an abundant dairy waste.
the lactose to ethanol fermentation can complete whey valorization chain by decreasing dairy waste polluting potential, due to its nutritional load, and producing a biofuel from renewable source at the same time.
in this work, we aim to engineer a new bacterial biocatalyst, specific for dairy waste fermentation.
we metabolically engineered eight escherichia coli strains via a new expression plasmid with the pyruvate-to-ethanol conversion genes, and we carried out the selection of the best strain among the candidates, in terms of growth in permeate, lactose consumption and ethanol formation.
we finally showed that the selected engineered microbe  is able to efficiently ferment permeate and concentrated permeate, without nutritional supplements, in ph-controlled bioreactor.
to our knowledge, this is the first report showing efficient ethanol production from the lactose contained in whey permeate with engineered e. coli.
wild type and engineered microorganisms have been proposed as fermentation biocatalysts.
