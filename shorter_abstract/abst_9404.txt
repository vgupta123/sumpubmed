the ripening phase was further associated with up-regulation of asc recycling genes, a secondary phase of increased accumulation of asc and an increase in the asc to dha ratio.
the purpose of this study was to gain insights into asc metabolism in wine grapes  and thus ascertain whether the developmental demand for ta and oa synthesis influences asc accumulation in the berry.
immature berries synthesised asc in-situ from the primary pathway precursors d-mannose and l-galactose.
immature berries also accumulated ta in early berry development in co-ordination with up-regulation of a ta biosynthetic gene.
in contrast, ripe berries have up-regulated expression of the alternative asc biosynthetic pathway gene d-galacturonic acid reductase with only residual expression of smirnoff-wheeler asc biosynthetic pathway genes and of the ta biosynthetic gene.
despite the interest in asc accumulation in fruits, little is known about the mechanisms whereby asc concentration is regulated.
we provide evidence for developmentally differentiated up-regulation of asc biosynthetic pathways and subsequent fluctuations in asc, ta and oa accumulation.
rapid accumulation of asc and a low asc to dehydroascorbate  ratio in young berries was co-ordinated with up-regulation of three of the primary asc biosynthetic  pathway genes.
we demonstrate strong developmental regulation of asc biosynthetic, recycling and catabolic genes in grape berries.
