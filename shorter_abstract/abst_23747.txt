the results contribute to the elucidation of gene function and suggest the manipulation of wrkys as a strategy to increase fungal resistance in soybean plants.
the expression of these genes in a resistant genotype was earlier and/or stronger compared with a susceptible genotype in response to p. pachyrhizi infection.
in the present study, a genome-wide annotation of the soybean wrky family was carried out and members involved in the response to p. pachyrhizi were identified.
the present study reports a genome-wide annotation of soybean wrky family.
genes involved in the response to p. pachyrhizi infection were identified using supersage, rna-seq of microdissected lesions and microarray experiments.
when infected with p. pachyrhizi, the leaves of the silenced transgenic line showed a higher number of lesions than the wild-type plants.
the participation of some members in response to p. pachyrhizi infection was demonstrated.
soybean somatic embryos were transformed in order to overexpress or silence wrky genes.
many previous studies have shown that soybean wrky transcription factors are involved in the plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
seventy-five genes were differentially expressed during fungal infection.
the number of wrky genes already annotated in soybean genome was underrepresented.
the expression of eight wrky genes was validated by rt-qpcr.
phakopsora pachyrhizi is the causal agent of asian soybean rust, one of the most important soybean diseases.
