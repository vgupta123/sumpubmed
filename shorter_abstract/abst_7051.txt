matching genomic and transcriptomic data allows us to identify putative regulatory variants associated with changes in splicing patterns.
here we analyzed natural variation of splicing patterns in the transcriptomes of  <dig> natural strains of drosophila melanogaster with known genotypes.
variation within splicing regulatory sequences often leads to differences in gene models among individuals within a species.
remarkably, allele-specific splicing changes often lead to qualitative changes in gene models, yielding many isoforms not previously annotated.
overall, the sets of gene models appear to be flexible within d. melanogaster populations.

the majority of changes can be explained by mutations in splice sites.
we identified dozens of genotype-specific splicing patterns associated with putative cis-splicing quantitative trait loci .
the observed variation in splicing patterns are predicted to have limited effects on the encoded protein sequences.
