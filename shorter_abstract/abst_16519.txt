on three consecutive days two pcr reaction mixes were used on each of the three amplification platforms – the lightcycler®, abi prism®  <dig> and rotor gene 3000™.
the wide variety of real-time amplification platforms currently available has determined that standardisation of dna measurements is a fundamental aspect involved in the comparability of results.
the results of the statistical analyses indicated that the platform with the most precise repeatability was the abi prism®  <dig> when coupled with the faststart pcr reaction mix.
an anova approach identified the factors that significantly affected the results, in descending order of magnitude, as: plasmid copy number, platform, pcr reaction mix and day .
in order to deliver useful, informative genetic tests, standardisation of real-time pcr detection platforms to provide repeatable, reliable results is warranted.
statistical analysis of the data arising from three different real-time platforms was conducted in order to assess inter-platform repeatability.
it was also found that there was no obvious relationship between plasmid copy number and repeatability.
