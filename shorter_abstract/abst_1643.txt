as the first non-avian reptilian genome sequenced, a. carolinesis is also a prime reptilian model for comparison with other vertebrate genomes.
here we provide an annotation of the a. carolinensis genome based on de novo assembly of deep transcriptomes of  <dig> adult and embryonic tissues.
this revised annotation also provides an atlas of gene expression specific to adult and embryonic tissues.
a second generation annotation based on tissue-specific transcriptomes would provide a valuable resource for molecular studies.
gaps in genome sequence from the current a. carolinensis build  are highlighted by our identification of  <dig>  unmapped transcripts, representing  <dig>  orthologues, with less than 70% genomic coverage.
incorporation of tissue-specific transcriptome sequence into the a. carolinensis genome annotation has markedly improved its utility for comparative and functional studies.
the public databases of ensembl and ncbi have provided a first generation gene annotation of the anole genome that relies primarily on sequence conservation with related species.
