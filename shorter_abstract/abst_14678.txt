furthermore, we located two tomato candidate genes using a marker linked to the high regeneration gene: rg- <dig>  and lesk <dig>  which encodes a serine/threonine kinase and was proposed as a marker for regeneration competence.
two linkage maps were developed and six qtls were identified on five chromosomes  in the bc <dig> population by means of the interval mapping and restricted multiple qtl mapping methods.
we have also located two candidate genes, discovering a putative allele of the high regeneration gene rg- <dig> in the qtl on chromosome  <dig>  the identified qtls could represent a significant step toward the understanding of this process and the identification of other related candidate genes.
it will also most likely facilitate the development of molecular markers for use in gene isolation.
as a result, we located a putative allele of rg- <dig> in the qtl detected on chromosome  <dig> that we named rg- <dig>  lesk <dig>  which is also situated on chromosome  <dig>  is outside rg- <dig>  in a preliminary exploration of the detected qtl peaks, we found several genes that may be related to regeneration.
despite the various studies that have been carried out on regeneration genetics, little is known about the key genes involved in this process.
the phenotypic assay indicated dominance for bud induction and additive effects for both the percentage of explants with shoots and the number of regenerated shoots per explant.
these qtls came from s. pennellii, with the exception of the minor qtl located on chromosome  <dig>  which was provided by cv.
we developed two mapping populations  derived from a previously selected tomato cultivar  with low regeneration ability and a high regeneration accession of the wild species solanum pennellii .
in this study we have identified new qtls related to the complex process of regeneration from tissue culture.
