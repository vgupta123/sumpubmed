to investigate cngc trafficking and localization, we have measured atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> expression in roots and leaves, analyzed atcngc10-gfp fusions transiently expressed in protoplasts, and conducted immunofluorescence labeling of protoplasts and immunoelectron microscopic analysis of high pressure frozen leaves and roots.
immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that atcngc <dig> was associated with the plasma membrane of mesophyll, palisade parenchyma and epidermal cells of leaves, and the meristem, columella and cap cells of roots.
immunofluorescence microscopy with affinity purified cngc-specific antisera indicated that atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> are present in the plasma membrane of protoplasts.
the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels  maintain cation homeostasis essential for a wide range of physiological processes in plant cells.
the atcngc10-egfp fusion was targeted to the plasma membrane in leaf protoplasts, and lightly labeled several intracellular structures.
atcngc <dig> and atcngc <dig> are plasma membrane proteins.
we postulate that atcngc <dig> traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum via the golgi apparatus and associated vesicles to the plasma membrane.
however, the precise subcellular locations and trafficking of these membrane proteins are poorly understood.
this is further complicated by a general deficiency of information about targeting pathways of membrane proteins in plants.
the presence of the cation channel, atcngc <dig>  in root cap meristem cells, cell plate, and gravity-sensing columella cells, combined with the previously reported antisense phenotypes of decreased gravitropic and cell enlargement responses, suggest roles of atcngc <dig> in modulating cation balance required for root gravitropism, cell division and growth.
patch clamp assays of an atcngc10-gfp fusion expressed in hek <dig> cells measured significant cation currents.
