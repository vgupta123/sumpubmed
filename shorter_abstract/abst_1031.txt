designing an active saccharifying enzyme system with synergy among their components is considered a promising approach.
in this study, a lignocellulose-degrading enzyme system of chaetomium globosum bcc <dig>  was characterized for its activity and proteomic profiles, and synergism with accessory enzymes.
proteomics analysis by lc/ms/ms revealed a complex enzyme system composed of core cellulases and accessory hydrolytic/non-hydrolytic enzymes attacking plant biopolymers.
a synergistic enzyme system comprising the cg-cel, a β-glucosidase  and a hemicellulase accellerase® xy was optimized on saccharification of alkaline-pretreated rice straw by a mixture design approach.
the work showed an approach for developing an active synergistic enzyme system based on the newly characterized c. globosum for lignocellulose saccharification and modification in bio-industries.
the highest cellulase productivity of  <dig>  fpu/ml was found for cg-cel under the optimized submerged fermentation conditions on 1%  epfb , 2% microcrystalline cellulose  and 1% soybean meal  at  <dig> °c, ph  <dig>  for  <dig> d. cg-cel worked optimally at 50– <dig> °c in an acidic ph range.
applying a full cubic model, the optimal ratio of ternary enzyme mixture containing cg-cel: novozyme® 188: accellerase® xy of  <dig> : <dig> : <dig>  showed synergistic enhancement on reducing sugar yield with a glucose releasing efficiency of  <dig>  mg/fpu, equivalent to a  <dig>  times compared with that from cg-cel alone.
efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials to sugars for conversion to biofuels and chemicals is a key step in biorefinery.
