here, we present data from gene expression analyses involving the bioeroding sponge cliona varians that harbors clade g symbiodinium.
we characterized a set of  <dig> genes drawn from a pool of differentially expressed genes in “reinfected” tissue compared to “aposymbiotic” tissue via ssh.
we allowed aposymbiotic sponge tissue to become re-populated by natural pools of symbiodinium in shallow water flats in the florida keys, and we analyzed gene expression profiles for two genes found to be increased in expression in “reinfected” tissue in both the transcriptome and via ssh.
we argue that sponges offer particularly useful characteristics for discerning essential dimensions of the symbiodinium niche.
to fully and broadly understand the conditions that permit symbiodinium to procure intracellular residency, we must explore hosts from different taxa to help uncover universal cellular and genetic strategies for invading and persisting in host cells.
transcriptomic profiles were different when reinfected tissue was compared to normal and aposymbiotic tissue.
this work provides a sponge transcriptome, and a database of putative genes and genetic pathways that may be involved in symbiodinium interactions.
the relative patterns of gene expression observed in these experiments will need to be evaluated on a gene-by-gene basis in controlled and natural re-infection experiments.
patterns of differential gene expression from distinct symbiont states  of the sponge host are presented based on two comparative approaches ).
these experiments highlighted the experimental tractability of c. varians to explore with precision the genetic events that occur upon establishment of the symbiosis.
