this study examined the molecular mechanisms by which src activates erk cascade through protein phosphatases following cerebral ischemia.
our previous data indicates that src can increase erk activity through raf kinase in response to ischemic stimuli.
the regulation of protein phosphorylation requires a balance in the activity of protein kinases and protein phosphatases.
in addition, the pp2a inhibitor, cantharidin, led to an up-regulation of erk activity and was able to counteract src inhibition during ischemia.
src induces up-regulation of erk activity and its target transcription factors, creb and erα, through attenuation of pp2a activity.
su <dig>  a src inhibitor, up-regulates pp2a activity, resulting in a significant decreased activity in erk and its targets, creb and erα.
ischemia-induced src activation is followed by phosphorylation of pp2a at tyr <dig> leading to its inhibition in the rat hippocampus.
