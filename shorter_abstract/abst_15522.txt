the results of the ehas with the isolate st showed differences in the percentage of hatching between the highest concentration  and the control well ; however, these differences were not confirmed under field conditions with the strain fst.
the ovicidal effect of tcbz in f. hepatica eggs from bile was shown using a commercial formulation diluted in dmso with a minimum concentration of  <dig> μg/ml.
f. hepatica eggs were recovered from bile and faeces of infected animals by isolates with different grade of anthelmintic resistance to tcbz: i) a resistant isolate ; ii) a susceptible isolate ; iii) naturally infected sheep by a susceptible field strain .
in the present study, the detection of anthelmintic resistance to triclabendazole  in sheep infected by fasciola hepatica was studied using an egg hatch assay .

the cleaning of eggs recovered from faeces is an important issue that should be reviewed and standardized before comparing results between susceptible and resistant isolates in this kind of eha.
since the range of hatching varied between isolates, we calculated the ratio of the results of each concentration to its control value confirming the higher hatching in rt than in st.
however, in eggs recovered from faeces the results are not conclusive.
