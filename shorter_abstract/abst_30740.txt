we used suppression subtractive hybridization  cdna library construction and characterization to identify transcripts that were dysregulated by heat-shock in liver, skeletal muscle and head kidney of atlantic cod.
toll-like receptor  <dig>  transcript, found in the liver reverse ssh library, was shown by qpcr to be significantly down-regulated in the head kidney after heat-shock.
chaperones are an important part of the cellular response to stress, and genes identified in this work may play important roles in resistance to thermal-stress.
qpcr analysis of hsp90Î± and hsp70- <dig>  mrna expression showed significant up-regulation in all three tissues studied.
several cdnas encoding putative chaperones belonging to the heat-shock protein  family were found in these libraries, and "protein folding" was among the gene ontology  terms with the highest proportion in the libraries.
daily and seasonal changes in temperature are challenges that fish within aquaculture settings cannot completely avoid, and are known to elicit complex organismal and cellular stress responses.
