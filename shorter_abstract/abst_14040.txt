for signature mpss data, high-range tag-position genes tend to have a flatter relationship between tag-position and measured abundance.
tag-position bias should be taken into consideration when measuring mrna transcript abundance using mpss technology, both in classic and signature mpss methods.
we quantify the effect of tag-position bias in classic and signature mpss technology using published data from arabidopsis, rice and human.
compared with the effects of mrna length and number of exons, tag-position bias seems to be more significant in arabadopsis.
the tag-position bias is reflected both in the measured abundance of genes with a significant tag count and in the proportion of unexpressed genes identified.
thus, our results confirm that the signature mpss method fixes a substantial problem with the classic mpss method.
for classic mpss data, genes with tag-position in the middle-range have highest measured abundance on average while genes with tag-position in the high-range, far from the 3' end, show a significant decrease.
massively parallel signature sequencing  technology was recently developed as a high-throughput technology for measuring the concentration of mrna transcripts in a sample.
we find that there exist different and significant biases in both classic and signature mpss data.
for both classic and signature mpss data there is a positive correlation between measured abundance and tag-position for low-range tag-position genes.
