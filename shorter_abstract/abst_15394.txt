strain sd <dig> expressing cassettes with different sivsm inserts, have potential utility as an effective antigen display system for immunogen testing in vivo and for initial epitope assessments in vitro.
humoral responses to r-gvtat, rev or nef <dig> elicited in vivo, associated changes in selected cell cytokine production following r-gv internalization, and the capacity of j774a.
the in vivo studies involving r-gv immunizations and in vitro studies of r-gv uptake by j774a.
recombinant gas vesicles  from halobacterium sp.
these features support the cost effective generation of vaccine components, and provide a simple, self-adjuvanting system for assessing immune visibility of and specific responses to individual pathogen peptides.
<dig> macrophages demonstrated:  tests for antibody isotypes in immunized mice sera showed activation and re-stimulation of memory b cells,  during long term immune response to the epitopes, primarily the igg <dig> isotype was produced,  in vitro, macrophage degradation of r-gv containing different sivsm inserts occurred over a period of days resulting in an inherent slow breakdown and degradation of the sivsm peptide inserts,  vesicle specific gvpc, a larger protein, degraded more slowly than the recombinant peptide inserts and  in vitro uptake and degradation of the r-gv populations tested was associated with sivsm insert specific patterns for cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>
they can clearly: display various exogenous peptides, be intracellularly degraded in vitro over a period of days, affect cell cytokine levels, and retain their self-adjuvanting capacity irrespective of the specific peptide expressed within the gvpc protein.
