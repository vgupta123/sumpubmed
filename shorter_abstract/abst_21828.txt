they are the simplest members of the multi-copper oxidases and contain at least two types of copper centres; a mononuclear t <dig> and a trinuclear that includes two t <dig> and one t <dig> copper ions.
substrate oxidation takes place at the mononuclear centre whereas reduction of oxygen to water occurs at the trinuclear centre.
in this study, the cota laccase from bacillus subtilis was used as a model to understand the mechanisms taking place at the molecular level, with a focus in the trinuclear centre.
these results present evidence that glu  <dig> is the only proton-active group in the vicinity of the trinuclear centre.
these results are compared with other data available for these enzymes, highlighting similarities and differences within laccases and multicopper oxidases.
the former has a dioxygen moiety between the t <dig> coppers, while the latter has a monoatomic oxygen, here interpreted as a hydroxyl ion.
