this study describes the physiological, morphological and genome-wide transcriptional changes caused by prolonged carbon starvation during submerged batch cultivation of the filamentous fungus aspergillus niger.
filamentous fungi are confronted with changes and limitations of their carbon source during growth in their natural habitats and during industrial applications.
enrichment analysis of gene ontology, pfam domain and kegg pathway annotations uncovered autophagy and asexual reproduction as major global transcriptional trends.
to survive life-threatening starvation conditions, carbon from endogenous resources becomes mobilized to fuel maintenance and self-propagation.
this study is the first system-wide analysis of the carbon starvation response in a filamentous fungus.
the knowledge deduced is important for the development of optimized industrial production processes.
compared to the exponential growth transcriptome, about 50%  of all genes displayed differential gene expression during at least one of the starvation time points.
the affymetrix genechip platform was used to establish genome-wide transcriptional profiles for three selected time points during prolonged carbon starvation.
changes in hyphal growth and morphology were analyzed at distinct cultivation phases using automated image analysis.
