the publication of the first draft chicken sequence assembly became available in  <dig> and was updated in  <dig>  however, this does not constitute a definitive and complete sequence of the chicken genome, since the microchromosomes are notably under-represented.
in an effort to develop maps for the microchromosomes absent from the chicken genome assembly, we developed radiation hybrid  and genetic maps with markers isolated from sequence currently assigned to "chromosome unknown" .
the high-resolution rh framework map obtained here covers the entire chicken chromosome  <dig> and reveals the existence of a high number of intrachromosomal rearrangements when compared to the human genome.
the chrun is composed of sequence contigs not assigned to named chromosomes.
the strategy used here for the characterization of gga <dig> could be used to improve knowledge on the other uncharacterized small, yet gene-rich microchromosomes.
