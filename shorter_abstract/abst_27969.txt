efficient gene expression involves a trade-off between  premature termination of protein synthesis; and  readthrough, where the ribosome fails to dissociate at the terminal stop.
sense codons that are similar in sequence to stop codons are more susceptible to nonsense mutation, and are also likely to be more susceptible to transcriptional or translational errors causing premature termination.
we construct a simple mathematical model based on the relative likelihoods of premature termination and readthrough.
when the code has more stop codons, premature termination is relatively more likely, particularly for longer genes.
although genetic codes are highly constrained, stop codon number appears to be their most volatile feature.
we suggest that the differing trade-offs presented by alternative genetic codes may result in differences in genome structure.
comparative analysis of taxa with a range of stop codon numbers suggests that genomes whose code includes more stop codons have shorter coding sequences.
our results depend strongly on the number of stop codons in the genetic code.
when readthrough occurs, the resultant protein has a tail of amino acid residues incorrectly added to the c-terminus.
we therefore expect this trade-off to be influenced by the number of stop codons in the genetic code.
this could help explain the puzzling overrepresentation of stop codons in the canonical genetic code and most variants.
