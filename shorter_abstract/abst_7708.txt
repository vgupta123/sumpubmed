by integrating stochastic simulation with thermodynamic prediction tools for dna hybridization, one may robustly and rapidly characterize of the selectivity of a proposed microarray design at the probe and "system" levels.
since hybridization is a chemical process, it may be modeled at a population-level using a combination of material balance equations and thermodynamics.
cross-hybridization between microarray probes and non-target ssdna has been implicated as a primary factor in sensitivity and selectivity loss.
however, the hybridization reaction network may be exceptionally large for commercial arrays, which often possess at least one reporter per transcript.
