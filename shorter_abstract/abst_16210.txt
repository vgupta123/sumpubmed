we have developed an analysis tool called hypothesis free clinical cloning  to search for genome-wide epistasis in a case-control design.
the difficulty in elucidating the genetic basis of complex diseases roots in the many factors that can affect the development of a disease.
with the current availability of genetic studies with large numbers of individuals and genetic markers, hfcc can have a great impact in the identification of epistatic effects that escape the standard single-locus association analyses.
hfcc combines a relatively fast computing algorithm for genome-wide epistasis detection, with the flexibility to test a variety of different epistatic models in multi-locus combinations.
hfcc has good power to detect multi-locus interactions simulated under a variety of genetic models and noise conditions.
most importantly, hfcc can accomplish exhaustive genome-wide epistasis search with large datasets as demonstrated with a  <dig>  snp set typed on a cohort of parkinson's disease patients and controls.
