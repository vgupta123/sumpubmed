we have thus analyzed additional purple bacteria for the shp gene and examined the genetic context to obtain new insights into the operon, its distribution, and possible function.
the three distinct sensors suggest at least as many separate functional roles for shp.
furthermore, the two companion cytochromes along with shp are likely to function as an electron transfer pathway that results in the reduction of shp by quinol and formation of the oxygen complex, which may function as an oxygenase.
sphaeroides heme protein  was discovered in the purple photosynthetic bacterium, rhodobacter sphaeroides, and is the only known c-type heme protein that binds oxygen.
although initially not believed to be widespread among the photosynthetic bacteria, the gene has now been found in more than  <dig> species of proteobacteria and generally appears to be regulated.
sphaeroides and in  <dig> out of  <dig> purple photosynthetic bacterial species in the family rhodobacteraceae.
shp is not as rare as generally believed and has a role to play in the photosynthetic bacteria.
two of the sensors are not well characterized, but the third is homologous to the qsec quorum sensor, which is present in a number of pathogens and typically appears to regulate genes involved in virulence.
sphaeroides is exceptional in not having regulatory genes associated with the operon.
we found a remarkable similarity within the family including the lack of regulatory genes.
