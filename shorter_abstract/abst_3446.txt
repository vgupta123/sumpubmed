previous research showed that the orange scallops with orange shell and muscle had a significantly higher carotenoid content than the brown ones with brown shell and white muscle.
especially, one class b scavenge receptor termed srb-like- <dig> was discovered to express only in orange scallops and absent in brown ones, suggesting a significant association with high carotenoid content.
transcriptome analysis of noble scallop reveals a novel scavenger receptor significantly associated with orange scallop rich in carotenoid content.
our findings pave the way for further functional elucidation of this gene and molecular basis of carotenoid deposition in orange scallop.
there is currently a need to identify candidate genes associated with carotenoid-based coloration.
down-regulation of srb-like- <dig> mrna by rna interference remarkably decreased blood carotenoid, providing compelling evidence that srb-like- <dig> is an ideal candidate gene controlling carotenoid deposition and determining orange coloration.
of the  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig> % isotigs and  <dig> % singletons were annotated.
in the present study,  <dig> gs-flx sequencing of noble scallop transcriptome yielded  <dig> , <dig> clean sequence reads, which were assembled into  <dig>  isotigs, leaving  <dig>  reads as the singletons.
