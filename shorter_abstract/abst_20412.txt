the present study evaluates the impact of the gibraltar region in reducing gene flow between populations from north-western africa and south-western europe, by comparing formally various genetic loci.
we show that the genetic patterns observed today in the region of the strait of gibraltar may reflect an ancient population genetic structure which has not been completely erased by more recent events such as neolithic migrations.
so far, genetic data were inconclusive about the fact that this strait constitutes a barrier to gene flow, as previous results were highly variable depending on the genetic locus studied.
we show that gene flow across the strait of gibraltar occurred at relatively high rates since pre-neolithic times and that natural selection and sex-bias migrations distorted the demographic signal at some specific loci of our genome.
then, we use an original simulation approach in order to infer the most probable evolutionary scenario for the settlement of the area, taking into account the effects of both demography and natural selection at some loci.
moreover, the differences observed among the loci  across the strait suggest specific evolutionary histories like sex-mediated migration and natural selection.
selection at this marker thus appears strong enough to leave a signature not only at the dna level, but also at the population level where drift and migration processes were certainly relevant.
first, we compute several statistics of population differentiation.
