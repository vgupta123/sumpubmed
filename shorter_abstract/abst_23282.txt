for ptm extraction, precision varies from 57% to 94%, and recall from 75% to 95%, according to the type of modification.
to help curators cope with this growing body of information we have developed a system which extracts information from the scientific literature for the most frequently annotated ptms in uniprotkb.
the procedure was used to track new publications on ptms and to recover potential supporting evidence for phosphorylation sites annotated based on the results of large scale proteomics experiments.
the annotation of protein post-translational modifications  is an important task of uniprotkb curators and, with continuing improvements in experimental methodology, an ever greater number of articles are being published on this topic.
the information retrieval and extraction method we have developed in this study forms the basis of a simple tool for the manual curation of protein post-translational modifications in uniprotkb/swiss-prot.
