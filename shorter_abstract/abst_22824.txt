one new matrix shows significant improvement over the base matrix; the other does not.
one of the extended quantitative matrices showed significant improvement in prediction over the original nine residue matrix and over the other extended matrix.
the new matrices differ in the sequence of the peptide library.
proline in the sequence of the peptide library of the better performing matrix presumably stabilizes the peptide conformation through neighbour interactions.
quantitative matrices extend the motif idea to include the contribution of non-anchor peptide residues.
such interactions may influence epitope prediction in this test of quantitative matrices.
this sequence pattern can be used to screen large sequences for potential epitopes.
this way allele-specific favoured residues are able to anchor into pockets in the binding groove leaving other peptide side chains exposed for recognition by t cells.
crystallographic structures show that the bound peptide in class ii major histocompatibility complex adopts a near uniform polyproline ii-like conformation.
