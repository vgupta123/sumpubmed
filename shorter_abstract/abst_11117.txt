cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells  yielded lower inter-lab c.v.'s than whole blood.
cryopreserved pbmc may yield slightly more consistent results than shipped whole blood.
three sample types  were shipped to various sites, where ics assays using cytomegalovirus  pp <dig> peptide mix or control antigens were performed in parallel in 96-well plates.
ics assays can be performed by multiple laboratories using a common protocol with good inter-laboratory precision, which improves as the frequency of responding cells increases.
standardization of ics among laboratories performing vaccine studies would provide a common platform by which to compare the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates across multiple international organizations conducting clinical trials.
as such, a study was carried out among several laboratories involved in hiv clinical trials, to define the inter-lab precision of ics using various sample types, and using a common protocol for each experiment .
for one experiment, antigens and antibody cocktails were lyophilised into 96-well plates to simplify and standardize the assay setup.
results  were determined by each site.
raw data were also sent to a central site for batch analysis with a dynamic gating template.
cytokine flow cytometry  or intracellular cytokine staining  can quantitate antigen-specific t cell responses in settings such as experimental vaccination.
mean inter-laboratory coefficient of variation  ranged from 17–44% depending upon the sample type and analysis method.
centralized analysis  reduced the inter-lab c.v. by 5–20%, depending upon the experiment.
the inter-lab c.v. was lowest  for samples with a mean of > <dig> % ifnγ + t cells, and highest  for samples with a mean of < <dig> % ifnγ + cells.
