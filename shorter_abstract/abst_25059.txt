these differences are likely to arise from the distinct dynamics of central structural nodes.
functional networks reflect the underlying structural networks on slow time scales, but significantly less so on faster time scales.
the noisy dynamics of these hubs enable them to persist despite ongoing rewiring and despite their comparative absence in functional networks.
we find time scale dependent differences between structural and functional networks.
our results outline a theoretical mechanism by which brain dynamics may facilitate neuroanatomical self-organization.
we provide further biophysical justification for this model and quantitatively characterize the relationship between structure, function and dynamics that accompanies the ensuing self-organization.
in spite of ordered functional topology, structural networks remain robustly interconnected – and therefore small-world – due to the presence of central, inter-modular hub nodes.
to this end, we simulate spontaneous brain dynamics on structural connectivity networks, using coupled nonlinear maps.
on slow time scales structural connectivity is gradually adjusted towards the resulting functional patterns via an unsupervised, activity-dependent rewiring rule.
we show that coupled chaotic dynamics generate ordered and modular functional patterns, even on a random underlying structural connectivity.
consequently, structural connectivity becomes more modular as it rewires towards these functional patterns.
