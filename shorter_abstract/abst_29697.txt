this approach provides chronological limits for its arrival to africa, followed by its spreads there according to climatic fluctuations, and its secondary prehistoric and historic migrations out of africa colonizing europe, the canary islands and the american continent.
the u <dig> expansions and contractions inside africa faithfully reflect the climatic fluctuations that occurred in this continent affecting also the canary islands.
using  <dig> complete sequences we have refined the u <dig> phylogeny, and improved the phylogeographic information by the analysis of  <dig> partial sequences.
in turn, the european colonization brought different u <dig> lineages throughout the american continent leaving the specific sign of the colonizers origin.
human mitochondrial dna haplogroup u <dig> has been considered as a molecular signal of a paleolithic return to north africa of modern humans from southwestern asia.
