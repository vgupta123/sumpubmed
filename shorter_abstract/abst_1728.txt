in this study, a ligation-detection-reaction  based microarray method was adapted for species-level detection of compost microbes characteristic of each stage of the composting process.
this study demonstrates that the ldr microarray method is capable of sensitive and accurate species-level detection from a complex microbial community.
clone libraries were constructed from eight compost samples.
the method can detect key species from compost samples, making it a basis for a tool for compost process monitoring in industrial facilities.
the method was applied to samples from nordic composting facilities after testing and optimisation with fungal pure cultures and environmental clones.
probes targeted for fungi were able to detect  <dig>  fmol of target ribosomal pcr product in an artificial reaction mixture containing  <dig> ng competing fungal ribosomal internal transcribed spacer  area or herring sperm dna.
the ldr microarray results were in concordance with the clone library sequencing results.
the detection level was therefore approximately  <dig> % of total dna.
the composting process is dependent on aerobic microbial activity and proceeds through a succession of different phases each dominated by certain microorganisms.
