horses and humans share a natural proclivity for athletic performance.
these findings suggest that the system that controls the inflammatory response in horses is better adapted to respond to exercise than that in humans.
in humans, il- <dig> mrna levels in pbmcs determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were significantly higher in highly trained subjects, whereas il-6r expression did not differ among groups.
up-regulation of il-6r expression in pbmcs in horses could reflect a mechanism that maintains an adequate anti-inflammatory environment at rest through ubiquitous production of anti-inflammatory cytokines throughout the body.
in both species, interleukin- <dig>  plays a major role in regulating the inflammatory process induced during exercise as part of an integrated metabolic regulatory network.
in this respect, horses can be considered a reference species in studies designed to optimize physical training and disease prevention.
