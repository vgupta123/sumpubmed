the nfn with a lower spectral edge closest to the test tone mostly decreased the n1m amplitude.
in the present study, we investigated the effect of proceeding notch-filtered noises  with different frequency spectra on a following test tone using meg.
the decrement of the n1m component after exposure to the nfns could be explained partly in terms of lateral inhibition.
we interpret this effect of asymmetric lateral inhibition in the auditory system as an important contribution to reduce the asymmetric neural activity profiles originating from the cochlea.
however the possible inhibitory interactions between different neuronal populations remains poorly understood.
three-second exposure to the nfns resulted in significantly different n1m responses to a  <dig> hz test tone presented  <dig> ms after the offset of the nfns.
the results demonstrated that the amplitude of the n1m was more effectively influenced by inhibitory lateral connections originating from neurons corresponding to lower rather than higher frequencies.
