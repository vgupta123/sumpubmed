on a data set of  <dig> gap and pair-rule genes containing  <dig> known crms, predictions made by hexdiff had a higher correlation with the known crms than several existing crm prediction algorithms: ahab, cluster buster, mscan, mcast, and lwf.
cis-regulatory modules  are short stretches of dna that help regulate gene expression in higher eukaryotes.
after combining the results of the different algorithms,  <dig> putative crms were identified and are strong candidates for future study.
we present a simple, efficient method  based only on hexamer frequencies of known crms and non-crm sequence to predict novel crms in regulatory systems.
the hexamers used by hexdiff to distinguish between crms and non-crm sequence were also analyzed and were shown to be enriched in regulatory elements.
