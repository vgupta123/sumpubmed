we then used recombinant versions of two odorant-binding proteins to identify the classes of ligands that these proteins might be helping bees detect.
by correlating the expression patterns of individual proteins with hb scores, we identified seven putative biomarkers of hb that survived stringent control for multiple hypothesis testing.
the western honey bee  is a critical component of human agriculture through its pollination activities.
after confirming that hb could be selectively bred for, we correlated measurements of this behavior with protein expression over a period of three years, at two geographically distinct sites, using several hundred bee colonies.
additionally, we do not yet fully understand the mechanisms behind social immunity.
our data suggest that neurosensory detection of odors emitted by dead or diseased larvae is the likely mechanism behind a complex and important social immunity behavior that allows bees to co-exist with pathogens.
while such treatments are likely to still be needed, an alternate management strategy is to identify and select bees with heritable traits that allow them to resist mites and diseases.
here we have set out to discover the molecular mechanism behind hygienic behavior , a trait known to confer disease resistance in bees.
