a bayesian analysis with beast produced a similar result.
however, there was little variation between these species clusters, resulting in unresolved species relationships and a star-like general nj topology.
radiation in some plant groups has occurred on islands and due to the characteristic rapid pace of phenotypic evolution, standard molecular markers often provide insufficient variation for phylogenetic reconstruction.
a neighbour-joining  dendrogram based on dice distances shows all species except d. minimifolia, d. parviflora and d. vieillardii to form unique clusters of genetically similar accessions.
overall, this process resulted in an opportunistic pattern of phenotypic diversification.
to resolve relationships within a clade of  <dig> closely related new caledonian diospyros species and evaluate species boundaries we analysed genome-wide dna variation via amplified fragment length polymorphisms .
