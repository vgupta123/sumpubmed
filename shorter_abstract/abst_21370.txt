methicillin-resistance was observed in 60% of the isolates, 90% of which belonged to the main clonal complexes cc <dig>  cc <dig> and cc <dig>  in  <dig> patients, methicillin-resistance of s. aureus isolates was not associated with the meca gene: for four patients, it was due to overproduction of Î²-lactamase, leading to bor-sa  isolates, while a strain showing probably a new modified penicillin-binding capacity  was observed from one patient.
systematic genotyping of s. aureus isolates recovered from sputum of cf children allows a thorough analysis of the strains responsible for sporadic as well as chronic colonization and the follow up of their evolution over time.
on six occasions, s. aureus isolates with the same genotype were shared by  <dig> different patients and they belonged to one of the four main clusters.
mssa as well as mrsa, bor-sa and mod-sa isolates can persist over several years, despite antibiotic treatments.
in  <dig> patients, strains from two to four different ccs were recovered over time.
staphylococcus aureus infection in patients with cystic fibrosis  is frequent and may be due to colonization by a few pathogenic lineages.
