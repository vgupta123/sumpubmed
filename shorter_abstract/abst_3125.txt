in silico analysis together with proteinase k and immunoflorescence data suggest that these proteins might be surface exposed.
moreover, the recombinant proteins partially inhibited leptospiral adherence to immobilized laminin and plg.
we believe that these multifunctional proteins have the potential to participate in the interaction of leptospires to hosts by mediating adhesion and by helping the bacteria to escape the immune system and to overcome tissue barriers.
this study examined the interaction of two putative leptospiral proteins with laminin, collagen type i, collagen type iv, cellular fibronectin, plasma fibronectin, plg, factor h and c4bp.
we show that two leptospiral proteins encoded by lic <dig> and lic <dig> genes interact with laminin in a dose - dependent and saturable mode, with dissociation equilibrium constants  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively.
leptospires were shown to express surface proteins that interact with the extracellular matrix  and to plasminogen .
pathogenic leptospires have the ability to survive and disseminate to multiple organs after penetrating the host.
leptospirosis is considered a re-emerging infectious disease caused by pathogenic spirochaetes of the genus leptospira.
