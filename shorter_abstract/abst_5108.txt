the de genes in auxin and cytokinin pathways suggest that the vcddf1-ox has also altered plant tolerance to drought and high salinity.
constitutive expression of the cbf/dreb <dig> for increasing freezing tolerance in woody plants is often associated with other phenotypic changes including dwarf plant and delayed flowering.
the overexpression of vcddf <dig> or its orthologues is a new approach to increase freezing tolerance of deciduous woody plant species with no obvious effect on plant size and plant flowering time.
the unchanged plant size, dormancy and flowering were due to the minimal effect of the vcddf1-ox on the expression of della proteins, flowering pathway genes, and the other phytohormone genes related to plant growth and development.
comparative transcriptome analysis of transgenic ‘legacy-vcddf1-ox’ plants containing an overexpressed vcddf <dig> with non-transgenic highbush blueberry ‘legacy’ plants revealed the vcddf1-ox derived differentially expressed  genes and transcripts in the pathways of cold-response, plant flowering, della proteins, and plant phytohormones.
the vcddf1-ox resulted in enhanced freezing tolerance in tetraploid blueberry plants and did not result in significant changes in plant size, chilling requirement, and flowering time.
to date, the ddf <dig> orthologues have not been studied in woody plants.
these phenotypic changes have been observed when arabidopsis dwarf and delayed flowering  <dig>  was overexpressed in a. thaliana plants.
the increase in freezing tolerance was associated to the expression of cold-regulated genes  and the ethylene pathway genes.
