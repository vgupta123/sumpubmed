the results revealed that precise phylogenetic analysis might provide evidence for genetic variation and movement of circulating orfv strains in northeast china.
from the recent outbreak of a sheep herd in nongan, northeast of china, the novel orf virus  strain na1/ <dig> was successfully isolated.
non-metric multidimensional scaling  was performed to analyze the nucleotide similarities between different orfv strains.
western blot analysis indicated that the na1/ <dig> strain cross reacts with monoclonal antibody a <dig> and infected sheep orfv antiserum.
orf is a zoonotic and epitheliotrophic contagious disease that mainly affects sheep, goats, wild ruminants, and humans with a worldwide distribution.
in addition, nmds analysis showed that geographic isolation and animal host are likely major factors resulting in genetic differences between orfv strains.
to date, there is little information on the characterization of orfv strains that are endemic in mainland china.
in addition, the relationship between the severity of disease and the molecular profile of orfv strains has not been fully elucidated.
phylogenetic analysis based on orfv  <dig> nucleotide sequences showed that the na1/11strain was closely related to xinjiang and gansu strains.
