this response includes an important role for the mycorrhizal symbiosis in the utilization of an n patch.
nitrogen metabolism and cell growth genes were induced by the high ammonium , while stress response genes were repressed.
the plant roots and shoots exhibited increased levels of 15n over time, indicating a sustained response to the enriched environment.
nitrogen , the primary limiting factor for plant growth and yield in agriculture, has a patchy distribution in soils due to fertilizer application or decomposing organic matter.
the complex regulation of specific transporters following the ammonium pulse reflects a simultaneous and synergistic response to rapidly changing concentrations of both forms of inorganic n in the soil patch.
transcriptional analysis of the phosphate transporters demonstrates cross-talk between n and phosphate uptake pathways and suggests that roots increase phosphate uptake via the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in response to n.
the ammonium treatments resulted in significantly higher concentrations of both ammonium and nitrate in the patch soil.
studies in solution culture over-simplify the complex soil environment where microbial competition and spatial and temporal heterogeneity challenge roots' ability to acquire adequate amounts of nutrients required for plant growth.
