also, we found inverse relationship between expression levels of sense/antisense mirnas during halibut development.
atlantic halibut, hippoglossus hippoglossus l., undergoes dramatic metamorphosis during early development from symmetrical pelagic larval stage to unsymmetrical flatfish.
developmental transitions during early development of atlantic halibut are associated with expression of certain mirna types.
size variants of mirnas, isomirs, are observed along with the main mirna types, but their origin and possible biological role are uncovered yet.
developmental profiles of mirnas have been reported in few fish species only and, to our knowledge, differential expressions of isomirs have not yet been shown during fish development.
we revealed that nucleotide truncations and/or additions at the 3' end of mature mirnas resulted in size variants showing differential expression patterns during the development in a number of mirna families.
no data exist on role of mirnas in halibut metamorphosis.
