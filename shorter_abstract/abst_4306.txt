thus, t acts through the er to provide neuroprotection against hiv proteins and cocaine.
collectively, the present data indicate that cocaine has a robust interaction with the hiv proteins gp <dig> and tat that produces severe neurotoxicity, and this toxicity can be blocked through pretreatment with er agonists.
intravenous drug use is a major route of hiv transmission, and drug use is associated with increased had.
specific proteins released as a consequence of hiv infection  have been implicated in the pathogenesis of had.
using this model system, the neuroprotective potential of gonadal steroids was investigated.
in primary cultures of human fetal brain tissue, subtoxic doses of gp <dig> and tat are capable of interacting with a physiologically relevant dose of cocaine, to produce a significant synergistic neurotoxicity.
