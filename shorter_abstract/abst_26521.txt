conversely, the xf genome revealed a high content of externally derived dna and several uncommon, possibly virulence-related features: a type vi secretion system, a second type iv secretion system and a distinct type iii secretion system effector repertoire comprised of multiple rare effectors and several putative new ones.
the draft genome sequence of lmg  <dig> confirms the distinct phylogenetic position of xf within the genus xanthomonas and reveals a patchwork of both lost and newly acquired genomic features.
the xf draft genome  was considerably smaller than most known xanthomonas genomes .
only half of the genes coding for tonb-dependent transporters and cell-wall degrading enzymes that are typically present in other xanthomonas genomes, were found in xf.
xanthomonas fragariae  is a bacterial strawberry pathogen and an a <dig> quarantine organism on strawberry planting stock in the eu.
these features may help explain the specific, mostly endophytic association of xf with the strawberry plant.
other missing genes/regions with a possible impact on its plant-host interaction were: i) the three loci for xylan degradation and metabolism, ii) a locus coding for a ÃŸ-ketoadipate phenolics catabolism pathway, iii) xcs, one of two type ii secretion system coding regions in xanthomonas, and iv) the genes coding for the glyoxylate shunt pathway.
as part of a broader pathogenicity study, the genome of a belgian, virulent xf strain  was assembled to draft status and examined for its pathogenicity related gene content.
it is taxonomically and metabolically distinct within the genus xanthomonas, and known for its host specificity.
