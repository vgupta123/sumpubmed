instead of making inference on probe-set summaries, comparisons are made separately for each perfect-match probe and are then summarized into one score for the probe-set.
plw is specially designed for affymetrix type arrays .
with empirical bayes and penalized t-tests the sample variances are adjusted towards a global estimate, producing more stable results compared to ordinary t-tests.
when analyzing microarray data a primary objective is often to find differentially expressed genes.
as a consequence, adjustment towards a global estimate results in an intensity-level dependent false positive rate.
however, for affymetrix type data a clear dependency between variability and intensity-level generally exists, even for logged intensities, most clearly for data at the probe level but also for probe-set summarizes such as the mas <dig> expression index.
a global covariance matrix is also used allowing for differing variances between arrays as well as array-to-array correlations.
the proposed methods are compared to  <dig> existing methods using five spike-in data sets.
we propose two new methods for finding differentially expressed genes, probe level locally moderated weighted median-t  and locally moderated weighted-t .
