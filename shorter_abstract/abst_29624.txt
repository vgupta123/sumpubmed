comparative genomic analysis revealed that the cgsp <dig> acquired a number of new genes by horizontal gene transfer , most of which were associated with virulence and antimicrobial resistance and clustered in mobile genetic elements.
serotype  <dig> often expresses resistance to a variety of antimicrobial agents, resulting in difficulties in treatment.
to gain insight into the evolution of virulence and antimicrobial resistance traits in s. pneumoniae from the genome level, we sequenced the entire genome of a serotype  <dig> isolate , and carried out comprehensive comparison with other pneumococcal genomes.
the most remarkable feature is the acquisition of two conjugative transposons and one resistance island encoding eight resistance genes.
results of mlst suggested that the major driving force for the genome evolution is the environmental drug pressure.
these include a versatile genome content, with a wide range of mobile elements, and chromosomal rearrangement; the latter re-balanced the genome after events of hgt.
multiple serotype  <dig> clinical isolates were also genotyped by multilocus sequence typing .
the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig> shows a bacterium with rapid adaptations to its lifecycle in human community.
