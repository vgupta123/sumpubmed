in this study, to investigate the transcriptomic processes underlying physiological traits and development in sdm, we used rna from four major tissues  for de novo assembly and to annotate the transcriptome of this species.

investigations of these physiological traits have been hampered by the lack of genomic resources for this species.
the data can potentially be used for future investigations on endophytic parasitism and sdm-spruce interaction, and it dramatically increases the available genomic resources for arceuthobium and dwarf mistletoe communities.
rna-seq analysis using this reference transcriptome identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes from shoots, flowers, fruits, and seeds.
the assembled sdm transcriptome reported in this work contains  <dig>  assembled transcripts;  <dig>  unigenes were functionally annotated by gene ontology analysis.
however, underlying molecular basis of the physiological development is largely unknown.
we uncovered the annotated transcriptome and performed whole genome expression profiling to uncover transcriptional dynamics during physiological development, and we identified key gene categories involved in the process of sexual development.
these genes are enriched in processes including organic substance metabolism, cellular metabolism, biosynthesis, and cellular component.
in addition, genes related to transport, transcription, hormone biosynthesis and signaling, carbohydrate metabolism, and photosynthesis were differentially expressed between tissues.
