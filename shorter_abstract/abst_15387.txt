sequence analysis of the cloned messages indicated that the major element pattern expressed in immunoquiescent sea urchins was either c <dig> or e <dig> .
these results illustrate that sea urchins appear to be able to differentiate among different pamps by inducing the transcription of different sets of 185/ <dig> genes.
optimal alignments of full-length 185/ <dig> cdnas requires the insertion of large gaps that define  <dig> blocks of sequence called elements.
furthermore, animals may share a suite of 185/ <dig> genes that are expressed in response to common pathogens, while also maintaining a large number of unique genes within the population.
individual sea urchins were challenged with pathogen associated molecular patterns  , and changes in the 185/ <dig> message repertoire were followed over time.
a diverse set of transcripts called 185/ <dig> is strongly expressed in sea urchins responding to immune challenge.
in addition to the major patterns, extensive element pattern diversity was observed among the different animals before and after challenge.
the presence or absence of individual elements also defines a specific element pattern for each message.
nucleotide sequence diversity of the transcripts increased in response to Î²- <dig> -glucan, double stranded rna and injury, whereas diversity decreased in response to lps.
