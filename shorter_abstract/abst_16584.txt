both procedures are extensions of available procedures for point null hypotheses achieving exact control of the familywise error rate.
then the second procedure might be more appropriate, where multiplicity is corrected according to a concept of data-driven order of hypotheses.
as both procedures test a hypothesis for each variable, the resulting multiple testing problem has to be considered.
the first algorithm to be discussed uses a permutation algorithm, and is appropriate for designs with a moderately large number of observations.
whereas the shift of the null hypothesis alone would give straight-forward solutions, the problems that are the reason for the empirical considerations discussed here arise by the fact that the shift is considered in both directions and the whole parameter space in between these two limits has to be accepted as null hypothesis.
however, many experiments have limited sample sizes.
hence, the procedures include a multiplicity correction.
for example, studies of microarray data seek to find a significant difference in location parameters from zero or one for ratios thereof for each variable.
