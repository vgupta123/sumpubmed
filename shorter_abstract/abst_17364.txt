increased stc <dig> expression was identified within four hours of initiating pancreatic injury and correlated to increased activation of perk signalling.
upon induction of pancreatic injury, stc2tg mice exhibited limited increases in circulating amylase levels and increased maintenance of cellular junctions.
stc2tg pancreatic tissue exhibited normal pancreatic morphology, but altered activation of perk signalling, including increases in activating transcription factor   <dig> accumulation and autophagy.
this study links stc <dig> to the pathological activation of perk in vivo, and suggests involvement of stc <dig> in responding to pancreatic acinar cell injury.
stanniocalcin  <dig>  is a secreted protein activated by -like endoplasmic reticulum kinase  signalling under conditions of er stress in vitro.
