although it is known that this polarized chromosomal arrangement plays a crucial role in meiotic progression, the molecular mechanisms of telomere bouquet regulation are poorly understood.
in fission yeast, telomeres localize to the nuclear periphery via interaction of the telomeric protein rap <dig> with the membrane protein bqt <dig>  during meiotic prophase, the meiotic proteins bqt1- <dig> bind rap <dig> and tether to the spindle pole body to form the bouquet.
concomitant phosphomimetic mutation of the modification sites suggests that rap <dig> hyper-phosphorylation does not directly regulate telomere bouquet formation or dissociation.
interestingly, mutations that change the charge of negatively charged residues within the bqt1- <dig> binding site of rap <dig> abolished the affinity to the bqt1- <dig> complex, suggesting that the intrinsic negative charge of rap <dig> is crucial for telomere bouquet formation.
chromosomes reorganize in early meiotic prophase to form the so-called telomere bouquet.
here, we detected high levels of rap <dig> phospho-modification throughout meiotic prophase, and identified a maximum of  <dig> phosphorylation sites.
whereas rap <dig> hyper-phosphorylation observed in meiotic prophase does not have an apparent role in bouquet formation, the intrinsic negative charge of rap <dig> is important for forming interactions with its binding partners.
thus, rap <dig> is able to retain bouquet formation under heavily phosphorylated status.
despite the negative charge conferred by its highly phosphorylated state, rap <dig> maintains interactions with its binding partners.
