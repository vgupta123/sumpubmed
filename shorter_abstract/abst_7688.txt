by deep sequencing and computational analysis,  <dig> known mirnas showed significant differential expression between ht and hs genotypes.
to gain insight into functional significance,  <dig> unique potential targets of these  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were predicted.
the broccoli inbred lines that are capable of producing head at high temperature in summer are unique varieties in taiwan.

this large-scale characterization of broccoli mirnas and their potential targets is to unravel the regulatory roles of mirnas underlying heat-tolerant head-forming capacity.
these targets were implicated in shoot apical development, phase change, response to temperature stimulus, hormone and energy metabolism.
the head-forming capacity of the unique ht line was related to autonomous regulation of bo-ft genes and less expression level of heat shock protein genes as compared to hs.
broccoli  is an important vegetable crop, and the yield and quality of broccoli are decreased by heat stress.
however, knowledge of mirnaomes during the broccoli head formation under heat stress is limited.
head-forming capacity was better for heat-tolerant  than heat-sensitive  broccoli under heat stress.
according to the criteria for annotation of new mirnas,  <dig> novel mirna sequences with differential expression between the two genotypes were identified.
