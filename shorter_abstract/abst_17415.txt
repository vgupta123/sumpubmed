we show it is possible to align proteins based solely on their dynamics and that we can use these dynamics-based alignments to quantify the dynamic similarity of proteins.
the dynamic similarity of pdz domains is highly correlated with their structural similarity as calculated with dali.
as a result of creating pair-wise dynamics-based alignments of pdz domains, we have found evolutionarily conserved patterns in their backbone dynamics.
the majority of comparative molecular dynamics studies performed to date relied upon prior sequence or structural alignment to define which residues were equivalent in 3-dimensional space.
however, significant differences in their dynamics can be detected indicating that sequence has a more refined role to play in protein dynamics than just dictating the overall fold.
here we discuss an alternative methodology for comparative molecular dynamics that does not require any prior alignment information.
in order to assess and quantify this, one needs to compare the dynamic motions of different proteins.
comparing the dynamics of distinct proteins may also provide insight into how protein motions are modified by variations in sequence and, consequently, by structure.
our method was tested on  <dig> representative members of the pdz domain family.
