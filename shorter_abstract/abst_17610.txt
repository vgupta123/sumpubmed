we therefore suggest that sex-specific differences in lifespan in this species primarily result from sexually divergent selection.
our results are however compatible with models based on sex-specific selection on reproductive strategies.
here we used sex-specific responses to inbreeding to study the genetic architecture of lifespan and mortality rates in callosobruchus maculatus, a seed beetle that shows sexual dimorphism in lifespan.
sex differences in lifespan are ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom but the causes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood.
alternatively, sexual dimorphism in lifespan could result from sex-specific selection, caused by fundamental differences in how males and females optimize their fitness by allocating resources into current and future reproduction.
several explanations based on asymmetrical inheritance patterns  have been proposed, but these ideas have rarely been tested experimentally.
no model based on asymmetrical inheritance can explain increased male lifespan in response to inbreeding.
