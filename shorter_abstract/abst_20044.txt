the anopheles gambiae salivary glands play a major role in malaria transmission and express a variety of bioactive components that facilitate blood-feeding by preventing platelet aggregation, blood clotting, vasodilatation, and inflammatory and other reactions at the probing site on the vertebrate host.
depletion of the salivary gland genes encoding d7l <dig>  anophelin, peroxidase, the sg <dig> precursor, and a 5'nucleotidase gene significantly increased probing time of a. gambiae mosquitoes and thereby their capacity to blood-feed.
