c-myc has been proposed as a putative target gene of signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> .
c-myc super-enhancer, located  <dig> Â mb downstream of the c-myc gene locus, was recently reported as essential for the regulation of c-myc gene expression by hematopoietic transcription factors and bromodomain and extra-terminal  proteins and for leukemia maintenance.
c-myc super-enhancer is composed of five regulatory regions  which recruit transcription and chromatin-associated factors, mediating chromatin looping and interaction with the c-myc promoter.
we now show that stat <dig> strongly binds to c-myc super-enhancer regions e <dig> and e <dig>  both in normal and transformed ba/f <dig> cells.
our data suggest that constitutive stat <dig> binding to c-myc super-enhancer might contribute to brd <dig> maintenance and thus allow sustained expression of c-myc in ba/f <dig> cells transformed by stat5-1* <dig>
brd <dig> binding at e3/e <dig> coincides with c-myc transcriptional activation and is lost upon treatment with deacetylase and bet inhibitors, both of which inhibit stat <dig> transcriptional activity and c-myc gene expression.
no functional stat <dig> binding site has been identified so far within the c-myc gene locus, therefore a direct transcriptional regulation by stat <dig> remains uncertain.
