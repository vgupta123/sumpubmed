in this study, the effects of l. plantarum zj <dig> isolated from infant fecal samples on pig growth and pork quality were investigated.
the concentration of short-chain fatty acids in lactobacillus- and antibiotic-treated fecal samples were not significantly different .
the results showed that, the l. plantarum zj <dig> has probiotic effects on pig growth and that these effects are dose dependent.
although we found that l. plantarum exerted probiotic effects on pig growth and pork quality, the mechanisms underlying its action require further study.
l. plantarum zj <dig> was found to have probiotic effects, improving pig growth and pork quality.
however, the villus height of ilea , jejuna  and duodena  were found to be significantly improved by lactobacillus treatment.
rather, it might be related to the inhibition of the growth of opportunistic pathogens and promotion of increased villus height.
however, experiments reporting the use of l. plantarum as a probiotic are limited.
group  <dig> was fed a diet supplemented with the antibiotic mequindox; groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were fed a diet supplemented with l. plantarum and no antibiotic; and group  <dig> was fed a mixture of mequindox and l. plantarum.
polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis results showed that the gut bacterial communities in lactobacillus- and antibiotic-treated pigs were very similar and the quantity of l. plantarum zj <dig> was below the detection limits of dgge-band sequencing.
the probiotic mechanism might not involve l. plantarum colonization and alteration of the gut bacterial community.
improved pork quality was associated with lactobacillus treatment.
lactobacillus plantarum is a plant-associated bacterial species but it has also been found in human, mouse and porcine gastrointestinal tracts.
