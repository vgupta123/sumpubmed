the three main computational challenges are: numerical stability, the scalability of search algorithms, and the high memory requirements for computing the likelihood.
finally, we discuss issues pertaining to the numerical stability of the Î“ model of rate heterogeneity on very large trees and argue in favor of rate heterogeneity models that use a single rate or rate category for each site to resolve these problems.
we present an adaptation of the subtree equality vector technique for phylogenomic datasets with missing data  that can reduce execution times and memory requirements by up to 50%.
the rapid accumulation of molecular sequence data, driven by novel wet-lab sequencing technologies, poses new challenges for large-scale maximum likelihood-based phylogenetic analyses on trees with more than  <dig>  taxa and several genes.
