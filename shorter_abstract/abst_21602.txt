these domains corralled the diffusive motion of membrane proteins.
chemical reactions proceed through the interactions of particles in space, with activation energies determining the rates of these chemical reactions at each interaction.
this energy-based model can include the cellular membrane, membranes of other organelles, and cytoskeleton.
we propose an algorithm designed for three-dimensional simulation of the reaction-diffusion dynamics of molecules, based on a particle model.
even single-particle tracking  and single fluorophore video imaging  are now being applied to observation of molecular-level dynamics.
sample trajectories of raft constructs exhibited "hop diffusion".
the simulation algorithm was tested for a reversible enzyme reaction model and its validity was confirmed.
