two different svm kernels with high noise tolerance are evaluated with a varying window size and the scores of the svm models are combined to generate the final propensity score to predict morf residues.
the svm models are designed to extract maximal information between morf residues, its neighboring regions  and the remainder of the sequence .
intrinsically disordered proteins  lack an ordered three-dimensional structure and are enriched in various biological processes.
the results show that the proposed method outperforms these two predictors.
using windowing technique, hmm profiles are utilised to extract features from protein sequences and support vector machines  are used to calculate a propensity score for each residue.
using hmm profile as a source of feature extraction, the proposed method indicates improvement in predicting morfs in disordered protein sequences.
to evaluate the proposed method, its performance was compared to that of other morf predictors; morfpred and anchor.
in this study, we introduce hidden markov model  profiles to accurately identify the location of morfs in disordered protein sequences.
identifying morfs in idps using computational methods is a challenging task.
the molecular recognition features  are functional regions within idps that undergo a disorder-to-order transition on binding to a partner protein.
