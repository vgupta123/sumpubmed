for this, a set of reliable molecular markers representative of the entire genome is required.
faba bean  is an important food legume crop, grown for human consumption globally including in china, turkey, egypt and ethiopia.
the validation by upgma cluster analysis of  <dig> genotypes based on nei's genetic distance, showed high quality and effectiveness of those novel ssr markers developed via next generation sequencing technology.
a library with  <dig>  putative ssr sequences was constructed and characterized for repeat type and length from a mixed genome of  <dig> spring and winter sown faba bean genotypes using  <dig> sequencing.
of these,  <dig> produced reproducible amplicons that were polymorphic among  <dig> faba bean genotypes selected from diverse geographical locations.
these novel markers are valuable for constructing genetic linkage maps, future qtl mapping, and marker-assisted trait selection in faba bean breeding efforts.
