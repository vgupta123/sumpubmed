divergent expression patterns, on the human evolutionary lineage.
the abundance of experimentally characterized human tfbs that are derived from repetitive dna speaks to the substantial regulatory effects that this class of sequence has on the human genome.
we found numerous experimentally characterized tfbs in the human genome, 7â€“10% of all mapped sites, which are derived from repetitive dna sequences including simple sequence repeats  and tes.
the majority of human non-protein-coding dna is made up of repetitive sequences, mainly transposable elements .
despite their rapid evolution, several lines of evidence indicate that te-derived tfbs are functionally constrained.
we set out to assess the evolutionary rate and pattern of experimentally characterized human transcription factor binding sites  that are derived from repetitive versus non-repetitive dna to test whether repeat-derived tfbs are in fact rapidly evolving.
we also evaluated the position-specific patterns of variation among tfbs to look for signs of functional constraint on tfbs derived from repetitive and non-repetitive dna.
te-derived tfbs sequences are far less conserved between species than tfbs derived from ssrs and non-repetitive dna.
it is becoming increasingly apparent that many of these repetitive dna sequence elements encode gene regulatory functions.
this fact has important evolutionary implications, since repetitive dna is the most dynamic part of the genome.
finally, te-derived tfbs show position-specific patterns of sequence variation that are highly distinct from random patterns and similar to the variation seen for non-repeat derived sequences of the same tfbs.
this result has practical implications with respect to the widespread use of evolutionary conservation as a surrogate for functionally relevant non-coding dna.
