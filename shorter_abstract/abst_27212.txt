ugt74s <dig>  a single copy gene located on chromosome  <dig>  displayed no evidence of duplication and was deemed to be under positive selection pressure.
the study suggests that ugt74s <dig> may be the key player in controlling seco glucosylation into sdg in flax although its closely related genes may also contribute to a minor extent in supplying the smg precursor to ugt74s <dig>
phylogenetic and gene duplication analyses, heterologous gene expression and enzyme assays were conducted to identify family members closely related to ugt74s <dig> and to establish their roles in seco glucosylation.
the phylogenetic analysis identified four main clusters where cluster  <dig>  which included ugt74s <dig>  was the most diverse.
flax ugts diverged  <dig> â€“ <dig>  mya and 71% were found to be under purifying selection pressure.
however, whether this gene is the only ugt achieving seco glucosylation in flax was not known.
flax ugt74s <dig> was recently reported to sequentially glucosylate seco into smg and sdg in vitro.
