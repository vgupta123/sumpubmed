for illustration, tide is used to detect optimal inhibitor positions in simple branched networks, a signalling pathway, and a well studied model of glycolysis in trypanosoma brucei.
it automatically assigns the respectively altered kinetics to the inhibited or activated reactions, performs the necessary calculations, and provides a graphical output of the analysis results.
using tide, we show in the branched models under which conditions inhibitions in a certain pathway can affect a molecule concentrations in a different.
finally, we compare our set of best targets in the glycolysis model with a similar analysis showing the applicability of our tool.
furthermore, we present tide , an open source, platform independent tool to investigate ordinary differential equation models in the common systems biology markup language format.
