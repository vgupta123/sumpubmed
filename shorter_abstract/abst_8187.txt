we used mirna microarrays containing all known plant mirnas and a set of unknown small  rnas earlier cloned from brassica phloem sap  <cit> , to comprehensively analyze the phloem response to nutrient deficiency by removing sulfate, copper or iron, respectively, from the growth medium.
phloem sap contains a specific set of srnas, of which some specifically accumulate in response to nutrient deprivation.
we further demonstrate that under nutrient starvation mir <dig> and mir <dig> can be translocated through graft unions from wild type scions to rootstocks of the mirna processing hen1- <dig> mutant.
recently, specific mirnas emerged as a new type of regulating molecules during stress and nutrient deficiency responses, and mir <dig> was suggested to be a phloem-mobile long-distance signal involved in the phosphate starvation response.
