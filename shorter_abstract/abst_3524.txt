sequence alignment showed that there was a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism  in the region encoding the heavy chain between allergan strain and atcc  <dig> and umass strains.
third, alignment of the three sequenced c. botulinum type a <dig> strain genomes revealed the presence of four comparable blocks.
taken together, c. botulinum type a <dig> strains including sanger institute atcc  <dig>  atcc 3502*, atcc  <dig>  hall, allergan, and umass strains demonstrate differences at the level of the neurotoxin gene sequence, in gene content, and in genome arrangement.
the pcr results indicated that umass strain belonged to hall type and atcc 3502* strain was identical to atcc  <dig>  type.
second, comparative genomic hybridization  demonstrated that the umass strain and a strain expected to be derived from atcc  <dig> in the centers for disease control and prevention  laboratory  differed in gene content compared to the atcc  <dig> genome sequence published by the sanger institute.
lastly, pcr was designed to identify umass and atcc 3502* strain genome organizations.
strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> share the same genome organization, while the organization of the blocks in strain hall were switched.
