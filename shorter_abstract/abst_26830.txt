we discuss the evidence that feedback of just this type occurs in vivo, and plays a role in tissue growth control.
here we show that introducing lineage branches can circumvent all such limitations, permitting effective attenuation of a wide range of perturbations.
experiments and mathematical modeling implicate feedback control of cell lineage progression, but a broad understanding of what lineage feedback accomplishes is lacking.
the existence of this strategy provides a dynamics-based justification for feedback control of cell fate in vivo.

by exploring the possible effects of various biologically relevant disturbances on the dynamic and steady state behaviors of stem cell lineages, we find that the simplest and most frequently studied form of lineage feedback - which we term renewal control - suffers from several serious drawbacks.
