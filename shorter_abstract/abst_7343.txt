statistical bioinformatics is the study of biological data sets obtained by new micro-technologies by means of proper statistical methods.
equipped with the new algorithms proposed here, deltaprot serves as an auxiliary analysis tool capable of visualizing and comparing orthologus protein sequences.
the framework of the algorithms also enables easy incorporation of extra information on structure, if such data is available.
we present the deltaprot toolbox, a software toolbox that may be useful in importing, analyzing and visualizing data from multiple alignments of proteins.
visualization of the data sets is also the focus of this article, since visualizations can play a key role in making the various relationships transparent.
the toolbox has been written in matlabâ„¢ to provide an easy and user-friendly platform, including a graphical user interface, while ensuring good numerical performance.
the website also contains documentation, and the toolbox comes with real data sets that are intended for training in applying the models to carry out bioinformatical and statistical analyses of protein sequences.
