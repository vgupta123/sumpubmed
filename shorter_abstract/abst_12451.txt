we have shown that sitesidentify compares favourably to other functional site prediction tools in a comparison of seven methods on a non-redundant set of  <dig> enzymes with annotated active sites.
the rate of protein structures being deposited in the protein data bank surpasses the capacity to experimentally characterise them and therefore computational methods to analyse these structures have become increasingly important.
there are many available approaches to predict functional site, but many are not made available via a publicly-accessible application.
here we present a functional site prediction tool , based on combining sequence conservation information with geometry-based cleft identification, that is freely available via a web-server.
sitesidentify is able to produce comparable accuracy in predicting functional sites to its closest available counterpart, but in addition achieves improved accuracy for proteins with few characterised homologues.
