in addition, a total of  <dig>  simple sequence repeats were identified from the  <dig>  unigenes.
finally, the analysis of simple sequence repeats will provide genetic makers for molecular breeding and genetic applications in this species.
at present, analysis of expressed sequence tags is still the most powerful tool for large-scale gene discovery.
additionally, a total of  <dig> potential cytochrome p <dig> and  <dig> potential udp-glycosyltransferase sequences were predicted based on the annotation results, some of which may encode enzymes responsible for ginsenoside backbone modification.
after annotation, we discovered  <dig> unigenes involved in ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis.
two  <dig> pyrosequencing runs generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads from p. ginseng roots, stems, leaves and flowers.
the global expressed sequence tags from p. ginseng tissues, especially those isolated from stems, leaves and flowers, are still limited, hindering in-depth study of p. ginseng.
this study provides global expressed sequence tags for p. ginseng, which will contribute significantly to further genome-wide research and analyses in this species.
among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  were identified for the first time, of which  <dig> % were identified in the stem, leaf or flower cdna libraries of p. ginseng.
a blast search of the obtained high-quality reads identified  <dig> potential micrornas in p. ginseng, which were estimated to target  <dig> protein-coding genes, including transcription factors, transporters and dna binding proteins, among others.
the novel unigenes identified here enlarge the available p. ginseng gene pool and will facilitate gene discovery.
in addition, the identification of micrornas and the prediction of targets from this study will provide information on gene transcriptional regulation in p. ginseng.
