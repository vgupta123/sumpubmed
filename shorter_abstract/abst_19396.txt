the proposed algorithm assesses each potential outlier in relation to the cluster of potential outliers without making explicit assumptions about the outlier distribution.
we present in this paper a simple algorithm for detecting hdegs by sequentially testing for potential outliers with respect to a tight cluster of non- outliers, among an ordered subset of the experimental samples.
we use simulated and real data to illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a good separation between the tight cluster of low expressions and the outliers for hdegs.
simulated examples and and breast cancer data sets are used to illustrate the suitability of the proposed algorithm for identifying hdegs with small numbers of outliers.
a hdeg is often observed in gene expression experiments  where it is highly expressed in a few experimental samples, or in drug trial experiments for cancer studies with drug resistance heterogeneity among the disease group.
