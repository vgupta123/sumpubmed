we successfully identified previously determined breakpoint junctions in three ptls cases, and also were able to discover novel junctions in repetitive sequences, including lcr-mediated breakpoints.
generation of long  dna sequencing reads provides an approach for interrogation of complex regions in the human genome.
currently, large-insert whole genome sequencing  technologies from pacific biosciences  enable analysis of chromosomal structural variations , but the cost to achieve the required sequence coverage across the entire human genome is high.
the new method leverages the cost efficiency of targeted capture-sequencing as well as the mappability and scaffolding capabilities of long sequencing reads generated by the pacbio platform.
other genomic research applications, such as haplotype phasing and small insertion and deletion validation could also benefit from this technology.
it is therefore suitable for studying complex svs, especially those involving lcrs, inversions, and the generation of chimeric alu elements at the breakpoints.
we developed a method  that combines oligonucleotide-based dna target-capture enrichment technologies with pacbio large-insert library preparation to facilitate sv studies at specific chromosomal regions.
the efficacy of pacbio-lits is illustrated by delineating the breakpoint junctions of low copy repeat -associated complex structural rearrangements on chr17p <dig>  in patients diagnosed with potockiâ€“lupski syndrome .
