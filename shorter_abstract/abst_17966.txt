saccharomyces cerevisiae is also included as a reference genome.
we also identified one example of intron gain in c. albicans.
our analysis provides an important resource that is now available for the candida community.
cgob assignments of homology were manually curated based on sequence similarity and synteny.
we have also generated improved candida gene sets by merging/removing partial genes in each genome.
candida species are the most common cause of opportunistic fungal infection worldwide.
we have developed the candida gene order browser , an online tool that aids comparative syntenic analyses of candida species.
interrogation of cgob revealed that the majority of tandemly duplicated genes are under strong purifying selection in all candida species.
we identified clusters of adjacent genes involved in the same metabolic pathways  and we showed that some clusters are species or lineage-specific.
cgob incorporates all available candida clade genome sequences including two candida albicans isolates  and  <dig> closely related species .
