here, we present a web-based platform for querying biological semantic web databases in a graphical way.
this new graphical way of creating queries for biological semantic web databases considerably facilitates usability as it removes the requirement of knowing specific query languages and database structures.
furthermore, it provides several predefined template queries for answering biological questions.
users can easily create and save new query graphs, which can also be shared with other researchers.
semantic web has established itself as a framework for using and sharing data across applications and database boundaries.
the tool integrates several publicly available semantic web databases, including the databases of the just recently released ebi rdf platform.
