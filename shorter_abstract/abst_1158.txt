the difficulty in accurately calling peaks for chip-seq data is partly due to the difficulty in defining peaks, and we demonstrate a novel method that improves on the accuracy of previous methods in resolving peaks.
our method for identifying statistically significant peaks from read coverage is inspired by the notion of persistence in topological data analysis and provides a non-parametric approach that is statistically sound and robust to noise in experiments.
our introduction of a robust statistical test based on ideas from topological data analysis is also novel.
