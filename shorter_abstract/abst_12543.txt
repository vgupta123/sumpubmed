levels of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide  were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.
inhaled budesonide enhanced lung infection in allergic mice exposed to p. aeruginosa and increased the number of viable bacteria in lung tissue.
budesonide decreased the expression of cramp, increased the number of internalized p. aeruginosa in ova-challenged mice and in lung epithelial cell lines.
however, the direct impact of glucocorticoids on the innate immune system and antibacterial host defense during asthma remain unclear.
these data indicate that inhaled budesonide can suppress pulmonary antibacterial host defense by down-regulating cramp in allergic inflammation mice and in cells in vitro.
inhaled budesonide suppressed pulmonary antibacterial host defense in an asthmatic mouse model and in lung epithelium cells in vitro.
glucocorticoids are widely regarded as the most effective treatment for asthma.
the number of viable bacteria in enflamed lungs was evaluated, and levels of interleukin- <dig>  and interferon-Î³  in serum were measured.
intracellular bacteria were observed in lung epithelial cells.
after sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin , balb/c mice were treated with inhaled budesonide and infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa .
