the transcriptome of larvae was not significantly affected by the treatment of 5 μg/l bde <dig>  as well as the treatment of dmso vehicle.
differential expression analysis and gene enrichment analysis respectively revealed that a great number of genes, and gene sets based on two popular terminologies, were affected by the treatment of 500 μg/l bde <dig>  among them, bde <dig> caused changes in the retinal metabolism and related biological processes involving eye morphogenesis and visual perception, as confirmed by disordered photoreceptor arrangement and thickened bipolar cell layer of larval retina from histological observations.
we also proposed the larval retina as a novel potential target tissue for bde <dig> exposure.
bde47-treated zebrafish larvae were found to present the light-related locomotion reduction in our previous study, therefore, we aimed to use high throughput sequencing to investigate the possible reasons from a transcriptomic perspective.
other altered genes such as pth1a and collaborative cathepsin family exhibited disrupted bone development, which was consistent with the body curvature phenotype.
body curvature arose from enhanced bone resorption because of the intensive up-regulation of related genes.
our results suggest that high bde <dig> concentrations disrupt the eye and bone development of zebrafish larvae based on both transcriptomic and morphological evidences.
by exposing zebrafish embryos/larvae to 5 μg/l and 500 μg/l bde <dig>  we measured the influence of bde <dig> on the mrna expression profiles of zebrafish larvae until 6 days post-fertilization, using illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencing.

the abnormal visual perception may result in the alteration of dark adaption, which was probably responsible for the abnormal larval locomotion.
