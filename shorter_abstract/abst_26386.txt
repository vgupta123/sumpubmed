we found that p. flava contains an intact parahox cluster with a similar arrangement to that of chordates.
these results strongly suggest that intact parahox gene clustering was retained in the deuterostome ancestor and is correlated with temporal colinearity.
parahox and hox genes are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral protohox cluster or from tandem duplication prior to the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterians.
similar to hox clusters, chordate parahox genes including gsx, xlox, and cdx, are clustered and their expression exhibits temporal and spatial colinearity.
in non-chordate animals, however, studies on the genomic organization of parahox genes are limited to only a few animal taxa.
in this study, we investigated the genomic organization and expression of parahox genes in the indirect developing hemichordate acorn worm ptychodera flava.
the temporal expression order of the p. flava parahox genes is the same as that of the chordate parahox genes.
our study shows that p. flava parahox genes, despite forming an intact cluster, exhibit temporal colinearity but lose spatial colinearity during embryogenesis.
on the other hand, pfxlox and pfgsx show a novel expression pattern in the blastopore.
during metamorphosis, partial spatial colinearity is retained in the transforming larva.
during embryogenesis, the spatial expression pattern of pfcdx in the posterior endoderm represents a conserved feature similar to the expression of its orthologs in other animals.
