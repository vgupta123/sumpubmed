in order to improve code locality, we apply our previously published technique of automatic loop nest tiling to all the three loops of the nussinov loop nest.
to produce parallel code, we apply the loop skewing technique to a tiled nussinov loop nest.
we present the speed-up factor of generated nussinov rna parallel code and demonstrate that it is considerably faster than related codes in which only the two outer loops of the nussinov loop nest are tiled.
this approach first forms original rectangular 3d tiles and then corrects them to establish their validity by means of applying the transitive closure of a dependence graph.

rna secondary structure prediction is a compute intensive task that lies at the core of several search algorithms in bioinformatics.
this effect is achieved due to improving code locality and calculation parallelization.
fortunately, the rna folding approaches, such as the nussinov base pair maximization, involve mathematical operations over affine control loops whose iteration space can be represented by the polyhedral model.
the purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach allowing for generation of a parallel tiled nussinov rna loop nest exposing significantly higher performance than that of known related code.
