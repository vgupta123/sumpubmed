to identify the regions that may account for species variation in kinetic properties, directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation were used to create four amino-acid substitutions in the carboxy terminus of the chlamydomonas large subunit to mimic the sequence of higher-specificity plant enzymes.
nonetheless, because of its positive influence on specificity, the carboxy terminus, relatively far from the active site, may serve as a target for enzyme improvement via combinatorial approaches.
the catalytic large subunit of the green-algal enzyme from chlamydomonas reinhardtii is ~90% identical to the flowering-plant sequences, although they confer diverse kinetic properties.
the quadruple-mutant enzyme has a 10% increase in co2/o <dig> specificity and a lower carboxylation catalytic efficiency.
