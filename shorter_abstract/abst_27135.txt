in severe cases, switchgrass rust has the potential to significantly affect biomass yield.
switchgrass rust, caused by puccinia emaculata, is an important disease of switchgrass, a potential biofuel crop in the united states.

variations in resistance response were also observed among tested brachypodium accessions.
transcript profiling of defense-related genes indicated that the genes which were induced in bd21after p. emaculata inoculation also had higher basal transcript abundance in bd3- <dig> when compared to bd30- <dig> and bd <dig> indicating their potential involvement in nonhost resistance against switchgrass rust.
in an effort to identify novel sources of resistance against switchgrass rust, we explored nonhost resistance against p. emaculata by characterizing its interactions with six monocot nonhost plant species.
we characterized p. emaculata interactions with six monocot nonhost species and identified brachypodium distachyon  as a suitable nonhost model to study switchgrass rust.
interestingly, screening of brachypodium accessions identified natural variations in resistance to switchgrass rust.
brachypodium inbred accessions bd3- <dig> and bd30- <dig> were identified as most and least resistant to switchgrass rust, respectively, when compared to tested accessions.
in the present study, we identified brachypodium as a suitable nonhost model to study switchgrass rust which exhibit type i nonhost resistance.
overall, this study provides a new avenue to utilize novel sources of nonhost resistance in brachypodium against switchgrass rust.
we also studied the genetic variations for resistance among brachypodium inbred accessions and the involvement of various defense pathways in nonhost resistance of brachypodium.
brachypodium nonhost resistance against p. emaculata may involve various defense pathways as indicated by transcript profiling of defense related genes.
