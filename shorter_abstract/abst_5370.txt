a significant gender difference was found in activation of the left and right stg  and the cingulate cortex for the subtractive condition women minus men, thus indicating that women might have a greater preference or interest for social stimuli .
however, no gender difference in the brain responses to persons and unanimated scenes has hitherto been demonstrated.
only women showed a source of activity in the stg and in the right mog , and only men in the left parahippocampal area .
