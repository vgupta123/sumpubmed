this study describes the overall  <dig> system performance of using multiple gs junior runs with an in-house established and validated diagnostic assay for human leukocyte antigen  exon sequencing.
incorrect bases are not distributed equally along sequences and tend to be more frequent at sequence ends.
improvements of sequence quality and error rate that have been made over the years are evident and it is shown that both have now reached a level where diagnostic applications become feasible.
