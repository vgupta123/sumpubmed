forward genetic approaches have limited use for agronomic traits that can’t be reliably scored on a single plant basis.
with a long-term goal to develop a sequence-based mutation detection resource in hexaploid wheat, we conducted a feasibility study to accurately differentiate induced mutations from the homoeologs’ sequence variations present among the three wheat genomes.
we conclude that sequencing based mutation detection is a valuable method to identify induced mutations at large.
in total,  <dig>  mutational changes  and  <dig>  homoeologous sequence changes were detected.
the pipeline was tested using the known sequence changes in the three wheat genes.
genes present in the distal regions of the chromosomes were found to be more prone to ems compared to genes present in the proximal regions.
thus, mutants in wheat and other crops are more useful for gene function studies by reverse genetic approach.
on an average,  <dig> snps  and  <dig> small indels  were identified for each of the mutants.
