finally, it was tested whether ovus blocks specific steps in the cell cycle using both pc- <dig> cells and lymphocytes.
recombinant ovus blocked proliferation of pc- <dig> cells at concentrations as low as  <dig> Î¼g/ml as determined by measurements of thymidine incorporation or atp content per well.
the most studied member of the group, ovine uterine serpin , inhibits proliferation of several cell types including activated lymphocytes, bovine preimplantation embryos, and cell lines for lymphoma, canine primary osteosarcoma and human prostate cancer  cells.
the goal for the present study was to evaluate the mechanism by which ovus inhibits cell proliferation.
results indicate that ovus acts to block cell proliferation through disruption of the cell cycle dynamics rather than induction of cytotoxicity or apoptosis.
the finding that ovus can regulate cell proliferation makes this one of only a few serpins that function to inhibit cell growth.
results from flow cytometry experiments showed that ovus blocked the entry of pc- <dig> cells into s phase and the exit from g2/m phase.
in addition, ovus blocked entry of lymphocytes into s phase following activation of proliferation with phytohemagglutinin.
uterine serpins are members of the serine proteinase inhibitor superfamily.
