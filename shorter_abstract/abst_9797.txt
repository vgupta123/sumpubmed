a large number of snps, among them several snps in esr <dig>  showed significantly different allele frequencies between the high and low risk breed groups .
the identification of cmt-associated snps in esr <dig> in two independent datasets suggests that this gene might be involved in cmt development.
ess is a dog breed known to be at increased risk of developing cmts.
the limited within-breed genetic heterogeneity and an enrichment of disease-predisposing alleles have made the dog a very suitable model for the identification of genes associated with risk for specific diseases.
however, the underlying inherited risk factors for canine mammary tumours  are still largely unknown.
we found significant associations to cmt for snps and haplotypes in the estrogen receptor  <dig>  gene in the ess material .
