our results corroborate that the two ectomycorrhiza-forming genera, austropaxillus and gymnopaxillus, form a monophyletic group nested within the saprotrophic genus serpula, and that the serpula species s. lacrymans and s. himantioides constitute the sister group to the austropaxillus-gymnopaxillus clade.
recent phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the ectomycorrhiza forming genera austropaxillus and gymnopaxillus cluster within serpula.
our results also show that the transition from brown rot to mycorrhiza has happened only once in a monophyletic serpulaceae, probably between  <dig> and  <dig> million years before present.
our results verify the transition from brown rot to ecm within serpulaceae between  <dig> and  <dig> mybp.
in this study we use dna sequence data to investigate phylogenetic relationships, historical biogeography of, and nutritional mode transitions in serpulaceae.
