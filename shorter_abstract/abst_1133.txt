a plasmid containing the locus propagated in linear mode when the telomeres of a linear plasmid were attached, indicating a bi-directional replication mode for pwty <dig>  as for rolling-circle plasmids, a single traa gene and a clt sequence  on pwty <dig> were required for plasmid transfer.
streptomyces species are widely distributed in natural habitats, such as soils, lakes, plants and some extreme environments.
traa recognized and bound specifically to the two regions of the clt sequence, one containing all the four dc <dig> of  <dig> bp  and one dc <dig>  and most of ic <dig>  and another covering two dc <dig> and part of ic <dig>  suggesting formation of a high-ordered dna-protein complex.
replication loci of several streptomyces theta-type plasmids have been reported, but are not characterized in details.
a basic locus for plasmid replication comprised repab genes and an adjacent iteron sequence, to a long inverted-repeat  of which the repa protein bound specifically in vitro, suggesting that repa may recognize a second structure  of the iteron dna.
the complete nucleotide sequence of pwty <dig> consisted of  <dig>  bp.
we report the detection of a widely distributed streptomyces strain y <dig> and its indigenous plasmid pwty <dig> from fourteen plants and four soil samples cross china by both culturing and nonculturing methods.
