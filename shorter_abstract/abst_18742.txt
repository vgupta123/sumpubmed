insulin signaling and tau protein phosphorylation in the hippocampi of young and old obese zucker fa/fa rats and their lean controls were assessed to determine whether obesity-induced peripheral insulin resistance and aging are risk factors for central insulin resistance and whether central insulin resistance is related to the pathologic phosphorylation of the tau protein.
both age-induced and obesity-induced peripheral insulin resistance are associated with central insulin resistance that is linked to hypertau phosphorylation.
peripheral hyperinsulinemia, rather than hyperglycemia, appears to promote central insulin resistance and the tau pathology in fa/fa rats.
aging and obesity significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of the insulin cascade kinases akt  and gsk-3β  in the hippocampi of the fa/fa rats.
