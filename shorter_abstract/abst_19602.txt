protein domains present some of the most useful information that can be used to understand protein structure and functions.
the proposed model achieved average prediction accuracy of 67% on the benchmark_ <dig> dataset for domain boundary identification in multi-domains proteins and showed superior predictive performance and generalisation ability among the most widely used neural network models.
the igrn was trained using a pssm , secondary structure, solvent accessibility information and inter-domain linker index to detect possible domain boundaries for a target sequence.
recent research on protein domain boundary prediction has been mainly based on widely known machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines.
in this study, we propose a new machine learning model  that can achieve accurate and reliable classification, with significantly reduced computations.
the performance of proposed model has been compared favourably to the performance of other existing machine learning based methods as well as widely known domain boundary predictors on two benchmark datasets and excels in the identification of domain boundaries in terms of model bias, generalisation and computational requirements.
with the casp <dig> benchmark dataset, it also demonstrated comparable performance to existing domain boundary predictors such as dompro, dompred, domssea, domcut and domaindiscovery with  <dig> % prediction accuracy.
