only recently, the crystal structure of the wnt8-frizzled8-cysteine-rich-domain  complex was solved, but the significance of interaction sites that influence wnt signaling has not been assessed.
the molecular basis of wnt binding to frizzled and lrp5/ <dig> co-receptors has long been unknown due to the lack of structural data on wnt ligands.
here, we present an extensive structure-function analysis of mouse wnt3a in vitro and in vivo.
in accordance, increasing amounts of soluble frizzled8-crd protein modulated wnt3a signaling in a biphasic manner.
wnt proteins are a family of secreted signaling molecules that regulate key developmental processes in metazoans.
we provide evidence for the essential role of serine  <dig>  glycine  <dig>  and tryptophan  <dig>  in fz binding.
