in the present study, we show that blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> were expressed and arginine dimethylation of histones h2a and h <dig> was detected in human male gonocytes at weeks 12â€“ <dig> of gestation, indicating a role of this mechanism in human fetal germ cell development as well.
in murine pgcs, expression and interaction of blimp <dig> and prmt <dig> results in arginine  <dig> dimethylation of histone h2a and h <dig>  this imposes epigenetic modifications leading to transcriptional repression in mouse pgcs enabling them to escape the somatic differentiation program during migration, while expressing markers of pluripotency.
moreover, we speculate that the histone h2a and h <dig> arginine  <dig> dimethylation might be the mechanism by which igcnu and seminoma maintain the undifferentiated state while loss of these histone modifications leads to somatic differentiation observed in nonseminomatous tumors.
most testicular germ cell tumors arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified , which is thought to originate from a transformed primordial germ cell /gonocyte, the fetal germ cell.
moreover, blimp1/prmt <dig> and histone h2a and h <dig> arginine  <dig> dimethylation was present in igcnu and most seminomas, while downregulated in embryonal carcinoma  and other nonseminomatous tumors.
