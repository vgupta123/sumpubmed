the work demonstrates an important role for this domain in the regulation of c/ebpα activity in adipocytes but not hepatocytes, however gsk <dig> phosphorylation of these residues does not mediate regulation of this c/ebp activity.
pharmacological inhibition of gsk <dig> mimics the effect of insulin on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , glucose- <dig> phosphatase  and igf binding protein- <dig>  gene expression.
finally, we demonstrate that c/ebpα is a very poor substrate for gsk <dig> in vitro and in cells.
caat/enhancer binding protein alpha  regulates these gene promoters in liver and is phosphorylated on two residues  by gsk <dig>  although the functional outcome of the phosphorylation has not been established.
we aimed to establish whether cebpα is a link between gsk <dig> and these gene promoters.
phosphorylation of t222/t <dig> is decreased by gsk <dig> inhibition, suggesting gsk <dig> does phosphorylate t222/ <dig> in intact cells.
c/ebpα represses the igfbp <dig> thymine-rich insulin response element , but mutation of t <dig> or t <dig> of c/ebpα to non-phosphorylatable alanines has no effect on c/ebpα activity in liver cells .
meanwhile c/ebpα activity in 3t <dig> l <dig> preadipocytes was enhanced by mutation of t222/t <dig> and/or s <dig> to alanine residues.
in short, we find no evidence that c/ebpα activity is regulated by direct phosphorylation by gsk <dig>
