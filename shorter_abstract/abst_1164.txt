as neural crest cells coalesce to form sympathetic ganglia, trkb-positive cells are seen in both chicken and mouse embryos.
the trkb-positive cells lack neural markers at this stage; however, they migrate with other neurally differentiating cells that are trka and trkc-positive.
by st. 29/ <dig>  trkb-positive cells begin to express the neural specific markers hu c/d and islet-1; eventually, all trkb positive cells commence neural differentiation.
in the mouse, trkb-positive cells surround newly formed sympathetic ganglia and a small number of trkb positive cells that co-express tyrosine hydroxylase are seen within ganglia between e <dig> - <dig>  in cell culture, many cells from st. 29â€“ <dig> chicken lumbar sympathetic ganglia express neural markers and are dividing, indicating that they are sympathoblasts.
bdnf increases the number of cells expressing neural markers in culture by increasing number of cells that incorporate bromodeoxyuridine.
nerve growth factor and neurotrophin- <dig> are involved in the development of sympathetic neurons; however, whether brain derived neurotrophic factor also plays a role is not known.
the purpose of this study was to determine whether bdnf and its receptor, trkb, are expressed during the development of paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in vivo and to determine the effect of bdnf in vitro.
developing paravertebral sympathetic ganglia in avian and murine embryos contain a subpopulation of sympathoblasts that transiently express trkb and ultimately commence neuronal differentiation.
in chicken embryos, trkb-expressing cells first appear at hamburger-hamilton stage   <dig> and they co-express hnk- <dig>  confirming that they are migrating neural crest cells.
