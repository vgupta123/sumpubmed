genomic instability of this gene family was driven by chromosomal inversion , recent duplication events , localized  and large scale deletions , and a phage integration event .
the bcc σ <dig> gene family was found to be under strong selective pressures that could lead to acquisition/deletion, and duplication events modifying its architecture.
comparative analysis of bcc and pseudomonas aeruginosa σ <dig> gene families revealed distinct evolutionary strategies, with the bcc having selected several alternative primary factors, something not recorded among p. aeruginosa and only previously reported to occur among the actinobacteria.
the burkholderia cepacia complex  groups bacterial species with beneficial properties that can improve crop yields or remediate polluted sites but can also lead to dramatic human clinical outcomes among cystic fibrosis  or immuno-compromised individuals.
this number is lower than the one of pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species found in similar habitats including cf lungs.
these two bacterial groups showed strikingly different σ <dig> family architectures, with only three ecf paralogs in common .
some paralogs appeared limited to the et <dig> epidemic clone , particular bcc species , the burkholderia genus , certain proteobacterial groups , or were broadly distributed in the eubacteria .
non-ecf paralogs were related to primary , alternative primary, stationary phase , flagellin biosynthesis , and heat shock  factors.
