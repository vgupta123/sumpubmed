we treat structure prediction as an optimization problem, using parameterizable cost functions representing biological "pseudo-energies".
our goal is to develop a state-of-the-art protein secondary structure predictor, with an intuitive and biophysically-motivated energy model.
the method presented shows promise for the prediction of protein secondary structure.
this method is general and can be extended beyond the all-alpha case described here.
biophysically-motivated elementary free-energies can be learned using svm techniques to construct an energy cost function whose predictive performance rivals state-of-the-art.
focusing on the prediction of alpha helices in proteins, we show that a model with  <dig> parameters can achieve a qα value of  <dig> % and an sovα value of  <dig> %.
machine learning methods are applied to estimate the values of the parameters to correctly predict known protein structures.
