an arabidopsis whole genome microarray was used to evaluate global gene expression under different n conditions.
no studies have yet delineated these responses at the transcriptional level when plants are grown under chronic n stress and the understanding of regulatory elements involved in n response is very limited.
differentially expressed genes were also identified in response to short- and long-term n availability increases.
differentially expressed genes identified provide additional insights into the coordination of the complex n responses of plants and the components of the n response mechanism.
putative n regulatory elements were identified to reveal possible new components of the regulatory network for plant n responses.
a better understanding of the complex regulatory network for plant n responses will help lead to strategies to improve n use efficiency.
mild n stress triggered only a small set of genes significantly different at the transcriptional level, which are largely involved in various stress responses.
to further our understanding of the response of plants to varying n levels, a growth system was developed where n was the growth-limiting factor.
efforts have been directed to understanding the molecular basis of plant responses to n and identifying n-responsive genes in order to manipulate their expression, thus enabling plants to use n more efficiently.
plant responses were much more pronounced under severe n stress, involving a large number of genes in many different biological processes.
putative n regulatory elements were determined along with several previously known motifs involved in the responses to n and carbon availability as well as plant stress.
differentially expressed genes under mild or severe chronic n stress were identified.
a large quantity of nitrogen  fertilizer is used for crop production to achieve high yields at a significant economic and environmental cost.
