variation in gene expression between two drosophila melanogaster strains, as revealed by transcriptional profiling, seldom corresponded to variation in proximal promoter sequence for  <dig> genes analyzed.
at least one kb of the proximal promoters of 15â€“ <dig> genes in each set was sequenced and compared between strains .
hypothetically, genes differing in expression between the two strains should have more proximal promoter polymorphisms than those whose expression is similar.
for these genes, sequences external to the proximal promoter, such as enhancers or in trans, must play a greater role than the proximal promoter in transcriptomic variation between d. melanogaster strains.
more than half of the snps were changes within a nucleotide class.
