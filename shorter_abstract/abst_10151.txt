orthogonal central composite design and response surface methodology were adopted to further investigate the mutual interaction between the variables and identify the optimum values that catalyse maximum metabolite production.
design–expert version <dig>  software was used for construction of the experimental design and statistical analysis of the experimental data.
optimization not only led to a  <dig> fold increase in metabolite yield but the same was achieved at much lesser time .
this work evaluates the effects of fermentation parameters on the production of a lactone compound effective against candida albicans by penicillium verruculosum mkh <dig> under submerged fermentation.
so far as our knowledge goes, till date there are no reports available on the production of antibiotics by penicillium verruculosum through media optimization using rsm.
stability of the compound was also assessed on the basis of its response to physical and chemical stresses.
the important factors influencing antibiotic production selected in accordance with the plackett–burman design were found to be initial ph, temperature, peptone, mgso <dig> h2o.
the validation experiments using optimized conditions of initial ph  <dig> , temperature 27 °c, peptone  <dig>  g/l and mgso <dig> h2o  <dig>  g/l resulted in a significant increase  in the metabolite production which was in agreement with the prediction .
microorganisms are a rich source of structurally diverse secondary metabolites that exert a major impact on the control of infectious diseases and other medical conditions.
the enhanced yield of the antibiotic strongly suggests that the fungus p. verruculosum mkh <dig> can be efficiently used for antibiotic production on a large scale.
