cardiac contractility is regulated by dynamic phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins by kinases such as camp-activated protein kinase a .
this study ascribes a novel function to mmgl isoform 4: it meets all criteria for classification as an akap, and we show that is involved in the phosphorylation of cmybpc as well as ctni, hence mmgl is an important regulator of cardiac contractility.
moreover, sirna-mediated knockdown of mmgl leads to reduction of cmybpc levels under conditions of adrenergic stress, indicating that mmgl-assisted phosphorylation is requisite for protection of cmybpc against proteolytic cleavage.
cardiac myosin binding protein-c  and cardiac troponin i  are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -causing sarcomeric proteins which regulate contractility in response to pka phosphorylation.
to investigate this possibility, we assessed the ability of mmgl isoform  <dig> to interact with pka regulatory subunits r1a and r2a using y2h-based direct protein-protein interaction assays.
we also showed that quantitatively more interaction occurs between mmgl and ctni under Î²-adrenergic stress.
additionally, to further elucidate the function of mmgl, we used it as bait to screen a cardiac cdna library.
carp, commd <dig>  eno <dig>  eno <dig> and ctni were identified as putative interactors, with ctni being the most frequent interactor.
