proteomic analysis has proven to be the most powerful method for describing plant species and lines, and for identification of proteins in complex mixtures.
these results suggest that there may be an association between these polymorphic storage protein isoforms and peanut subspecies fastigiata  and hypogaea .
the protein profiles were similar on one-dimensional gels for all tested peanut genotypes.
there was one minor band with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda that was present in all runner peanut genotypes and the spanish-derivatives .
the  <dig> kda protein in a <dig> and the  <dig> kda protein in runner-type peanut genotypes were confirmed on the 2-d sds-page gels.
in contrast, spot  <dig>  and spot  <dig>  were present in all runner peanut genotypes but not in spanish-bunch genotypes.
the polymorphic protein peptides distinguished by 2-d page could be used as markers for identification of runner and spanish peanuts.
however, peanut genotype a <dig> lacked one major band with a molecular weight of about  <dig> kda.
the strength of this method resides in high resolving power of two-dimensional electrophoresis , coupled with highly sensitive mass spectrometry , and sequence homology search.
among more than  <dig> main protein spots on the 2-d gels, four protein spots that were individually marked as spots 1â€“ <dig> showed polymorphic patterns between runner-type and spanish-bunch peanuts.
spot  <dig>  and spot  <dig>  were observed in all spanish-bunch genotypes, but were not found in runner types.
based on the internal and n-terminal amino acid sequences, these proteins are isoforms  of each other, are iso-allergens and may be modified by post-translational cleavage.
