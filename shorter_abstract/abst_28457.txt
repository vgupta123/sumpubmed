the  <dig> bio::nexus modules define  <dig> methods in  <dig> lines of code, with  <dig> lines of pod .
bio::nexus can be used as glue code for connecting existing software that uses nexus, or as a framework for new applications.
evolutionary analysis provides a formal framework for comparative analysis of genomic and other data.
in evolutionary analysis, observed data are treated as the terminal states of characters that have evolved  along the branches of a tree.
bio::nexus provides an object-oriented interface to reading, writing and manipulating the contents of nexus files.
in spite of some limitations owing to the complexity of nexus files and the lack of a formal grammar, nexus will continue to be useful for years to come.
provides a portable, expressive and flexible text format for representing character-state data and trees.
it closely follows the extensive explanation of the nexus format provided by maddison et al., supplemented with a few extensions such as support for the nhx  tree format.
