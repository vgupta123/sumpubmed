each resistance allele was associated with fitness costs  in an insecticide-free environment, with the costs of ace-1r being greater than for kdrr.
in particular, the presence of the kdrr mutation compensated for the costs of the ace-1r mutation in an insecticide-free environment, suggesting the strength of selection in untreated areas would be less against mosquitoes resistant to both insecticides than for those resistant to carbamates alone.
the evolutionary dynamics of xenobiotic resistance depends on how resistance mutations influence the fitness of their bearers, both in the presence and absence of xenobiotic selection pressure.
in cases of multiple resistance, these dynamics will also depend on how individual resistance mutations interact with one another, and on the xenobiotics applied against them.
insecticide resistance mutations interacted to positively or negatively influence a mosquito's fitness, both in the presence or absence of insecticides.
additional interactions suggest the dynamics of resistance will be difficult to predict in populations where multiple resistance mutations are present or that are subject to treatment by different xenobiotics.
we compared culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes harbouring two resistance alleles ace-1r and kdrr  to mosquitoes bearing only one of the alleles, or neither allele.
