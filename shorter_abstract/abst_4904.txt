moreover, compared with s. cerevisiae and k. lactis, the replication licensing machinery in l. kluyveri seems more tolerant to variations in the ars sequence composition.
in contrast, only about half of the l. kluyveri arss function in s. cerevisiae and less than 10% function in k. lactis.
the characterization of dna replication origins in yeast has shed much light on the mechanisms of initiation of dna replication.
it is able to initiate replication from almost all s. cerevisiae arss tested and most kluyveromyces lactis arss.
this lack of understanding is largely due to the vast evolutionary distances between model organisms in which origins have been examined.
through a combination of experimental work and rigorous computational analysis, we show that l. kluyveri arss require a sequence that is similar but much longer than the ars consensus sequence well defined in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
in this study we have isolated and characterized autonomously replicating sequences  in lachancea kluyveri - a pre-whole genome duplication  budding yeast.
