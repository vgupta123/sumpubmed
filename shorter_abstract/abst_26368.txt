<dig> transcripts encoded enzymes putatively involved in pheromone biosynthesis, of which  <dig> were specifically, or mainly, expressed in the pheromone glands at  <dig> to 120-fold higher levels than in the body.
the transcripts encoding for  <dig> acetyl-coa carboxylases,  <dig> fatty acid synthase,  <dig> desaturases,  <dig> acyl-coa reductases,  <dig> alcohol oxidases,  <dig> aldehyde reductases and  <dig> acetyltransferases were expressed at a significantly higher level in the pheromone glands than in the body.
a. ipsilon is a destructive pest of many crops and further characterization of the genes involved in pheromone biosynthesis and transport could offer potential targets for disruption of their chemical communication and for crop protection.
our study identified genes potentially involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis and transport in a. ipsilon.
the identification of highly expressed csps and obps in the pheromone gland suggests that they may play a role in the binding, transport and release of sex pheromones during sex pheromone production in a. ipsilon and other lepidoptera insects.
here we report  <dig> next-generation sequencing of the a. ipsilon pheromone gland transcriptome, identification and expression profiling of genes putatively involved in pheromone production, transport and degradation.
two csp transcripts  were highly abundant in the pheromone gland transcriptome and this was confirmed by qrt-pcr.
the identified genes are likely to play essential roles in sex pheromone production, transport and degradation and could serve as targets to interfere with pheromone release.
a total of  <dig> unigenes were obtained from the transcriptome analysis, 86% of which were a. ipsilon specific.
based on these studies we proposed possible a. ipsilon biosynthesis pathways for major and minor sex pheromone components.
