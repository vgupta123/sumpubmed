we wanted to estimate to what extent this is true given a consolidated protein interaction data set.
a total of  <dig> disease groups had significant overlaps with protein interaction data consolidated by irefindex.
we also found that disease groups overlapped with all three interaction data types: n-ary, spoke-represented complexes and binary data â€“ thus stressing the importance of considering each of these data types separately.
this survey provides a basis for further curation efforts to confirm and search for overlaps between diseases and interaction data.
we constructed  <dig> multigenic disease groups from omim and tested for overlaps with interaction and pathway data.
almost half of our multigenic disease groups could potentially be explained by protein complexes and pathways.
multigenic diseases are often associated with protein complexes or interactions involved in the same pathway.
the accompanying r script can be used to reproduce the work and track progress in this area as databases change.
however, the fact that no database or data type was able to cover all disease groups suggests that no single database has systematically covered all disease groups for potential related complex and pathway data.
a further  <dig> disease overlaps were found only in the kegg pathway database.
disease group overlaps can be further explored using the irefscape plugin for cytoscape.
the study stresses data integration and data representation issues.
no single database contained all significant overlaps thus stressing the importance of data integration.
