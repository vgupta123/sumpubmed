specifically designed to facilitate large-scale  genetic linkage or association studies, genelink securely and efficiently handles large amounts of data and provides additional features to facilitate data analysis by existing software packages and quality control.
genelink has already proven an invaluable tool for complex trait mapping studies and is discussed primarily in the context of our large, multi-center study of hereditary prostate cancer .
in contrast to gene-mapping studies of simple mendelian disorders, genetic analyses of complex traits are far more challenging, and high quality data management systems are often critical to the success of these projects.
finally, genelink generates several quality assurance reports, including genotyping success rates of specified dna samples or success and heterozygosity rates for specified markers.
genelink is a powerful tool for complex trait mapping, enabling genotypic data to be easily merged with pedigree and extensive phenotypic data.
these include the ability to download chromosome-specific data files containing marker data in map order in various formats appropriate for downstream analyses .
to minimize the difficulties inherent in complex trait studies, we have developed genelink, a web-accessible, password-protected sybase database.
