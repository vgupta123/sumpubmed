we report here the first genome-wide physical map of flax and the generation and analysis of bac-end sequences  from  <dig>  clones, providing initial insights into the genome.
the physical map consists of  <dig> contigs spanning ~ <dig> mb, assembled from  <dig>  fingerprints, representing roughly  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the estimated haploid genome .
homology searches against flax-ests and ncbi-ests suggested that ~ <dig> % of the transcriptome is unique to flax.
the ssrs identified from bes will be valuable in saturating existing linkage maps and for anchoring physical and genetic maps.
annotation revealed that a large part of the genome consists of ribosomal dna , followed by known transposable elements at  <dig> %.
compared to other plant genomes, the proportion of rdna was found to be very high whereas the proportion of known transposable elements was low.
analysis of the bes has provided insights into the uniqueness of the flax genome.
the first genome-wide physical map of flax constructed with bac clones provides a framework for accessing target loci with economic importance for marker development and positional cloning.
the physical map and paired-end reads from bac clones will also serve as scaffolds to build and validate the whole genome shotgun assembly.
the longest contig was ~ <dig>  kb comprising  <dig> clones.
