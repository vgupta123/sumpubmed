the experimental data used in systems biology can be assigned to one of the following categories: assays yielding average data of a cell population, high-content single cell measurements and high-throughput techniques generating single cell data for large cell populations.
in this article we present a method that combines the power of high-content single cell measurements with the efficiency of high-throughput techniques.
it is the combination of data calibration and model into a single method that makes it possible to determine quantities only accessible by single cell assays but using high-throughput techniques.
high-quality quantitative data is a major limitation in systems biology.
we develop a mathematical model to relate quantities exclusively observable by high-content single cell techniques to those measurable with high-content as well as high-throughput methods.
the latter are defined as free variables, while the variables measurable with only one technique are described in dependence of those.
as an example, we apply our approach to the nucleocytoplasmic transport of stat5b in eukaryotic cells.
a calibration on the basis of identical cell populations measured by both approaches connects the two techniques.
