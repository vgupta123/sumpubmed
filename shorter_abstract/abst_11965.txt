in addition, we present a novel algorithm that further improves runtimes by up to an additional order of magnitude, for simulations where a fraction of the mutations is neutral .
apart from simulated sequences, our tool also generates a graph structure that depicts the complete observable history of neutral mutations.
the graph structure generated by our algorithm can give rise to novel approaches for visualizing and analyzing the output of forward simulations.
in population genetics, simulation is a fundamental tool for analyzing how basic evolutionary forces such as natural selection, recombination, and mutation shape the genetic landscape of a population.
we introduce ana-fits, a highly optimized forward simulation software, that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art software.
