by exploring the accuracy of sequencing as a function of depth of coverage, we found that about  <dig> million reads are required to match the sensitivity of two tiling array replicates.
we find that the raw signals from these two technologies are reasonably well correlated but that rna-seq outperforms tiling arrays in several respects, notably in exon boundary detection and dynamic range of expression.
the effects of cross-hybridization were analyzed using a "nearest neighbor" classifier applied to array probes; we describe a method for determining potential "black list" regions whose signals are unreliable.
here, we compare these two platforms using a matched sample of poly-enriched rna isolated from the second larval stage of c. elegans.
understanding the relative merits of these technologies will help researchers select the appropriate technology for their needs.
finally, we propose a strategy for using rna-seq data as a gold standard set to calibrate tiling array data.
all tiling array and rna-seq data sets have been submitted to the modencode data coordinating center.
