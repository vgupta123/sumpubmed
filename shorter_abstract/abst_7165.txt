our work represents one of the first direct comparisons between first- and second-generation libraries and shows that modern library designs together with methodological advances have had a significant influence on genome-scale rnai screens.
to examine advances in rnai screening technology, we compare this screen to a biologically very similar screen undertaken in  <dig> with a first-generation library.
here we present a new genome-wide rnai screen of the drosophila jak/stat signalling pathway undertaken in the sheffield rnai screening facility .
however, whilst every screen identifies interacting genes, less attention has been given to how factors such as library design and post-screening bioinformatics may be effecting the data generated.
both screens used the same cell line, reporters and experimental design, with the srsf screen identifying  <dig> putative regulators of jak/stat signalling,  <dig> of which verified in a secondary screen and  <dig> verified with an independent probe design.
