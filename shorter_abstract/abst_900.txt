the in vitro lifespan of primary domestic pig fibroblast  and miniature pig fibroblast  cells using a standard 3t <dig> protocol was determined.
primary mpf cells exhibited a relatively shorter lifespan and slower proliferation rate compared to those of primary pf cells.
these results suggest that p <dig> signaling might be a major determinant for the replicative senescence in the mpf cells that have the shorter lifespan and slower growth rate compared to pf cells in vitro.
in contrast to the immortalized pf cells, immortal mpf cells showed a transformed phenotype and possessed more frequent chromosomal abnormalities and loss of p <dig> regulatory function.
therefore, we sought to establish primary and immortal cell lines derived from both the miniature and domestic pig to better enable insight into possible in vivo growth differences.
the lifespan of primary mpf and pf cells was extended by inactivation of the p <dig> function using transduction by sv40lt without any detectable senescent phenotype.
both of the primary pf and mpf cells were shown to have a two-step replicative senescence barrier.
beyond senescence barriers, lifespan-extended pf and mpf cells were eventually established and indicated spontaneous cellular immortalization.
although the miniature breeds are more recent and have increasingly been used in a variety of biomedical studies, their cell lines have rarely been established.
