therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression pattern of ki- <dig> in normal and neoplastic perianal glands of dogs to evaluate the possible use of this proliferation marker as an ancillary method of perianal tumor diagnosis.
for adenomas and epitheliomas of the perianal glands the computer-assisted counting and the manual counting gave similar results; however, only the computer-assisted image analysis was efficient to predict the perianal gland carcinoma recurrence.
also, higher ki- <dig> index is related to recurrence in cases of perianal gland carcinomas.
we studied  <dig> cases of perianal gland neoplasms including adenomas , epitheliomas , and carcinomas .
out of the  <dig> cases of perianal gland neoplasms,  <dig> were from males and eight from females.
since there were significant differences in the number of ki-67-positive nuclei, this marker proved to be effective in helping the classification of perianal gland neoplasms and to refine the diagnosis criteria, especially in those samples with high variation in morphology/area.
further, the computer-assisted image analysis proved to be a fast and reliable method to assess the ki- <dig> index in perianal gland neoplasms.
a ki- <dig> index was established by a computer-assisted image analysis and compared with manual counting.
as controls,  <dig> tissue samples from normal perianal glands were used.
