the ability of pprhs to silence cd <dig> and sirpα was evaluated at the mrna level by qrt-pcr and at the protein level by western blot.
pprhs were able to decrease both cd <dig> expression in mcf- <dig> cell line and sirpα expression in macrophages at the mrna and protein levels.
cell viability was assessed by mtt assays.
in the context of tumor immunology, tumor cells have been shown to overexpress cd <dig>  an anti-phagocytic signal directed to macrophages to escape from phagocytosis by interacting with signal regulatory protein α sirpα.
in the present work, we designed polypurine reverse hoogsteen hairpins, pprhs, to silence the expression of cd <dig> in tumor cells and sirpα in macrophages with the aim to eliminate tumor cells by macrophages in co-culture experiments.
macrophages were co-cultured with tumor cells in the presence of pprhs to silence cd <dig> and/or sirpα.
the mrna levels of differentiation markers cd <dig> and mcl- <dig> mrna and pro-inflammatory cytokines  were measured by qrt-pcr.
these results indicate that pprhs could represent a new approach with immunotherapeutic applications.
our data support the usage of pprhs to diminish cd47/sirpα interaction by decreasing the expression of both molecules thus resulting in an enhanced killing of mcf- <dig> cells by macrophages, which might translate into beneficial effects in cancer therapy.
thp- <dig> cells differentiated to macrophages with pma showed an increase in macrophage surface markers  and pro-inflammatory cytokines .
in the presence of pprhs, mcf- <dig> cells were eliminated by macrophages in co-culture experiments, whereas they survived in the absence of pprhs.
