we identified a hypomorphic allele of chmob <dig> in a random insertional mutant  of the hemibiotrophic ascomycete fungus colletotrichum higginsianum.
the genome of c. higginsianum encodes two more mob proteins.
this study shows that chmob <dig> binds to the conserved ndr/lats kinase chcbk <dig> and plays an important role in pathogenicity of colletotrichum higginsianum on arabidopsis thaliana.

mob family proteins are conserved between animals, plants and fungi and are essential for the activation of ndr kinases that control crucial cellular processes like cytokinesis, proliferation and morphology.
the mutant is impaired in conidiation, host penetration and virulence on arabidopsis thaliana.
