the ultimate goal of the clustering process is to provide the user with several different readings of the  query results and show possible hidden correlations among them, thus improving their browsing and understanding.
bpbcomputes these views by exploiting the meta-data present within the retrieved documents such as the references to gene ontology, the taxonomy lineage, the organism and the keywords.
this scenario generates severe problems not only at indexing time, where suitable algorithmic techniques for data indexing and retrieval are required, but also at query time, since a user query may produce such a large set of results that their browsing and "understanding" becomes humanly impractical.
these tools organize on-the-fly the results of a user query in a hierarchy of labeled folders that ease their browsing and knowledge extraction.
in both cases the search task returns a set of documents  which constitute the answer to the user query.
the user can search a set of keywords within a specific field of the document schema, or can execute blastto find documents relative to homologue sequences.
high-throughput molecular biology provides new data at an incredible rate, so that the increase in the size of biological databanks is enormous and very rapid.
since the number of hits may be large, bpbclusters them into groups of homogenous content, organized as a hierarchy of labeled clusters.
we investigate this approach on biological data, and propose the so called the bioprompt-boxsoftware system which deploys ontology-driven clustering strategies for making the searching process of biologists more efficient and effective.
