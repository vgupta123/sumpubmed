we also observe that the metabolism of e. coli is significantly more modular than even our most versatile networks.
our work shows that modularity in metabolic networks can be a by-product of functional constraints, e.g., the need to sustain life in multiple environments.
the ubiquity of modules in biological networks may result from an evolutionary benefit of a modular organization.
because we observe this principle not just in one or few biological networks, but in large random samples of networks, we propose that it may be a generic principle of metabolic network organization.
we here ask whether this last scenario may play a role in genome-scale metabolic networks that need to sustain life in one or more chemical environments.
we call a metabolic network viable in a given chemical environment if it can synthesize all of an organism's biomass compounds from nutrients in this environment.
we here ask whether versatility affects the modularity of metabolic networks.
using recently developed techniques to randomly sample large numbers of viable metabolic networks from a vast space of metabolic networks, we use flux balance analysis to study in silico metabolic networks that differ in their versatility.
this organizational principle is insensitive to the environments we consider and to the number of reactions in a metabolic network.
modules that arise in highly versatile networks generally involve reactions that process nutrients or closely related chemicals.
we find that highly versatile networks are also highly modular.
most or all reactions in a module are associated with the same biochemical pathways.
an organism's metabolism is highly versatile if it can sustain life in many different chemical environments.
