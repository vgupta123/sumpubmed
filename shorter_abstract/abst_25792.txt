a protein may bind to its target dna sites constitutively, i.e., regardless of cell type.
furthermore, t-kde can identify constitutive sites that are missed by a motif-based approach either because a bound site failed to reach the motif significance cutoff or because the peak sequence scanned was too short.
to locate constitutive binding sites for a protein using chip-seq data for that protein from multiple cell lines, we developed a method, t-kde, which combines a binary range tree with a kernel density estimator.

t-kde is an efficient and effective method to predict constitutive protein binding sites using chip-seq peaks from multiple cell lines.
using  <dig> ctcf  chip-seq datasets, we showed that the number of constitutive sites identified by t-kde is robust to the choice of tuning parameter and that t-kde identifies binding site locations more accurately than a binning approach.
genome-wide discovery of constitutive binding sites requires robust and efficient computational methods to integrate results from numerous binding experiments.
