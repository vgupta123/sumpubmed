real-time quantitative rt-pcr  demonstrated that different isoforms of dab <dig> and fyn have tissue-specific expression patterns, and sdab <dig> and sfyn-b display similar temporal expression characteristics in the developing porcine cerebral cortex and cerebellum.
sdab1-li is an isoform that is highly expressed in peripheral organs.
our results imply that the short splice form sdab1-li might regulate cellular responses to different cell signals by acting as a dominant negative form against the full length sdab <dig> variant and that both isoforms might serve different signaling functions in different tissues.
disabled- <dig>  is an adaptor protein that is essential for the intracellular transduction of reelin signaling, which regulates the migration and differentiation of postmitotic neurons during brain development in vertebrates.
