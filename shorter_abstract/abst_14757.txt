phylogenetic analyses of brk <dig> as well as microsatellite simple sequence repeat  data confirm a polyphyletic origin for three physcomitrella lineages.
the moss physcomitrella patens  bruch & schimp.
molecular analysis of the nuclear single copy gene brk <dig> reveals that three physcomitrium species feature larger genome sizes than physcomitrella patens and encode two expressed brk <dig> homeologs , indicating that they may be allopolyploid hybrids.
we propose a revised classification of the previously described four subspecies of physcomitrella patens into three distinct species, namely physcomitrella patens, physcomitrella readeri and physcomitrella magdalenae.
we argue that secondary reduction of sporophyte complexity in these species is due to the establishment of an ecological niche, namely spores resting in mud and possible spore dispersal by migratory birds.
in order to shed light on the evolutionary history of physcomitrella and related species within the funariaceae, we analyzed the natural genetic diversity of the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex.
differences in the conservation of mitochondrial editing sites further support hybridization and cryptic speciation within the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex.
besides the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex, the funariaceae are host to their type species, funaria hygrometrica, featuring a sporophyte morphology which is more complex.
