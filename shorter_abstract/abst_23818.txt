the space occupied by neural  and glial, but excluding vascular elements of the neurovascular compartment was also measured in 100-Î¼m <dig> sample fields of both pvn subdivisions.
the role of the endothelial cell  in blood flow regulation within the central nervous system has been little studied.
the space occupied by the neural and glial elements of the neurovascular compartment did not show changes with lactation.
our findings suggest that during lactation the microvasculature of the pvn of female rats undergoes dynamic, transitory changes in blood flow as represented by an increment in the icd through a self-cytoplasmic volume modification reflected by ec changes.
we measured the inner capillary diameter  of  <dig> capillaries from either the magnocellular or parvocellular regions.
here, we explored ec participation in morphological changes of the anterior hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus  microvasculature of female rats at two reproductive stages with different metabolic demand .
