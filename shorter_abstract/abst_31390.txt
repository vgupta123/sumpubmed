accordingly, the effective computational discovery and analysis of such motifs is a central theme in bioinformatics.
the first is the maximum entropy distribution subject to mean information content, and the second is the truncated uniform distribution over all motifs having information content within a given interval.
in addition to positional information content, we consider the informational gini coefficient of the motif, a measure of the degree to which information is evenly distributed throughout a motif’s positions.
despite the historical centrality of biological sequence motif analysis, this study constitutes to our knowledge the first use of principled null hypotheses for sequence motifs given information content.

biological sequence motifs drive the specific interactions of proteins and nucleic acids.
in particular, we observe that biological sequence motifs show an unusual distribution of igc, presumably due to biochemical constraints on the mechanisms of direct read-out.
through their use, we are able to characterize for the first time differerences in global motif statistics between biological motifs and their null distributions.
we find that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic motifs tend to exhibit higher informational gini coefficients  than would be expected by chance under either reference distribution.
as a second application, we apply maximum entropy sampling to the motif p-value problem and use it to give elementary derivations of two new estimators.
