in this study, we focused our attention on cgis showing different dna methylation between two culture replicas of the same cell line.
we used methylation data of  <dig> cell lines from the encyclopedia of dna elements  consortium to identify cpg islands that were differentially methylated between replicas of the same cell line and denoted them inter replicas differentially methylated cpg islands .
we identified a group of irdm-cgis that was consistently shared by different cell lines, and denoted it common irdm-cgis.
our results show that several specific functional and structural features characterize common irdm-cgis.
x chromosome cgis were overrepresented among common irdm-cgis.
functional analysis of the genes associated with autosomal irdm-cgis showed that many of them are involved in dna binding and development.
differentially methylated regions  are genomic regions showing different degrees of dna methylation in multiple samples.
autosomal irdm-cgis were preferentially located in gene bodies and intergenic regions had a lower g + c content, a smaller mean length, and a reduced cpg percentage.
cpg dinucleotide-rich genomic dna regions, known as cpg islands , can be methylated at their cytosine residues as an epigenetic mark that is stably inherited during cell mitosis.
they may represent a specific subset of cgis that are more prone to being differentially methylated for their intrinsic characteristics.
