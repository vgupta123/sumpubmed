pathways such as mtor signaling, ppar/lxr/rxr signaling, and nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response are significantly differentially regulated in multiple tissues, indicative of cell growth and proliferation along with coordinated cell-protective stress responses.
consistent enrichment of the nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response indicates this pathway may be particularly important in mediating cellular stress during such extreme regenerative growth.
previous studies examining post-feeding organ regeneration in the burmese python  have identified thousands of genes that are significantly differentially regulated during this process.
these results suggest that largely divergent patterns of post-feeding gene regulation across tissues are mediated by a core set of higher-level signaling molecules.
however, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of coherent mechanisms and specific growth pathways that underlie these rapid and extensive shifts in organ form and function.
here we addressed these gaps by comparing gene expression in the burmese python heart, liver, kidney, and small intestine across pre- and post-feeding time points , and by conducting detailed analyses of molecular pathways and predictions of upstream regulatory molecules across these organ systems.
identified enriched canonical pathways and upstream regulators indicate that while downstream transcriptional responses are fairly tissue specific, a suite of core pathways and upstream regulator molecules are shared among responsive tissues.
