the x-rays, ct scans and blood tests were performed every two weeks.
based on the x-rays and ct scans, fracture healing or bone formation was observed to be faster in the control group.
fracture healing in bone gap is one of the major challenges encountered in orthopedic surgery.
based on the mechanism of their actions, we embarked on a study on the healing of a fractured ulna with bone gap in a rabbit model.
we created a 5 mm bone gap in the ulna bone, removing the periosteum as well.
at the end of six weeks, the rabbits were sacrificed, and the radius and ulna bones harvested for histopathological examination.
we segregated ten rabbits into two groups: five rabbits in the test group and five rabbits in the control group.
rabbits in the test group received 450 mg/kg of strontium ranelate via oral administration, daily, for six weeks.
none of the fractures united in the test group.
from the x-ray findings, 80 % of the fracture united and by ct scan, 60 % of the fracture united in the control group at the end of the six-week study.
the serum levels of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase initially remained similar up to three weeks and changed slightly at the end of six weeks.

new drugs are emerging in the markets such as anabolic bone-forming agents including teriparatide and strontium ranelate to stimulate bone growth.
at present, the treatment includes bone graft, employing either internal or external fixation which has a significant impact on the patient, family and even society.
