here we present a measure, called weighed domain architecture comparison , of domain architecture similarity, which can be used to identify homolog of multidomain proteins.
we found that wdac is better at identifying homology among multidomain proteins.
to distinguish these promiscuous domains from conventional protein domains, we assigned a weight score to pfam domain extracted from refseq proteins, based on its abundance and versatility.
however, these methods are challenged by large families defined by 'promiscuous'  domains.
we combined sequence similarity with domain architecture comparisons to identify proteins belonging to the same domain architecture.
our analysis indicates that considering domain weight scores in domain architecture comparisons improves protein homology identification.
the general method used to determine the function of newly discovered proteins is to transfer annotations from well-characterized homologous proteins.
the process of selecting homologous proteins can largely be classified into sequence-based and domain-based approaches.
to measure the similarity of two domain architectures, cosine similarity  is used.
using human and nematode proteomes, we compared wdac with an unweighted domain architecture method  to evaluate the effectiveness of domain weight scores.
we developed a web-based server to allow users to compare their proteins with protein domain architectures.
