dictyostelium discoideum is a social amoeba that exhibits cooperative behavior in the construction of a multicellular fruiting body.
cheater strains can be generated in the lab or found in the wild and genetic analyses have shown that cheating behavior can be achieved through many pathways.
when mixed in equal proportions with parental strain cells, chtb mutants contributed almost 60% of the total number of spores.
when two strains of d. discoideum are mixed, a cheater strain can exploit its social partner by differentiating more spore than its fair share relative to stalk cells.
we found no obvious fitness costs  associated with the cheating ability of the chtb knockout.
moreover, under lab conditions, we did not detect any fitness costs associated with this behavior.
we have characterized the knockout mutant chtb, which was isolated from a screen for cheater mutants that were also able to form normal fruiting bodies on their own.
to do so, chtb cells inhibit wild type cells from becoming spores, as indicated by counts and by the wild type cellsâ€™ reduced expression of the prespore gene, cotb.
in this study we describe a new gene in d. discoideum, chtb, which when knocked out inhibits the parental strain from producing spores.
