the aim of this study was two-fold; firstly, we aimed to determine whether progesterone delivery via osmotic mini-pump would confer neuroprotective effects and whether such neuroprotection could be produced in co-morbid animals.
in hypertensive animals, progesterone treatment lowered neurological deficit , reduced contralateral/ipsilateral alternation ratio %  and time taken to complete trials  for t-maze.
post-ischemic progesterone administration via mini-pump delivery is effective in conferring functional improvement in a transient mcao model in adult mice.
mice were allowed to survive for up to 7Â days post-ischaemia and assessed for general well-being , neurological score, foot fault and t-maze performance.
however, in hypertensive mice, who received post-ischemic progesterone intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion had better functional outcomes than control hypertensive mice.
progesterone reduced neurological deficit  and number of contralateral foot-faults  in adult, but not aged animals, following ischaemia.
