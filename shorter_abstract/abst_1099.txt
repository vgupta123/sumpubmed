supernatants of c. albicans or indirect coculture with c. albicans induces upregulation of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression.
our analysis of signal transduction events demonstrate a functional interaction of epithelial cells with pmns in response to candida infection involving divergent signalling events that differentially govern hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression.
however, under certain conditions it may cause life-threatening infections like candida sepsis.
we used the esophageal cell line oe <dig> and analysed the role of paracrine signals from polymorphonuclear leukocytes  in an in vitro model of esophageal candidiasis.
we therefore studied the role of candidate signalling pathways in order to understand the mechanisms involved in regulation of hbd-expression by c. albicans.
pmns strongly amplifies c. albicans-mediated induction of hbds.
by emsa we demonstrate that c. albicans activates nf-κb and ap- <dig> in oe <dig> cells.
human β-defensins  are critical components of host defense at mucosal surfaces and we have recently shown that hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> are upregulated in candida esophagitis.
