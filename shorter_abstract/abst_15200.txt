our results provide, for the first time, a number of molecular, histological and physiological markers that characterize the different stages of ar formation in this species and that could be used to monitor adventitious rooting on a wide collection of carnation germplasm with the aim to identify the best-rooting cultivars for breeding purposes.
adventitious root  formation is a critical step in vegetative propagation of most ornamental plants, such as carnation.
by whole transcriptome sequencing, we identified the genes involved in ar formation in carnation cuttings and in response to exogenous auxin.
ar formation from stem cuttings is usually divided into several stages according to physiological and metabolic markers.
their expression profiles have been analysed through rna-seq during a time-course experiment in the stem cutting base of two cultivars with contrasting efficiencies of ar formation.
auxin is often applied exogenously to promote the development of ars on stem cuttings of difficult-to-root genotypes.
