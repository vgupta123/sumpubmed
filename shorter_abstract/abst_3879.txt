salt stress, oxidative stress, and starvation, but not heat shock, induce the relocalization of ubiquitin, proteasome, and the tiar- <dig> protein into distinct subnuclear regions referred to as stress induced nuclear granules .

the heat shock results suggest that chaperone expression can prevent sing formation and that the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins is a necessary precursor to sing formation.
this study examines the cellular response to environmental stress in the germline of the nematode, c. elegans.
environmental stressors may affect the genome or the proteome and can cause cellular distress by contributing to protein damage or misfolding.
the data suggest an interesting model where sings represent sites of localized protein degradation for nuclear or cytosolic proteins.
stressed embryos containing sings fail to hatch and cell division in these embryos is halted.
the formation of sings can be prevented by pre-exposure to a brief period of heat shock before stress exposure.
heat shock inhibition of sings is dependent upon the hsf- <dig> transcription factor.
the sings form within 1 h of stress initiation and do not require intertissue signaling.
environmental stress can affect the viability or fecundity of an organism.
thus, the physiological impacts of environmental stress may begin at the cellular level with the formation of stress induced nuclear granules.
worms with a mutation in the conjugating enzyme, ubc- <dig>  do not form sings.
