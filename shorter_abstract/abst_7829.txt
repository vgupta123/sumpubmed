the meiotic developmental pathway in yeast enables both differentiation of vegetative cells into haploid spores that ensure long-term survival, and recombination of the parental dna to create genetic diversity.
metabolic regulation during meiotic differentiation in budding yeast was analyzed by integrating information on genome-wide transcriptional activity,  <dig> enzymatic activities in the central metabolism, the dynamics of  <dig> metabolites, and a metabolic flux analysis at mid-stage meiosis.
the correlation between transcript levels and enzymatic activities in the central metabolism varies significantly in a developmental stage-dependent manner.
despite the importance of proper metabolic regulation for the supply of building blocks and energy, little is known about the reprogramming of central metabolic pathways in meiotically differentiating cells during passage through successive developmental stages.
the complete loss of phosphofructokinase activity at mid-stage meiosis enables a unique setup of the glycolytic pathway which facilitates carbon flux repartitioning into synthesis of spore wall precursors during the co-assimilation of glycogen and acetate.
the need for correct homeostasis of purine nucleotides during the meiotic differentiation was demonstrated by the sporulation defect of the amp deaminase mutant amd <dig>  which exhibited hyper-accumulation of atp accompanied by depletion of guanosine nucleotides.
our systems-level analysis shows that reprogramming of the central metabolism during the meiotic differentiation is controlled at different hierarchical levels to meet the metabolic and energetic needs at successive developmental stages.
