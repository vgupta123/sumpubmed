this indicates that secondary structure plays an important role in the selection of cleavage site.
5- <dig> april  <dig> tenth annual mcbios conference.
in this study, a novel method has been developed to predict dicer cleavage sites on pre-mirnas using support vector machine.
we used the dataset of experimentally validated human mirna hairpins from mirbase, and extracted fourteen nucleotides around dicer cleavage sites.
based on this study, we developed a webserver phdcleav  to predict dicer cleavage sites in pre-mirna.
the prediction performance of dicer cleavage site improved significantly from 66% to 86% when we integrated secondary structure information.
a precise cleavage by dicer is crucial because an inaccurate processing can produce mirna with different seed regions which can alter the repertoire of target genes.
we developed number of models using various types of features and achieved maximum accuracy of 66% using binary profile of nucleotide sequence taken from 5p arm of hairpin.
moreover, it would also be useful in the discovery of mirnas in human genome and design of dicer specific pre-mirnas for potent gene silencing.
dicer, an rnase iii enzyme, plays a vital role in the processing of pre-mirnas for generating the mirnas.
all models were trained and tested on  <dig> experimentally validated cleavage sites and evaluated using 5-fold cross validation technique.
this tool can be used to investigate functional consequences of genetic variations/snps in mirna on dicer cleavage site, and gene silencing.
