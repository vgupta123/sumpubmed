in order to test these expectations, we performed phylogenetic analyses and tested for correlations among body size, habitat choice, range sizes, and diversification rates in the pachydactylus group.
in the pachydactylus group, one possible explanation is a history of diversification via geographic isolation.
both body size and habitat use are inferred to have shifted multiple times across the phylogeny of the pachydactylus group, with large size and generalist habitat use being ancestral for the group.
therefore, the pachydactylus group may represent an intermediate between clades in which radiation is adaptive versus those in which it is non-adaptive.
rock-dwelling and small body size are also associated with higher rates of diversification, and subclades retaining ancestral conditions for these traits are less species rich than subclades in which shifts to small body size and rocky habitat use have occurred.
geckos of the genus pachydactylus and their close relatives comprise the most species-rich clade of lizards in sub-saharan africa.
the results are consistent with a model in which lineages more likely to become geographically isolated diversify to a greater extent, although some patterns also resemble those expected of an adaptive radiation in which ecological divergence acts as a driver of speciation.
if geographic isolation has played a key role in facilitating diversification, then we expect species in more species-rich subclades to have smaller ranges than species in less diverse subclades.
we also expect traits promoting geographic isolation to be correlated with small geographic ranges.
