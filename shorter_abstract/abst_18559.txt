effective generation of patterned 3d cultures will lead to improved cell study results by better modeling in vivo growth environments and increasing efficiency and specificity of cell studies.
cell biology is also tending toward miniaturization for increased efficiency and specificity.
use of simplified growth scaffolds such as peptide-derived hydrogel should be seen as highly advantageous and will likely become more commonplace in cell culture methodology.
phenylalanine derivative hydrogel formation was seen to occur in multiple dispersion media.
cells were immobilized in situ within microchambers designed for cell analysis.
such realistic environments should be the aim of any cell growth study, requiring new methods for culturing cells in vitro.
