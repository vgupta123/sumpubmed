it is based on a combination of genomic signals, based on what is known from wet-lab experiments, whose contribution is precisely quantified.
meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes provides natural combinations of genetic variations and is a main driving force of evolution.
when compared to saccharomyces cerevisiae experimental data, spore predicts axis protein and dsb positions with high sensitivity and precision, axis protein density with an average local correlation r= <dig>  and dsb density with an average local correlation r= <dig> .
spore is a mathematical model that describes the non-uniform localisation of dsb and axis proteins sites, and distinguishes high versus low protein density.
it models dsb accumulation at approximated gene promoter positions with intergenic region length and gc-content.
it is initiated via programmed dna double-strand breaks  and involves a specific axial chromosomal structure.
spore outbreaks previous dsb predictors, which are based on nucleotide patterning, and it reaches 85% of success rate in dsb prediction compared to 54% obtained by available tools on a benchmarked dataset.
