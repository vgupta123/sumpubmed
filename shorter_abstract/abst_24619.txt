the software, including the source code, the clustering results for cog and coryneregnet, and all evaluation datasets are available at .
today, new sequencing technologies provide huge amounts of sequence data that has to be efficiently clustered with constant or increased accuracy, at increased speed.
we present the force heuristic that is based on transitive graph projection and clusters arbitrary sets of objects, given pairwise similarity measures.
its theoretical foundation, weighted cluster editing, can outperform other clustering paradigms on protein homology clustering.
furthermore, we show that force is able to handle huge datasets by calculating clusters for all  <dig>  <dig> prokaryotic protein sequences  obtained from the cog database.
