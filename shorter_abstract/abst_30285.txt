the stability of nine rgs through vegf treatment as well as the donor variation was assessed using the genex software with the subprograms genorm and normfinder.
normfinder found the tata box binding protein  to be the most stable single rg for both bmscs and ascs.
human mesenchymal stromal cells from the bone marrow  are widely used as experimental regenerative treatment of ischemic heart disease, and the first clinical trials using adipose-derived stromal cells  are currently being conducted.
the optimal number of rgs for ascs was two, and the lowest variance for vwf normalization was found using tbp and ywhaz.
for bmscs, the optimal number of rgs was four, while the two-rg combination producing the most similar results was tbp and ywhaz.
when characterizing the transcriptional activity of these cellular mechanisms in vitro it is important to consider the effect of the growth factor treatment on reference genes  for the normalization of qpcr data.
a common reference gene, tbp, was found to be the most stable standalone gene, while tbp and ywhaz were found to be the best two-rg combination for qpcr analyses for both bmscs and ascs through the vegf stimulation.
the procedure of stepwise elimination was validated by poor performance of eliminated rgs in a normalization experiment using vwf as target gene.
the presented stepwise elimination procedure was validated, while we found the final normalization experiment to be essential.
