interestingly, several eubacterial species have multiple pathways, while eukaryotes have only the tps/tpp pathway.
we have demonstrated that trehalose biosynthesis pathways are widely distributed in nature.
however, in recent years it has been shown that although higher plants do not accumulate trehalose at significant levels they have actively transcribed genes encoding the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes.
tps and tpp domains have evolved mainly in parallel and it is likely that they have experienced several instances of gene duplication and lateral gene transfer.
the compatible solute trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide, which accumulates upon heat, cold or osmotic stress.
we present phylogenetic analyses of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase  and trehalose-phosphatase  domains and show that there is a close evolutionary relationship between these domains in proteins from diverse organisms.
