systematic analysis of expression profiles of zebrafish small rnaome will be greatly helpful for understanding the srna regulation during embryonic development.
we also predicted  <dig> potentially novel mirnas, whereas two candidates were verified by northern blots.
our study not only generated a better understanding for srna regulations in early zebrafish development, but also provided a useful platform for analyzing srna-seq data.
to evaluate the computational accuracy, the expression levels of four known mirnas were experimentally validated.
integrative analyses with a new computational platform of csz  demonstrated an srna class transition from pirnas to mirnas as development proceeds.
during early vertebrate development, various small non-coding rnas  such as micrornas  and piwi-interacting rnas  are dynamically expressed for orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition .
taken together, our analyses revealed the pirna to mirna transition as a conserved mechanism in zebrafish, although two different types of srnas exhibit distinct expression dynamics in abundance and diversity, respectively.
we first determined the expression profiles of srnas during eight distinct stages of early zebrafish development by srna-seq technology.
