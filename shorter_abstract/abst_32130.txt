therefore, the cross-reactivity of the applied tbev serology test systems – enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  and virus neutralization test  – as well as the longevity of tbev antibody titres in sheep and goats were investigated in this study.
to assess the longevity of tbev antibody titres, sera from two sheep and two goats, which had been immunized four times with a commercially available tbev vaccine, were tested routinely over 28 months.
interestingly, in most cases the results of the former investigations were confirmed, which may be caused by steadily existing natural tbev foci.
furthermore, over-interpretation of single tbev-positive serological results should be avoided, especially in areas without a tbev history.
in three of the four animals, tbev-specific antibody titres could be detected over the whole test period.
by using animal sera as sentinels, natural tbev foci could be identified and further analyses including investigations of ticks could be initiated.
