presence of strong sgd has been observed not only in genomes having pas, but also in genomes with g-dominance along their leading strands – an observation that defies the notion of co-occurrence of pas and sgd in firmicutes.
co-occurrence of pas, strong sgd and polc should not be regarded as a genome signature of the firmicutes.
presence of pas in a species may warrant polc and strong sgd, but polc and/or sgd not necessarily implies pas.
the polc-containing non-firmicutes organisms often have alternate stretches of r-dominant and y-dominant sequences along their genomes and most of them show relatively weak, but significant sgd.
there are five major compositional trends in firmicutes:  an explicit pas or g + a-dominance along the entire leading strand  only g-dominance in the leading strand,  alternate stretches of purine-rich and pyrimidine-rich sequences,  g + t dominance along the leading strand, and  no identifiable patterns in base usage.
firmicutes having g + a-dominance or g-dominance along les usually show distinct base usage patterns in three codon sites of genes.

the firmicutes often possess three conspicuous genome features: marked purine asymmetry  across two strands of replication, strand-biased gene distribution  and presence of two isoforms of dna polymerase iii alpha subunit, polc and dnae.
polc prevails in four bacterial phyla: firmicutes, fusobacteria, tenericutes and thermotogae, while pas occurs only in subsets of firmicutes, fusobacteria and tenericutes.
despite considerable research efforts, it is not clear whether the co-existence of pas, polc and/or sgd is an essential and exclusive characteristic of the firmicutes.
the present study has been designed to address these issues.
