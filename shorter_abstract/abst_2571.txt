altogether, this new expression system, that brings constant quality, sensitivity and unique versatility, will be important to broaden the use of recombinant and natural monoclonal antibodies both for laboratory and diagnosis use.
however, so far, recombinant antibodies have not managed to impose themselves as efficient alternatives to natural antibodies.
this series enables the fusion of single chain fv antibodies with human, mouse or rabbit fc so that a given antibody is no longer restricted to a particular species.
we developed a series of vectors that allow one to easily fuse single chain fv antibodies to fc domains of immunoglobulins, improving their sensitivity and facilitating their use.
this opens up unlimited multiplexing possibilities and gives additional value to recombinant antibodies.
