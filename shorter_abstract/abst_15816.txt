furthermore, we characterized these genes using gene ontology, molecular interactions and promoter sequence analysis.
down syndrome  is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation in the human population and key molecular networks dysregulated in ds are still unknown.
our study represents a comprehensive integrative analysis of heterogeneous data including genome-wide transcript levels in the domain of trisomy  <dig>  the detected dosage effects build a resource for further studies of ds pathology and the development of new therapies.
all results have been made available through a web server under http://ds-geneminer.molgen.mpg.de/.
many different experimental techniques have been applied to analyse the effects of dosage imbalance at the molecular and phenotypical level, however, currently no integrative approach exists that attempts to extract the common information.
we identified  <dig> genes with significant genome-wide dosage effects, including well investigated genes like sod <dig>  app, runx <dig> and dyrk1a as well as a large proportion of novel genes .
