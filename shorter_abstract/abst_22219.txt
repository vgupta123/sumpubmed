total anthocyanin content at full maturity correlated well with the cumulative expression of f3h, ufgt and gst throughout ripening.
cumulative mrna levels of the structural genes and their relative abundance throughout ripening explained per se the final phenotype for anthocyanin content, anthocyanin composition, colour intensity and colour hue of grapes at berry maturity.
expression of six genes of the anthocyanin pathway coding for flavanone-hydroxylase , flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase , flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase , udp-glucose:flavonoid-3-o-glucosyltransferase , glutathione-s-transferase , o-methyltransferase  and four transcription factors  was analysed by quantitative rt-pcr at four developmental stages from before the onset of ripening until full maturity and compared to anthocyanin metabolites.
transcripts of the last two genes were absent in the green-skinned cultivar 'sauvignonasse', also known as 'tocai friulano', and were at least 10-fold less abundant in pale red cultivars, such as 'pinot gris' and 'gew√ºrztraminer', compared to fully coloured cultivars.
we analysed a panel of nine cultivars that included extreme phenotypes for berry colour, ranging from green  to red, purple, violet and blue.
colour variation of the grape berry conforms to a peculiar pattern of genotype-specific expression of the whole set of anthocyanin genes in a direct transcript-metabolite-phenotype relationship.
