we characterized this evolutionary event during experimental evolution for only  <dig> generations of an escherichia coli strain under glucose limitation within chemostats.

here we analyzed an unequal duplication harboring a beneficial mutation that may provide alternative evolutionary outcomes.
our results suggest that the duplication state may constitute a second order selection process providing higher evolutionary potential.
our results also highlighted how careful analyses of whole genome data are needed to identify such complex rearrangements.
this evolved duplication revealed a heterozygous state, with one copy harboring a  <dig> bp deletion that included part of the ogrk gene and both the yegr and yegs genes.
nonetheless, the heterozygous duplicated state was relatively stable in the conditions prevailing during evolution in chemostats, in striking contrast to non selective conditions in which the duplication resolved at high frequency into either its ancestral or deleted copy.
