our results suggest possible phenotypic manifestations for proteins biochemically associated with sugar metabolism and electron transport.
here we utilize a systematic approach to discover genotype-phenotype associations that combines phenotypic information from a biomedical informatics database, gideon, with the molecular information contained in national center for biotechnology information's clusters of orthologous groups database .
