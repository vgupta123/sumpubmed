here, we describe a modification of the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification , called extension-mlpa , which enables quantification of relatively small differences in dna that are a consequence of cre-mediated recombination.
these models frequently rely on cre-mediated recombination of sequences flanked by lox-p sites.
emlpa is a novel strategy which easily can be applied to measure the cre-mediated recombination efficiency in each experimental case with high accuracy.
emlpa, here applied on an inducible pkd <dig> conditional deletion mouse model, simultaneously measures both the reduction of the floxed allele and the increase of the deletion allele in a single reaction thereby minimizing any type of experimental variation.
interestingly, with this method we were also able to observe the presence of the excised dna fragment.
to understand the consequences of gene disruption, it is essential to know the efficiency of the recombination process.
this extra-chromosomal deletion-circle was detectable up to  <dig> months after activation of cre.
