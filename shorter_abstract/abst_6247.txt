the global role of arca in e. coli is well characterized; however, little is known about its role in anaerobically grown s. typhimurium.
regulation by arca in s. typhimurium is similar, but distinct from that in e. coli.
however, genes/operons present in both organisms, but regulated differently by arca in s. typhimurium included those coding for ethanolamine utilization, lactate transport and metabolism, and succinate dehydrogenases.
we have identified the arca regulon in anaerobically grown s. typhimurium.
our results demonstrated that in s. typhimurium, arca serves as a transcriptional regulator coordinating cellular metabolism, flagella biosynthesis, and motility.
furthermore, arca and fnr share in the regulation of  <dig> s. typhimurium genes.
we compared the transcriptional profiles of the virulent wild-type  strain  and its isogenic arca mutant grown under anaerobic conditions.
in agreement with our microarray data, the arca mutant was non-motile, lacked flagella, and was as virulent in mice as the wt.
salmonella-specific genes/operons regulated by arca included those required for propanediol utilization, flagellar genes , gifsy- <dig> prophage genes, and three spi- <dig> genes .
in escherichia coli, arca  helps the cells to sense and respond to the presence of dioxygen.
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  is a gram-negative pathogen that must successfully adapt to the broad fluctuations in the concentration of dissolved dioxygen encountered in the host.
