for the assignment of kinetic rate laws, however, this process is not straightforward, as it often requires manual assembly and specific knowledge of kinetic equations.
sbmlsqueezer facilitates exactly this modeling step via automated equation generation, overcoming the highly error-prone and cumbersome process of manually assigning kinetic equations.
sbmlsqueezer considers the annotation of all participating reactants, products and regulators when generating rate laws for reactions.
these kinetics allow sbmlsqueezer to cover metabolic, gene regulatory, signal transduction and mixed networks.
after invoking sbmlsqueezer, the kinetic formulas are generated and assigned to the model, which can then be simulated in celldesigner or with external ode solvers.
thus, for each reaction, only applicable kinetic formulas are considered.
for each reaction the kinetic equation is derived from the stoichiometry, the participating species  as well as the regulatory relations  of the sbgn diagram.
whenever multiple kinetics are applicable to one reaction, parameter settings allow for user-defined specifications.
