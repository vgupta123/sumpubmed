this higher clearance ability of lrrk2-ko microglia was thought to be due to an increase of rab5-positive endosomes, but not rab7- or rab11-positive endosomes.
in lrrk2-ko microglia, αsyn was taken up in larger amounts and cleared from the supernatant more effectively than for microglia isolated from wild-type  mice.
increased engagement between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig> was also observed in lrrk2-ko microglia.
in the brain, microglial αsyn clearance is closely related to neuronal survival.
in this study, we investigated αsyn clearance by microglia isolated from lrrk2-knockout  mice.
our findings reveal a new functional role of lrrk <dig> in microglia and offer a new insight into the mechanism of pd pathogenesis.
lrrk <dig> negatively regulates the clearance of αsyn accompanied by down-regulation of the endocytosis pathway.
