however, its impact on epigenetic mechanisms has not been elucidated, and more specifically, little information is available regarding genome-wide dna methylation changes in cancer cells after ir exposure.
we screened for differential dna methylation changes in colorectal cancer cells after ir exposure with  <dig> and 5Â gy.
twenty-nine genes showed radiation-induced hypomethylation in colon cancer cells, and of those, seven genes showed a corresponding increase in gene expression by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction .
ir is a well-known genotoxic agent and human carcinogen that induces cellular damage through direct and indirect mechanisms.
exposure to ionizing radiation  results in the simultaneous activation or downregulation of multiple signaling pathways that play critical roles in cell type-specific control of survival or death.
in this study, we employed this technology to test the hypothesis that exposure to ir not only induces differential dna methylation patterns at a genome-wide level, but also results in locus- and gene-specific dna methylation changes.
we identified alterations in global dna methylation patterns and hypomethylation at specific cancer-related genes following ir exposure, which suggests that radiation exposure plays a critical role in conferring epigenetic alterations in cancer.
in addition, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  to confirm that the dna-methyltransferase  <dig>  level associated with the promoter regions of these genes correlated with their methylation level and gene expression changes.
this improved technology is capable of identifying genome-wide dna methylation changes in cpg islands and other cpg island-associated regions.
recently, genome-wide dna methylation profiling technology using the illumina humanmethylation450k platform has emerged that allows us to query > <dig>  loci within the genome.
