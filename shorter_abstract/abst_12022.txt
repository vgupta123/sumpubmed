in the present study, we used  <dig> technology  to determine the complete mt genome of haemonchus contortus , a parasite of substantial agricultural, veterinary and economic significance.
the present study demonstrates the utility of  <dig> technology for the rapid determination of mt genome sequences from tiny amounts of dna and reveals a wealth of mt genomic data in current databases available for mining.
the complete mt genome of haemonchus contortus was sequenced directly from long-pcr amplified template utilizing genomic dna  from a single adult male using  <dig> technology.
the comparison demonstrated that the  <dig> technology platform is reliable for the sequencing of at-rich mt genomes from nematodes.
the mt genome sequenced for haemonchus contortus was  <dig>  bp in length and was highly at-rich .
in accordance with other chromadorean nematodes studied to date, the mt genome of h. contortus contained  <dig> genes  and was similar in structure, size and gene arrangement to those characterized previously for members of the strongylida.
this approach provides a novel platform for high-throughput sequencing of mt genomes from nematodes and other organisms.
