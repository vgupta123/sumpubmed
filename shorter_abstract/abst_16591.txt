after combination of the search results and optional flagging for different experimental conditions, the results can be browsed and further inspected.
the pipeline allows integrating peptide identifications from various algorithms and emphasizes the visualization of spectral counts from different experimental conditions.
from a given genome sequence, a na√Øve six frame translation is performed and, if desired, a decoy database generated.
intermediate and final results can be exported into gff <dig> format for visualization in common genome browsers.
the bacterial proteogenomic pipeline, which is completely written in java, alleviates the conducting of proteogenomic analyses of bacteria.
to facilitate proteogenomics analyses the bacterial proteogenomic pipeline is a set of comprehensive tools running on common desktop computers, written in java and thus platform independent.
this database is used to identify ms/ms spectra by common peptide identification algorithms.
