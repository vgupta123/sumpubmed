healthmap is part of a new generation of online systems designed to monitor and visualize, on a real-time basis, disease outbreak alerts as reported by online news media and public health sources.
the results of this analysis provide a framework for future automated global surveillance efforts that reduce manual input and improve timeliness of reporting.
a particular task that makes such a surveillance useful is the automated discovery of the geographic references contained in the retrieved outbreak alerts.
given that human readers perform this kind of task by using both their lexical and contextual knowledge, we developed an approach which relies on a relatively small expert-built gazetteer, thus limiting the need of human input, but focuses on learning the context in which geographic references appear.
we show in a set of experiments, that this approach exhibits a substantial capacity to discover geographic locations outside of its initial lexicon.
