targetspy predictions for classes ii and iii are generated by appropriate postfiltering.
it is based on machine learning and automatic feature selection using a wide spectrum of compositional, structural, and base pairing features covering current biological knowledge.
on a human dataset revealing fold-change in protein production for five selected micrornas our method shows superior performance in all classes.
moreover, we have demonstrated that the application of machine learning techniques in combination with upcoming deep sequencing data results in a powerful microrna target site prediction tool http://www.targetspy.org.
recently however, it has been shown that this requirement might be too stringent, leading to a substantial number of missed target sites.
we developed targetspy, a novel computational approach for predicting target sites regardless of the presence of a seed match.
we estimate that targetspy predicts between  <dig> and  <dig> functional target sites without a seed match per microrna that are missed by all other currently available algorithms.
only a few algorithms can predict target sites without demanding a seed match and targetspy demonstrates a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy in that class.
in drosophila melanogaster not only our class ii and iii predictions are on par with other algorithms, but notably the class i  predictions are just marginally less accurate.
our model does not rely on evolutionary conservation, which allows the detection of species-specific interactions and makes targetspy suitable for analyzing unconserved genomic sequences.
