in this paper, we present a four-phase method for extracting and annotating primer/probe sequences from the literature.
the biological literature is the main information source for empirically validated primer and probe sequences.
these phases are:  convert each document into a tree of paper sections,  detect the candidate sequences using a set of finite state machine-based recognizers,  refine problem sequences using a rule-based expert system, and  annotate the extracted sequences with their related organism/gene information.
the results of the evaluation show that our approach is suitable for automatically extracting dna sequences, achieving precision/recall rates of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.
we believe that the proposed method can facilitate routine tasks for biomedical researchers using molecular methods to diagnose and prescribe different infectious diseases.
in addition,  <dig> % of the detected sequences were correctly annotated with their organism name.
the system also provided correct gene-related information for  <dig> % of the sequences assigned a correct organism name.
primer and probe sequences are the main components of nucleic acid-based detection systems.
biologists use primers and probes for different tasks, some related to the diagnosis and prescription of infectious diseases.
in addition, the proposed method can be expanded to detect and extract other biological sequences from the literature.
