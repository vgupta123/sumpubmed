essential and critical genes are enriched for fundamental cellular housekeeping functions, such as acyl-trna biosynthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and glycolysis.
we report development, testing, and results from a tn-seq system for use in streptococcus agalactiae , an important cause of neonatal sepsis.
we believe that our baseline fitness assignments will be a valuable tool for gbs researchers and that our system has the potential to reveal key pathogenesis gene networks and potential therapeutic/preventative targets.
next-generation sequencing of transposon-genome junctions from a saturated bacterial mutant library  is a powerful tool that permits genome-wide determination of the contribution of genes to fitness of the organism under a wide range of experimental conditions.
after statistical analysis of transposon insertion density and distribution, we identified  <dig>  % of genes as essential and  <dig>  % as critical, with high levels of reproducibility.
in order to establish the gbs essential genome, we performed tn-seq on dna collected from three independent mutant libraries—with at least  <dig>  mutants per library—at serial  <dig> h time points after outgrowth in rich media.
