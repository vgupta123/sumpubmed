we then study the successive jumps of the coverage function, and show that they can be encoded as a random tree that is approximately a galton-watson tree with generation-dependent geometric offspring distributions whose parameters can be computed.
we study the statistical properties of fragment coverage in genome sequencing experiments.
we extend standard analyses of shotgun sequencing that focus on coverage statistics at individual sites, and provide a null model for detecting deviations from random coverage in high-throughput sequence census based experiments.
