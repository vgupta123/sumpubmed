we established the distribution of  <dig> genes coding sensors and adhesins in a large collection of xanthomonad strains.
we hypothesised that determinants responsible for bacterial host adaptation are expressed starting from the establishment of chemotactic attraction and adhesion on host tissue.
candidate genes are involved in chemotactic attraction , chemical environment sensing , and adhesion .
the correspondence between repertoires of sensor and adhesin genes and pathovars and the rapid evolution of sensors and adhesins shows that, for plant pathogenic xanthomonads, events leading to host specificity may occur as early as chemotactic attraction by host and adhesion to tissues.
most pathovars were characterized by unique repertoires of candidate genes, highlighting a correspondence between pathovar clustering and repertoires of sensors and adhesins.
these  <dig> strains belong to different pathovars of xanthomonas spp and display different host ranges.
our study revealed that candidate gene repertoires comprised core and variable gene suites that likely have distinct roles in host adaptation.
bacterial plant pathogens belonging to the xanthomonas genus are tightly adapted to their host plants and are not known to colonise other environments.
these data provide insight into the potential role played by sensors and adhesins in the adaptation of xanthomonads to their host plants.
to further challenge our hypothesis, we tested for molecular signatures of selection on candidate genes extracted from sequenced genomes of strains belonging to different pathovars.
we found strong evidence of adaptive divergence acting on most candidate genes.
