in response to dna damage or structural alterations of chromatin, histone h2ax may be phosphorylated on ser <dig> by phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinases  such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated , atm-and rad- <dig> related  kinase, or by dna dependent protein kinase .
when dna damage primarily involves formation of dna double-strand breaks , h2ax is preferentially phosphorylated by atm rather than by the other pikks.
these data implicate atm as the pikk that phosphorylates h2ax in response to dna damage caused by cs.
when cells were exposed to cs from cigarettes with different tobacco and filter combinations, the expression levels of atm-s1981p correlated well with the increase in expression of phosphorylated h2ax  .
based on current understanding of atm activation, expression and localization, these data would suggest that, in addition to inducing potentially carcinogenic dsb lesions, cs may also trigger other types of dna lesions and cause chromatin alterations.
we have recently reported that brief exposure of human pulmonary adenocarcinoma a <dig> cells or normal human bronchial epithelial cells  to cigarette smoke  induced phosphorylation of h2ax.
we report here that h2ax phosphorylation in a <dig> cells induced by cs was accompanied by activation of atm, as revealed by atm phosphorylation on ser <dig>  detected immunocytochemically and by western blotting.
in addition, we note that while cs-induced Î³h2ax expression was localized within discrete foci, the activated atm was distributed throughout the nucleoplasm.
no cell cycle-phase specific differences in kinetics of atm activation and h2ax phosphorylation were observed.
