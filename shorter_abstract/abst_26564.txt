tocopherols, which are vitamin e compounds, play an important role in maintaining human health.
an integrated genetic linkage map was constructed using  <dig> snp markers, spanning a total of  <dig>  cm of the maize genome with an average interval of  <dig>  cm.
in these two maps, qtls for different traits were localized to the same genomic regions and some were co-located with candidate genes in the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway.
these results demonstrate that a few qtls with major effects and several qtls with medium to minor effects might contribute to the natural variation of tocopherols in maize grain.
a major qtl  affecting Î±-tocopherol  was identified on chromosome  <dig> between the pza <dig>  and pza <dig>  in the pop- <dig>  the qtl region was narrowed down from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb by estimating the recombination using high-density markers of the qtl region.
the high-density markers will help to fine map and identify the qtls with major effects even in the preliminary segregating populations.
single qtl was responsible for  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation and the qtls in sum explained <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation.
compared with other staple foods, maize grains contain high level of tocopherols.
two f <dig> populations , which share a common parent , were developed and genotyped using a goldengate assay containing  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphism  markers.
