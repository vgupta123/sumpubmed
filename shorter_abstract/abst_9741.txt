split samples and inclusion of duplicates within each processing group allowed us to undertake a formal genome-wide analysis comparing the magnitude of result variation contributed by sample source , processing protocol , and random background .
primary human tissues are an invaluable widely used tool for discovery of gene expression patterns which characterize disease states.
patient subjects provided the greatest sources of variation in the mixed model anova, with replicates and processing method the least.
the dataset was randomly permuted to define a baseline pattern of anova test statistic values against which the observed results could be interpreted.
subset analysis of the test statistic according to gene functional class showed that the frequency of "outlier" anova results within each functional class is overall no greater than expected by chance.
ambient storage of tissues for  <dig> or  <dig> hours in rnalater did not contribute any systematic shift in quantitative rna expression results relative to the alternatives of fresh or frozen tissue.
tissue processing methods remain unstandardized, leading to unanswered concerns of how to best store collected tissues and maintain reproducibility between laboratories.
we subdivided uterine myometrial tissue specimens and stored split aliquots using the most common tissue processing methods  before comparing quantitative rna expression profiles on the affymetrix u <dig> human expression array.
the magnitude of variation conferred by processing method  was similar to the variability seen within replicates.
