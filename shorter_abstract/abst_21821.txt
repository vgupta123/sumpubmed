recently unsupervised clustering algorithms have been proposed to identify gene-sets from transcriptomics datasets deposited in public domain.
we validate our gene-sets and demonstrate that by identifying genes associated with multiple gene-sets, fcm clustering algorithm significantly improves interpretation of transcriptomic data facilitating investigation of novel biological processes by leveraging on transcriptomic data available in the public domain.
despite advances in the gene-set enrichment analysis methods; inadequate definitions of gene-sets cause a major limitation in the discovery of novel biological processes from the transcriptomic datasets.

specifically, we apply our pipeline to derive gene-sets from transcriptomic data measuring response of monocyte derived dendritic cells and a <dig> epithelial cells to influenza infections.

we develop an interactive ‘fuzzy inference of gene-sets ’ package  to facilitate use of of pipeline.
our approach apply ward’s method for the selection of initial conditions, optimize parameters of fcm algorithm for human cell-specific transcriptomic data and identify robust gene-sets along with versatile viral responsive genes.
we developed a pipeline using fuzzy-c-means  soft clustering approach to identify gene-sets which recapitulates topological characteristics of biological pathways.
however, the previously proposed algorithms for identification of data-driven gene-sets are based on hard clustering which do not allow overlap across clusters, a characteristic that is predominantly observed across biological pathways.
