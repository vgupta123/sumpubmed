thus, cortisol levels could be monitored and managed in older people, to decrease their risk of ad type hippocampal dysfunction.
aging induced a 12% decrease in hippocampus activity , increased to 30% by acute and 40% by chronic elevations in cortisol.
both acute and chronic elevations in cortisol secretion increased aging-associated hippocampal atrophy and a loss of ha in the model.
acute increases in plasma cortisol are associated with transient hippocampal inhibition and retrograde amnesia, while chronic cortisol elevation is associated with hippocampal atrophy.
we generated an in silicomodel of the chronic effects of elevated plasma cortisol on hippocampal activity and atrophy, using the systems biology mark-up language .
the in silicosbml model reflected the in vivoaging of the hippocampus and increased plasma cortisol and negative feedback to the hypothalamic pituitary axis.
the biological intervention attenuated the cortisol associated decrease in ha by 2% in the acute cortisol simulation and by 8% in the chronic simulation.
we further challenged the model with biologically based interventions to ascertain if cortisol associated hippocampal dysfunction could be abrogated.
