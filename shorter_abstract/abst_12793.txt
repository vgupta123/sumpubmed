a comparison of the phylogenetic tree of our roo and rooa elements shows that the split between roo and rooa took place early in drosophila evolution.
furthermore there is one incongruency between the species tree and the phylogenetic tree of the roo element.
we discuss the possibility of a horizontal gene transfer of roo within this clade.
within genomes, the evolutionary dynamics of roo and rooa range from recent transpositional activity to slow decay and extinction.
this incongruency regards the placement of elements from d. mojavensis, which are more closely related to d. melanogaster than elements from d. willistoni.
most of our roo and rooa elements have been recently inserted.
among genomes, the balance of phylogenetic evidence, sequence divergence distribution, and the occurrence of solo-ltr elements suggests an origin of roo/rooa within the drosophila clade.
