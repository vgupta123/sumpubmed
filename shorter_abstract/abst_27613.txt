the lysis-lysogeny decision in the temperate coliphage λ is influenced by a number of phage proteins  as well as host factors, viz.
we propose that a yet unidentified cii-stabilizing factor in λ may influence the lysis-lysogeny decision in Δhflkc cells.
nevertheless, we also obtained turbid plaques when a Δhflkc host was infected by a ciii-defective phage .
however, when λ infects Δhflkc cells, turbid plaques are produced, indicating stabilization of cii under these conditions.
