high-throughput systems for gene expression profiling have been developed and have matured rapidly through the past decade.
based on different principles, hybridization-based and sequencing-based technologies should be considered complementary to each other, rather than competitive alternatives for measuring gene expression, and currently, both are important tools for transcriptome profiling.
with data from different technologies being accumulated, concerns and challenges are raised about the level of agreement across technologies.
the variation found between pooled biological replicates underlines the importance of exercising caution in identification of differential expression, especially for the purposes of biomarker discovery.
