the present study used comparative genomics to examine the different pathogenicities of s. zooepidemicus.
zooepidemicus  is an important pathogen causing swine streptococcosis in china.
genome of s. zooepidemicus atcc <dig>  comprises  <dig> ,264-bp of a single circular chromosome, with a gc content of  <dig> %.
genes of the fim iii operon were presumed to be involved in breaking the host-restriction of sz <dig>
further analysis of the ta and rm systems in the pais will improve our understanding of the pathogenicity of this bacterium and could lead to the development of diagnostics and vaccines.
genome wide comparisons of sz <dig> with three other strains and transcriptome analysis revealed novel genes related to bacterial virulence and breaking the host-restriction.
pathogenicity islands  of s. zooepidemicus have been transferred among bacteria through horizontal gene transfer  and play important roles in the adaptation and increased virulence of s. zooepidemicus.
comparative genome analysis of sz <dig>  s. zooepidemicus mgcs <dig> , streptococcus equi.
<dig>  and s. zooepidemicus h <dig>  identified  <dig> sz35246-specific genes, clustered into three toxin-antitoxin  systems pais and one restriction modification system  pai.
