we identified and characterized  <dig> protein coding feline sequences, of which  <dig> map to public sequences and  <dig> are novel.
additionally, we characterized feline cdna sequences that have mouse orthologs associated with clinical, nutritional and developmental phenotypes.
the initial public release of the felis catus genome assembly provided a framework for investigating the genomic basis of feline biology.
through functional and comparative genomic analyses, we gained an understanding of the role of these sequences in feline development, nutrition and health.
together, this analysis provides an overview of the value of our cdna sequences and enhances our understanding of how the feline genome is similar to, and different from other mammalian genomes.
the cdna sequences reported here expand existing feline genomic resources by providing high-quality sequences annotated with comparative genomic information providing functional, clinical, nutritional and orthologous gene information.
however, the entire set of protein coding genes has not been elucidated.
the feline genome is valuable to the veterinary and model organism genomics communities because the cat is an obligate carnivore and a model for endangered felids.
we detected relatively less negative selection on protein sequences encoding extracellular networks, apoptotic pathways and mitochondrial gene ontology annotations.
we detected negative selection within sequences with gene ontology annotations associated with intracellular trafficking, cytoskeleton and muscle functions.
specifically, we identified  <dig> orthologs of human genes associated with mendelian disorders.
