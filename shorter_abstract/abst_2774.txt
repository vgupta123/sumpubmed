these cells are located at the maternal-fetal interface and are capable of invasive and endocrine functions, which are necessary for successful pregnancy.
transcript profiles from trophoblast stem cells, differentiated trophoblast cells, and differentiated trophoblast cells following disruption of pi3k signaling were generated and characterized.
trophoblast giant cells are one of several end-stage products of trophoblast cell differentiation in rodents.
among the pi3k-responsive genes were those encoding proteins contributing to the invasive and endocrine phenotypes of trophoblast giant cells.
rcho- <dig> trophoblast stem cells can be effectively used as a model for investigating trophoblast cell differentiation.
prominent changes in gene expression accompanied the differentiation of trophoblast stem cells.
genes have been identified with differential expression patterns associated with trophoblast stem cells and trophoblast cell differentiation; a subset of these genes are regulated by pi3k signaling, including those impacting the differentiated trophoblast giant cell phenotype.
in this report, we evaluated the role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  signaling pathway in the regulation of trophoblast cell differentiation.
pi3k modulated the expression of a subset of trophoblast cell differentiation-dependent genes.
the trophoblast lineage arises as the first differentiation event during embryogenesis.
