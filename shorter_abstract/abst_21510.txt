many biological processes important for n metabolism such as the cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process and the cellular amino acid metabolic process were enriched in the n-responsive gene list from the hybrid shoots but not from the parental linesâ€™ shoots.
a survey of the transcriptomes of shoot and root tissues of a maize hybrid line and its two parental inbred lines grown under sufficient and limiting n conditions by mrna-seq has been conducted to have a better understanding of how different maize genotypes respond to n limitation.
our results expand our current understanding of n responses and will help move us forward towards effective strategies to improve nue and enhance crop production.
development of crop varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency  is crucial for minimizing n loss, reducing environmental pollution and decreasing input cost.
expression patterns also differed between shoots and roots, such as the up-regulation of the cytokinin degradation pathway in the shoots of the hybrid and down-regulation of that pathway in the roots.
gene expression in two parental inbreds and the corresponding hybrid line in response to n limitation was surveyed using the mrna-seq technology.
maize is one of the most important crops cultivated worldwide and its productivity is closely linked to the amount of fertilizer used.
the change of gene expression under n limitation in the hybrid resembled the parent with the higher nue trait.
coupled to this, sugar, carbohydrate, monosaccharide, glucose, and sorbitol transport pathways were all up-regulated in the hybrid, but not in the parents under n limitation.
