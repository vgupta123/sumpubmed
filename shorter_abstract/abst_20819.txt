staphylococci are commonly associated with antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings including resistance to methicillin and other beta lactam antibiotics primarily associated with the carriage of sccmec mobile genetic elements.
these typeable strains primarily included those assigned to sccmec type i , type iv  and type vi .
we investigated oxacillin susceptibility in  <dig> different species of environmental staphylococci to evaluate the potential dissemination of such resistance determinants in staphylococcal isolates from non-healthcare environments.
we have demonstrated the diversity of sccmec elements in a wide range of staphylococcal species isolated from outside of healthcare settings.
<dig> of the  <dig> isolates were assigned to known sccmec types.

of the  <dig> strains investigated, there were representatives of  <dig> different species of staphylococci.
we have also shown that the variability in oxacillin mics in such isolates are unrelated to species or sccmec type.
