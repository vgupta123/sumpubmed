these results help to delineate further the limits and origins of n/q-rich prions, and provide insight as a case study of the evolution of compositionally-defined protein domains.
we find distinct evolutionary behavior for q-rich and n-rich prions/pafs; those of ancient ancestry  are q-rich, whereas n-rich cases arose early in saccharomycetes evolution.
here, we exploit the increasing abundance of complete fungal genomes to examine the ancestry of prions/pafs and other n/q-rich proteins across the fungal kingdom.
we find that recent mutational tendencies arising during saccharomycetes evolution , contributed to the expansion/development of the prion phenomenon.
this emergence of n-rich prion/pafs is linked to a large-scale emergence of n-rich proteins during saccharomycetes evolution, with saccharomycetes showing a distinctive trend for population sizes of prion-like proteins that sets them apart from all the other fungi.
prions are transmissible, propagating alternative states of proteins, and are usually made from the fibrillar, beta-sheet-rich assemblies termed amyloid.
variation in these mutational tendencies in saccharomycetes is correlated with the population sizes of prion-like proteins, thus implying that selection pressures on n/q-rich protein sequences against amyloidogenesis are not generally maintained in budding yeasts.
furthermore, human proteins with such n/q-rich composition have been linked to the pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative amyloid diseases.
other proteins, that we term here ‘prionogenic amyloid formers’ , have been shown to form amyloid in vivo, and to have n/q-rich domains that can propagate heritable states in yeast cells.
eurotiales, have much fewer n/q-rich proteins, and in some cases likely lose them en masse, perhaps due to greater amyloid intolerance, although they contain relatively more non-n/q-rich predicted prions.
