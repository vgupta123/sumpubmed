superoxide production in vivo by ctbt was found associated to mitochondria as indicated by oxidation of mitosox red.
we conclude that ctbt causes intracellular superoxide production and oxidative stress in fungal cells and is thus enhancing antimycotic drug effects by a secondary stress.
the deleted genes encode proteins mainly involved in mitochondrial functions, dna repair, transcription and chromatin remodeling, and oxidative stress response.
here we elucidate ctbt mode of action with a combination of systematic genetic and transcriptome analysis.
transcriptome analysis of the immediate early response to ctbt revealed rapid induction of oxidant and stress response defense genes.
we found that the susceptibility of yeast cells to ctbt depends on molecular oxygen.
ctbt  increases efficacy of commonly used antifungal agents by an unknown mechanism.
many of these genes depend on the transcription factors yap <dig> and cin <dig>  yap <dig> accumulates rapidly in the nucleus in ctbt treated cells suggesting acute oxidative stress.
