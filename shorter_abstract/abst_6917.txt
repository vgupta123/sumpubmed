the adventitious roots  of plants share the same function as primary and lateral roots , although their development is mainly an adaptive reaction to stress conditions.
two pectic epitopes  were developmentally regulated and the occurrence of the lm <dig> xylogalacturonan epitope in the root cap of the ar differed from other species described so far.
jim <dig> and jim <dig> epitopes were detected in the more advanced stages of primordium development, whereas the jim <dig> epitope was present from the earliest division events of the initial ar cells.
agp epitopes were abundantly present in the cytoplasmic compartments  and were correlated with the degree of cell vacuolisation.

pectins and arabinogalactan proteins  are helpful markers of particular cellular events, such as programmed cell death , elongation, proliferation or other differentiation events that accompany ar development.
however, little is known about the distribution of pectins and agps during ar ontogeny, either in the primordium or stem tissues from which ar arise or their correspondence with these events during lr formation.
ar were developed from different stem tissues such as parenchyma, xylem rays and the cambium, depending on the stem age and treatment  of the parental tissue.
