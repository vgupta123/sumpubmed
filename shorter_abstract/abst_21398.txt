capitalizing on established safety features and a track record of high transduction efficiencies of mammalian cells, adeno- associated virus type  <dig> were successfully engineered to provide new powerful tools for macrolide-adjustable transgene expression in mammalian cells as well as in mice.
moreover, we investigated key characteristics of the systems, such as reversibility and adjustability to the regulating agent, to determine promising candidates for in vivo studies.
viral vectors, based on the adeno-associated virus  type  <dig>  have emerged as one of the most promising types of vectors for therapeutic applications due to excellent transduction efficiencies of a broad variety of dividing and mitotically inert cell types and due to their unique safety features.
we designed recombinant adeno-associated virus  vectors for the regulated expression of transgenes in different configurations.
to validate the functionality of delivery and regulation we performed in vivo studies by injecting particles, coding for compact self-regulated expression units, into mice and adjusting transgene expression.
