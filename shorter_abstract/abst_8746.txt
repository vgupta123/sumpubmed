this systematic variation was observed within both yoshino cherry and japanese beech trees.

the degree of genome sequence difference  varied systematically from the bottom to the top of the plant, such that the greatest divergence was observed between leaf genomes from uppermost branches and the remainder of the tree.
as measured by gp, the genomic distance between two cells within an individual organism was non-negligible, and was correlated with physical distance .
using genome profiling , we detected considerable systematic variation in genome sequences among cells in individual woody plants.
