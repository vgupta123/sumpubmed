however, the speckles in ultrasound images affect the post-processing, such as follicle segmentation and finally affect the measurement of the follicles.
we develop a new bilateral filter for speckle reduction in ultrasound images for follicle segmentation and measurement.
we also present the results of follicle segmentation after speckle reduction.
ultrasound imaging technology has wide applications in cattle reproduction and has been used to monitor individual follicles and determine the patterns of follicular development.
experimental results on both synthetic images and real ultrasound images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter.
the segmentation of the follicles in the speckle reduced images by the proposed method has higher performance than the segmentation in the original ultrasound image, and the images filtered by gaussian filter, the conventional bilateral filter respectively.
in order to reduce the effect of speckles, a bilateral filter is developed in this paper.
different from the previous bilateral filters, the proposed bilateral filter uses normalized difference in the computation of the gaussian intensity difference.
compared with the previous bilateral filters, the proposed bilateral filter can reduce speckles in both high-intensity regions and low intensity regions in ultrasound images.
