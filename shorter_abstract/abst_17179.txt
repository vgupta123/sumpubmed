the biomechanical and biochemical properties of the thoracic aorta were characterized in warmblood horses, unaffected friesian horses and friesians with aortic rupture in an attempt to unravel the underlying pathogenesis of aortic rupture in friesian horses.
samples of the thoracic aorta at the ligamentum arteriosum , mid thoracic aorta  and distal thoracic aorta  were obtained from friesian horses with aortic rupture , nonaffected friesian  and warmblood horses .
the distal thoracic aorta displayed an increased stiffness associated with a higher collagen percentage in this area and a higher load-bearing capacity compared to the more proximal segments.
our findings match reported findings in other animal species.
the biomechanical properties of these samples were determined using uniaxial tensile and rupture assays.
data revealed no significant biomechanical nor biochemical differences among the different groups of horses.
study results did not provide evidence that the predisposition of the friesian horse breed for aortic rupture can be attributed to altered biomechanical properties of the aortic wall.
thoracic aortic rupture and aortopulmonary fistulation are rare conditions in horses.
intrinsic differences in biomechanical properties of the aortic wall might predispose this breed.
