here, we used the illumina platform to generate over  <dig> million rna sequencing reads from four root samples, including whole roots from one-year-old plants and three types of root tissue from six-year-old plants .
additionally,  <dig> were uniquely expressed in one-year-old roots, while seven were uniquely expressed in six-year-old root tissues.
digital expression profiling revealed  <dig> genes showing differential expression patterns among the four root samples.
our analysis provides new insights into the role of the root transcriptome in development and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in p. ginseng.
through de novo assembly and reference-assisted selection, we obtained a non-redundant unigene set consisting of  <dig>  transcripts with an average length of  <dig>  bp.
korean ginseng  is a highly effective medicinal plant containing ginsenosides with various pharmacological activities, whose roots are produced commercially for crude drugs.
we identified  <dig> transcripts encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis pathways and  <dig> encoding udp-glycosyltransferases.
approximately  <dig>  % of the transcripts represent novel gene sequences that have not previously been reported for p. ginseng.
