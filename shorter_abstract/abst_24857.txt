both the live pathogen and pathogen fragments significantly increased ppo, chitinase and β- <dig> -glucanase activity in the leaves, but only ppo activity was increased in roots.
we demonstrate that aboveground fungal pathogens can affect belowground mutualism with two very different types of microbial symbionts—rhizobia and amf.
we report here that an aboveground fungal pathogen of common bean  induces a defense response that inhibits both the belowground formation of root nodules elicited by rhizobia and the colonization with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi .
our results suggest that systemically induced ppo activity is functionally involved in this above-belowground interaction.
polyphenol oxidase , chitinase and β- <dig> -glucanase activity in leaves and roots, as well as the number of rhizobia nodules and the extent of amf colonization, were measured after pathogen treatments.
the number of rhizobia nodules and the extent of amf colonization was significantly reduced in treatment plants when compared to controls.
induced aboveground plant defenses against pathogens can have negative effects on belowground microbial symbionts.
