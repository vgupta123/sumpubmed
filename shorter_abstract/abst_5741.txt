the chloroplast genome of toona ciliata ,  <dig>  base pairs long, was assembled from shotgun sequencing on the illumina platform using de novo assembly of contigs.
the high coverage of illumina sequence data also renders this method appropriate for multiplexing and snp discovery and therefore a useful approach for landscape level studies of evolutionary ecology.
our approach provides a simple method for construction of whole chloroplast genomes from shotgun sequencing of whole genomic dna using short-read data and no available closely related reference genome .
following validation, we used the identified snps for a preliminary phylogeographic study of t. ciliata in australia and to confirm low diversity across the distribution.
here we present an approach for in silicio chloroplast dna assembly and single nucleotide polymorphism detection from short-read shotgun sequencing.
to evaluate its practicality, value and quality, we compared the short read assembly with an assembly completed using  <dig> data obtained after chloroplast dna isolation.
