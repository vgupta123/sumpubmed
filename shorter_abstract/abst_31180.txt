here, we compare the global gene expression patterns induced by pieris rapae caterpillar attack in two white cabbage  cultivars.
additionally, comparisons between pieris rapae- and jasmonate-induced transcriptional responses showed that pieris rapae induced more jasmonate-independent than jasmonate-dependent genes.
several of these differences involve genes that are known to have an impact on pieris rapae performance and probably underlie different mechanisms of direct defense, present in the cultivars.
the present study clearly shows that global transcriptional responses in two cultivars of the same plant species in response to insect feeding can differ dramatically.
the two cultivars are shown to differ in their level of direct defense against caterpillar feeding.
comparing herbivore-induced transcriptional responses of plants with different phenotypes provides insight into plant defense mechanisms.
the transcriptional responses of the two cultivars differed in timing as characterized by changes in their expression pattern after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours of caterpillar feeding.
analyses of transcriptional responses after jasmonate treatment revealed that the difference in timing did not hold for the response to this phytohormone.
surprisingly, of all genes induced at any time point, only one third was induced in both cultivars.
