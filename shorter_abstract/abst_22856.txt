to construct the main functionalities of sigla a workflow of a proteomic laboratory was first defined.
in this work we describe the sistema integrado de gerência de laboratórios , an open source lims with a new approach designed to allow it to adapt its activities and processes to various types of laboratories.
we also hope to make possible to laboratories with little resources to afford a high level system for complex data management.
during the execution, for each workflow created, the values of attributes defined in a xpdl file  are stored in sigla’s database, allowing then to be managed and retrieved upon request.
a lims is a complex computational system used to manage laboratory data with emphasis in quality assurance.
with sigla’s development we hope to contribute positively to the area of management of complex data in laboratory by managing its large amounts of data, guaranteeing the consistence of the data and increasing the laboratory productivity.
to validate the sigla capability of adapting to multiples laboratories, on this paper we study theprocess and the needs of a microarray laboratory and define its workflow.
the need to manage large amounts of data is a clear demand for laboratories nowadays.
however, most of them have proprietary code and are commercialized with a high cost.
sigla incorporates a workflow management system, making it possible to create and manage customized workflows.
the use of laboratory information management systems  to achieve this is growing each day.
for each new laboratory a workflow is defined with its activities, rules and procedures.
