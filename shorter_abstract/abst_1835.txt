further clone sequencing analysis on pres identified  <dig> deletions which were classified into  <dig> types, the most common being pres <dig>  also, in contrast to the core and bcp regions, most pres deletions were in-frame.
in vitro experiments demonstrated that pres <dig> deletions alone were not responsible for antiviral resistance, implying the coordination between wild type and mutant strains during viral survival and disease development.
in this study, we explored hbv deletion patterns and their association with disease status and antiviral treatment by performing whole genome sequencing on samples from  <dig> hepatitis b patients and by monitoring changes in deletion variants during treatment.
in chronic carriers of the virus, and individuals with chronic hepatitis, the deletion rate was significantly higher in the antiviral treatment group .
the accumulation of pres deletion mutants during nucleoside analog therapy may be due to viral escape from host immuno-surveillance.
among the core, pres, and basic core promoter  deletion hotspots, we identified pres to have the highest frequency and the most complex deletion pattern using whole genome sequencing.
among various clinical factors examined, logistic regression showed that antiviral medication affected the accumulation of deletion mutants .
hepatitis b virus , because of its error-prone viral polymerase, has a high mutation rate leading to widespread substitutions, deletions, and insertions in the hbv genome.
we present the hbv deletion distribution patterns and pres deletion substructures in viral genomes that are prevalent in northern china.
deletions may significantly change viral biological features complicating the progression of liver diseases.
