expression of the ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> repressors in escherichia coli inhibit the growth of e. coli and the propagation of phage λ. the ngoΦ <dig> repressor was able to inhibit transcription of n. gonorrhoeae genes and haemophilus influenzae hp <dig> phage promoters.
the holin gene of ngoΦ <dig> , when expressed in e. coli, could serve as substitute for the phage λ s gene.
we were able to detect the presence of the dna derived from ngoΦ <dig> in the cultures of n. gonorrhoeae.
the genetic content of the dsdna prophage sequences were examined in detail and found to contain blocks of genes encoding for proteins homologous to proteins responsible for phage dna replication, structural proteins and proteins responsible for phage assembly.
the distribution, conservation and function of many of these sequences, and their ability to produce bacteriophage particles are unknown.
electron microscopy analysis of culture supernatants revealed the presence of multiple forms of bacteriophage particles.
since phage particles were only present in culture supernatants after induction with mitomycin c, it indicates that the gonococcus also regulates the expression of bacteriophage genes.
the dna sequences from ngoΦ <dig>  ngoΦ <dig> and ngoΦ <dig> contain some significant regions of identity.
our analysis of the genomic sequence of fa <dig> identified five genomic regions  that are related to dsdna lysogenic phage.
bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence of neisseria gonorrhoeae revealed the presence of nine probable prophage islands.
