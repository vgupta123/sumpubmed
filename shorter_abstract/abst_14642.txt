the smtnl <dig> proximal promoter enhances expression up to 8-fold in smooth muscle cells and a second activating region lays  <dig> bp further upstream.
the proximal promoter is highly conserved in mammals and contains a mirror repeat sequence.
in silico analysis suggests many transcription factors  could potentially bind within the smtnl <dig> proximal promoter sequence.
promoter studies suggest restrictive control of smtnl <dig> expression in non-muscle cells.
smoothelin-like  <dig>  plays a role in promoting relaxation as well as adaptive responses to exercise, pregnancy and sexual development in smooth and skeletal muscle.
smtnl <dig> transcript was identified in all smooth muscle tissues examined to date, albeit at much lower levels than found in skeletal muscle.
thus, in this study, we identify and characterize key regulatory elements of the mouse smtnl <dig> gene.
it is unlikely that multiple smtnl <dig> isoforms exist since a single smtnl <dig> transcription start site was identified in both skeletal and intestinal smooth muscle.
