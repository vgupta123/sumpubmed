the second internal transcriber spacer  is a fast evolving part of the nuclear-encoded rrna operon located between the  <dig> s and 28s rrna genes.
therefore, we developed a suite of methods providing a critical 'close-up' view into its <dig> evolution by directly tracing the evolutionary history of individual positions, and we caution against a non-critical use of the its <dig> cbc clade concept for species delimitation.
high sequence and length conservation allowed the generation of an its <dig> consensus secondary structure, and introduction of a novel numbering system of its <dig> nucleotides and base pairs.
the phenetic approach of pairwise comparison of sequences can be misleading, and thus, cbcs/hcbcs must be investigated in their evolutionary context, including homoplasy events  cbcs and hcbcs in its <dig> helices evolved independently, and we found no evidence for a cbc that originated via a two-fold hcbc substitution.
alignments and analyses were based on this structural information, leading to the following results:  in the ulvales, the presence of a cbc is not linked to any particular taxonomic level,  most cbc 'clades' sensu coleman are paraphyletic, and should rather be termed cbc grades.
based on crossing experiments it has been proposed that even a single compensatory base change  in helices  <dig> and  <dig> of the its <dig> indicates sexual incompatibility and thus separates biological species.
our case study revealed several discrepancies between its <dig> evolution in the ulvales and generally accepted assumptions underlying its <dig> evolution as e.g.
to gain 'close-up' insights into its <dig> evolution,   <dig> sequences of its <dig> including secondary structures have been investigated in the green algal order ulvales ,  after recording all existing substitutions, cbcs and hemi-cbcs  were mapped upon the its <dig> phylogeny, rather than merely comparing its <dig> characters among pairs of taxa, and  the relation between cbcs, hcbcs, cbc clades, and the taxonomic level of organisms was investigated in detail.
however, in depth comparative analyses of its <dig> secondary structures, its <dig> phylogeny, the origin of cbcs, and their relationship to biological species have rarely been performed.
