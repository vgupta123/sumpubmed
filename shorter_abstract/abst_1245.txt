principal components analysis and delta variance tests were used to investigate the distribution and disparity of cranial morphology between different landmark sets  of the whole skull and of individual developmental or functional regions  for extant placentals and marsupials.
these results support the hypothesis of developmental constraint limiting the evolution of the marsupial skull, and further suggest that the marsupial viscerocranium as a whole, rather than just the early-ossifying oral region, is developmentally constrained.
when the disparities of cranial regions were investigated separately, significant differences between placentals and marsupials were seen for the viscerocranial and oral regions, but not for the neurocranial region.
in contrast to placental neonates, in which all cranial bones are ossified, marsupial young have only the bones of the oral region and the exoccipital ossified at birth, in order to facilitate suckling at an early stage of development.
we collected three-dimensional  landmark data about the crania of a wide range of extant placentals and marsupials, and from six fossil metatherians , using a laser scanner and a 3d digitizer.
inclusion of fossil taxa did not significantly increase the variance of metatherian cranial shape.
we found that the extant marsupial taxa investigated here occupy a much smaller area of morphospace than the placental taxa, with a significantly  smaller overall variance.
