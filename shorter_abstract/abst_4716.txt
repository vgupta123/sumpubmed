comparison of the lrrs, enable us to propose a parsimonious evolutionary scenario of these domains driven by adjacent concatenations of lrrs.
their closest homologs are the 28-residue ri-like lrrs of mammalian nods and the 24-meres of some ralstonia and legionella proteins.
phylogenetic analyses suggest that serial duplications producing the six lgrs occurred relatively recently and nucleotide usage analyses show that lgrb, lgre and lgrf were relocated on the chromosome.
defined by a cumulative alignment score, the  <dig> to  <dig> concatenated octacosapeptidic  lrrs of lgrs present all a predicted Î±-helix conformation.
interestingly, lgre, which is present on pam100g like the tra operon, exhibits pfam domains related to dna metabolism.
our model established on bacterial lrrs can be challenged in eucaryotic proteins carrying less conserved lrrs, such as nod proteins and toll-like receptors.
it contains a tra unit likely involved in conjugative dna transfer and lgre, a  <dig> -kb gene similar to five others of p. amoebophila: lgra to lgrd, lgrf.
the c-terminal part of lgrs is homologous to leucine-rich repeats domains .
