no arsenic metabolism  has ever been reported in cold environments .
its arsenite oxidase was constitutively expressed and functioned over a broad temperature range.
this ability to grow at low temperatures could be harnessed for arsenic bioremediation in moderate to cold climates.
an arsenite-oxidising bacterium  was isolated, and was shown to oxidise arsenite in the early exponential growth phase and to grow at a broad range of temperatures .
the diversity of arsenite oxidisers does not significantly differ from two subsamples of a microbial biofilm that vary in arsenite concentrations.
we compared the arsenite oxidisers in two subsamples  collected from one biofilm.
the two soluble inorganic forms of arsenic are arsenite  and arsenate , with arsenite the more toxic.
our study site is located  <dig> kilometres south of the arctic circle in the northwest territories, canada in an inactive gold mine which contains mine waste water in excess of  <dig> mm arsenic.
