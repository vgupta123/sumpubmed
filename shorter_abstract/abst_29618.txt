the satisfactory prediction results show the super gsvm model generates decent protein sequence clusters and has the ability to capture the hidden sequence-to-structure information.
understanding the relationship between the protein sequence and the 3d structure is a major research area in bioinformatics.
in this paper, we propose a super granule support vector machine  model to obtain the high quality protein sequence motifs and to predict local tertiary structure information based on purely sequence information.
the prediction of complete protein tertiary structure based only on sequence information is still an impractical work.
