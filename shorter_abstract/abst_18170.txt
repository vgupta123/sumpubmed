also, gtfb ncibs were active, with approx.
soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb were compared using activity assays, secondary structure analysis by ft-ir, and product analyses by nmr, hpaec and sec.
when expressed as units of activity obtained per liter e. coli culture, the total amount of ncib gtfb expressed possessed around  <dig> % hydrolysis activity and  <dig> % transferase activity compared to the amount of soluble gtfb enzyme obtained from one liter culture.
ft-ir analysis revealed extended β-sheet formation in ncib gtfb providing an explanation at the molecular level for reduced gtfb activity in ncibs.
the thermostability of ncib gtfb was relatively high compared to the soluble and refolded gtfb.
in view of their relatively high yield, activity and high thermostability, both refolded and ncib gtfb derived from ibs in e. coli may find industrial application in the synthesis of modified starches.
denaturation followed by refolding, as well as ncib preparation were used for isolation of active gtfb protein from inclusion bodies.
expression of gtfb in e. coli yielded >  <dig> mg/l relatively pure and active but mostly insoluble gtfb protein in ibs, regardless of the expression conditions used.
following denaturing, refolding of gtfb protein was most efficient in double distilled h2o.
<dig> % of hydrolysis activity compared to the soluble protein.
the product profiles obtained for the three gtfb enzyme preparations were similar when analyzed by hpaec and nmr.
the gtfb enzyme expresses well in escherichia coli bl <dig> star , but mostly accumulates in inclusion bodies  which generally contain wrongly folded protein and inactive enzyme.
