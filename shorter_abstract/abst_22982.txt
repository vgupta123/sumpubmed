we propose that the leprk complex perceives stil, resulting in leprk <dig> dephosphorylation and an increase in pollen tube growth.
stil increased pollen tube lengths of in vitro germinated pollen in a dose-dependent manner.
leprk <dig> and leprk <dig> are two pollen receptor kinases localized to the plasma membrane, where they are present in a high molecular weight complex .
