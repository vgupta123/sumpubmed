human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with ppp2r2b constructs encoding the complete sequences of bβ <dig> and bβ <dig>  respectively.
to test how cells respond to reactive oxygen species generators, the cells were treated with either hydrogen peroxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide and bβ <dig> clones induced cell death.
suppression of autophagy using either rna interference of the essential autophagy gene or pharmacological inhibitor rescued cell death caused by oxidative stress.
cells with ectopically expressed mitochondria-targeted regulatory subunit ppp2r2b of the holoenzyme pp2a were shown predisposed to autophagy and oxidative stress induced cell death that is related to apoptosis.
the colonies with antibiotic resistance were selected as stable cell lines.
the results promised a model for studying the mechanism and function of aberrant ppp2r2b expression in neuronal cells.
by modifying various downstream signal transducers, the aberrant expression of the brain-targeted regulatory subunit ppp2r2b is associated with the onset of a panel of neuronal disorders.
