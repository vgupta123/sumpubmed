neither fkbp <dig>  fkbp <dig>  fkbp <dig> nor the unrelated immunophilin cypa did react with c1q-c in the yeast system stressing the specificity of the interaction.
the c-chain of complement c1q  was detected to interact with fkbp <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system and in a protein complementation assay.
a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the fk <dig> binding protein  <dig> kda  as a bait and a fetal liver expression library as a prey.
it is concluded that exclusively fkbp <dig> but no other fkbps tested so far interact with the c-chain of complement c1q in the two different assays and further work will be initiated to investigate the physiological relevance of the interaction.
the pharmacological action of specific immunosuppressants is mediated by immunophilins.
