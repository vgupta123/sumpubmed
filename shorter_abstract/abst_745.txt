a total of  <dig> genes were identified as candidate genes underlying scn resistance.
<dig>  the beneficial alleles and candidate genes identified by gwas might be valuable for improving marker-assisted breeding efficiency and exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying scn resistance.
a total of sixteen novel soybean accessions were identified with significant resistance to hg type  <dig> .
the most effective strategy to control this pest involves the use of resistant cultivars.
the aim of the present study was to investigate the genome-wide genetic architecture of resistance to scn hg type  <dig> .
