unlike previous module inference tools which are static statistics-based methods, himia is a dynamic system model-based method that utilizes the dynamic nature of time series gene expression data.
integrating transcription factor binding site , mutant, chip-chip, and heat shock time series gene expression data, we develop a method, called heat-inducible module identification algorithm , for reconstructing grms of yeast heat shock response.
himia identifies  <dig> grms, which in total contain  <dig> heat-inducible genes regulated by  <dig> heat-responsive tfs.
our analysis suggests that different combinations of a fairly small number of heat-responsive tfs regulate a large number of genes involved in heat shock response and that there may exist crosstalk between heat shock response and other cellular processes.
finally, we show that himia outperforms four current module inference tools , and we conduct two randomization tests to show that the output of himia is statistically meaningful.
furthermore, himia is capable of assigning the regulatory roles of the tfs that regulate grms and cst <dig>  hsf <dig>  msn <dig>  msn <dig>  and yap <dig> are found to be activators of several grms.
therefore, identifying grms is helpful for understanding gene regulation.
using himia, we identify  <dig> uncharacterized genes that may be involved in heat shock response and we also identify their plausible heat-responsive regulators.
in addition, himia refines two clusters of genes involved in heat shock response and provides a better understanding of how the complex expression program of heat shock response is regulated.
himia is effective for reconstructing grms of yeast heat shock response.
using various types of published data, we validate the biological relevance of the identified grms.
