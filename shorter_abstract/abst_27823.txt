comparing the outcome of the local method h2rs and of the global method psicov indicates that such methods supplement each other and have different scopes of application.
we determined a by deducing substitution frequencies from contacting residue pairs observed in the homologs of  <dig>  <dig> proteins, whose structure is known.
considering substitution frequencies for residue pairs by means of the von neumann entropy and a p-value improved the success rate in identifying important residue positions.
to decide on significance, the algorithm calculates a p-value by performing a randomization test for each individual pair of residue positions.
a common measure assessing these dependencies is the mutual information, which is based on shannon’s information theory that utilizes probabilities only.
to compute the corresponding mutual information, a matrix a is required, which assesses the similarity of residue pairs.
the identification of functionally important residue positions is an important task of computational biology.
consequently, such approaches do not consider the similarity of residue pairs, which may degrade the algorithm’s performance.
methods of correlation analysis allow for the identification of pairs of residue positions, whose occupancy is mutually dependent due to constraints imposed by protein structure or function.
the outcome of h2rs and of a method that predicts contacting residue positions  overlapped only marginally.
the integration of proven statistical concepts and normalization allows for an easier comparison of results obtained with different proteins.
to improve specificity of h2r, we developed a revised algorithm, named h2rs, which is based on the von neumann entropy .
the analysis of a large in silico testbed demonstrated that specificity and precision were higher for h2rs than for h2r and two other methods of correlation analysis.
