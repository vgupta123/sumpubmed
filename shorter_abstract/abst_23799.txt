a key challenge in the emerging field of single-cell rna-seq is to characterize phenotypic diversity between cells and visualize this information in an informative manner.
to aid in the analysis and interpretation of single-cell rna-seq data, we have developed fastproject, a software tool which analyzes a gene expression matrix and produces a dynamic output report in which two-dimensional projections of the data can be explored.
additionally, when analyzing single-cell data, the relationship between cells can be obscured by technical confounders such as variable gene capture rates.
here we present fastproject, a software package for two-dimensional visualization of single cell data, which utilizes a plethora of projection methods and provides a way to systematically investigate the biological relevance of these low dimensional representations by incorporating domain knowledge.
a common technique when dealing with high-dimensional data is to project the data to  <dig> or  <dig> dimensions for visualization.
additionally, fastproject is written with a modular architecture and designed to serve as a platform for incorporating and comparing new projection methods and gene selection algorithms.
