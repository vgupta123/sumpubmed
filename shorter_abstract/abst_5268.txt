all three subunits  were detected by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy of omvs.
our results strongly suggest that the release of outer membrane vesicles is functioning as a route of c. jejuni to deliver all the subunits of cdt toxin  to the surrounding environment, including infected host tissue.
background: cytolethal distending toxin  is one of the well-characterized virulence factors of campylobacter jejuni, but it is unknown how cdt becomes surface-exposed or is released from the bacterium to the surrounding environment.
subcellular fractionation of the bacteria indicated that, apart from the majority of cdt detected in the cytoplasmic compartment, appreciable amounts  of the cellular pool of cdt proteins were present in the periplasmic compartment.
our data suggest that cdt is secreted to the bacterial culture supernatant via outer membrane vesicles  released from the bacteria.
