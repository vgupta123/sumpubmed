this study also enabled better characterisation of the co-opted gamma retroviral envelope gene ovex <dig>  additionally, this work suggests that there is no deficit of ltr retrotransposons within the galliformes relative to other birds, or to mammalian genomes when scaled for the three-fold difference in genome size.
ltr retrotransposons contribute approximately 10 % of the mammalian genome, but it has been previously reported that there is a deficit of these elements in the chicken relative to both mammals and other birds.
use of the novel locatr pipeline has nearly doubled the annotated ltr retrotransposon content of the chicken genome compared to previous estimates.
the transcription of most ltr retrotransposons were suppressed or incomplete, but individual domain and full length retroviral transcripts were produced in some cases, although mostly with regularly interspersed stop codons in all reading frames.
ltr retrotransposon content was found to be very variable across the avian lineage and did not correlate with either genome size or phylogenetic position.
further analysis has described element distribution, clustering patterns and degree of expression in a variety of adult tissues, as well as in three embryonic stages.
elements are significantly depleted within coding regions and enriched in gene sparse areas of the genome.
over 40 % of intact elements are found in clusters, unrelated by age or genera, generally in poorly recombining regions.
element distribution is significantly correlated with chromosome size and is non-random within each chromosome.
