at variant sites without apparent sequencing or alignment error, wild type/non-variant calls cluster near - <dig> plrd and variant calls typically cluster above  <dig> plrd.
future work will further differentiate the variants in bin  <dig>

depending on the separation of a proband's variant plrd value from the cluster of wild type/non-variant plrd values for background samples at the same variant change and position, the varbin method's classification is assigned to each proband variant .
to assess varbin performance, sanger sequencing was performed on  <dig> variants in the proband and background samples.
plrd values were calculated for a proband of interest and  <dig> additional illumina hiseq, exome and whole genome samples .
sites with systematic variant calling problems  tend to have higher and more variable wild type/non-variant plrd values.
true variants were confirmed in 97% of bin  <dig> variants, 30% of bin  <dig>  and 0% of bin 3/bin  <dig>
these data indicate that varbin correctly classifies the majority of true variants as bin  <dig> and bin 3/ <dig> contained only false positive variants.
methods to remove false positive variants often retain many false positive variants.
the "uncertain" bin  <dig> contained both true and false positive variants.
sequencing or alignment errors create "false positive" variants, which are often retained in the variant screening process.
