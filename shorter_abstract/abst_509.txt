precise classification of glioma subtype is essential for proper therapeutic treatment and better clinical prognosis.
ng subtype is associated with higher expression of nfil <dig> and ahr, and has worse prognosis with elder age at diagnosis.
recently, classification methods based on molecular characteristics are developed with rapid progress of high throughput technology.
however, the molecular mechanism of glioma is far from clear and the classical classification methods based on traditional morphologic and histopathologic knowledge are subjective and inconsistent.
according to our inferred differential networking information and previously reported signalling knowledge, we suggested testable hypotheses on the roles of ahr and nfil <dig> in glioma carcinogenesis.

in the present study, we designed a novel integrated gene coexpression analysis approach, which involves differential coexpression and differential regulation analysis , to investigate glioma prognostic biomarkers and molecular subtypes based on six glioma transcriptome data sets.
our work is extendable to prognosis-related classification and signature identification in other cancer researches.
we revealed a novel three-transcription-factor signature including ahr, nfil <dig> and znf <dig> for glioma molecular subtypes.
notably, zg subtype is featured with higher expression of znf <dig> and has better prognosis with younger age at diagnosis.
