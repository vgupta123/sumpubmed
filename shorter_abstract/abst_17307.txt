emerging evidences suggest that enteric glial cells , a major constituent of the enteric nervous system , are key regulators of intestinal epithelial barrier  functions.
finally, important genes involved in lipid and protein metabolism of epithelial cells were shown to be differentially regulated by egc.
in addition, egc profoundly modulated expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell survival, although no clear functional trend could be identified.
egc also regulated genes involved in cell motility towards an enhancement of cell motility.
by performing functional analysis of the  <dig> identified genes using ingenuity pathway analysis, we showed that egc induced a significant regulation of genes favoring both cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion as well as cell differentiation.
to achieve this goal, we aimed at identifying the impact of egc upon iec transcriptome by performing microarray studies.
egc have a profound impact upon iec transcriptome and induce a shift in iec phenotype towards increased cell adhesion and cell differentiation.
consistently, functional studies showed that egc induced a significant increase in cell adhesion.
egc induced significant changes in gene expression profiling of proliferating iec after  <dig> hours of co-culture.
this study reinforces the emerging concept that egc have major protective effects upon the ieb.
