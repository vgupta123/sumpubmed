as a first step towards examining the equivalence of epigenetic profiles between xenografts and primary tumours in paediatric leukaemia, we performed genome-scale dna methylation and gene expression profiling on a panel of  <dig> paediatric b-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  tumours that were stratified by prednisolone response.
in order to demonstrate the potential utility of epigenetic analyses in bcp-all xenografts, we identified dna methylation biomarkers that correlated with prednisolone responsiveness of the original tumour samples.
we found high correlations in dna methylation and gene expression profiles between matching primary and xenograft tumour samples with pearson’s correlation coefficients ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> .
we identified  <dig> genes showing an inverse relationship between dna methylation and gene expression in association with prednisolone response.

insights into tumour biology and biomarkers predictive of responses to chemotherapeutic drugs can also be gained from investigating xenograft models.
the findings of this study confirm the stability of epigenetic and gene expression profiles of paediatric bcp-all propagated in mouse xenograft models.
further, our preliminary investigation of prednisolone sensitivity highlights the utility of mouse xenograft models for preclinical development of novel drug regimens with parallel investigation of underlying gene expression and epigenetic responses associated with novel drug responses.
