adult mice  were pretreated with 9 j/cm <dig> of 670 nm light once daily for  <dig> consecutive days prior to being placed in hyperoxic environment .
photoreceptor damage and loss were quantified by counting photoreceptors undergoing cell death and measuring photoreceptor layer thickness.
in this study, we aim to examine whether 670 nm red light pretreatment can provide protection against hyperoxia-induced damage in the c57bl/6j mouse retina.
the hyperoxia-induced photoreceptor loss was accompanied by reduction of metabolic marker, cox va, and increased expression of oxidative stress indicator, acrolein and hmox- <dig>  pretreatment with 670 nm red light reduced expression of markers of oxidative stress and c <dig>  and slowed, but did not prevent, photoreceptor loss over the time course of hyperoxia exposure.
these results suggest that pretreatment with 670 nm light may provide stability to photoreceptors in conditions of oxidative stress.
retinas were collected after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 14 days of hyperoxia exposure  and prepared either for histological analysis, or rna extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction .
irradiation with light wavelengths from the far red  to the near infrared  spectrum  has been shown to have beneficial effects in several disease models.
