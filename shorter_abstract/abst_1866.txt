however, high-throughput analysis of sfm data is limited by the lack of versatile software tools accessible to sfm users.
assembled in a single user interface, sfmetrics serves as a semi-automatic analysis tool capable of measuring several geometrical properties  from dna and protein complexes, but is also applicable to other samples with irregular shapes.
scanning force microscopy  allows direct, rapid and high-resolution visualization of single molecular complexes; irregular shapes and differences in sizes are immediately revealed by the scanning tip in three-dimensional images.
we present sfmetrics as a metrology toolbox for sfm, specifically aimed at biomolecules like dna and proteins, which features  semi-automatic high-throughput analysis of individual molecules;  ease of use working within matlab environment or as a stand-alone application;  compatibility with multimode , nanowizard , asylum , ascii, and tiff files, that can be adjusted with minor modifications to other formats.
