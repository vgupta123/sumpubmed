rna samples from each rat were split to assess variation arising at labeling and hybridization steps.
the greatest source of variation was biological variation, followed by residual error, and finally variation due to labeling when *.cel files were processed with dchip and rma image processing algorithms.
a typical microarray experiment has many sources of variation which can be attributed to biological and technical causes.
the objectives of this study were:  to estimate relative magnitudes of different sources of variation and  to evaluate agreement between biological and technical replicates.
pearson correlations were computed to evaluate agreement between technical and biological replicates.
correlations between technical replicates were consistently higher than between biological replicates.
identifying sources of variation and assessing their magnitude, among other factors, are important for optimal experimental design.
we performed a microarray experiment using a total of  <dig> affymetrix genechipÂ® arrays.
a general linear model was used to estimate variance components.
