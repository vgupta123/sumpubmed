the identified proteins are mainly involved in cell mobility, antioxidant and detoxification, signal transduction and protein metabolism.
our proteome results suggest that the apoptosis related proteins were involved in promoting and regulating cell death of ags cells, and might be helpful to understand the molecular mechanism of vitamin c on ags cell growth inhibition.
hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of vitamin c on ags cell growth, and protein profiles in ags cells after exposure to vitamin c treatment, by using proteomic tools.
vitamin c  is an essential nutrient of most living tissues that readily acts as a strong reducing agent, which is abundant in fruits and vegetables.
vitamin c showed a cytotoxic effect on ags cells  and,  <dig> differentially expressed proteins  were successfully identified by assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry .
