by reference to the dog, we also identified transcripts revealing homology to five class i, ten class ii and three class iii genes of the major histocompatibility complex and derived the putative genomic distribution of  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  in silico mined microsatellites and  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms.
however, because many genes have tissue-specific expression patterns, developing a complete transcriptome usually requires a 'discovery pool' of individuals to be sacrificed in order to harvest mrna from as many different types of tissue as possible.
homology was found to  <dig> % of dog  transcripts, suggesting that the combined assembly represents a substantial proportion of this species' transcriptome.
our findings suggest that transcriptome development based on samples collected post mortem may greatly facilitate genomic studies, not only of marine mammals but also more generally of species that are of conservation concern.
to circumvent this problem in a model pinniped species, we  <dig> sequenced cdna from testis, heart, spleen, intestine, kidney and lung tissues obtained from nine adult male antarctic fur seals  that died of natural causes at bird island, south georgia.

moreover, only  <dig> % of transcripts revealed sequence similarity to bacteria, implying minimal contamination, and the percentage of transcripts involved in cell death was low at  <dig> %.
transcripts with immune-related annotations were almost five-fold enriched relative to skin and represented  <dig> % of all spleen-specific contigs.
