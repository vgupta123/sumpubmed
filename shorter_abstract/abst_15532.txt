it was found that several sequence and structural attributes such as evolutionary conservation, solvent accessibility, depth and protrusion clearly illustrate the differences between heme binding and non-binding residues.
to further improve the performance, an attempt has been made to develop a post-processing procedure to reduce the number of false positives.
these features can then be separately used or combined to build the structure-based classifiers using support vector machine .
we systematically investigated the characteristics of binding interfaces based on a non-redundant dataset of heme-protein complexes.
extensive experiments indicated that both the structure-based and sequence-based methods have effectively identified heme binding residues while the complementary relationship between them can result in a significant improvement in prediction performance.
although much effort has been devoted to the development of various generic algorithms for ligand binding site prediction over the last decade, no algorithm has been specifically designed to complement experimental techniques for identification of heme binding residues.
hemebind is the first specialized algorithm used to predict binding residues in protein structures for heme ligands.
the results showed that the information contained in these features is largely complementary and their combination achieved the best performance.
consequently, an urgent need is to develop a computational method for recognizing these important residues.
in addition, we built a sequence-based classifier based on svm and sequence profile as an alternative when only sequence information can be used.
here we introduced an efficient algorithm hemebind for predicting heme binding residues by integrating structural and sequence information.
