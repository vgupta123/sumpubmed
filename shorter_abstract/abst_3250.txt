no significant difference was observed between both isolation methods tested.
isolates selected for microarray analysis carried a broad range of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes.
molecular characterization was performed by means of spa-typing, mlst, sccmec typing and microarray analysis for the detection of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes.
most isolates were st <dig> spa type t <dig> or closely related spa types.
since no validated methods for mrsa isolation from nasal swabs were available, we compared two isolation methods.
in this study, we investigated the prevalence and types of mrsa present in the nose of healthy bovines of different age groups and rearing practices.
staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium usually found on skin and mucous membranes of warm blooded animals.
there was a marked difference between rearing practices with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the dairy, beef and veal calve farms respectively being mrsa positive.
although s. aureus isolated from animals are often susceptible to most antibiotics, multi-resistant livestock associated -mrsa have been recovered from bovine mastitis.
sccmec types carried by these strains were mainly type iv, iv and type v. type iii and non-typeable sccmec were recovered to a lesser extent.
all isolates were multi-resistant to at least two antimicrobials in addition to the expected cefoxitin and penicillin resistance, with an average of resistance to  <dig>  different antimicrobials.
resistance in s. aureus has been increasingly reported though depending on the clonal lineage.
indeed, while hospital acquired -methicillin resistant s. aureus  are typically multi-resistant, community associated -mrsa are by large more susceptible to many antibiotics.
