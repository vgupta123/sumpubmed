using computational modeling analysis we report here the identification, the physico-chemical properties, and the amino acid residue analysis of a novel tunnel like cavity exclusively found in the maize sterility restorer protein, rf2a/aldh2b <dig> by which this protein is suggested to bind variably long chain molecular ligands and/or potentially harmful molecules.
our finding indicates that maize aldh superfamily is the most expanded of plant aldhs ever characterized, and the mitochondrial maize rf2a/aldh2b <dig> is the only plant aldh that harbors a newly defined pocket/cavity with suggested functional specificity.
the maize genome contains  <dig> unique aldh sequences encoding members of ten aldh protein families including the previously identified male fertility restoration rf2a gene, which encodes a member of mitochondrial class  <dig> aldhs.
gene annotation and functional characterization of gene products are important to uncover novel protein functionality.
the completion of maize genome sequencing has resulted in the identification of a large number of uncharacterized genes.
