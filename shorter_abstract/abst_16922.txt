to assess the heterogeneity of the margins and the odds ratios of agreement, four log-linear models were used: a full model, a homogeneous-margin model, a model with single odds ratio for all patients, and a model with single intercept.
then a log-linear mixed model was fitted considering the biological variability as a random effect.
the analysis of mps data involves the development of several bioinformatic tools, academic or commercial.
the method allows thus pipeline comparison and selection.

same-trend results were obtained when only single nucleotide variants were considered .
we present here a statistical method to compare mps pipelines and test it in a comparison between an academic  and a commercial pipeline , with and without reference to a gold standard , on a panel of  <dig> genes in  <dig> epileptic patients.
it is generalizable to all types of mps data and all pipelines.
this method used the number of variants to fit log-linear models for pairwise agreements between pipelines.
today, sequencing is frequently carried out by massive parallel sequencing  that cuts drastically sequencing time and expenses.
