qrt-pcr revealed for the first time a transient, acid triggered prfa induction of approximately 4-fold,  <dig> -fold, 7-fold and  <dig> -fold  <dig> to  <dig> min after acid shock of l. monocytogenes at 37°c, 25°c, 18°c, and 10°c, respectively.
comparable data were obtained for seven different l. monocytogenes strains, demonstrating that prfa induction under these conditions is a general response of l. monocytogenes.
to test if up regulation of virulence genes at temperatures below 37°c correlates with pathogenicity, the capacity of l. monocytogenes to invade epithelial cells after acid shock at 25°c was measured.
using a nematode infection assay, we demonstrated that caenorhabditis elegans fed with acid-shocked l. monocytogenes exhibits a shorter time to death of 50%  of the worms  compared to infection with unshocked bacteria .
the saprophytic pathogen listeria monocytogenes has to cope with a variety of acidic habitats during its life cycle.
prfa and other listerial virulence genes are induced by an inorganic acid in a temperature-dependent manner.
the data presented here suggest that low ph serves as a trigger for listerial pathogenicity at environmental temperatures.
twenty-five genes repressed upon acid shock are known to be down regulated during intracellular growth or by virulence regulators.
transcriptome analysis revealed that the in vivo-relevant genes bsh, clpp, glpd, hfq, inla, inlb, inle, lisr, and lpla <dig> as well as many other genes with a putative role during infection are transiently induced upon acid shock conducted at 25°c and 37°c.
these data were confirmed by qrt-pcr of twelve differentially regulated genes and by the identification of acid shock-induced genes influenced by σb.
