the phylogenetic tree constructed from sequencing information of twenty-four whole mtdna genome revealed novel substitutions in the previously defined m2a and m <dig> lineages.
the most striking feature of this phylogenetic tree is the recognition of two new lineages, m <dig> and m <dig>  distinguished by transitions at  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.
the phylogenetic tree also identifies a potential new lineage in the m* branch with hvsi sequence as  <dig> .
in the absence of whole mtdna sequence information of m lineages reported in india that exhibits highest diversity within the sub-continent, the present study was undertaken to provide a detailed analysis of this macrohaplogroup to precisely characterize and unravel the intricate phylogeny of the lineages and to establish the antiquity of m lineages in india.
the deep roots of m phylogeny clearly establish the antiquity of indian lineages, especially m <dig>  as compared to ethiopian m <dig> lineage and hence, support an asian origin of m majorhaplogroup.
analysis of human complete mitochondrial dna sequences has largely contributed to resolve phylogenies and antiquity of different lineages belonging to the majorhaplogroups l, n and m .
furthermore, this study supports the non existence of lineages such as m <dig> and m <dig> that are solely defined on the basis of fast mutating control region motifs and hence, establishes the importance of coding region markers for an accurate understanding of the phylogeny.
this study describes five new basal mutations and recognizes two new lineages, m <dig> and m <dig> that substantially contribute to the present understanding of macrohaplogroup m. these two newly erected lineages include the previously independent lineages m <dig> and m <dig> as sub-lineages within them, respectively, suggesting that most mt dna genomes might arise as limited offshoots of m trunk.
m <dig> comprises of m <dig> and identifies a potential new sub-lineage possessing substitution at  <dig> and  <dig>  it further branches into m30a sub-lineage, defined by  <dig> and 195a substitution.
