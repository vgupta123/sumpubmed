using genome next-generation sequencing data and appropriate bioinformatics tool, it is plausible to accurately identify transposon insertion sites, which could provide candidate causal mutations for desired phenotypes for further functional validation.
we developed a novel bioinformatics tool, itis , for localizing transposon insertion sites within a genome.
it takes next-generation genome re-sequencing data , transposon sequence, and reference genome sequence as input, and generates a list of highly reliable candidate insertion sites as well as zygosity information of each insertion.
with the case study data, we demonstrated the efficiency of itis by validating the presence and zygosity of predicted insertion sites of the tnt <dig> transposon within a complex plant system, m. truncatula.

using a simulated dataset and a case study based on an insertional mutant line from medicago truncatula, we showed that itis performed better in terms of sensitivity and specificity than other similar algorithms such as relocate, retroseq, temp and tif.
transposition events associated with phenotypic changes occur naturally or are induced in insertional mutant populations.
transposon mutagenesis results in multiple random insertions and recovery of most/all the insertions is critical for forward genetics study.
transposable elements constitute an important part of the genome and are essential in adaptive mechanisms.
this study showed that itis is a robust and powerful tool for forward genetic studies in identifying transposable element insertions causing phenotypes.
