both omps showed distinct expression patterns in zebrafish; omp <dig> was expressed in the deep layer of the olfactory epithelium , which is consistent with previous studies of mice and zebrafish, whereas omp <dig> was sporadically expressed in the superficial layer.
we found distinct expression patterns of zebrafish omp <dig> and  <dig> at the tissue and cellular level.
these differences in expression patterns may be explained by subfunctionalization as the model of molecular evolution.
then, two omp gene paralogs derived from 3r-wgd reduced and specialized the expression patterns.
in addition, the analysis of transcriptome data of spotted gar, a non-teleost fish, revealed that single omp gene was expressed in the eyes.
namely, single omp gene was speculated to be originally expressed in the oe and the eyes in the common ancestor of all osteichthyes .
this study provides a good example for analyzing a functional subdivision of the teleost oe and eyes as revealed by 3r-derived paralogs of omps.
two rounds of wgd  occurred in the common ancestor of gnathostomata and cyclostomata, followed by the third-round wgd  in a common ancestor of all modern teleosts.
however, the recent studies of 3r-derived paralogs tend to be based on in silico analyses.
whole genome duplications  have been proposed to have made a significant impact on vertebrate evolution.
