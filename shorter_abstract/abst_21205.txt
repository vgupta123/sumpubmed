biologists generally interrogate genomics data using web-based genome browsers that have limited analytical potential.
new generation genome browsers such as the integrated genome browser  have largely overcome this limitation and permit customized analyses to be implemented using plugins.
we illustrate the use of a plugin for igb that exploits advanced visualization techniques to integrate the analysis of genomics data with network and structural approaches.
starting from the mdm2-p <dig> interaction, which is a high-value target for cancer therapy, and nutlin, the parent small molecule of an mdm <dig> antagonist that is currently in clinical trials, we show that this method can be generalized to analyze how drugs and mutations can interfere with both protein-protein and drug-protein networks.
we show how visualization technologies that combine both genomics and network biology can facilitate the selection of the key amino acid contacts from protein-protein and protein-drug interactions.
we illustrate this point by two additional use-cases exploring the molecular basis of tamoxifen side effects and of drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia patients.
