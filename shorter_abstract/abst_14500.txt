however, few studies of the genomes of a. salmonicida subspecies have been reported to date.
we sequenced the genomes of additional a. salmonicida isolates, including three from india, using next-generation sequencing in order to gain a better understanding of the genomic and phylogenetic links between a. salmonicida subspecies.
this observation, based on comparative genomics, is in agreement with previous results showing that insertion sequence mobility induced by heat in a. salmonicida subspecies causes genomic plasticity, resulting in a deleterious effect on the virulence of the bacterium.
the indian isolates, which formed a sub-group together with a. salmonicida subsp.
amino acid frequencies, gc content, trna composition, loss and gain of genes during evolution, pseudogenes as well as genes under positive selection and the mobilome were studied to explain this intraspecies dichotomy.
aeromonads make up a group of gram-negative bacteria that includes human and fish pathogens.
insertion sequences appeared to be an important driving force that locked the psychrophilic strains into their particular lifestyle in order to conserve their genomic integrity.
