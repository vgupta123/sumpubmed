dietary non-digestible carbohydrates stimulate the gut microflora and are therefore presumed to improve host resistance to intestinal infections.
mrna was collected from colonic mucosa and changes in gene expression were assessed for each individual rat using agilent rat whole genome microarrays.
these results indicate that dietary fos influences intestinal mucosal energy metabolism.
to examine the mechanisms underlying weakening of the intestinal barrier by fos, a controlled dietary intervention study was performed.
we conclude that altered energy metabolism may underly colonic barrier function disruption due to fos feeding in rats.
fos upregulated expression of the peptide hormone proglucagon gene, in agreement with previous studies, as well as three other peptide hormone genes; peptide yy, pancreatic polypeptide and cholecystokinin.
however, several strictly controlled rat infection studies showed that non-digestible fructo-oligosaccharides  increase, rather than decrease, translocation of salmonella towards extra-intestinal sites.
furthermore, increased expression of  <dig> genes related to protein turnover, including proteasome genes, ribosomal genes and protein maturation related genes, was seen.
fos did not induce changes in tight junction genes and only  <dig> genes related to mucosal defense were induced by fos.
possible explanations are altered mucosal integrity due to changes in tight junctions or changes in expression of defense molecules such as antimicrobials and mucins.
these small effects are unlikely the cause for the clear increase in intestinal permeability that is observed.
in addition, it was shown that fos increases intestinal permeability already before infection.
