genomic and syntenic analyses in addition to lack of pcr amplification show that one of the duplicated copies, ar-b, was lost in several basal clupeocephala such as cypriniformes , siluriformes, characiformes and salmoniformes.
the comparison of the mutations present in these divergent ar-b with those known in human to be implicated in complete, partial or mild androgen insensitivity syndrome suggests that the existence of two distinct ar duplicates may be correlated to specific functional differences that may be connected to the well-known plasticity of sex determination in fish.
in this paper, we studied in a wide range of actinopterygians the duplication and fate of the androgen receptor , a nuclear receptor known to play a key role in sex-determination in vertebrates.
based on the observation of an increased number of paralogous genes in teleost fishes compared with other vertebrates and on the conserved synteny between duplicated copies, it has been shown that a whole genome duplication  occurred during the evolution of actinopterygian fish.
this suggests that three specific events have shaped the present diversity of ars in actinopterygians:  early wgd,  parallel loss of one duplicate in several lineages and  putative neofunctionalization of the same duplicate in percomorphs, which occurred a long time after the wgd.
it has been proposed that this event might have facilitated the evolutionary radiation and the phenotypic diversification of the teleost fish, notably by allowing the sub- or neo-functionalization of many duplicated genes.
