the generation of regulatory pathways through text-mining tools allows the integration of data generated by several studies for a more complete visualization of complex biological processes.
the clustering of homologous genes together with determination of the ancestry leads to a better understanding of the evolution of such process.
we noticed the absence of a chart or pathway describing the well-studied preimplantation development stages; furthermore, not all genes involved in the process have entries in kegg orthology, important information for knowledge application with relation to other organisms.
these homologues allowed the determination of the last common ancestor for each gene and revealed that the preimplantation development pathway consists of a conserved ancient core of genes with the addition of modern elements.
the integration of sequencing and gene interaction data and subsequent generation of pathways and networks contained in databases such as kegg pathway is essential for the comprehension of complex biological processes.
