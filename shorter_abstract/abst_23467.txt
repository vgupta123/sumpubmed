the identification of protein-protein interaction sites is a computationally challenging task and important for understanding the biology of protein complexes.
our results strongly suggest that pcrfs form a methodological framework to improve residue-wise score-based protein-protein interface predictors given the scores are appropriately distributed.
we performed three sets of experiments with synthetic scores assigned to the surface residues of proteins taken from the data set planedimers compiled by zellner et al.
a prototypical implementation of our method is accessible at http://ppicrf.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/index.html.
thus we were able to improve the prediction of the prescont server devised by zellner et al.
some probabilistic models classify the residues on the basis of the posterior probabilities.
in this paper, we introduce pairwise conditional random fields  in which edges are not restricted to the backbone as in the case of linear-chain crfs utilized by li et al.
moreover, the pcrf-based enhancer is also successfully applicable, if the distributions are only unimodal over a certain sub-domain.
