the evolutionary analysis of molecular sequence variation is a statistical enterprise.
beast is a powerful and flexible evolutionary analysis package for molecular sequence variation.
here we present beast: a fast, flexible software architecture for bayesian analysis of molecular sequences related by an evolutionary tree.
this is reflected in the increased use of probabilistic models for phylogenetic inference, multiple sequence alignment, and molecular population genetics.
a large number of popular stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided and tree-based models suitable for both within- and between-species sequence data are implemented.
