an accuracy rate of  <dig> % and an area under the curve  value of  <dig>  were obtained in a cross validation.
because of this, the previous research has been limited by the relatively unbalanced accuracy rate and the low identification success of the current methods.
in this paper, we explored the practicality of modelling dna binding identification and simultaneously employed an ensemble classifier, and a new predictor  was designed.
the presented framework is comprised of two stages: a 188-dimension feature extraction method to obtain the protein structure and an ensemble classifier designated as imdc.

our method can help to accurately identify dna-binding proteins, and the web server is accessible at http://datamining.xmu.edu.cn/~songli/ndna.
experiments using different datasets showed that our method is more successful than the traditional methods in identifying dna-binding proteins.
in addition, we also predicted possible dna-binding protein sequences in all of the sequences from the uniprotkb/swiss-prot database.
a test dataset was tested in our method and resulted in an 86% accuracy, versus a 76% using idna-prot and a 68% accuracy using dna-prot.
the identification was conducted using a feature that selected the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance .
