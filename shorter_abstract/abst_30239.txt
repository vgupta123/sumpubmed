in this paper, we present a server with powerful capability not only for gene and protein functional annotation, but also for transcriptomics and proteomics data comparison.
with fast development of high-throughput technology, more and more transcriptomics and proteomics data are generated at an unprecedented rate.
moreover, the server provides many functionalities to compare transcriptomics and proteomics data.

therefore, requirement of software to annotate those omics data and explore their biological nature arises.
in the post-genomic era, transcriptomics and proteomics provide important information to understand the genomes.
