egf-induced sodium influx regulates egfr trafficking through increased microtubule acetylation.
na,k-atpase maintains intracellular sodium homeostasis, functions as a signaling scaffold and interacts with egfr.
trafficking of egfr relies on microtubule tracks that transport the cargo vesicle to their intermediate and final destinations and can be modulated through posttranslational modification of tubulin including acetylation.
these studies provide a novel regulatory mechanism to attenuate egfr signaling in which egf modulates egfr trafficking through intracellular sodium-mediated hdac <dig> inactivation and tubulin acetylation.
endocytosis of activated egf receptor  to specific endocytic compartments is required to terminate egf signaling.
na,k-atpase also binds to and is regulated by acetylated tubulin but whether there is a functional link between egfr, na,k-atpase and tubulin acetylation is not known.
in turn, blocking sodium influx reduced tubulin acetylation and egf-induced egfr turnover.
knockdown of hdac <dig> reversed the effect of sodium influx indicating that hdac <dig> is necessary to modulate sodium-dependent tubulin acetylation.
