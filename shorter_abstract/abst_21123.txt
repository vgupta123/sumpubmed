most analyses of symmetry and asymmetry have focused on organisms or parts with bilateral symmetry.
studies of complex symmetries are promising for many contexts in evolutionary biology, such as fluctuating asymmetry, because these structures can potentially provide more information than structures with bilateral symmetry.
for instance, some organisms have two axes of reflection symmetry  or rotational symmetry .
studies of symmetric structures have made important contributions to evolutionary biology, for example, by using fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of developmental instability or for investigating the mechanisms of morphological integration.
our results demonstrate that asymmetric variation predominates in this dataset and that its amount depends on the type of symmetry considered in the analysis.
our framework uses a mathematical definition of symmetry based on the theory of symmetry groups.
we illustrate this approach with data from a colonial coral that has ambiguous symmetry and thus can be analyzed in multiple ways.
so far, there is no general method for the shape analysis of these types of symmetry.
we generalize the morphometric methods currently used for the shape analysis of bilaterally symmetric objects so that they can be used for analyzing any type of symmetry.
this approach can be used to divide shape variation into a component of symmetric variation among individuals and one or more components of asymmetry.
