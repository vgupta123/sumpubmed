metabolomics is a systems approach to the analysis of cellular processes through small-molecule metabolite profiling.
however, the development of robust methods for the analysis of metabolomic data is a work-in-progress.
to demonstrate the use of the software we here present an analysis of 1d and 2d 1h nmr metabolomic data from a model system of mammalian cell growth under hypoxic conditions.
the ipython backend provides integration with existing platforms including matlab® and r, allowing data to be seamlessly transferred.
the core application provides a workflow editor, ipython kernel and a humancyc™-derived database of metabolites, proteins and genes.
toolkits provide reusable tools that may be linked together to create complex workflows.
