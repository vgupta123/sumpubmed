subsequently, we captured l. monocytogenes by myone-2d <dig> and myone-3f <dig> from hotdogs inoculated with mono- or co-cultures of l. monocytogenes and l. innocua , enriched for 18 h and detected by fiber-optic sensor and confirmed by plating, light-scattering, and qpcr assays.
furthermore, capture efficiency for myone-2d <dig> was highly specific for l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii.
the detection limit for l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii by the fiber-optic immunosensor was 3 × 102 cfu/ml using mab-2d <dig> as capture and reporter antibody.
ims coupled with a fiber-optic sensor using anti-inla mab is highly specific for l. monocytogenes and l. ivanovii and enabled detection of these pathogens at low levels from buffer or food.
in this study, monoclonal antibodies  against internalin a  and p <dig> were generated and used on paramagnetic beads of varying diameters for concentration, as well as on fiber-optic sensor for detection.
anti-inla mab-2d <dig>  was specific for listeria monocytogenes and l. ivanovii, and p30-specific mab-3f <dig>  was specific for the genus listeria.
selective media plating, light-scattering, and qpcr assays confirmed the ims and fiber-optic results.
immunomagnetic separation  and immunoassays are widely used for pathogen detection.
