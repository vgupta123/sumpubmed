sc is composed of the following modules: classifier design, data exploration, data visualisation, classifier evaluation, reports, and classifier history.
it accepts all kinds of pre-processed mrs data types and classifies them semi-automatically, allowing spectroscopists to concentrate on interpretation of results with the use of its visualisation tools.
classifier evaluation is performed through various methods: display of the confusion matrix of the training and testing datasets; k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out and bootstrapping as well as receiver operating characteristic  curves.
each functionality of sc has been specifically validated with real data with the purpose of bug-testing and methods validation.
the main goal of sc is to allow users with minimum background knowledge of multivariate statistics to perform a fully automated pattern recognition analysis.
sc is a user-friendly software designed to fulfil the needs of potential users in the mrs community.
in addition, to facilitate exchanging data between applications, a standard format capable of storing all the information needed for a dataset was developed.
spectraclassifier  is a java solution for designing and implementing magnetic resonance spectroscopy -based classifiers.
