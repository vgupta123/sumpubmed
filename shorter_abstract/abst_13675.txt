bovine-derived uc-wj cells, collected individually from  <dig> different umbilical cords sources, were successfully cultured under serum-free conditions and were capable to support  <dig> consecutive passages using commercial stemline® mesenchymal stem cells expansion medium.
we described for the first time the isolation and characterization of uc-wj cells in a serum-free condition and maintenance of primitive mesenchymal phenotype.
taken together all results, it was possible to demonstrate an easy way to isolate and culture of bovine-derived uc-wj cells under 2d and 3d serum-free condition, from fetal adnexa with a great potential in cell therapy and biotechnology.
the culture was stable under  <dig> consecutive passages with no genetic abnormalities and proliferating ratios.
additionally, the genes that are considered important embryonic, pou5f <dig> and itsn <dig>  and mesenchymal cell markers, cd105+, cd29+, cd73+ and cd90+ in mscs were also expressed in five bovine-derived uc-wj cultures.
moreover, the uc-wj cells were differentiated into osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes and neural-like cells and cultured separately.
moreover, the proliferative capacity of t cells in response to a mitogen stimulus was suppressed when bovine-derived uc-wj cells was included in the culture which demonstrated the immunossupression profile typically observed among isolated mesenchymal cells from other species.
after classified the uc-wj cells as mesenchymal stromal phenotype the in vitro 3d cultures was performed using the algimatrix® protocol.
based on the size of spheroids  we found that three weeks of culture was the best period to growth the uc-wj cells on 3d dimension.
