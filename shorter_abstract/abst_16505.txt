the two large-effect qtl corresponded to one each for flower color and leaf spininess.
here, we present an analysis of the genetic architecture of safflower domestication and compare our findings to those from sunflower , an independently domesticated oilseed crop within the same family.
as has been observed in sunflower, and unlike many other crops, our results suggest that the genetics of safflower domestication is quite complex.
we mapped  <dig> qtl, the vast majority of which  exhibited minor or moderate phenotypic effects.
of these, qtl for three traits  had cultivar alleles that conferred effects in the same direction in both species.
moreover, our comparative mapping results indicate that safflower and sunflower exhibit numerous instances of qtl colocalization, suggesting that parallel trait transitions during domestication may have been driven, at least in part, by parallel genotypic evolution at some of the same underlying genes.
also, we compared qtl positions in safflower against those that have been previously identified in cultivated x wild sunflower crosses to identify instances of colocalization.
we mapped quantitative trait loci  underlying  <dig> domestication-related traits in progeny from a cross between safflower and its wild progenitor, carthamus palaestinus eig.
safflower  is an oilseed crop in the compositae  that is valued for its oils rich in unsaturated fatty acids.
