trypanosome gene expression is regulated almost exclusively at the post-transcriptional level, with mrna degradation playing a decisive role.
when trypanosomes are transferred from the blood of a mammal to the midgut of a tsetse fly, they transform to procyclic forms: gene expression is reprogrammed, changing the cell surface and switching the mode of energy metabolism.
we describe here the transitions in gene expression that occur during differentiation of in-vitro cultured bloodstream forms to procyclic forms.
trypanosome genes form post-transcriptional regulons in which mrnas with functions in particular pathways, or encoding components of protein complexes, show almost identical patterns of regulation.
some mrnas showed changes within  <dig> min of cis-aconitate addition, whereas others responded 12- <dig> hours later.
within the blood, trypanosomes can pre-adapt for tsetse transmission, becoming growth-arrested stumpy forms.
for the first  <dig> h after addition of cis-aconitate, cells accumulated at the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, and showed decreases in mrnas required for proliferation, mimicking the changes seen in stumpy forms: many mrnas needed for ribosomal and flagellar biogenesis showed striking co-regulation.
