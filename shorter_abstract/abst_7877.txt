blochmannia floridanus provides important nutrients for its host, the ant camponotus, while the bacterium in return is provided with a niche to proliferate.
improved sequence analysis algorithms, databanks and gene and pathway context methods allowed us to reveal new information on various enzyme and pathways from the blochmannia floridanus genome sequence .
there is an increasing interest to better understand endosymbiont capabilities in insects both from an ecological point of view and for pest control.
these included septum initiation and cell division ; translation; transport; the ubiquinone , the inositol and nitrogen pathways.
blochmannia floridanus proteins and metabolites are difficult to study due to its endosymbiontic life style; however, its complete genome sequence became recently available.
we were able to assign a confirmed or at least a putative molecular function for  <dig> from  <dig> previously conserved hypothetical proteins.
furthermore, these predictions are supported and linked to experimental data for instance from structural genomics projects  or available biochemical data on proteins from other species which we show here to be related.
to extend and re-test predictions and links to experimentally verified protein functions, functional clusters and interactions were assembled.
taken together, our data allow a better and more complete description of the pathway capabilities and life style of this typical endosymbiont.
