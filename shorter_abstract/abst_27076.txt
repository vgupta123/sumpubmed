cyanopeptolin gene cluster variability and biological functions of the peptide variants are likely to be interconnected.
we have investigated two cyanopeptolin gene clusters from highly similar, but geographically remote strains of the same genus.
sequencing of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase  cyanopeptolin gene cluster from the japanese strain planktothrix nies  <dig> , showed the  <dig> kb gene cluster to be highly similar to the oci gene cluster previously described in planktothrix niva cya  <dig>  isolated in norway.
nucleotide statistics indicate that both purifying selection and positive selection forces are operating on the gene cluster.
the positive selection forces are acting within and around the epimerase insertion while purifying selection conserves the remaining  part of the gene cluster.
the presence of an epimerase in the gene cluster is in line with the d-configuration of htyr, determined experimentally in oscillapeptin e in a previous study.
sequence analyses showed a high degree of conservation, except for the presence of an epimerase domain in nies  <dig> and the regions around the epimerase, showing high substitution rates and ka/ks values above  <dig>  the two strains produce almost identical cyanopeptolins, cyanopeptolin- <dig> and oscillapeptin e respectively, but with slight differences regarding the production of minor cyanopeptolin variants.
cyanopeptolins are nonribosomally produced heptapetides showing a highly variable composition.
other genetic markers  were identical, supporting that these geographically separated planktothrix strains are closely related.
