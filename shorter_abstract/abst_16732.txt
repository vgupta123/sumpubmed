a large proportion of the gene transcripts  were detected in all three age groups.
not all or genes are expressed at a detectable level.
we observed very little difference between males and females and between rats from two different suppliers.
using microarray hybridization and rtqpcr, we analyzed the mrna profiles of the olfactory epithelium of male and female brown norway rats of different origins and ages .
pups expressed fewer or genes than adult rats, and generally at a lower level; however, a small subset of or genes were more strongly expressed in these newborn rats.
mammalian genomes contain a large number  of olfactory receptor  genes, many of which  are pseudogenes.
or gene transcription is not restricted to the olfactory epithelium, but is found in numerous tissues.
most or genes were expressed at lower levels at birth than in older animals, but a small number of or genes were expressed specifically or were overexpressed in newborns.
