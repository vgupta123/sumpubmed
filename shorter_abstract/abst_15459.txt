in this study we have extended this approach to include a number of recently sequenced protists, four of which are pathogenic, to identify fusion linked proteins in trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of african sleeping sickness.
their gene products interact either as part of a multi-subunit protein complex, or in a metabolic pathway.
domain or gene fusion analysis is a bioinformatics method for detecting gene fusions in one organism by comparing its genome to that of other organisms.
the occurrence of gene fusions suggests that the two original genes that participated in the fusion are functionally linked, i.e.
we find relatively limited occurrence of gene fusions/fissions within the protist lineages examined.
our results point to two trypanosome-specific gene fissions, which have recently been experimentally confirmed, one fusion involving proteins involved in the same metabolic pathway, as well as two novel putative functional links between fusion-linked protein pairs.
we have used strict thresholds and only discuss results which are highly likely to be genuine and which either have already been or can be experimentally verified.
gene fusion analysis has been used to identify protein functional links in prokaryotes as well as in eukaryotic model organisms, such as yeast and drosophila.
this is the first study of protein functional links in t. brucei identified by gene fusion analysis.
