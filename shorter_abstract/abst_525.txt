in the study lasting from  <dig> to  <dig> we compared the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli isolated from children, domestic animals, poultry meat and surface water in northern poland.
the results proved the presence of campylobacter spp.

the highest percentage of c. jejuni isolates with resistance to ciprofloxacin were found in samples from 80% dogs and 85% ponds.
one c. jejuni isolate from a fountain was resistant to four antimicrobial agents .
campylobacteriosis is a dominant bacterial cause of foodborne infection and is considered the main public health problem in europe and many other countries worldwide.
the study proved that surface water, poultry meat and pets constituted potential sources of campylobacter to children.
two c. coli  and four c. jejuni  isolated from poultry meat were resistant to erythromycin.
among isolates resistant to two antimicrobials  <dig> % c. jejuni and  <dig> % c. coli isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin as well as to tetracycline.
only one cat c. coli isolate was resistant to both azithromycin and erythromycin.
fountains can be a direct source of children campylobacteriosis but can also pollute other environments with multidrug-resistant campylobacter.
it decreased from  <dig> % in  <dig> to  <dig> % in  <dig>  it should be highlighted with a particular concern that campylobacter jejuni was detected in  <dig> % of fountains.
all children and poultry meat isolates were susceptible to azithromycin.
in children isolates was  <dig> %.
the percentage of campylobacter-positive samples differed among the sample types, from 0%  to  <dig> % .
the high resistance to some antimicrobials among the isolates may lead to increasing numbers of difficult-to-treat campylobacteriosis cases among children.
