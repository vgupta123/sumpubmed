our results suggest that max <dig> previously characterized for its role in regulation of polar auxin transport in arabidopsis, and thus plant development also significantly influences plant disease resistance.
we conclude that the increased susceptibility to p. syringae and p. carotovorum is due to increased stomatal conductance in max <dig> mutants promoting pathogen entry into the plant apoplast.
a reverse genetic screen for f-box protein mutants altered in their stress responses identified max <dig> as a component of plant defense.
max <dig> mutant phenotype was associated with constitutively increased stomatal conductance and decreased tolerance to apoplastic ros but also with alterations in hormonal balance.
additional factors contributing to pathogen susceptibility in max <dig> plants include decreased tolerance to pathogen-triggered apoplastic ros and alterations in hormonal signaling.
max <dig> appears essential for the perception of the newly characterized phytohormone strigolactone, a negative regulator of polar auxin transport in arabidopsis.
the arabidopsis thaliana f-box protein more axillary growth <dig>  has previously been characterized for its role in plant development.
