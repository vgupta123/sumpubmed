we conducted a broad scale phylogeographic analysis of the least salmonfly pteronarcella badia  across western north america.
evidence from five mitochondrial genes and one nuclear locus identified a potentially cryptic lineage in the pacific northwest.
gene flow estimates and geographic clade distributions suggest that overland flight during the winged adult stage is an important dispersal mechanism for this taxon.
we found evidence of multiple glacial refugia across the species distribution and signs of secondary contact within and among major clades.
phylogeographic studies of aquatic insects provide valuable insights into mechanisms that shape the genetic structure of communities, yet studies that include broad geographic areas are uncommon for this group.
we tested hypotheses related to mode of dispersal and the influence of historic climate oscillations on population genetic structure.
this work adds to the ever-growing list of studies that highlight the potential of next-generation dna sequencing in a phylogenetic context to improve molecular data sets from understudied groups.
in order to generate a larger mitochondrial data set, we used  <dig> sequencing to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial genome in the early stages of the project.
our analysis revealed high levels of population structure with several deeply divergent clades present across the sample area.
we identified several geographic areas that may have historical importance for other aquatic organisms with similar distributions and dispersal strategies as p. badia.
our findings add to an understanding of the role of historical climate isolations in shaping assemblages of aquatic insects in this region.
