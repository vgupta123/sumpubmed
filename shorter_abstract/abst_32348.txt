zinc finger proteins  play an important role in regulating plant responses to abiotic stress.
these findings illustrated that oslol <dig> overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for sa stress through active oxygen species.
sa stress caused significant changes in the malondialdehyde  contents in non-transgenic plants compared with those in transgenic lines.
the results suggested that oslol <dig> improved sa tolerance in plants, and regulated oxidative and salinity stress retardation via the active oxygen detoxification pathway.
oslol <dig> was located in the nucleus as evidenced by the bombardment of onion epidermal cells.
the present study showed that the oslol <dig> genes involved in the ros signaling pathways may combine with the model plant arabidopsis and rice in lds1-type zfp by ros signaling pathways that regulate cell necrosis.
the yeast invsci bacterium grew significantly better than the control strain under nacl, nahco <dig>  and h2o <dig> treatments.
transgenic rice overexpressing oslol <dig> exhibited stronger resistance than nt under nahco <dig> treatment, as demonstrated by its greater shoot length, and fresh weight.
oslol <dig> expression significantly increased in rice leaves and roots under 150 mmol l- <dig> nacl, 30 mm nahco <dig>  and 10 mmol l- <dig> h2o <dig> treatment, respectively.
we speculated that the oslol <dig> active oxygen scavenging system may have coordinating roles.
the present study further revealed that oslol <dig> zfp could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains.
transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing oslol <dig> grew well in the presence ofboth nacl and nahco <dig> treatments, whereas wild-type plants exhibited chlorosis, stunted growth phenotype, and even death.
the genes associated with oxidative stress, such as osapx <dig>  oscat, oscu/zn-sod, and osrgrc <dig>  were significantly upregulated in oslol5-overexpressing rice.
overexpression of oslol <dig> in yeast resulted in sa tolerance at significant level.
in this study, oslol <dig> , containing two lsd1-like-type c2c <dig> domains, was isolated and analyzed its protection roles in transgenic plants and yeast.
