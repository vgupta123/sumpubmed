the phage therapy effectively cured the ulcerative lesions of the infected fish in 8â€“ <dig> days of treatment, with a sevenfold reduction of the lesion with untreated infection control.
the specific bacteriophage was isolated and concentrated using coal bed developed in our lab at csir-neeri.
the isolated bacteria from fish lesions was characterised based on isolation on selective and differential medium like pseudomonas agar, gram staining, biochemical tests and 16srrna sequencing.
the bacteriophage therapy is an effective antimicrobial approach with potentially important applications in medicine and biotechnology which can be seen as an additional string in the bow.
bacteriophage therapy can have potential applications soon as an alternative or as a complement to antibiotic treatment in the aquaculture.
we present bacteriophage therapy as a treatment method for controlling mdr p. aeruginosa infection in c. gariepinus.
emerging drug resistant bacteria in aquaculture industry due to unrestricted use of antibiotics warrants more sustainable and environmental friendly strategies for controlling fish infections.
one out of twenty p. aeruginosa isolate showing multi drug resistance  was incidentally found to be mbl producing as determined by imipenem-edta disk method.
to the best of our knowledge this is a first report of application of phage therapy against mbl producing p. aeruginosa isolated from aquatic ecosystem.
the pathogenic bacterium responsible for causing ulcerative lesions in catfish species  was identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa.
the phage therapy was applied for treating ulcerative lesion in fish.
