we found that the holdfast undergoes a two-stage process of spreading and thickening during its morphogenesis.
the diameter of the holdfast plate reaches its final average value of  <dig> nm by the cell age of ~  <dig> min, while its thickness further increases until the age of ~  <dig> min.
the holdfast first forms a thin plate on the surface.
it has strong affinity to the surface and cures to form a plate-like holdfast capable of supporting strong and permanent adhesion.
we report a study by fluorescence imaging and atomic force microscopy on the growth in size and thickness of the holdfast of synchronized caulobacter crescentus cells as they attach to a glass surface.
our afm analysis indicates that the holdfast is typically thicker in the middle, with gradual falloff in thickness towards the outer edge.
