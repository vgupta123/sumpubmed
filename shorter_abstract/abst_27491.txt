actinomycetes from the arctic ocean have rarely been investigated for halogenases and their gene clusters associated, albeit great potential of halometabolite production has been predicted.
halometabolites, an important group of natural products, generally require halogenases for their biosynthesis.
in addition, our study indicates that great genetic potential of new halometabolites can be expected from mostly untapped actinomycetes from the polar regions.
therefore, we initiated this research on the screening of halogenases from arctic marine actinomycetes isolates to explore their genetic potential of halometabolite biosynthesis.
genome sequencing can also identify cryptic gene clusters potentially producing new halometabolites, which might be easily missed by traditional isolation and chemical characterization.
genome sequencing revealed a potential gene cluster containing the halogenase predicted to catalyze peptide-like compounds.
however, the gene cluster was probably silent under the current conditions.
nine halogenase genes were discovered from sixty arctic marine actinomycetes using in-house designed or previously reported pcr primers.
pcr-based screening of halogenase genes is a powerful and efficient tool to conduct bioprospecting of halometabolite-producing actinomycetes from the arctic.
