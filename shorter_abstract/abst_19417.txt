in addition, we develop a graphical user interface designed to facilitate processing and interpretation of movement data.
in this paper, we introduce nemo , a computationally efficient and robust two-dimensional object tracking algorithm for automated detection and analysis of c. elegans locomotion.
while, in this study, we focus on the simple sinusoidal locomotion of c. elegans, our approach can be readily adapted to handle complicated locomotory behaviour patterns by including additional movement characteristics and parameters subject to quantification.
our software tool offers the capacity to extract, analyze and measure nematode locomotion features by processing simple video files.
monitoring and examination of such alterations requires tools to capture and quantify features of nematode movement.
this algorithm enables precise measurement and feature extraction of nematode movement components.
