in the cotton bollworm, helicoverpa armigera, the prediapause phase, which contains two sub-phases, diapause induction and preparation, occurs in the larval stage.
the proteins and metabolites with significantly altered levels play different roles in diapause-destined larvae, including diapause induction, metabolic storage, immune response, stress tolerance, and others.
of these proteins,  <dig> were successfully identified by maldi-tof/tof mass spectrometry.
here, we performed parallel proteomic and metabolomic analyses on h. armigera larval hemolymph during the prediapause phase.
pupal diapause is induced by environmental signals and is prepared during the prediapause phase.
moreover, a total of  <dig> altered metabolites were found in diapause-destined larval hemolymph by gc-ms analysis, and the levels of  <dig> metabolites were elevated and  <dig> were decreased.
diapause is programmed developmental arrest coupled with the depression of metabolic activity and the enhancement of stress resistance.
