dna-binding proteins  play fundamental roles in many biological processes.
the experimental results of our predictor on two benchmark datasets outperformed many state-of-the-art predictors, which revealed the effectiveness of our method.
the promising prediction performance on a new-compiled independent testing dataset from pdb and a large-scale dataset from uniprot proved the good generalization ability of our method.
these features included evolutionary conservation profile, secondary structure motifs, and physicochemical properties.
thirdly, we introduced a novel improved binary firefly algorithm  to remove redundant or noisy features as well as select optimal parameters for the classifier.
secondly, we used multiple informative features to encode the protein.
