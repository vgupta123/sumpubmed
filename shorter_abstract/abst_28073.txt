the size and repetitive nature of the rhipicephalus microplus genome makes obtaining a full genome sequence fiscally and technically problematic.
to selectively obtain gene-enriched regions of this tick's genome, cot filtration was performed, and cot-filtered dna was sequenced via  <dig> flx pyrosequencing.
comparison of the bac and cot filtration data indicates that cot filtration was highly successful in filtering repetitive dna out of the genomic dna used in  <dig> sequencing.
cot filtration is a very useful strategy to incorporate into genome sequencing projects on organisms with large genome sizes and which contain high percentages of repetitive, difficult to assemble, genomic dna.
to survey the repetitive elements in the tick genome, the complete sequences of five bac clones were determined.
the sequenced cot-filtered genomic dna was assembled with an est-based gene index of  <dig>  unique entries where each est served as a potential "seed" for scaffold formation.
