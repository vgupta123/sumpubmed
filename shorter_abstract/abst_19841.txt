both kinds of mirnas were involved in cold stress response, but all the conserved mirnas were up-regulated, implying an important role for cold-induced mirnas.
although mirnas are proved to be involved in plant cold stress responses, little is known for winter-habit monocots.
the different size and genome organization of mirna families in brachypodium and rice suggest that the frequency of duplication events or the selection pressure on duplicated mirnas are different between these two closely related plant species.
brachypodium distachyon, with close evolutionary relationship to cool-season cereals, has recently emerged as a novel model plant.
there are few reports of brachypodium mirnas.
our results suggest that brachypodium mirnas are composed of a set of conserved mirnas and a large proportion of non-conserved mirnas with low expression levels.
the genome organization of mir <dig> family in brachypodium was quite different from that in rice.
among these mirnas, some were cold-induced and some were cold-suppressed, but all the conserved mirnas were up-regulated under cold stress condition.
the expression of  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> predicted mirnas showed significant changes in response to cold stress.
for multiple-member conserved mirna families, their sizes in brachypodium were much smaller than those in rice and populus.
micrornas  are endogenous small rnas having large-scale regulatory effects on plant development and stress responses.
