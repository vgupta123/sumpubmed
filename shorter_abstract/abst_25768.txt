the most efficient method of transformation used cotyledonary node explants from 7-days-old seedlings with a shifting kanamycin selection.
overall, testing six different vectors and two kinds of agrobacterium strains, the average transformation frequency using the shifting method was  <dig> %.
present research revealed the potential of using crambe meristematic tissue for genetic transformation and in vitro propagation.
axillary buds showed the highest shoot proliferation efficiency.
meristematic tissues  had the highest ability for shoot proliferation.
for propagation by tissue culture, explants of stems, petioles, leaves and axillary buds of in vitro plantlets were tested using the optimized medium.
later, in vitro plant axillary buds were tried as explants for transformation, however, transformation frequency was low ranging from  <dig>  to 2%.
cotyledonary nodes were used to test the proper concentration of kanamycin for selection of transformation events, and  <dig> to 25 mg · l- <dig> were identified as effective.
cotyledonary nodes on basic medium with  <dig>  μm naa and  <dig>  μm bap gave the highest regeneration percentages.
the cotyledonary nodes and cotyledons from 7-day-old seedlings were used in agrobacterium-mediated transformations with two kinds of selection strategies, shifting or consistent.
using the shifting selection method  cotyledonary nodes gave 10% transformation frequency, and cotyledons 4%, while with the consistent method  lower frequencies were found, 1% for cotyledonary nodes and 0% for cotyledons).
different explant types from crambe seedlings were tested for shoot regeneration using different hormone-combinations.
furthermore, it is a potential platform for various feedstock oils for industrial uses based on genetic modification.
