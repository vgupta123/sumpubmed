i-type cells were investigated as a bipotential  differentiation stage.
n- and i-type cells displayed cytoplasmic membrane gd <dig> staining, while nuclear calcyclin was restricted to s-type.
n- and i-type cells showed similar phenotype and immunoreactivity pattern.
n- and i-type cells displayed similar differentiation capacity towards neuronal and glial lineage fates.
s-type cells appear irreversibly committed to a glial lineage fate.
results suggest that n- and i-type nb cell subtypes represent an immature bilineage stage, able to progress towards neuronal and glial fates upon induction of differentiation.
s-type cells, upon induction, did not show a neuronal-like phenotype, despite gene expression changes.
neuroblastic tumors  derive from neural crest stem cells .
in culture, neuroblastic , substrate-adherent  and intermediate phenotype  cell subtypes arise spontaneously.
differential gene expression was associated with each cell subtype.
