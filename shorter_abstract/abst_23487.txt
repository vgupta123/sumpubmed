its sensitivity is comparable to the method based on the covariance model .
for six out of ten riboswitch classes, our method detects more than  <dig> % of the candidates identified by the much slower cm method while being several hundred times faster.
for three riboswitch classes, our method detects 97-99% of the candidates relative to the cm method.
our method works very well for those classes of riboswitches that are characterized by distinct and conserved sequence motifs.
our method exploits the high degree of sequence conservation that characterizes the aptamer domain.
every class of riboswitch is characterized by an aptamer domain, which provides the site for ligand binding, and an expression platform that undergoes conformational change on ligand binding.
the sequence and structure of the aptamer domain is highly conserved in riboswitches belonging to the same class.
we propose a method for fast and accurate identification of riboswitches using profile hidden markov models .
however, a complete picture of the distribution pattern of riboswitches will emerge only after accurate identification of riboswitches across genomes.
riboswitches are a type of noncoding rna that regulate gene expression by switching from one structural conformation to another on ligand binding.
our method can detect riboswitches in genomic databases rapidly and accurately.
