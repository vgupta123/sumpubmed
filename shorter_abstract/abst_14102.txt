the phylogenetic distribution of this gene loss/transfer and the high level of sequence similarity in transit peptides suggest a single transfer of the plastid-encoded rpl <dig> to the nucleus in the ancestor of the subfamily thalictroideae approximately 20â€“ <dig> mya.
the complete plastid genome of thalictrum coreanum, the first from the subfamily thalictroideae , was sequenced and revealed the losses of two genes, infa and rpl <dig>  the functional transfer of these two genes to the nucleus in thalictrum was verified by examination of nuclear transcriptomes.
thalictrum is unusual among the three sequenced ranunculaceae plastid genomes in the loss of two genes infa and rpl <dig>  which have been functionally transferred to the nucleus.
comparative genomic investigations have shown that gene transfer from plastids to the nucleus is an ongoing evolutionary process but molecular evidence for recent functional gene transfers among seed plants have only been documented for the four genes accd, infa, rpl <dig>  and rpl <dig>
the genome sequence of thalictrum coreanum provides valuable information for improving the understanding of the evolution of plastid genomes within ranunculaceae and across angiosperms.
a nuclear-encoded rpl <dig> with high sequence identity was identified in both thalictrum and aquilegia.
the plastid-encoded rpl <dig> gene is likely nonfunctional in members of the subfamily thalictroideae  including  <dig> thalictrum species due to the presence of indels that disrupt the reading frame.
a survey of the phylogenetic distribution of the rpl <dig> loss was performed using  <dig> species of thalictrum and representatives of related genera in the subfamily thalictroideae.
