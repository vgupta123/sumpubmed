we have designed an oligonucleotide probe for use in fluorescent in situ hybridization  and two pairs of pcr primers targeting a c. testosteroni subgroup.
the fish probe and one of the pcr primer pairs are suitable for quantification of c. testosteroni in mixed microbial communities using fish followed by quantitative image analysis or real-time quantitative pcr, respectively.
additionally, we have successfully used quantitative pcr to follow the c. testosteroni abundance during a laboratory scale wastewater bioaugmentation experiment.
the oligonucleotides presented here provide a useful tool to study c. testosteroni population dynamics in mixed microbial communities.
this has been shown by analysis of samples from an enrichment of activated sludge on testosterone resulting in an increase in abundance and finally isolation of c. testosteroni.
the ability to detect and quantify members of this species in mixed microbial communities thus may be desirable.
