identifying candidate genes responsible for flavonoid biosynthesis pathway  will facilitate understanding the molecular mechanism of controlling pigment formation in yam tubers.
this study provides the first comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for yam tubers, which will significantly contribute to genomic research of this and other related species.
some key genes associated with purple-flesh trait were successfully identified, thus providing valuable information about molecular process of regulating pigment accumulation in elite yam tubers.
in addition, our ssr marker sets will facilitate identification of qtls for various tuber traits in yam breeding programs.
yam  is an important tuber crop and purple pigmented elite cultivar has recently become popular because of associated health benefits.
transcriptome analysis detected  <dig> unigenes encoding multiple well-known enzymes in the fbp.
here, we used illumina sequencing to characterize the transcriptome of tubers from elite purple-flesh cultivar  and conventional white-flesh cultivar  of yam.
