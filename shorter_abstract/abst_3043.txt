retroposition, as a special type of gene duplication- the rna-based duplication, has been found to play an important role in new gene evolution in mammals and plants, but little is known about the process in the teleostei genome.
this is among the most rapid rates of generation of chimerical genes, just next to the rice.
our results indicate that retroposition created a large amount of new genes in the zebrafish genome, which has contributed significantly to the evolution of the fish genome.
based on our analysis of  <dig> pairs of orthologs between cyprinus carpio and danio rerio, we found that the synonymous substitution rate of zebrafish genes is  <dig> Ã—10- <dig> substitution per silent site per year.
retrocopies have long been considered evolutionary dead ends without functional significance due to the presumption that retrocopies lack the regulatory element needed for expression.
this discovery combined with the substitution analysis suggested that the majority of all retrocopies are subject to negative selection, indicating that most of the retrocopies may be functional retrogenes.
we also found  <dig> chimerical retrogenes that were created in the last  <dig> million years, which is  <dig>  times the rate of  <dig>  chimerical retrogenes per million years in the primate lineage toward human and  <dig>  times the rate of  <dig>  chimerical genes per million years in drosophila.
we identified  <dig> retrocopies, of which  <dig> are intact retrogenes and  <dig> are pseudogenes.
here we screened the zebrafish genome for identification of retrocopies and new chimerical retrogenes and investigated their origination and evolution.
one of the major mechanism providing raw materials for the origin of new genes is gene duplication.
