the purpose of this study was to characterize expression and activation of stat <dig> in feline oscc cell lines and tumor samples and to investigate the biologic activity of a novel, allosteric stat <dig> inhibitor, lll <dig>  in feline oscc cell lines.
the oscc cell lines with low basal stat <dig> phosphorylation did not exhibit these effects, suggesting that stat <dig> inhibition was responsible for the observed results.
signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig>  plays a critical role in tumor development by regulating signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, metastasis and angiogenesis.
we evaluated  <dig> feline oscc cell lines and one of these  exhibited high levels of constitutive stat <dig> phosphorylation and high sensitivity to lll <dig> treatment.
these data demonstrate that lll <dig> has biologic activity against a feline oscc cell line expressing pstat <dig> and that stat <dig> represents a target for therapeutic intervention in this disease.
feline oral squamous cell carcinoma  is similar to advanced or recurrent hnscc as it is poorly responsive to traditional therapies and carries a poor long-term prognosis.
stat <dig> is activated in many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  in people.
exposure of sccf <dig> cells to lll <dig> resulted in decreased expression of pstat <dig> and total stat <dig>  apoptosis as assessed by caspase 3/ <dig> activation, inhibition of colony formation and reduced expression of the stat <dig> transcriptional target survivin.
