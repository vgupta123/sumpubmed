we provide a genome-wide map of selection signatures in the chicken genome, and make a contribution to the better understanding the mechanisms of selection for af content in chickens.
genomic regions controlling abdominal fatness  were studied in the northeast agricultural university broiler line divergently selected for af.
these genes may be important for af deposition in chickens.
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> core regions were detected in the lean and fat lines, and  <dig> and  <dig> reached a significant level , respectively.
in this study, the chicken 60ksnp chip and extended haplotype homozygosity  test were used to detect genome-wide signatures of af.
