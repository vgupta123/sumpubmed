to address this problem, we removed an extraneous target by pretreating genomic dna with a restriction enzyme.
the development of four independent populations with considerable mutation density, together with an additional method for screening closely related targets, indicates that soybean is a suitable organism for high-throughput mutation discovery even with its extensively duplicated genome.
the nmu-treated population and one ems mutagenized population had similar mutation density , while another ems population had a mutation density of ~1/ <dig> kb.
the remaining population had a mutation density of ~1/ <dig> kb.
we have applied tilling to four mutagenized soybean populations, three of which were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate  and one with n-nitroso-n-methylurea .
digestion of the template eliminated amplification of the extraneous target and allowed the identification of four additional mutant alleles compared to untreated template.
nevertheless, chemical mutagenesis can be applied to soybean followed by screening for mutations in a target of interest using a strategy known as targeting induced local lesions in genomes .
