overall, the prevalence of mutations is much higher in mitochondrial aarss, and the two most often mutated aarss are mitochondrial glutamyl-trna synthetase and dual localized glycyl-trna synthetase.
our data suggest that in some but not all cases, aars mutations occur in functional and structural sectors where they can manifest their pathological effects by altering enzyme activity or causing structural instability.
mutations in structural cores or at potential biomolecular interfaces account for ~55% mutations while remaining mutations  remain structurally un-annotated.
further, mutations appear in both solvent exposed and buried regions of aarss indicating that these alterations could lead to dysfunctional enzymes resulting in abnormal protein translation routines by affecting inter-molecular interactions or by disruption of non-bonded interactions.
this pipeline enabled us to super-annotate human aars mutations and analyze their linkage to health disorders.
the methodology described here could be employed to annotate mutations in other protein families in a high-throughput manner.
out of  <dig> mutations annotated in this work, only  <dig>  were observed in regions that could directly affect aminoacylation activity via either binding to atp/amino-acid, trna or by involvement in dimerization.
