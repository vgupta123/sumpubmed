in drosophila muscle cell fusion takes place both during the formation of the somatic mesoderm and the visceral mesoderm, giving rise to the skeletal muscles and the gut musculature respectively.
verprolin is expressed in the visceral mesoderm and plays a role in visceral muscle fusion as shown by mislocalization of duf/kirre in the verprolin mutant, however it is not absolutely required for myoblast fusion in either the visceral or the somatic mesoderm.
the core process of myoblast fusion is believed to be similar for both organs.
verprolin is specifically expressed in the fusion competent myoblasts of the visceral mesoderm, suggesting a role in visceral mesoderm fusion.
we here describe a novel verprolin mutant allele which displays subtle visceral mesoderm fusion defects in the form of mislocalization of the immunoglobulin superfamily molecule duf/kirre, which is required on the myoblast cell surface to facilitate attachment between cells that are about to fuse, indicating a function for verprolin in visceral mesoderm fusion.
