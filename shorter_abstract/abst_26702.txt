the marker with the highest − log in each chromosome is selected, and the segment is expanded one mb upstream and one mb downstream of the marker.
currently, association studies are analysed using statistical mixed models, with marker effects estimated by a linear transformation of genomic breeding values.
however, approaches used to estimate the parameters rely on a prior variance or on a constant estimate of the additive variance.
moreover, genome scanning of candidate segments can be used in meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies, as it enables the detection of specific genome regions that affect an economically relevant trait when using multiple populations.
the standardized test of marker effects using their own variance helps in detecting specific genomic regions involved in the additive variance, and in reducing false positives.
furthermore, genomic predictions are solved efficiently by the procedure, and the p-values are virtually identical to those calculated from tests for one marker effect at a time.
moreover, the standardized test reduces computing time and memory requirements.
the likelihood ratio is then calculated to test for the effect in every chromosome against a reduced model with fixed effects and genomic breeding values.
the following steps are used to locate genome segments displaying strong association.
the standardized test was neither conservative nor liberal with respect to type i error rate , compared to a similar test using predictor error variance, a method that was too conservative.
