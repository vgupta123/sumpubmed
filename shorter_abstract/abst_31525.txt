thus, functional characterization of identified pr proteins , trypsin protease inhibitor, aba responsive protein, cysteine protease, protein disulphide isomerase, ripening related protein and albumins are expected to serve as important molecular components for biotechnological application and development of sustainable resistance against foc <dig>
vascular wilt caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
comparative analyses of expression profiles of obtained proteins suggest that albeit some common components participate in early defense signaling in both susceptible and resistant genotypes, but their roles and regulation differ in case of compatible and/or incompatible interactions.
the present study focuses on comparative root proteomics of susceptible  and resistant  chickpea genotypes infected with foc <dig>  to understand the mechanistic basis of susceptibility and/or resistance.
the differential and unique proteins of both genotypes were identified at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h post foc <dig> inoculation.
the differential and unique proteins identified indicate their involvement in early defense signaling of the host.
qrt-pcr analyses were performed to correlate the mrna and protein levels of some proteins of representative classes.
although comparative transcriptomic profiling have highlighted some important signaling molecules, but proteomic studies involving chickpea-foc <dig> are limited.
network analyses of identified proteins revealed intra and inter relationship of these proteins with their neighbors as well as their association with different defense signaling pathways.
the fungus invades the plant via roots, colonizes the xylem vessels and prevents the upward translocation of water and nutrients, finally resulting in wilting of the entire plant.
2d page analyses followed by maldi-tof ms and ms/ms identified  <dig> differentially  or uniquely expressed proteins.
