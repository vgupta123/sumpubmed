in order to establish an animal model for neuronal migration disorders in the pig, we have studied the expression pattern and structure of reelin during pig brain development.
we determined the sequence of pig reelin mrna and protein and identified a high degree of homology to human reelin.
we conclude that the pig might serve as an alternative animal model to study reelin functions and that manipulation of the pig reelin could allow the establishment of an animal model for human neuronal migration disorders.
the pig possesses a gyrencephalic brain that bears resemblance to the human brain.
this resembles observations for human brain development.
a peak in reelin mrna and protein expression is present during the period of major neurogenesis and neuronal migration.
immunohistochemical analysis showed the highest expression of reelin in the cajal-reztius cells of the marginal zone, in resemblance with observations for the developing brain in humans and other mammalian species.
