to facilitate its use in a diagnostic setting, the 70-gene prognosis profile was translated into a customized microarray  containing a reduced set of  <dig>  probes suitable for high throughput processing.
a 70-gene tumor expression profile was established as a powerful predictor of disease outcome in young breast cancer patients.
the array is therefore an excellent tool to predict outcome of disease in breast cancer patients.
classification results obtained from the original analysis were then compared to those generated using the algorithms based on the custom microarray and showed an extremely high correlation of prognosis prediction between the original data and those generated using the custom mini-array .
this profile, however, was generated on microarrays containing  <dig>  60-mer oligonucleotides that are not designed for processing of many samples on a routine basis.
