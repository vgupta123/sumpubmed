results promise to enhance a fundamental understanding of evolutionary changes of tree architecture under domestication and to design sound silvicultural and breeding measures for improving plant productivity.
here we show that the plasticity of fine root growth may increase plant productivity based on an experiment using young seedlings  of loblolly pine.
for the "xeric" ecotype, the favorable influence of the plasticity of fine root growth on stem growth results from increased allocation of biomass to foliage and decreased allocation to fine roots.
an evolutionary genetic analysis indicates that the plasticity of fine root growth is inducible, whereas the plasticity of foliage is constitutive.
for the "mesic" ecotype, increased stem biomass as a consequence of more nutrients may be primarily due to reduced fine-root biomass partitioning.
the partitioning of biomass to fine roots is observed to reduce with increased nutrient availability.
the plastic response of fine roots to a changing environment is suggested to affect the growth and form of a plant.
