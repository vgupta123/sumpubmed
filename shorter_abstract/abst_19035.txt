model  <dig> explains gcn <dig> translation's nonlinear dependency upon uorf placements, and predicts that an as yet unidentified factor, which was proposed to regulate gcn <dig> translation under some conditions, only has pronounced effects upon gcn <dig> translation when intercistronic distances are unnaturally short.
importantly, the translation rate for codons starved of cognate trnas is predicted to be the most significant contributor to the changes in ribosomal loading in the coding region under repressing and derepressing conditions.
using published experimental data, we have developed and validated a probabilistic formulation of gcn <dig> translation using the chemical master equation .
using parameter values optimised for this algebraic model  <dig>  we performed stochastic simulations by gillespie algorithm to investigate the distribution of ribosomes in different sections of gcn <dig> mrna under distinct conditions.
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to amino acid starvation by inducing the transcription factor gcn <dig>  this is mainly mediated via a translational control mechanism dependent upon the translation initiation eif2·gtp·met-trnaimet ternary complex, and the four short upstream open reading frames  in its 5' mrna leader.
during amino acid starvation, levels of ternary complex are reduced.
the ensuing stochastic simulations evaluated different factors that may impact on the translation of gcn <dig> mrna, and integrated translation status with ribosomal density.
