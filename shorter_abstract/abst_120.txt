molecular-sequence  based phylogenetic and morphological analysis of brachymystax throughout siberia support that sharp- and blunt-snouted lenok are independent evolutionary lineages, with the majority of their variation distributed among major river basins.
broad-scale phylogeographic studies of freshwater organisms provide not only an invaluable framework for understanding the evolutionary history of species, but also a genetic imprint of the paleo-hydrological dynamics stemming from climatic change.
sharp- and blunt-snouted lenok have apparently undergone a long, independent, and demographically dynamic evolutionary history in siberia, supporting their recognition as two good biological species.
divergence of sharp-snouted lenok in the selenga-baikal catchment may correspond to the isolation of lake baikal in the mid-pleistocene, while older isolation events are apparent for blunt-snouted lenok in the extreme east and sharp-snouted lenok in the extreme west of their respective distributions.
inferred demographic expansions were dated earlier than the last glacial maximum .
phylogeographic structure reflects climatic limitations, especially for blunt-snouted lenok above 56Â° n during one or more glacial maxima.
