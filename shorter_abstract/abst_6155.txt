mp-pbmice can be easily adapted for other large-scale insertional mutation mapping projects and the source code of this software is freely available at http://www.idmshanghai.cn/pbmice.
this paper presents a database application called mp-pbmice , which is developed to serve the on-going large-scale pb insertional mutagenesis project.

it supports the collaboration among different groups that enter data and exchange information on daily basis, and is capable of providing real time progress reports for the whole project.
this project is carried out via collaborations among multiple groups overseeing interconnected experimental steps and generates a large volume of experimental data continuously.
insertional mutagenesis is an effective method for functional genomic studies in various organisms.
a large-scale insertional mutagenesis with the piggybac  transposon is currently performed in mice at the institute of developmental biology and molecular medicine , fudan university in shanghai, china.
a lightweight enterprise-level development framework struts-spring-hibernate is used here to ensure constructive and flexible support to the application.
mp-pbmice is a web-based application for large-scale insertional mutation mapping onto the mouse genome, implemented with the widely used framework struts-spring-hibernate.
this system is already in use by the on-going genome-wide pb insertional mutation mapping project at idm, fudan university.
therefore, the project calls for an efficient database system for recording, management, statistical analysis, and information exchange.
