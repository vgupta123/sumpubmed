those probe pairs are located within 1mbp window from each other and have a mean of absolute value of genetic correlation equal to  <dig> , further demonstrating the high degree of shared genetic control.
a substantial proportion of the variation in gene expression and dna methylation is known to be under genetic control.
expression qtls and epigenetic marks are often employed to provide an insight into the possible biological mechanisms behind gwas hits.

an exhaustive search for pairwise phenotypic correlations between gene expression and dna methylation in samples from human blood  was performed.
overall, this study demonstrates notable genetic covariance between dna methylation and gene expression and reaffirms the importance of correcting for cell-counts in studies on non-homogeneous tissues.
of the  <dig> ×  <dig> possible pairwise tests,  <dig>  % passed bonferroni corrected p-value cutoff of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  we determined that the correlation structure between probe pairs was largely due to blood cell type specificity of the expression and methylation probes.
upon adjustment of the expression and methylation values for observed blood cellular composition , the number of probe pairs which survived bonferroni correction reduced by more than  <dig> fold.
we address the proportion of genetic control that is shared between these two genomic features.
