feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus type  <dig> , clostridium perfringens alpha toxin , cryptosporidium spp., giardia spp., and salmonella spp.
cpv- <dig> was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections, associated with cpa, cryptosporidium spp., or giardia spp.
therefore, multiple pathogens should be investigated in dogs presenting with diarrhea.
the effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors.
the most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were cpa , cpv- <dig> , and giardia spp.
whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections, about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections.
diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls.
overall, 71/ <dig>  dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen: a single infection in 39/ <dig> dogs  and co-infections in 32/ <dig> dogs , including 21/ <dig> dogs  with dual, 5/ <dig>  with triple, and 6/ <dig>  with quadruple infections.
the objective of this study was to use a real-time pcr diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea, as well the frequency in different countries.
although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction , a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established.
infectious diarrhea can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or protozoan organisms, or a combination of these.
in the control group, 13/ <dig>  dogs were positive, all with single infections only.
