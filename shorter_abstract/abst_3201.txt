it was then found to interact with the coiled-coil domain of the rx and gpa <dig> resistance proteins, which confer resistance to potato virus x  and potato cyst nematode globodera pallida, respectively.
our results highlight how a resistance gene co-factor can manage in terms of evolution both an established role as a cell housekeeping gene and an implication in plant parasite interactions.
from a mechanistic point of view these results are in accordance with a physical interaction of rangap <dig> with gpa <dig> and suggest that rbp- <dig> would rather bind the rangap2-gpa <dig> complex than the rangap <dig> protein alone.
while functional and evolutionary analyses of gp-rbp- <dig> and gpa <dig> identified key residues in both the resistance and avirulence proteins that are involved in recognition determination, whether variation in rangap <dig> also plays a role in pathogen recognition has not been investigated.
we amplified a total of  <dig> rangap <dig> sequences from  <dig> accessions belonging to  <dig> different di-and tetraploid solanum species from the section petota.
nonetheless, we identified polymorphic positions in the protein sequence at the intra-specific level, which could modulate the activity of rangap <dig>  two polymorphic sites and a three amino-acid deletion in rangap <dig> were found to affect the timing and intensity of the gpa2-induced hypersensitive response to avirulent gp-rbp- <dig> variants even though they did not confer any gain of recognition of virulent gp-rbp- <dig> variants.
rangap <dig> is thought to mediate recognition of the avirulence protein gp-rbp- <dig> by gpa <dig>  however, the gpa2-induced hypersensitive response appears to be relatively weak and gpa <dig> is limited in terms of spectrum of efficiency as it is effective against only two nematode populations.
its variability does not seem to influence the specificity of gpa <dig> recognition but is able to modulate this activity by enhancing the defence response.
