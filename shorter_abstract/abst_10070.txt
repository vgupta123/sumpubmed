as prototype for exon-level analysis dexseq was used.
exon-level analysis performed slightly better than splice variant-quantification approaches, although at most only 50% of the spiked-in transcripts was detected.
the performances of both splice variant-quantification and exon-level analysis improved when raising the number of input reads.
we observed that both splice variant-quantification and exon-level analysis performances were strongly dependent on the number of input reads.
a benchmark dataset, in which synthetic reads as well as reads generated from standard  and low input  lsps were spiked-in was used to evaluate the effect of lsp on the statistical detection of alternative splicing events .
statistical detection of altde was done using as prototypes for splice variant-quantification cuffdiff <dig> and rsem-ebseq.
different lsps  allowed the detection of a large common set of splice variants.
two crucial steps that affect rna-seq experiment results are library sample preparation  and bioinformatics analysis .
this work describes an evaluation of the combined effect of lsp methods and ba tools in the detection of splice variants.
