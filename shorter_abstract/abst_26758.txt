combined with chromatin modifications, the weighted chromatin modification network  was built, and a t2d-related chromatin modification pattern subnetwork was obtained by the tmsn gene set.
the study of t2d epigenetic networks provides a new way for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of t2d caused by epigenetic disorders.
based on the network theory and by combining epigenetic characteristics with human interactome, the weighted human dna methylation network  was constructed, and a t2d-related subnetwork  was obtained through t2d-related differentially methylated genes.
using the cumulative hypergeometric test,  <dig> interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications were identified.
by the analysis of gene expression in human t2d islet tissue, it is found that there existed genes with the variant expression level caused by the aberrant dna methylation and  chromatin modifications, which might affect and promote the development of t2d.
here we have detected the potential interplay modules of dna methylation and chromatin modifications for t2d.

type  <dig> diabetes  is one of the most common chronic metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance and the decrease of insulin secretion.
epigenetics could establish the interface between the environmental factor and the t2d pathological mechanism.
genetic variation can only explain part of the heritability of t2d, so there need new methods to detect the susceptibility genes of the disease.
