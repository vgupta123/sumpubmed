in order to speed up the process of generating pssms, we tried to use different reference data sets  against which a target protein is scanned for psi-blast iterations.
we find that a very small set of proteins can actually be used as such a reference data without losing much of the prediction value.
an average of sensitivity and specificity using pssms is up to  <dig> % better than the prediction with sequence information only.
here we implement a neural network based algorithm to utilize evolutionary information of amino acid sequences in terms of their position specific scoring matrices  for a better prediction of dna-binding sites.
a web server has been developed to provide these predictions of dna-binding sites for any new protein from its amino acid sequence.
