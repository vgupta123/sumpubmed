plants homozygous for insertion alleles at the aml <dig> locus, as well as plants homozygous for insertion alleles at all five loci in the aml gene family, bolt earlier than wild-type plants.
aml <dig> interacts with atraptor1b, homologue of a protein that recruits substrates for phosphorylation by the major cell-growth regulator tor.
atraptor1b, a plant raptor homologue, binds the aml <dig>  protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay.
tor, the target of the antibiotic rapamycin in both yeast and mammalian cells, is a potent cell growth regulator in all eukaryotes.
identification of aml <dig> as a putative downstream effector of tor gives valuable insights into the plant-specific mode of action of this critical growth regulator.
