we performed such an analysis by an extensive search of the branch length search space under two topologies of six taxa, a felsenstein-like topology and farris-like topology.
the long branch extraction method is a procedure to detect a data set suffering from this problem so that maximum likelihood could be used instead of maximum parsimony.
research has shown that parsimony is particularly vulnerable to inferring the wrong tree in felsenstein topologies.
long branch attraction  is a problem that afflicts both the parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis techniques.
the long branch extraction method seems to mask the majority of the search space rendering it ineffective as a detection method of lba.
