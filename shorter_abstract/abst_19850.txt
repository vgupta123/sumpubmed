amino acid sequence probability distributions, or profiles, have been used successfully to predict secondary structure and local structure in proteins.
the finding is best explained by considering secondary structure profiles as multivariant, all-or-none models, which subsume covariant models.
profile models assume the statistical independence of each position in the sequence, but the energetics of protein folding is better captured in a scoring function that is based on pairwise interactions, like a force field.
i-sites motifs are short sequence/structure motifs that populate the protein structure database due to energy-driven convergent evolution.
examples of negative design are present, where the covariances disfavor non-native structures.
an updated i-sites local structure motif library that provides sequence covariance information for all types of local structure in globular proteins and a web server for local structure prediction are available at .
