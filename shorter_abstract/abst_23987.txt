with several software tested, newbler with a seed length of  <dig> and abyss with a k-value of  <dig> appear to be appropriate for the assembly of  <dig> reads alone and illumina paired-end reads alone, respectively.
using both  <dig> and illumina paired-end reads, a hybrid assembly strategy using newbler for initial  <dig> sequence assembly, velvet for initial illumina sequence assembly, followed by a second step assembly using mira provided the best assembly of the physical map contig, resulting in  <dig> contigs with a n <dig> value of  <dig>  bp.
as a pilot project for whole genome sequencing of the catfish genome, here we attempt to determine the proper sequence coverage, the proper software for assembly, and various parameters used for the assembly of a bac physical map contig spanning approximately a million of base pairs.
using  <dig> sequencing alone, a sequencing depth of  <dig> x was sufficient to obtain the good quality assembly, whereas a  <dig> x illumina appeared to be sufficient for a good quality assembly.
a hybrid sequencing strategy using low sequencing depth of  <dig> and high sequencing depth of illumina provided the good quality assembly with high n <dig> value and relatively low cost.
the short sequence reads pose great challenges for de novo sequence assembly.
additional long reads using the third generation sequencing platforms are needed to sequence through repetitive genome regions that should further enhance the sequence assembly.
a combination of low sequence coverage of  <dig> and illumina sequencing appeared to provide effective assembly as reflected by a high n <dig> value.
