the interfering activity of a 3' tail was improved by adding a 5' splice site sequence next to the branch site sequence.
the inclusion of branch site or 5' splice site sequences in the y-shaped 3' tail further improved splicing inhibition.
in the present study, we have tested the inhibitory activity of rna oligonucleotides carrying different tail structures.
we previously described the use of tailed oligonucleotides as a means of reprogramming alternative pre-mrna splicing in vitro and in vivo.
we show that an oligonucleotide with a 5' tail containing the human Î²-globin branch site sequence inhibits the use of the 5' splice site of bcl-xl, albeit less efficiently than a tail containing binding sites for the hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins.
our in vitro results indicate that a variety of tail architectures can be used to elicit splicing interference at low nanomolar concentrations, thereby broadening the scope and the potential impact of this antisense technology.
the tailed oligonucleotides that were used interfere with splicing because they contain a portion complementary to sequences immediately upstream of the target 5' splice site combined with a non-hybridizing 5' tail carrying binding sites for the hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins.
