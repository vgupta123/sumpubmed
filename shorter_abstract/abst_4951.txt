our study demonstrates dynamic changes of circulating monocytes during ageing in humans.
the expansion of the non-classical cd14+cd16+ subtype, alterations of surface protein and chemokine receptor expression as well as circulating monocyte-related chemokines possibly contribute to the preserved functionality of the monocyte pool throughout adulthood.
circulating monocyte subsets, surface marker and chemokine receptor expression were analyzed in  <dig> healthy volunteers .
recent experimental approaches have unraveled essential migratory and functional differences of monocyte subpopulations in mice.
monocyte-derived macrophages from old or young individuals did not differ with respect to cytokine release in vitro at steady state or upon lps stimulation.
in order to possibly translate these findings into human physiology and pathophysiology, human monocyte subsets need to be carefully revisited in health and disease.
in analogy to murine studies, we hypothesized that human monocyte subsets dynamically change during ageing, potentially influencing their functionality and contributing to immunosenescence.
