deletion of gna <dig> led to significantly decreased biomass formation in darkness in submersed culture but had only minor effects on morphology and hyphal apical extension rates on solid medium.
heterotrimeric g-protein signaling represents one of the best studied signal transduction pathways in fungi.
analysis of the regulatory targets of the g-protein α subunit gna <dig> in h. jecorina revealed a carbon source and light-dependent role in signal transduction.
we show that regulation of transcription and activity of gna <dig> involves a carbon source-dependent feedback cycle.
the widespread consequences of mutations in gna <dig> indicate a broad function of this gα subunit in appropriation of intracellular resources to environmental  conditions.
we conclude that gna <dig> transmits a signal the physiological relevance of which is dependent on both the carbon source as well as the light status.
additionally we found a function of gna <dig> in hydrophobin regulation as well as effects on conidiation and tolerance of osmotic and oxidative stress.
cellulase gene transcription was abolished in Δgna <dig> on cellulose in light and enhanced in darkness.
