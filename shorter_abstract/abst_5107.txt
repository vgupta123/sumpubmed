furthermore, sp-ci73t cells secreted into the medium soluble factors that modulated surface expression of ccr <dig> or cxcr <dig> receptors on cd4+ lymphocytes and neutrophils, suggesting a direct paracrine influence of sp-ci73t on neighboring cells in the alveolar space.
the most frequent sftpc mutation in ild patients leads to a threonine for isoleucine substitution at position  <dig>  of the sp-c preprotein , however little is known about the cellular consequences of sp-ci73t expression.
in addition, we show that some of the mentioned cellular aspects behind the disease can be modulated by application of pharmaceutical drugs commonly applied in the ild therapy.
we show that i73t mutation leads to impaired processing of prosp-c in alveolar type ii cells, alters their stress tolerance and surfactant lipid composition, and activates cells of the immune system.
this resulted in increased intracellular accumulation of prosp-c processing intermediates, which matched prosp-c species recovered in bronchial lavage fluid from patients with this mutation.
exposure of sp-ci73t cells to drugs currently used empirically in ild therapy, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine or methylprednisolone, enhanced expression of the chaperones hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  calreticulin and calnexin.
