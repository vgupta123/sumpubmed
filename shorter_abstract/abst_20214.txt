our study was based on four publicly available expression datasets belonging to four different populations across the world.
with these clique connectivity profiles , we were able to identify the divergence among the populations, important biological processes , and related gene pathways.
we identified cliques of various sizes  across the four population networks.
these cliques were further analyzed based on their connectivity profiles.
we found associations between the cliques and their connectivity profiles across networks.
therefore the genes identified in these cliques and their connectivity profiles can be defined as the gene-signatures across populations.
we developed a new approach where cliques and their connectivity profiles helped elucidate the variation and similarity in crc gene profiles across four populations with unique dietary habits.
forty-nine common cliques of size seven were identified.
gene signatures for any disease can identify the key biological processes, which is especially useful in studying cancer development.
we developed a topological and biological feature-based network approach for identifying the gene signatures across populations.
