however, bacteriophage–host protein interactions in high temperature environment remain poorly understood.
the life cycle of a bacteriophage has tightly programmed steps to help virus infect its host through the interactions between the bacteriophage and its host proteins.
the results indicated that the vp371-groel-ast complex were up-regulated and co-localized in the gve <dig> infection of geobacillus sp.
as reported, the vp <dig> is a capsid protein of gve <dig> and the host ast is essential for the gve <dig> infection.
to address this issue, the protein interaction between the thermophilic bacteriophage gve <dig> and its host thermophilic geobacillus sp.
this investigation showed that the host’s aspartate aminotransferase , chaperone groel, and viral capsid protein vp <dig> formed a linearly interacted complex.
therefore, our study revealed that the phage could use the anti-stress system of its host to protect the virus reproduction in a high-temperature environment for the first time.
