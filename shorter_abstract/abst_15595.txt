rats were penned as groups and fed with feeds containing 15% , 30% , or 45%  o. kansuensis for experimental groups i, ii, and iii, respectively, or complete feed in the case of the control group.
one hundred and nineteen days after poisoning, and all rats showed neurological disorders at different degrees, which were considered to be successful established a chronic poisoning model of o. kansuensis.
our data suggest that sw induces apoptosis in cells of the brain through death receptor and mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways in the brain tissue of sd rats.
moreover, sw treatment significantly increases the activation of caspase- <dig>   <dig> and - <dig>  the key effectors in apoptosis pathway .
the results showed that sw treatment up-regulated fas and fas ligand  , and that there was an increase in bax and a decrease in bcl- <dig> protein .
oxytropis kansuensis is a variety of locoweed that contains swainsonine as its main toxic ingredient.
rats were sacrificed and the expression of fas, fasl, bcl- <dig>  bax as well as cleaved caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> proteins in brain tissues were detected by western blot.
twenty-four sprague-dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups  and  <dig> sd rats of each group were feed in  <dig> cages separately.
