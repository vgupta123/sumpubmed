the epitopia server is a web-based tool that aims to predict immunogenic regions in either a protein three-dimensional structure or a linear sequence.
detecting candidate b-cell epitopes in a protein is a basic and fundamental step in many immunological applications.
due to the impracticality of experimental approaches to systematically scan the entire protein, a computational tool that predicts the most probable epitope regions is desirable.
the epitopia algorithm has been compared to other available epitope prediction tools and was found to have higher predictive power.
a special emphasis was put on the development of a user-friendly graphical interface for displaying the results.
epitopia is a user-friendly web-server that predicts immunogenic regions for both a protein structure and a protein sequence.
