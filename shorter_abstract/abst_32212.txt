a smaller  superfamily is revealed, consistent with studies of other gene families in selaginella.
the sequencing of the selaginella moellendorffii genome has allowed us to extend these analyses into an early diverging vascular plant.
these results confirm selaginella as an important intermediary between bryophytes and angiosperms.
analysis of the expansin superfamily in the moss physcomitrella patens revealed a superfamily without exla or exlb genes that has evolved considerably and independently of angiosperm expansins.
selaginella has an expansin superfamily, which, like physcomitrella, lacks exla or exlb genes, but does contain two expa genes that are related to a particular arabidopsis-rice clade involved in root hair development.
from sequence-based phylogenetic analysis, most selaginella expansins lie outside the arabidopsis-rice clades, leading us to estimate the minimum number of expansins present in the last common ancestor of selaginella and angiosperms at  <dig> expa genes and  <dig> expb gene.
the expansin superfamily in selaginella moellendorffii has now been assembled from genomic scaffolds.
