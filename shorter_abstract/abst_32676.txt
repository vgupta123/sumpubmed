compared to untreated cells, s. typhimurium, c. difficile, m. paratuberculosis, and flagellin activated nf-κb and stimulated significant secretion of ccl <dig> and il- <dig> by ht- <dig> cells.
treatment with b. infantis, but not l. salivarius, dose-dependently inhibited the baseline secretion of ccl <dig>  in cells pre-treated with b. infantis, c. difficile-, s. typhimurium-, and flagellin-induced ccl <dig> were significantly attenuated.
conversely, b. infantis, l. salivarius or m. smegmatis did not activate nf-κb or augment ccl <dig> or il- <dig> production.
b. infantis did not limit m. paratuberculosis-induced ccl <dig> secretion.
collectively, the data indicate that m. paratuberculosis may mediate mucosal damage and that b. infantis can exert immunomodulatory effects on iecs that mediate host responses to flagellin and flagellated enteric pathogens.
ht- <dig> human iecs were incubated with commensal bacteria , or with salmonella typhimurium, its flagellin, clostridium difficile, mycobacterium paratuberculosis, or mycobacterium smegmatis for varying times.
here we investigated iec responses to various pathogenic and commensal bacteria as well as the modulatory effects of commensal bacteria on pathogen-induced ccl <dig> secretion.
human intestinal epithelial cells  secrete the chemokine ccl <dig> in response to infection by various enteropathogenic bacteria or exposure to bacterial flagellin.
in some studies, ht- <dig> cells were pre-treated with a commensal strain for  <dig> hr prior to infection or flagellin stimulation.
this study is the first to demonstrate that a commensal strain can attenuate ccl <dig> secretion in ht- <dig> iecs.
