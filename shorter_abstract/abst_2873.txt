furthermore, connexin <dig> knock-in connexin <dig> male and female mice were infertile and exhibited hypotrophic gonads.
only about 17% of the homozygous connexin <dig> knock-in connexin <dig> mice instead of 25% expected according to mendelian inheritance, were born and only 6% survived to day  <dig> post partum and longer.
in testes, tubuli seminiferi were developed and spermatogonia as well as some primary spermatocytes were present, but further differentiated stages of spermatogenesis were absent.
heterozygous mothers showed impaired mammary gland development responsible for decreased lactation and early postnatal death of the pups which could be partially rescued by wild type foster mothers.
