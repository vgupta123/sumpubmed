by pcr analysis, the cdtb gene was detected in  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> and  <dig> stool specimens of healthy cattle and swine, respectively, and none from  <dig> chicken samples.
our results suggest that healthy cattle and swine could be the reservoir of ctec, and they could be a potential source of human infections.
subtypes of the cdtb genes  were further examined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the amplicons and by type-specific pcrs for the cdt-iii and cdt-v genes.
of the  <dig> cdtb gene-positive cattle samples,  <dig> cdt-i,  <dig> cdt-iii,  <dig> cdt-iv,  <dig> cdt-v and  <dig> both cdt-iii and cdt-v gene-positive strains were isolated while  <dig> cdt-ii and  <dig> cdt-v gene-positive were isolated from  <dig> cdtb positive swine samples.
three and twenty-two cdt-v gene-positive strains harbored eaea and stx genes, respectively, and seven possessed cdt-v, stx and subab genes.
the cnf <dig> gene, normally present in cdt-iii gene-positive strains, was also detected in cdt-v gene-positive strains.
cytolethal distending toxin -producing escherichia coli  has been isolated from patients with gastrointestinal or urinary tract infection, and sepsis.

interestingly, a cdt-ii gene-positive strain isolated from swine was for the first time identified as escherichia albertii.
however, the source of human infection remains unknown.
in this study, we attempted to detect and isolate ctec strains from fecal specimens of healthy farm animals and characterized them phenotypically and genotypically.
