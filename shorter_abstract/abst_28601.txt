the progress in mapping rna-protein and rna-rna interactions at the transcriptome-wide level paves the way to decipher possible combinatorial patterns embedded in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

in addition the tool allows to analyze the binding site similarity of co-regulators belonging to the same cluster, given their positional binding information.
