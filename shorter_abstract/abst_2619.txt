the reversed querying process and the program identics allow a fast and adequate prediction protein coding sequences and reconstruction of the potential metabolic network from low coverage genome sequences of bacteria.
<dig> % of the cdss in the original annotation are correctly identified.
a necessary step for a genome level analysis of the cellular metabolism is the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network from genome sequences.
in this work a fast method is proposed to use unannotated genome sequence for predicting cdss and for an in silico reconstruction of metabolic networks.
the results suggest that a  <dig> -fold coverage of the bacterial genome could be sufficiently used for the in silico reconstruction of the metabolic network.
based on the new method, a program called identics  is delivered that combines the identification of cdss with the reconstruction, comparison and visualization of metabolic networks .

the new method can accelerate the use of genomic data for studying cellular metabolism.
the available methods are mainly based on the annotation of genome sequences including two successive steps, the prediction of coding sequences  and their function assignment.
the use of swiss-prot-trembl databases resulted in an identification of  <dig> % of cdss that have ec-numbers in the published annotation.
instead of using predicted genes or cdss to query public databases, entries from public dna or protein databases are used as queries to search a local database of the unannotated genome sequence to predict cdss.
