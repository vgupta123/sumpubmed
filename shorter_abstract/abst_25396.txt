crudilactis and b. mongoliense into two different clusters well separated from other bifidobacteria clusters.
the study of a production chain of raw milk cheeses  led to the isolation of two bifidobacterium populations: b. crudilactis and b. mongoliense, that were able to grow along the production chain.
the aims of this study were to further detect and characterize these bacteria along the process and evaluate the ability of some strains to survive or grow in adverse conditions.
according to the observed characteristics such as survival in adverse conditions and their ability to grow under 12°c during the manufacturing process of the cheeses, which has never been described for bifidobacteria and which is a very interesting technological asset, these b. crudilactis and b. mongoliense strains should be further investigated for a potential use in new food or in food supplements.
using pcr coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism, b. crudilactis and b. mongoliense were detected in respectively 77% and 30% of st marcellin cheeses from production chain after 21 days of ripening.
they were present in more than half of all analyzed retail cheeses with counts going from  <dig>  to  <dig> log cfu g- <dig> for b. crudilactis and  <dig>  to  <dig> log cfu g- <dig> for b. mongoliense.
the genotypic analyses using total dna-dna hybridization, gc% content, 16s rrna gene sequencing and multilocus sequencing analysis  confirmed the classification of bifidobacterium.
bifidobacterium mongoliense was sensitive to ph  <dig>  with an observed decrease of at least  <dig> log for both studied strains  after 1 h incubation.
good survival was observed for the same strains in presence of pancreatic juice with a decrease of less than one log.
