we present an extended crosstalk diagram of the irf - nf-κb pathways.
the nf-κb and irf transcription factor families are major players in inflammation and antiviral response and act as two major effectors of the innate immune response .

the regulatory mechanisms of activation of these two pathways and their interactions during the iir are only partially known.
our in silico findings report that there is cross-regulation between both pathways at the level of gene transcription regulation, mediated by the presence of binding sites for both factors in promoters of genes essential for these pathways.
we conclude that members of the nf-κb family may directly impact regulation of irf family, while irf members impact regulation of nf-κb family rather indirectly, via other transcription factors such as ap- <dig> and sp <dig>
