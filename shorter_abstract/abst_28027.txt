this genomic colocalization and the observation that the abca17p and abca <dig> genes share significant homologies in several exons  suggest that both genes have evolved by gene duplication.
our results demonstrate that abca17p and abca <dig> form a complex of overlapping genes in the human genome from which both non-coding and protein-coding abc a-transporter rnas are expressed.
genomic analysis revealed that abca17p borders on another abc a-subfamily transporter â€“ the lung surfactant deficiency gene abca <dig>  surprisingly, we found that both genes overlap at their first exons and are transcribed from opposite strands.
in this study, we report the identification and characterization of the human ortholog of rodent abca <dig>
the new abc transporter gene exhibits striking nucleotide sequence homology with the recently cloned mouse  and rat abca <dig> , respectively, and is located in the syntenic region of mouse abca <dig> indicating that it represents the human ortholog of rodent abca <dig>  however, unlike in the mouse, the full-length abca <dig> transcript  contains numerous mutations that preclude its translation into a bona fide abc transporter protein strongly suggesting that the human abca <dig> gene is a transcribed pseudogene .
the fact that both genes overlap at their 5' ends suggests interdependencies in their regulation and may have important implications for the functional analysis of the disease gene abca <dig>  moreover, this is the first demonstration of the expression of a pseudogene and its parent gene from a common overlapping dna region in the human genome.
