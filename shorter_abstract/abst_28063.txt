interestingly, the mrna expression of some antioxidant genes in the placenta were increased  and pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced  by cos supplement, whereas no significant difference was observed in the activities of placental total sod and cat between two groups.
from day   <dig> of gestation to parturition, sixteen pregnant sows were divided into a control group  and a cos group .
taken pregnant sow as a model, we aimed to investigate the effects of dietary cos supplementation during late gestation on placental amino acids transport and antioxidant defense capacity of sows.
these observations suggested that cos supplement in sow’s diet during late gestation enhanced antioxidant defense capacity of sows, promoted placental amino acids transport, which may contribute to the health of sows and development of fetus during gestation.
then plasma antioxidant enzyme’s activities, the relative level of oxidant stress related genes, amino acids transport related genes and mtor pathway molecules in placenta were determined.
additionally, further study demonstrated that cos feeding stimulated mtor signaling pathway, increased amino acids transporters expression in placenta.

plasma sample of sow was collected on d  <dig> of gestation, and placenta tissue was obtained during parturition.
results showed that maternal dietary supplementation with cos increased  plasma total sod, caused a downtrend in plasma mda  on d  <dig> of gestation.
