babesia parasites, mainly babesia bovis and b. bigemina, are tick-borne hemoparasites inducing bovine babesiosis in cattle globally.
phylograms were inferred based on b. bigemina-specific gp <dig> and b. bovis-specific rap- <dig> nucleotide sequences obtained with group ii nested pcr primers.
these samples were genetically tested for babesia parasitic infections using nested pcr assays with species-specific primers.
a total of  <dig> blood samples were randomly collected from apparently healthy cattle.
on the other hand, a phylogeny based on b. bovis rap- <dig> sequences indicated a similar trend of clustering among the sequences of b. bovis isolates investigated in this study.
the clinical signs of the disease include, among others, anemia, fever and hemoglobinuria.
in this study, we aim to provide information about the occurrence and phylogenetic relationship of b. bigemina and b. bovis species in cattle from different locations in nine provinces of south africa.
the highest prevalence of  <dig> %  for b. bigemina was recorded in the free state province collection sites , while north west collection sites had the highest number of animals infected with b. bovis .
it was also noted that the situation of babesia parasitic infection in cattle from certain areas within the surveyed provinces had either reached endemic stability or was progressing towards stability.
nested pcr assays with group i primer sets revealed that the overall prevalence of b. bigemina and b. bovis in all bovine samples tested was  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively.
phylogenetic analysis of gp <dig> sequences revealed significant differences in the genotypes of b. bigemina isolates investigated, including those of strains published in genbank.
babesiosis is known to occur in tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
this study demonstrates the occurrence of babesia parasites in cattle from different provinces of south africa.
