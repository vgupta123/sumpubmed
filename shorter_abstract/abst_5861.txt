these visualizations help researchers analyze model predictions by displaying predictions in their biological context.
we developed wholecellviz, a web-based software program for visually exploring and analyzing whole-cell simulations.
whole-cell models promise to accelerate biomedical science and engineering.
however, discovering new biology from whole-cell models and other high-throughput technologies requires novel tools for exploring and analyzing complex, high-dimensional data.
wholecellviz was designed to facilitate exploration, analysis, and communication of whole-cell model data.
furthermore, wholecellviz enables researchers to compare predictions within and across simulations by allowing users to simultaneously display multiple visualizations.
