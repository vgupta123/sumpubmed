the results showed that the biological implications of up-regulated genes in m. ricketti were significantly over-represented in biological process categories such as ‘cochlea morphogenesis’, ‘inner ear morphogenesis’ and ‘sensory perception of sound’, which are consistent with the inner ear morphological and physiological differentiation between the two bat species.
to comprehensively explore the underlying molecular basis between echolocating and non-echolocating bats, we employed a sequence-based approach to compare the inner ear expression difference between the rickett’s big-footed bat  and the greater short-nosed fruit bat .
however, this highly specialized trait is not characteristic of old world fruit bats.
