the bacterial growth inhibition rate increased and the bacterial count in vivo decreased significantly in dose dependence after administration of the saponin and its combination with amoxicillin or erythromycin, suggesting its antibacterial effect.
its efficacy was evaluated by the inhibition on amoxicillin-resistant e. coli and erythromycin-resistant s. aureus and therapeutic effect on chicks infected by the two bacteria.
molecular simulation reveals the strong interaction existing between the saponin and mdh or edna.
the saponin is a prospective substitute of antibiotics, and molecular simulation is a convenient alternative method to find out hopeful candidates of antibiotics substitute.
biofilm formation is an important reason for drug resistance.
the saponin identified as camelliagenin shows significant inhibition on the biofilm of e. coli and s. aureus, and it is related to the decrease of mannitol dehydrogenase  activity and extracellular dna  content.
our previous research has found that the extract of camellia oleifera seeds has lots of pharmacological effects.
escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus are the main pathogens infectious to poultry, and their resistances against antibiotics have become troublesome currently.
in order to find the substitute for antibiotics, the saponin was isolated from the defatted c. oleifera seeds with structural identification.
