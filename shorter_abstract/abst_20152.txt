the sm site of wheat showed a more complex construction than that in mammal and model plant.
taken together, our findings indicate that the lincrna of wheat responded to bgt and pst stress and played important roles in splicesome and inter-regulating with mirna.
among them,  <dig> snrnp motifs  were detected and showed rru4–11rr sm site element and consensus rru1–9vu1–7rr snrnp motifs, where the total number of uridine was more than  <dig> but less than  <dig>  additionally,  <dig> de-lincrnas were predicted as targets of mirna by psrnatarget, while  <dig> target mimics were identified using target mimicry search in tapir.
increasingly evidences suggest that long intergenic ncrnas  are developmentally regulated and play important roles in development and stress responses of plants.
of which,  <dig> de-lincrnas responded to the bgt stress, and  <dig> lincrnas in pst.
the transcriptome of the hexaploid wheat line n <dig> inoculated with the chinese pst race cyr <dig> and bgt race e <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and 3 days post-inoculation was recapitulated to detect the lincrnas.
