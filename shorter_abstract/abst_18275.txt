most regulons correspond to identifiable biological processes and include a combination of genes encoding related developmental, metabolic pathway, and regulatory functions.
despite the mounting research on arabidopsis transcriptome and the powerful tools to explore biology of this model plant, the organization of expression of arabidopsis genome is only partially understood.
here, we create a coexpression network from a  <dig>  affymetrix probes dataset derived from  <dig> microarray chips that query the transcriptome in response to a wide variety of environmentally, genetically, and developmentally induced perturbations.
markov chain graph clustering of the coexpression network delineates  <dig> regulons ranging from one to  <dig> genes in size.
in contrast, expression of the mitochondrial genome is highly integrated with that of nuclear genes; each of the seven regulons containing mitochondrial genes also incorporates nuclear genes.
the network of regulons reveals a higher-level organization, with dense local neighborhoods articulated for photosynthetic function, genetic information processing, and stress response.
to assess the significance of the clustering results, the statistical over-representation of go terms is averaged over this set of regulons and compared to the analogous values for  <dig> randomly-generated sets of clusters.
this analysis creates a framework for generation of experimentally testable hypotheses, gives insight into the concerted functions of arabidopsis at the transcript level, and provides a test bed for comparative systems analysis.
