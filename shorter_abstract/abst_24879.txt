in contrast, the native and invasive strain showed no significant difference in replication in cultured mosquito, monkey or human cells.
here we tested the hypothesis that differences between the invasive and native strain in their infectivity for aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of denv, contributed to the competitive success of the invasive strain
the invasive strain infected a similar proportion of mosquitoes as the native strain but replicated to significantly higher titers in the midgut and disseminated with significantly greater efficiency than the native strain.
aegypti more efficiently than the displaced native denv <dig> strain, suggesting that the invasive strain is transmitted more efficiently.
the current study focused on competitive displacement in dengue virus serotype  <dig> , a mosquito-borne pathogen of humans.
to be transmitted by a mosquito, denv must infect and replicate in the midgut, disseminate into the hemocoel, infect the salivary glands, and be released into the saliva.
competitive displacement of a weakly virulent pathogen strain by a more virulent strain is one route to disease emergence.
in sri lanka in the 1980's, a native denv <dig> strain associated with relatively mild dengue disease was displaced by an invasive denv <dig> strain associated with the most severe disease manifestations, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome , resulting in an outbreak of dhf/dss.
among vector-borne pathogens, variation in the ability to infect vectors may effect displacement.
