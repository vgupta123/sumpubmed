it would be an advantage if the functional effects of an nssnp on protein structure and function could be predicted, both for the final identification process of a causal variant in a disease-associated chromosome region, and in further functional analyses of the nssnp and its disease-associated protein.
contrary to previous reports, we also show that rare mutations are consistently predicted to be deleterious as often as commonly occurring nssnps.
genome-wide association studies of common diseases for common, low penetrance causal variants are underway.
for over 40% of the nssnps, structure-based methods predicted which of these sequence changes are likely to either disrupt the structure of the protein or interfere with the function or interactions of the protein.
the nssnp information came from two sources, the omim database which are rare  and are known to cause penetrant, monogenic diseases.
in the present report we have compared and contrasted structure- and sequence-based methods of prediction to over  <dig> genes carrying nearly  <dig>  nssnps, by employing an automatic comparative modelling procedure to build models for the genes.
a proportion of these will alter protein sequences, the most common of which is the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism .
we show that, in general, the prediction tools are able distinguish disease causing mutations from those mutations which are thought to have a neutral affect.
