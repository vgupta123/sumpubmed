the -egc and -ec contents were significantly lower and the -gc and -c contents were abnormally higher in ‘ruchengmaoyecha’ than in ‘yunnanshilixiang’, ‘chawansanhao’, and ‘anjibaicha’.
catechins not only contribute to tea quality but also serve important functions in the anti-stress regulation of secondary metabolic pathways.
the proportion of catechins was confirmed by selecting critical genes  for qrt-pcr analysis.
catechins contents were measured through reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography , and the biosynthetic pathway was also surveyed.
the analyses of transcriptome profiles and physiological indicators not only identified the putative genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway but also provided some novel insights for the mechanisms of catechins biosynthesis.
transcriptomes from leaf tissues of four tea plant cultivars, ‘yunnanshilixiang’, ‘chawansanhao’, ‘ruchengmaoyecha’, and ‘anjibaicha’, were sequenced using the high-throughput sequencing platform illumina hiseq™  <dig>  de novo assemble were also performed.
a total of  <dig>  pairs of putative orthologs from the four tea plant cultivars, ‘yunnanshilixiang’, ‘chawansanhao’, ‘ruchengmaoyecha’, and ‘anjibaicha’ were generated.
this study provided a global survey of transcriptomes from four tea plant cultivars and serves as an available resource of genetic diversity.
approximately  <dig>  unigenes  were aligned to the sequences of seven public databases with a cut-off e-value of 1e- <dig>  a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were found through rpkm values, and  <dig> unigenes were assigned to the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway using the integrated function annotation.
tea is a popular natural non-alcoholic beverage consumed worldwide due to its bioactive ingredients, particularly catechins .
