we applied our benchmarking tests on  <dig> well known mapping tools, namely, bowtie, bowtie <dig>  bwa, soap <dig>  maq, rmap, gsnap, novoalign, and mrsfast  using synthetic data and real rna-seq data.
maq and rmap are based on building hash tables for the reads, whereas the remaining tools are based on indexing the reference genome.
the results show that no single tool outperforms all others in all metrics.
therefore, the end user should clearly specify his needs in order to choose the tool that provides the best results.
the process of aligning these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of fast and accurate alignment tools.
the development of next-generation sequencing instruments has led to the generation of millions of short sequences in a single run.
