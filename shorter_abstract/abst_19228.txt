wounding displayed the highest number of unique canpis while wounding with os treatment resulted in the high accumulation of specifically canpi- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>  characterization of the pi protein activity through two dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed tissue and induction specific patterns.
the canpi gene pool either from uninduced or induced leaves was dominated by 3-ird pis and trypsin inhibitory domains.
inductions were performed by subjecting c. annuum leaves to various treatments, namely aphid infestation or mechanical wounding followed by treatment with either oral secretion  of helicoverpa armigera or water.
consistent with transcript abundance, wound plus os or water treated c. annuum leaves exhibited significantly higher pi activity and isoform diversity contributed by 3- and 4-ird canpis.
fourty seven different canpi genes composed of  <dig> unique irds were identified in total along with those reported earlier.
canpi accumulation and activity was weakly elicited by aphid infestation yet resulted in the higher expression of canpi- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>
plants can differentially perceive various kinds of insect attacks and respond appropriately through activating plant defenses including regulation of pis at transcriptional and post-translational levels.
based on the differentially elicited canpi accumulation patterns, it is intriguing to speculate that generating sequence diversity in the form of multi-ird pis is a part of elaborative plant defense strategy to obtain a diverse pool of functional units to confine insect attack.
