the human fusion protein bound to nickel and zinc affinity columns, whereas the sea urchin protein barely interacted with such columns.
we identified the gene for fgfrl <dig> also in the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus and cloned its mrna.
direct determination of metal ions by atomic absorption revealed  <dig>  mole zinc/mole protein for human fgfrl <dig> and  <dig>  mole zinc/mole protein for sea urchin fgfrl <dig>
a comparison of the intracellular domain between sea urchin and human fgfrl <dig> provides interesting insights into the shaping of a novel zinc binding domain.
similar to the human protein, the s. purpuratus protein contains a histidine-rich motif at the c-terminus, but this motif is much shorter than the human counterpart.
the deduced amino acid sequence shares 62% sequence similarity with the human protein and shows conservation of all disulfides and n-linked carbohydrate attachment sites.
to analyze the function of the novel motif, recombinant fusion proteins were prepared in a bacterial expression system.
since it does not occur in more distantly related invertebrates such as insects and nematodes, we have speculated that fgfrl <dig> might have evolved just before branching of the vertebrate lineage from the other invertebrates .
