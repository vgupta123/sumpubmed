the aim of this study was to compare different methods for estimating individual homozygosity-by-descent based on the information from human genome-wide scans rather than genealogies.
we considered the four most commonly used methods and investigated their applicability to single-nucleotide polymorphism  data in both a simulation study and by using the human genotyped data.
simulation data suggested that multi-point festim is the method most strongly correlated to true homozygosity-by-descent.
deciding who is really inbred is a methodological challenge where multi-point approaches can be very helpful once the set of snp markers is filtered to remove linkage disequilibrium.
correlation coefficients between the homozygosity-by-descent estimates were high but only for inbred individuals, with nearly absolute correlation between single-point measures.
all individuals were genotyped with the illumina humanhap <dig> array with  <dig>  snp markers.
