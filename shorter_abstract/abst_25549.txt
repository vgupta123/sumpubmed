our findings led to a more detailed model of cell wall evolution and suggested that gene loss played an important role in the evolution of csl families.
we studied the occurrences and phylogenies of cesa/csl families in diverse plants and algae by comprehensive data mining of  <dig> genomes and transcriptomes.
we found that 1) charophytic green algae  have orthologous genes in cesa, cslc and csld families; 2) liverwort genes are found in the cesa, csla, cslc and csld families; 3) the fern pteridium aquilinum not only has orthologs in these conserved families but also in the cslb, cslh and csle families; 4) basal angiosperms, e.g.
aristolochia fimbriata, have orthologs in these families too; 5) gymnosperms have genes forming clusters ancestral to cslb/h and to csle/j/g respectively; 6) cslg is found in switchgrass and basal angiosperms; 7) cslj is widely present in dicots and monocots; 8) cesa subfamilies have already diversified in ferns.
we also demonstrated the usefulness of transcriptome data in the study of plant cell wall evolution and diversity.
we speculate that:  ferns and horsetails might both have cslh enzymes, responsible for the synthesis of mixed-linkage glucans and  csld and similar genes might be responsible for the synthesis of mannans in cga.
