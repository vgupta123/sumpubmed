ann can reliably select snp combinations that are associated with caa.
important combinations were determined by effective combination value  defined in the present paper.
here, we propose a susceptible marker-selectable artificial neural network  for predicting development of allergic disease.
the accuracy of the ann model with  <dig> snps was  <dig> % for learning data and  <dig> % for evaluation data.
thus, the ann can be used to characterize development of complex diseases caused by multiple factors.
screening of various gene markers such as single nucleotide polymorphism  and correlation between these markers and development of multifactorial disease have previously been studied.
this is the first report of automatic selection of snps related to development of multifactorial disease from snp data of more than  <dig> patients.
effective 2-snp or 3-snp combinations were found to be concentrated among the  <dig> selected snps.
to predict development of childhood allergic asthma  and select susceptible snps, we used an ann with a parameter decreasing method  to analyze  <dig> snps of  <dig> genes in  <dig> japanese people, and select  <dig> susceptible snps of caa.
