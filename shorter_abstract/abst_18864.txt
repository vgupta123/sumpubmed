the characterization of single domains revealed that the ch domain of gxcdd functions as a membrane association domain, the rhogef domain can physically interact with a subset of rac gtpases, and the arfgap-ph tandem accumulates in cortical regions of the cell and on phagosomes.
gxcdd is a 180-kda multidomain protein containing a type  <dig> ch domain, two iq motifs, three ph domains, a rhogef domain and an arfgap domain.
inactivation of the gene results in defective streaming during development under different conditions and a delay in developmental timing.
we provide evidence for a calponin homology domain acting as a membrane association domain.
our results also suggest that a conformational change may be required for activation of gxcdd, which would be important for its downstream signaling.
compared to our understanding of the downstream effects of racs our understanding of upstream mechanisms that activate rac gtpases is relatively poor.
gxcdd can bind to several rac gtpases, but its function as a nucleotide exchange factor needs to be studied further.
rho subfamily gtpases are implicated in a large number of actin-related processes.
