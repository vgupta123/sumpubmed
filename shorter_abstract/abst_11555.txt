for fungal identification, oligonucleotide probes were designed by exploiting the sequence variations of the elongation factor 1-alpha  coding regions and the internal transcribed spacer  regions of the rrna gene cassette.
a total of  <dig> potentially mycotoxigenic fungi isolated from different food commodities, as well as the genes that are involved in the mycotoxin synthetic pathways, were analyzed.
the diagnostic microarray developed can be used to identify single pure strains or cultures of potentially mycotoxigenic fungi as well as genes leading to toxin production in both laboratory samples and maize-derived foods offering an interesting potential for microbiological laboratories.
for the detection of fungi able to produce mycotoxins, oligonucleotide probes directed towards genes leading to toxin production from different fungal strains were identified in data available in the public domain.
in this study, a diagnostic dna microarray was developed for the identification of the most common food-borne fungi, as well as the genes leading to toxin production.
mycotoxins are secondary metabolites which are produced by numerous fungi and pose a continuous challenge to the safety and quality of food commodities in south africa.
