this work provides a solid foundation for the principled integration of imperfect biological knowledge with gene expression data and other high-throughput data sources.
to address this shortcoming, we developed m-bison , a formal probabilistic model that integrates background biological knowledge with microarray data to predict individual de genes.
m-bison improves signal detection on a range of simulated data, particularly when using very noisy microarray data.
we also applied the method to the task of predicting heat shock-related differentially expressed genes in s. cerevisiae, using an hsf <dig> mutant microarray dataset and conserved yeast dna sequence motifs.
<dig> when compared to a method using only microarray data, and m-bison outperforms a related method, generank.
furthermore, by analyzing m-bison predictions in the context of the background knowledge, we identified yhr124w as a potentially novel player in the yeast heat shock response.
our results demonstrate that m-bison improves the analysis quality and makes predictions that are easy to interpret in concert with incorporated knowledge.
the accurate detection of differentially expressed  genes has become a central task in microarray analysis.
while a number of existing methods partially overcome these limitations by incorporating biological knowledge in the form of gene groups, these methods sacrifice gene-level resolution.
specifically, m-bison increases the auc of de gene prediction from .
