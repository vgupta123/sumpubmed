pre-absorbed immunoproteomics method  is a useful method previously established in our laboratory for identifying bacterial surface proteins.
the Δxf mutant and cΔxf showed no significant differences in growth characteristics and adherence to hep- <dig> cells compared with the wild-type strain.
however the 50% lethal dose of Δxf was increased  compared with that of the parental strain in a zebrafish infection model.
screening of the surface proteins is required to identify virulence factors or protective antigens involved in piscine s.agalactiae infections in tilapia.
a serine-rich repeat protein family  <dig> , designated xf, was identified by paim in piscine s. agalactiae isolate gd201008- <dig>  to investigate the role of xf in the pathogenesis of piscine s. agalactiae, an isogenic xf mutant strain  and a complemented strain  were successfully constructed.
the findings demonstrated that xf is a virulence-related, highly immunoreactive surface protein and is involved in the pathogenicity of s. agalactiae infections in fish.
since  <dig>  large-scale streptococcus agalactiae infections have broken out in cultured tilapia farms in china, resulting in considerable economic losses.
