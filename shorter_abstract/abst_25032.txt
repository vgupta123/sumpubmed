dna microarray analysis revealed that expression of many pi starvation genes reached higher levels during the pi starvation response on minimal medium with glucose as sole carbon source than in pi starved acetate-grown c. glutamicum cells.
in c. glutamicum, ramb is involved in expression control of pstscab operon.
gel mobility shift assays and mutational analysis of the psts promoter region revealed that ramb binds to two sites localized at positions − <dig> to − <dig> and − <dig> to + <dig> with respect to the transcriptional start site of pstscab.
dna affinity chromatography identified the regulator of acetate metabolism ramb as a protein binding to psts promoter dna in vitro.
thus, transcriptional regulation of pstscab is complex involving activation by the phosphate-responsive two-component regulatory system phosr and the regulators of carbon metabolism glxr and ramb.
the pstscab operon of corynebacterium glutamicum, which encodes an abc transport system for uptake of phosphate , is induced during the pi starvation response.
the two-component regulatory system phors is involved in this response, but partial pi starvation induction of pstscab in a Δphors mutant indicated the involvement of additional regulator.
