we prepared a comprehensive collection of ests from the various tissues that develop during the wheat life cycle and from tissues subjected to stress.
wheat clones that showed high homology to those of rice were selected in order to investigate their expression patterns in various tissues throughout the wheat life cycle and in response to abiotic-stress treatments.
the data for each clone's expression in various tissues and stress treatments and its variability in wheat and rice as a result of their diversification are valuable tools for functional genomics in wheat and for comparative genomics in cereals.
about 10% of the clones were wheat-unique genes, without any counterparts within the dna database.
by grouping the ests of recombinant clones randomly selected from the full-length cdna library, we were able to sequence  <dig>  independent clones with high accuracy.
therefore, accumulation of expressed sequence tags  for wheat is becoming particularly important for functional genomics and molecular breeding.
this sequence information is a valuable genetic resource for functional genomics and will enable carrying out comparative genomics in cereals.
as part of the functional genomics and development of genomic wheat resources, we have generated a collection of full-length cdnas from common wheat.
as full-length cdnas are indispensable to certify the collected ests and annotate the genes in the wheat genome, we performed a systematic survey and sequencing of the full-length cdna clones.
genes that were preferentially expressed in certain tissues or treatments had higher ka/ks values than those in other tissues and treatments, which suggests that the genes with the higher variability expressed in these tissues is under adaptive selection.
we have generated a high-quality full-length cdna resource for common wheat, which is essential for continuation of the ongoing curation and annotation of the wheat genome.
we also examined their expression profiles in silico.
