the optpdt uses general nuclear families.
we developed the optimal p-value threshold pedigree disequilibrium test .
the multi-snp analysis aims to test association based on a snp set, usually defined based on biological knowledge such as gene or pathway, which may contain only a portion of snps with effects on the disease.
therefore, a challenge for the multi-snp analysis is how to effectively select a subset of snps with promising association signals from the snp set.
our simulation results suggested that the optpdt is a valid and powerful test.
a permutation procedure is used to assess the significance of the test.
our power studies showed that the optpdt can be more powerful than the set-based test in plink, the multi-snp fbat test, and the p-value based test gates.
as complex diseases are caused by the joint effects of multiple genes, while the effect of individual gene or snp is modest, a method considering the joint effects of multiple snps can be more powerful than testing individual snps.
genome-wide association studies  have become a common approach to identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms  associated with complex diseases.
the method is ideal for the secondary analysis of existing gwas datasets, which may identify a set of snps with joint effects on the disease.
the optpdt will be helpful for gene-based or pathway association analysis.
we applied the optpdt to a family-based autism gwas dataset for gene-based association analysis and identified macrod2-as <dig> with genome-wide significance .
we used simulations to verify that the optpdt has correct type i error rates.
a variable p-value threshold algorithm is used to determine an optimal p-value threshold for selecting a subset of snps.
