five tsps, designated tsp- <dig> through tsp- <dig>  are encoded in the human genome.
in the human genome, the tsp- <dig>  tsp- <dig>  tsp- <dig> and tsp- <dig> genes lie within paralogous regions that provide insight into the ancestral genomic context of vertebrate tsps.
thus, all tsp genes show conservation of synteny between fish and tetrapods.
these novel results give deeper insight into the evolution of tsps in vertebrates and open new directions for understanding the physiological and pathological roles of tsp- <dig> and tsp- <dig> in humans.
a new model for tsp evolution in vertebrates is presented.
we identified by bioinformatics that three fish species encode larger numbers of tsps than vertebrates, yet all these sequences group as homologues of tsp- <dig> to - <dig>  by phylogenomic analysis of neighboring genes, we uncovered that, in fish, a tsp-4-like sequence is encoded from the gene corresponding to the tetrapod tsp- <dig> gene.
thrombospondins  are evolutionarily-conserved, extracellular, calcium-binding glycoproteins with important roles in cell-extracellular matrix interactions, angiogenesis, synaptogenesis and connective tissue organisation.
