a detailed study of analogous enzymes may reveal new catalytic mechanisms, add information about the origin and evolution of biochemical pathways and disclose potential targets for drug development.
we applied this approach to a dataset obtained from kegg comprising all annotated enzymes, which resulted in the identification of  <dig> ec classes where putative analogy was detected .
analogous enzymes are able to catalyze the same reactions, but they present no significant sequence similarity at the primary level, and possibly different tertiary structures as well.
the algorithm for the detection of analogy is based i) on the construction of groups of homologous enzymes and ii) on the identification of cases where a given enzymatic activity is performed by two or more proteins without significant similarity between their primary structures.
anenpi is an efficient tool for detection and annotation of analogous enzymes and other enzymes in whole genomes.
enzymes are responsible for the catalysis of the biochemical reactions in metabolic pathways.
