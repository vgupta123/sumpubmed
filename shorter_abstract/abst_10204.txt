however, it is not known whether etanercept improves outcomes of tbi by attenuating microglia-associated, astrocytes-associated, and/or neurons-associated tnf-α expression in ischemic brain.
tumor necrosis factor-alpha  is elevated early in injured brain after traumatic brain injury , in humans and in animals.
the tbi-induced cerebral ischemia, neurological motor deficits, and increased numbers of microglia-tnf-α double positive cells and increased tnf-α levels in the injured brain were all significantly attenuated by etanercept therapy.
this finding indicates that early microglia overproduction of tnf-α in the injured brain region after tbi contributes to cerebral ischemia and neurological motor deficits, which can be attenuated by etanercept therapy.
a well clinically relevant rat model, where a lateral fluid percussion is combined with systemic administration of etanercept immediately after tbi, was used.
in addition, tnfα contents of ischemic cerebral homogenates was measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.
in addition to inducing brain ischemia as well as neurological and motor deficits, tbi caused significantly higher numbers of microglia-tnf-α double positive cells, but not neurons-tnf-α or astrocytes-tnf-α double positive cells in the injured brain areas than did the sham operated controls, when evaluated  <dig> days after tbi.
the neurological severity score and motor function was measured on all rats preinjury and on day  <dig> after etanercept administration.
etanercept  attenuates tbi in rats by reducing both microglial and astrocytic activation and increased serum levels of tnf-α.
