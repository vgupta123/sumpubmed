to address these problems, we propose two new tests designed to reduce the inflation in the type i error rate caused by these problems.
specifically, we show that the proportions of each called genotype need not equal the true proportions in the population, even as the number of subjects grows infinitely large.
when the distributions of the summary statistics are not well separated by genotype, the act of genotype assignment can lead to more potential problems than acknowledged by the literature.
one common goal of a case/control genome wide association study  is to find snps associated with a disease.
the called genotypes for two subjects need not be independent, even when their true genotypes are independent.
consequently, p-values from tests of association can be anti-conservative, even when the distributions of the summary statistic for the cases and controls are identical.
the first algorithm, logicall, measures call quality by fully exploring the likelihood profile of intensity measurements, and the second algorithm avoids genotyping by using a likelihood ratio statistic.
