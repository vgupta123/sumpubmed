analysis of genome sequences has revealed a large number of putative transcription factors in most fungal genomes.
in this study we have analysed the number of members for  <dig> regulator classes in  <dig> ascomycete and  <dig> basidiomycete fungal genomes and revealed significant differences between ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.

a significant number of regulators lacked orthologs in the ascomycete yeasts and the basidiomycetes.
this study demonstrates a significant difference in the regulatory repertoire of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi, at the level of both regulator class and individual regulator.
this demonstrated that overall the highest presence of orthologs is in the filamentous ascomycetes.
most regulators detected in both phyla are involved in central functions of fungal physiology and therefore were likely already present in the ancestor of the two phyla.
gene regulation underlies fungal physiology and therefore is a major factor in fungal biodiversity.
although genome-scale transcription factor surveys have been performed before, no global study into the prevalence of specific regulators across the fungal kingdom has been presented.
