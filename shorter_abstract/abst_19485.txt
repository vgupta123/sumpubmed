this was reflected in faster kinetics of listeria dissemination, higher bacterial loads in internal organs, and elevated serum levels of il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α and ccl <dig> in the susceptible strains as compared to the resistant c57bl/6j strain.
we identified c57bl/6j mice as being most resistant to orally acquired listeriosis whereas c3heb/fej, a/j and balb/cj mice were found to be most susceptible to infection.
however, expression of murinized inla does not enhance listerial brain invasion suggesting that crossing of the blood brain barrier and crossing of the intestinal epithelium are achieved by listeria monocytogenes through different molecular mechanisms.
it plays a critical role in the bacteria crossing the host intestinal barrier by a species-specific interaction with the cell adhesion molecule e-cadherin.
murinised listeria are able to efficiently cross the intestinal barrier in mice from diverse genetic backgrounds.
in the present study, we have used bioluminescent murinised and non-murinised listeria strains to examine the spatiotemporal dissemination of listeria in four diverse mouse genetic backgrounds after oral inoculation.
the murinised listeria monocytogenes strain showed enhanced invasiveness and induced more severe infections in all four investigated mouse inbred strains compared to the non-murinised listeria strain.
the bacterial surface protein internalin  is a major virulence factor of the food-born pathogen listeria monocytogenes.
importantly, murinisation of inla did not cause enhanced invasion of listeria monocytogenes into the brain.
