nine markers could be mapped on robusta linkage map.
a small-insert partial genomic library of coffea canephora, was probed for various ssr motifs following conventional approach of southern hybridisation.
the present study aimed to develop new coffee-specific ssr markers and validate their utility in analysis of genetic diversity, individualization, linkage mapping, and transferability for use in other related taxa.
the conventional approach of genomic library was successfully employed although with low efficiency to develop a set of  <dig> new genomic microsatellite markers of coffee.
species-specific microsatellite markers are desirable for genetic studies and to harness the potential of mas-based breeding for genetic improvement.
the characterization/validation of new markers demonstrated them to be highly informative, and useful for genetic studies namely, genetic diversity in coffee germplasm, individualization/bar-coding for germplasm protection, linkage mapping, taxonomic studies, and use as conserved orthologous sets across secondary genepool of coffee.
further, the relative frequency and distribution of different ssr motifs in coffee genome indicated coffee genome to be relatively poor in microsatellites compared to other plant species.
the ssr positive sequences were used to design  <dig> primer pairs of which  <dig> pairs could be validated as single locus markers using a panel of arabica and robusta genotypes.
the relative frequencies of different dnrs were found as at >> ag > ac, whereas among tnrs, agc was the most abundant repeat.
