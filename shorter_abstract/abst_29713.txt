the complex relationships between biological processes taking place in live skeletal muscle and meat quality are driven on the one hand by the energy reserves and their utilisation in the muscle and on the other hand by the muscle structure itself and calcium signalling.
transcripts with positive correlation dominantly represented biochemical processes including oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial pathways, as well as transporter activity.
holistic expression profiling was integrated with qtl analysis for the trait of interest and for gene expression levels for creation of a priority list of genes out of the orchestra of genes of biological networks relevant to the liability to develop elevated drip loss.
there is considerable variation in the water holding capacity of meat affecting economy of meat production.
leakage of water and ions and soluble proteins from muscle cells occurs during prolonged exercise due to ischemia causing muscle damage.
also post mortem anoxia during conversion of muscle to meat is marked by loss of water and soluble components from the muscle cell.
a linkage analysis of abundance of trait correlated transcripts revealed  <dig> expression qtl  with  <dig> eqtl coinciding with qtl regions for water holding capacity;  <dig> transcripts had trans acting and  <dig> had cis acting regulation.
expression microarray analysis of m. longissimus dorsi rnas of  <dig> f <dig> animals of a resource population showed  <dig>  transcripts with trait correlated expression to water holding capacity.
