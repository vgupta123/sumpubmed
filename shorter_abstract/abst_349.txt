we present an infinite mixture-of-experts model to find an unknown number of sub-groups within a given patient cohort based on survival analysis.
the unified framework presented here, combining elements of cluster and feature detection for survival analysis, is clearly a powerful tool for analyzing survival patterns within a patient group.
the model also demonstrates the feasibility of analyzing complex interactions which can contribute to definition of novel prognostic compound markers.
when applied to a breast-cancer dataset consisting of survival times and protein expression levels of patients, it results in identifying two distinct sub-groups with different survival patterns  along with the respective sets of compound markers.
the model is able to find key explanatory factors  for each sub-group by enforcing sparsity on the regression coefficients via the bayesian group-lasso.
