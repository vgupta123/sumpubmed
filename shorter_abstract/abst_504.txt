ribosome synthesis is down-regulated at low ph under oxygen limitation, possibly due to the restricted energy yield of catabolism.
a core group of  <dig> genes showed ph responses similar to those in a previous study of cultures grown with aeration.
other genes showed opposite ph responses with or without aeration, for example ets components  and hydrogenases .
acid also up-regulated fimbriae , periplasmic chaperones , cyclopropane fatty acid synthase , and the "constitutive" na+/h+ antiporter .
many ph-dependent genes are co-regulated by anaerobiosis, but the overall intersection of ph stress and oxygen limitation has not been investigated.
acid up-regulated the catabolism of sugar derivatives whose fermentation minimized acid production , and also a cluster of  <dig> genes in the gada region.
base up-regulated core genes for maltodextrin transport , atp synthase , and dna repair .
affymetrix array hybridization revealed ph-dependent expression of  <dig>  genes and  <dig> intergenic regions.
the ph dependence of gene expression was analyzed in oxygen-limited cultures of e. coli k- <dig> strain w <dig>  e. coli k- <dig> strain w <dig> was cultured in closed tubes containing lbk broth buffered at ph  <dig> , ph  <dig> , and ph  <dig> .
intergenic regions containing regulatory srnas were up-regulated by acid .
under oxygen limitation, however, ph regulation is reversed for genes encoding electron transport components and hydrogenases.
in escherichia coli, ph regulates genes for amino-acid and sugar catabolism, electron transport, oxidative stress, periplasmic and envelope proteins.
under oxygen limitation only, acid down-regulated ribosome synthesis .
a hypf strain lacking all hydrogenase activity showed loss of extreme-acid resistance.
ph regulates a core set of genes independently of oxygen, including yagu, fimbriae, periplasmic chaperones, and nhab.
under oxygen limitation, ph regulates metabolism and transport so as to maximize alternative catabolic options while minimizing acidification or alkalinization of the cytoplasm.
