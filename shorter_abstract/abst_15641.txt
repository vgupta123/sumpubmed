a subset of  <dig> snps was used to successfully fingerprint a panel of eggplant germplasm, producing a set of informative diversity data.
the high throughput sequencing of the rad tags allowed the discovery of a large number of dna markers, which will prove useful for extending our current knowledge of the genome organization of eggplant, for assisting in marker-aided selection and for carrying out comparative genomic analyses within the solanaceae family.
in particular, no snp markers are publicly available; on the other hand, over  <dig>  ssr markers were developed and publicly available.
we have combined the recently developed restriction-site associated dna  approach with illumina dna sequencing for rapid and mass discovery of both snp and ssr markers for eggplant.
rad tags were generated from the genomic dna of a pair of eggplant mapping parents, and sequenced to produce ~ <dig>  mb of sequences arrangeable into ~ <dig>  contigs.
the shared sequences allowed the discovery of ~ <dig>  snps and nearly  <dig>  indels, equivalent to a snp frequency of  <dig>  per kb and an indel frequency of  <dig>  per kb.
