functional annotation of  <dig> genes revealed their role in several biological activities such as neurogenesis, regulation of map kinase activity, response to calcium ion, endocytosis paralleling the ad specific attributes.
finally,  <dig> potential biochemical biomarkers were found from the overlap of 108 ad proteins with proteins from csf and plasma proteome.
clustering of these proteins further helped us in identifying  <dig> significant clusters with  <dig> proteins  forming the central hub nodes.
with the assumption that common genetic signals obtained from different methodological platforms might serve as robust ad risk markers than candidates identified using single dimension approach, here we demonstrated an integrated genomic convergence approach for disease candidate gene prioritization from heterogeneous data sources linked to ad.

here, we have designed a rank based gene prioritization approach involving convergent analysis of multi-dimensional data and protein-protein interaction  network modelling.
in recent years, high throughput methodologies, such as genome-wide linkage analysis , genome-wide association  studies, and genome-wide expression profiling , have led to the identification of several candidate genes associated with ad.
our approach employs integration of three different ad datasets- gwl,gwa and gwe to identify overlapping candidate genes ranked using a novel cumulative rank score  based method followed by prioritization using clusters derived from ppi network.
however, due to lack of consistency within their findings, an integrative approach is warranted.
sr for each gene is calculated by addition of rank assigned to individual gene based on either p value or score in three datasets.
egfr and actb were found to be the two most significant ad risk genes.
