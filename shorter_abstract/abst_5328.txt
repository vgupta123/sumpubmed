our findings contribute to knowledge of mirna roles in regulatory pathways in the complex, polyploidy sugarcane genome.
deep sequencing analyses accelerate the process of small rna discovery in many plants and expand our understanding of mirna-regulated processes.
the biological function of the new mirnas candidates was assessed by analyzing their putative targets.
a large scale investigation of srna in sugarcane using a computational approach has identified a substantial number of new mirnas and provides detailed genotype-tissue-culture mirna expression profiles.
we therefore undertook small rna sequencing of sugarcane mirnas in order to understand their complexity and to explore their role in sugarcane biology.
a bioinformatics search was carried out to discover novel mirnas that can be regulated in sugarcane plants submitted to drought and salt stresses, and under pathogen infection.
by means of the presence of mirna precursors in the related sorghum genome, we identified  <dig> candidates of new mature mirnas in sugarcane.
additionally, a mads-box transcription factor and an rpp2b protein, which act in development and disease resistant processes, could be regulated by cleavage  and dna methylation , respectively.
microrna-regulation of gene expression plays a key role in the development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses.
