in contrast with what has been reported for m. tuberculosis, our results suggest that in m. smegmatis only ider-dependent regulation is retained, while zinc has no effect on gene expression.
there are  <dig> esat- <dig> family members in m. tuberculosis h37rv.
the esat- <dig>  family collects small mycobacterial proteins secreted by mycobacterium tuberculosis, particularly in the early phase of growth.
in this research, we performed emsa experiments and transcriptional analysis of esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> in mycobacterium smegmatis  and m. tuberculosis.
in contrast to what we had observed in m. tuberculosis, we found that in m. smegmatis esat- <dig> cluster  <dig> responds only to iron and not to zinc.
in m. smegmatis, the expression of msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> genes is broadly similar in differing growth phases and in stress conditions, with the exception of acid stress .
differences in expression between cluster  <dig> genes can be explained by the presence of internal promoters, both in m. smegmatis and m. tuberculosis.
in a previous work, we identified the zur- dependent regulation of five proteins of the esat-6/cfp- <dig> family .
the role of cluster  <dig> in m. tuberculosis virulence is still to be defined; however, iron- and zinc-dependent expression strongly suggests that cluster  <dig> is highly expressed in the infective process, and that the cluster contributes to the antigenic profile during the course of infection.
we compared the expression of msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> in different growth and stress conditions by means of relative quantitative pcr.
in both organisms we identified an internal promoter, a finding which suggests the presence of two transcriptional units and, by consequence, a differential expression of cluster  <dig> genes.
analysis revealed that in acid stress conditions m. tuberculosis rv <dig> gene was 3-fold induced too, while rv <dig> induction was almost insignificant.
the expression of msmeg <dig> and msmeg <dig> genes was essentially similar; they appeared to be repressed in most of the tested conditions, with the exception of acid stress  where msmeg <dig> was about 4-fold induced, while msmeg <dig> was repressed.
moreover, cluster  <dig> induction in acid stress conditions strengthens the hypothesis that cluster  <dig> is expressed in the course of infection.
