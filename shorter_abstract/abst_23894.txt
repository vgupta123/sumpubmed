despite the difficulty of procuring venom from rear-fanged species, we were able to complete all analyses from a single specimen of each species without pooling venom samples or glands, demonstrating the power of high-definition transcriptomic and proteomic approaches.
we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptomes from a specimen of hypsiglena  and of boiga irregularis  and verified the transcriptomic results proteomically by means of high-definition mass spectrometry.
comparisons of the venoms revealed divergent venom types, with hypsiglena possessing a viper-like venom dominated by metalloproteinases, and b. irregularis having a more elapid-like venom, consisting primarily of three-finger toxins.
for b. irregularis, we found  <dig> putative toxin transcripts in  <dig> clusters with <1% nucleotide divergence, and for hypsiglena we identified  <dig> toxin sequences that were grouped into  <dig> clusters.
however, relatively little is known about the molecular complexity and evolution of the venoms of rear-fanged colubrid snakes, which are, with a few notable exceptions, regarded as harmless to humans.
