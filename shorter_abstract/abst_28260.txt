the overall accuracy of this approach was  <dig> %, which was higher  than those of state-of-the-art tools.
here we proposed a novel approach by fusing features from pseudo nucleic acid composition , including nac, n-tier nac and pseudo dinucleotide composition .
however, experimental identification of recombination spots is both time-consuming and costly.
developing an accurate and automated method for reliably and quickly identifying recombination spots is thus urgently needed.
svm was adopted for identifying recombination spots based on these optimal features.
comparison results suggested that linear kernel svm is a useful vehicle for identifying recombination hot/cold spots.
identification of the recombination hot/cold spots is critical for understanding the mechanism of recombination as well as the genome evolution process.
to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, jackknife cross-validation test was employed on a benchmark dataset.
