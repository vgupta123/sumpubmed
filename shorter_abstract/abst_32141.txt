the software also allows detecting putative protein-protein interactions, novel enzymes involved in only partially known biochemical pathways, and alternate enzymes originated by convergent evolution.
there are several bioinformatic studies that made use of this database to determine thermophile-specific proteins by searching for cogs containing  exclusively proteins from thermophilic genomes.
the rapidly increasing number of completely sequenced genomes led to the establishment of the cog-database which, based on sequence homologies, assigns similar proteins from different organisms to clusters of orthologous groups .
in addition to ranking all cogs according to the user defined specificity criteria, a graphical visualization shows the distribution of all cogs by displaying their abundance as a function of their specificity indexes.
