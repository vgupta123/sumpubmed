ybey-dependent srnas have central roles in modulating cellular response to hu stress.
we have applied a multipronged approach of loss-of-function studies, genome-wide mrna and srna expression profiling, pathway analysis, target prediction, literature mining and network analysis to unravel ybey-dependent molecular responses of e. coli exposed to hydroxyurea .
loss of ybey function, which results in a marked resistance to hu, had global affects on srna-mediated gene expression.
of  <dig> detectable e. coli srnas in our microarray analysis,  <dig> srnas showed a differential expression upon hu stress, of which  <dig> srnas displayed a ybey-dependent change in expression.
the highly conserved bacterial ybey rnase has structural similarities to the mid domain of agos.
a limited study had indicated that in sinorhizobium meliloti the ybey ortholog regulates the accumulation of srnas as well as the target mrnas, raising the possibility that ybey may play a previously unrecognized role in bacterial srna regulation.
conceptual parallels exist between bacterial and eukaryotic small-rna  pathways, yet relatively little is known about which protein may recognize and recruit bacterial srnas to interact with targets.
