production of anti-inflammatory il- <dig> increased in ee-erko mice  but not in ee-gpr30ko mice .
the inability of ee to reduce disease in gpr30ko mice indicates an important but still undefined role for gpr <dig> in regulating immune reactivity.
previous work has established that 17β-estradiol can inhibit onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis , while ethinyl estradiol  can reduce the severity of established disease.
differential production of il- <dig> following ee treatment in erko and gpr30ko animals may be responsible for the distinctly different effects on disease severity.
ee reduced disease severity in wild-type and erα knockout  mice, but did not alter disease in the gpr30ko group.
in the current study, the influence of estrogen receptor-α  and the g-protein coupled estrogen receptor  on ee's ability to treat eae was explored.
remission of multiple sclerosis during periods of high ovarian hormone secretion  has led to a great deal of interest in the potential for estrogens to treat autoimmune disease.
