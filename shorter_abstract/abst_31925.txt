a toxin protein cltoxb was further characterized as a potential host-specific toxin through heterologous in planta expression.
cltoxb is further characterized as a host-specific toxin that is likely to contribute to quantitative differences in virulence between the races  <dig> and  <dig>
in silico analysis of  <dig> ests generated from c. lentis-infected lentil leaf tissues identified  <dig> candidate effectors.
during its interaction with the host plant, c. lentis likely secretes numerous effector proteins, including toxins to alter the plantâ€™s innate immunity, thereby gaining access to the host tissues for nutrition and reproduction.
a single nucleotide polymorphism in the orf of candidate effector clce <dig>  used to develop a kaspar marker, differentiated perfectly between pathogenic race  <dig> and race  <dig> isolates when tested on  <dig> isolates arbitrarily selected from a large culture collection representing the western canadian population of c. lentis.
in silico analysis of the cltoxb sequence and comparative genomics revealed that toxb is unlikely a foreign gene in the c. lentis genome.
incongruency between established species relationships and that established based on gene sequence data confirmed toxb arose through evolution from a common ancestor, whereas the bacterial gene arg identified in c. lentis was horizontally transferred from bacteria.
we developed a kaspar assay using effector polymorphism to differentiate c. lentis races.
the knock-down of cltoxb transcripts by rnai resulted in reduced virulence, suggesting that cltoxb is a virulence factor.
comparative genomics revealed a foreign gene encoding a potential virulence factor arg, which was horizontally transferred from bacteria into the genus colletotrichum.
furthermore, an est encoding argininosuccinate lyase  was identified as a bacterial gene.
in planta infection stage-specific gene expression waves among candidate effectors were revealed for the appressorial penetration phase, biotrophic phase and necrotrophic phase.
est mining and expression profiling revealed a set of in planta expressed candidate effectors.
no sign of positive selection pressure  in effectors was detected at the intraspecific level.
