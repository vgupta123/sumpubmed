the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus regulates food intake.
ankyrin repeat and socs box containing protein  <dig>  is expressed in neuropeptide y and proopiomelanocortin  neurons in the arcuate nucleus, target neurons in the regulation of food intake and metabolism by insulin and leptin.
in hek <dig> cells co-transfected with myc-tagged asb- <dig> and flag-tagged irs <dig>  asb- <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with irs4; in these cells endogenous irs <dig> also co-immunoprecipitated with transfected myc-asb-4; furthermore, asb- <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with irs <dig> in rat hypothalamic extracts.
these data demonstrated that asb- <dig> co-localizes and interacts with irs <dig> in hypothalamic neurons.
insulin receptor substrate  <dig>  is an adaptor molecule involved in the signal transduction by both insulin and leptin.
the interaction of asb- <dig> with irs <dig> in cell lines mediates the degradation of irs <dig> and decreases insulin signaling.
double in situ hybridization showed that irs <dig> colocalized with asb- <dig>  and both asb- <dig> and irs <dig> mrna were expressed in proopiomelanocortin  and neuropeptide y  neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
in the present study we examined the colocalization and interaction of asb- <dig> with irs <dig> and the involvement of asb- <dig> in insulin signaling.
in hek <dig> cells over expression of asb- <dig> decreased irs <dig> protein levels and deletion of the socs box abolished this effect.
asb- <dig> increased the ubiquitination of irs4; deletion of socs box abolished this effect.
in situ hybridization showed that the expression pattern of asb- <dig> was consistent with that of irs <dig> in the rat brain.
