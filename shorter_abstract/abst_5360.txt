raphidioptera  is a holometabolous order of the superorder neuropterida characterized by the narrowly elongate adult prothorax and the long female ovipositor.
however, the evolutionary history of raphidioptera is largely unexplored, as a result of the poorly studied phylogeny among fossil and extant lineages within the order.
the snakefly affinity of priscaenigmatomorpha is confirmed and another new family, chrysoraphidiidae fam.
the new family is characterized by an unexpected combination of plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters of raphidioptera.
diversification of higher snakefly taxa had occurred by the early jurassic, suggesting that these insects had already had a long but undocumented history by this time.
nov. is determined to be a transitional lineage between priscaenigmatomorpha and raphidiomorpha.
mesozoic snakeflies were markedly more diverse than the modern ones are.
in this paper, we report a new snakefly family, juroraphidiidae fam.
based on our phylogenetic analysis, juroraphidiidae fam.
