intrinsic protein disorder is becoming an increasingly important topic in protein science.
here, we present a thorough description and analysis of the data made available by mobidb, providing descriptive statistics on the various available annotation sources.
our recently published database, mobidb, provides a centralized resource for accessing and analysing intrinsic protein disorder annotations.
the comparison between disorder information sources highlights how the mobidb consensus captures the main features of intrinsic disorder and correlates well with manually curated datasets.
mobidb is a central resource for intrinsic disorder research, containing both experimental data and predictions.
this has sparked a need to better understand and characterize different types of idps, their functions and roles.
<dig> , <dig> uniprot sequences, covering all eukaryotic proteomes.
finally, we demonstrate the annotation of  <dig> eukaryotic model organisms through mobidb's datasets, and of an example protein through the interactive user interface.
in the future it will be expanded to include additional information for all known proteins.
