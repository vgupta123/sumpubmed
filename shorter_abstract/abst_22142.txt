in this study, we introduce the concept of resampling methods for the analysis of kinetic models and present a statistical model invalidation approach.
we based our invalidation approach on the evaluation of a kinetic model’s predictive power through cross validation and forecast analysis.
they can be used to predict the dynamics of metabolite production, signal transduction or transcription of genes.
through a simulations study, we showed that too simple mechanistic descriptions can be invalidated by using our spca-based comparative approach until high amount of noise exists in the experimental data.
as a reference point for this evaluation, we used the predictive power of an unsupervised data analysis method which does not make use of any biochemical knowledge, namely smooth principal components analysis  on the same test sets.
we also applied our approach on an eicosanoid production model developed for human and concluded that the model could not be invalidated using the available data despite its simplicity in the formulation of the reaction kinetics.
matlab files needed for invalidation using spca cross validation and our toy model in sbml format are provided at http://www.bdagroup.nl/content/downloads/software/software.php.
with this study, we have successfully presented the potential of two resampling methods, cross validation and forecast analysis in the analysis of kinetic models’ validity.

kinetic models can present mechanistic descriptions of molecular processes within a cell.
although there has been tremendous effort in constructing kinetic models for different biological systems, not much effort has been put into their validation.
furthermore, we analysed the high osmolarity glycerol  pathway in yeast to question the validity of an existing model as another realistic demonstration of our method.
