by comparison with several structural alignment algorithms, our approach outperforms previous methods on both the classification accuracy and efficiency.
even though using the scop database is believed to be more reliable than classification results from other methods, it is labor intensive.
to mimic human classification processes, we develop an automatic scop fold classification system to assign possible known scop folds and recognize novel folds for newly-discovered proteins.
domain experts manually construct the structural classification of protein  database to categorize and compare protein structures.
with satisfactory ground truth data from the scop database, our approach identifies relevant domain knowledge and yields reasonably accurate classifications.
in this paper, we build an advanced, non-parametric classifier to accelerate the manual classification processes of scop.
with a sufficient amount of ground truth data, our system is able to assign the known folds for newly-discovered proteins in the latest scop v <dig>  release with  <dig> % accuracy.
the average response time for proteins with  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids to complete the classification process is  <dig>  and  <dig>  seconds, respectively.
our system also recognizes the novel folds with  <dig> % accuracy using  <dig> fold cross validation.
