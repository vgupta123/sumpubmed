it computes the shortest path of co-occurring terms in the document to one of these senses.
to evaluate these approaches we defined a manually curated training corpus of  <dig> documents for seven ambiguous terms from the gene ontology and mesh.
the 'term cooc' approach performs better on gene ontology  than on mesh  as mesh is not a strict is-a/part-of, but rather a loose is-related-to hierarchy.
ontology term labels can be ambiguous and have multiple senses.
metadata is valuable for disambiguation, but requires high quality training data.
however, most treat ontologies as simple terminologies, without making use of the ontology structure or the semantic similarity between terms.
overall, the results show that well structured ontologies can play a very important role to improve disambiguation.
the 'closest sense' method assumes that the ontology defines multiple senses of the term.
the 'closest sense' approach achieves on average 80% success rate.
the 'term cooc' method defines a log-odds ratio for co-occurring terms including co-occurrences inferred from the ontology structure.
it does not require any ontology, but requires training data, which the other methods do not.
its performance deteriorates as quality of the training data decreases.
term cooc achieves greater 90% success given a consistently modelled ontology.
the three benchmark datasets created for the purpose of disambiguation are available in additional file  <dig>
classical approaches to word sense disambiguation use co-occurring words or terms.
here, we systematically compare three approaches to word sense disambiguation, which use ontologies and metadata, respectively.
