a transcriptomic approach using soybean cultivars with high  and low  root isoflavonoid content was used to find elements that underlie this variation.
coordinated regulation of genes involved in flavonoid metabolism could redirect flux into the isoflavonoid branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway, by reducing competition for the flavanone substrate.
these candidate genes could help identify mechanisms to overcome the endogenous bottleneck to isoflavonoid production, facilitate biosynthesis in heterologous systems, and enhance crop resistance against pathogenic infections.
two genes, encoding the flavonoid-metabolizing enzymes, flavonoid 3â€²-hydroxylase  and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , had lower expression levels in high isoflavonoid cultivars.
they play a role in signaling for symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and inhibiting pathogen infection.
in addition, genes annotated with stress and disease response were upregulated in high isoflavonoid cultivars.
