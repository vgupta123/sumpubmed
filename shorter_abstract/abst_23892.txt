relationships between birth size, division size, and generation time indicated that cell-size control was inconsistent with the “sizer” rule, where division timing is based on cell size, or the “timer” rule, where division occurs after a fixed time interval.
thus, the cumulative effects of drift over long periods can cause difficulties in monitoring and quantifying cell growth and division dynamics.
instead, single cell growth statistics were most consistent with the “adder” rule, in which division occurs after a constant increment in cell volume.
we also observed rapid phenotypic response to light-dark transitions at the single cell level, highlighting the critical role of light in cyanobacterial cell-cycle control.
to overcome this challenge, we enhanced a microfluidic cell-culture device and developed an image analysis pipeline for robust lineage reconstruction.
cyanobacteria are important agents in global carbon and nitrogen cycling and hold great promise for biotechnological applications.
generation times were highly correlated for sister cells, but not between mother and daughter cells.
our analyses revealed that the “adder” model can explain both the growth-related statistics of single synechocystis cells and the correlation between sister cell generation times.
cells exposed to light-dark cycles exhibited growth and division only during the light period; dark phases pause but do not disrupt cell-cycle control.

our findings suggest that by monitoring the growth kinetics of individual cells we can build testable models of circadian control of the cell cycle in cyanobacteria.
this allowed simultaneous tracking of many cells over multiple generations, and revealed that cells expand exponentially throughout their cell cycle.
model organisms such as synechocystis sp.
