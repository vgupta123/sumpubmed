using these datasets, we prove that alpha alignments are at least as good as those computed by standard aligners.
a python implementation of alpha, along with installation instructions for ubuntu and osx, is available on bitbucket .
indeed, whole genome aligners interpret lack of similarity between sequences as an indication of rearrangements, insertions, or losses.
in this paper, we propose a multiple alignment strategy that exploits functional collinearity shared by related strains of bacteriophages, and uses partial orders to capture mosaicism of sets of genomes.
due to the peculiar mosaic structure of these genomes, few informative approaches for comparing whole genomes exist: dot plots diagrams give a mostly qualitative assessment of the similarity/dissimilarity between two or more genomes, and clustering techniques are used to classify genomes.
in recent years, many studies focused on the description and comparison of large sets of related bacteriophage genomes.
this behavior makes them ill-prepared to align bacteriophage genomes, where even closely related strains can accomplish the same biological function with highly dissimilar sequences.
multiple alignments of whole bacteriophage genomes work, and will become an important conceptual and visual tool in comparative genomics of sets of related strains.
multiple alignments are conspicuously absent from this scene.
as classical alignments do, the computed alignments can be used to predict that genes have the same biological function, even in the absence of detectable similarity.
