third, we apply these methods to compare  <dig> smoothing models on a new database of  <dig> annotated neuroblastoma copy number profiles, which we make available as a public benchmark for testing new algorithms.
many models have been proposed to detect copy number alterations in chromosomal copy number profiles, but it is usually not obvious to decide which is most effective for a given data set.
we present three contributions for copy number profile smoothing model selection.
whereas previous studies have been qualitative or limited to simulated data, our annotation-guided approach is quantitative and suggests which algorithms are fastest and most accurate in practice on real data.
first, we propose to select the model and degree of smoothness that maximizes agreement with visual breakpoint region annotations.
in the neuroblastoma data, the equivalent pelt.n and cghseg.k methods were the best breakpoint detectors, and exhibited reasonable computation times.
