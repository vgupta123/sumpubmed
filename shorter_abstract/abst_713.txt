in the current study, to further define molecular characteristics of acquired antiestrogen resistance we constructed an “integrative network”.
by integrating mirna-related network, gene/mirna expression and text-mining, the current study provides a computational-based systems biology approach for further investigating the molecular mechanism underlying antiestrogen resistance in breast cancer cells.
based on the integrative network, we extracted “substructures”  representing the drug resistant states  compared to drug sensitive state .
we identified un-described network clusters that contribute to antiestrogen resistance consisting of mir-146a, -27a, - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  -15a, -125b, and let-7s, in addition to the previously described mir-221/ <dig>
in addition, new mirna clusters that contribute to antiestrogen resistance were identified, and they warrant further investigation.
we combined joint mirna-mrna expression profiles, cancer contexts, mirna-target mrna relationships, and mirna upstream regulators.
also, to improve biological interpretation, cancer contexts were incorporated into the network connectivity.
however, employing a systems biology approach to better understand the complexities underlying drug resistance phenotypes in cancer continues to represent a significant challenge to the field.
