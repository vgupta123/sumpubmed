populations may be bound by contemporary gene flow, selective sweeps, and extinction-recolonization processes.
indeed, existing molecular estimates indicate that species with low levels of gene flow are rare.
however, strong priority effects and local selective regimes may hinder gene flow  sending populations on independent evolutionary trajectories.
we aimed to better understand the history of population differentiation and ongoing gene flow in daphnia rosea s.l., by comparing population and regional divergences in mature unglaciated areas and younger previously glaciated areas.
our evidence agrees with negligible gene flow after founding, and the accumulation of genetic divergence with habitat age.
instead, priority effects and local selection regimes may play a role in limiting gene flow.
the results challenge the notion that lacustrine populations of cladocerans are generally unified by contemporary gene flow.
the genetic evidence indicated pronounced historical structure.
existing direct evidence and our mismatch analyses indicate that the pronounced population differentiation is unlikely to be due to dispersal limitation.
in this scenario , population differentiation will increase with time and genealogical evidence should yield ample private haplotypes.
the japanese/american clade showed marked population genetic structure  that was weakly associated with geographic distance, and a high proportion of private haplotypes.
cyclical parthenogens  have an increased capacity for rapid local adaptation and priority effects because sexual reproduction is followed by multiple generations of clonal selection and massive egg bank formation.
mismatch analyses of mtdna and ndna were consistent with a single rapid post-glacial expansion of d. rosea that covered most of the new world.
we also examined the timing and paths of colonization of previously-glaciated areas to assess the dispersal limitations of d. rosea s.l.
