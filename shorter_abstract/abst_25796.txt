amongst human mirnas, there are  <dig> are unique motifs, many residing in processing sites.
interestingly, unique motifs were identified in human mirna processing sites, binding to which could inhibit mirna maturation and hence function.
the composite of secondary structural elements that comprise mirnas could aid the design of small molecules that modulate their function.
further, we identified motifs in mirnas that are not present in other highly expressed human rnas, desirable targets for small molecules.
we also analyzed the most frequently occurring bulges and internal loops for each rna class and found that the smallest loops possible prevail.
we analyzed the secondary structural elements, or motifs, present in all human mirnaÂ hairpin precursors and compared them to highly expressed human rnas with known structures and other rnas from various organisms.
mirna motifs were incorporated into a searchable database that is freely available.
collectively, we have completed a broad survey of motifs found in human mirna precursors, highly expressed human rnas, and rnas from other organisms.
however, the distribution of loops and the preferred closing base pairs were unique to each class.
micrornas  regulate gene expression by targeting complementary mrnas for destruction or translational repression.
