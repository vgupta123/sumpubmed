however there has been little attention devoted to copy number variation  detection from exome capture datasets despite the potentially high impact of cnvs in exonic regions on protein function.
we developed a rigorous bayesian method to detect cnvs in the genes, based on read depth within target regions.
this is well suited for snp discovery and genotyping.
