our results suggest that the replacement of entire adenylation domains could be a more successful strategy to obtain higher specificity in the modification of the non-ribosomal peptides than point mutations.
here, we show that independent evolutionary events affecting the substrate specificity of the microcystin biosynthetic pathway have resulted in convergence on a rare  microcystin-lr chemical variant.
however, point mutations affecting the substrate-binding sequence motifs of the mcya <dig> adenylation domain were associated with the change in substrate specificity in two strains of microcystis.
we detected this rare microcystin variant from strains of the distantly related genera microcystis, nostoc, and phormidium.
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that both point mutations and gene conversion result in functional mcy gene clusters that produce the same rare  variant of microcystin in strains of the genera microcystis, nostoc, and phormidium.
the chemical diversity of the microcystin family is attributed to a number of genetic events that have resulted in the diversification of the pathway for microcystin assembly.
engineering pathways to produce recombinant non-ribosomal peptides could provide new natural products or increase the activity of known compounds.
we found evidence for conversion of the gene encoding the mcya <dig> adenylation domain in strains of the genera nostoc and phormidium.
phylogenetic analysis performed using sequences of the catalytic domains within the mcy gene cluster demonstrated a clear recombination pattern in the adenylation domain phylogenetic tree.
