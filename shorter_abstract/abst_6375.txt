we investigated this via an in silico analysis and by performing a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  screen on mouse samples.
in silico analysis of the vertebrate ena/vasp gene family reveals that birds do not have vasp, while fish have two evl genes.
analysis of expressed sequence tags of vertebrate enah splice variants confirms that an enah transcript without alternative exons is ubiquitously expressed, but yields only limited information about the existence of other possible alternatively spliced enah transcripts.
via a rt-pcr screen, we provide evidence that during mouse development and in adult mice at least eight and maximally sixteen different enah transcripts are expressed.
it has extra alternatively included exons compared to vasp and evl, and possibly one alternatively excluded intron s. the aim of this mapping study was to probe the occurrence of combinations of exon usage in enah thereby identifying possible vertebrate enah splice variants.
we further probed the expression pattern of mouse enah splice variants during development and in a selection of mouse adult tissues and mouse cell lines.
exons previously associated with neuronal expression of enah splice variants are also present in other tissues, in particular in heart.
we provide an overview of distinct expression profiles of mouse enah splice variants during mouse development, in adult mouse tissues and in a subset of mouse cell lines.
we propose a more uniform nomenclature for alternative exons in enah.
we also show that tissues and cell lines display specific expression profiles of these different transcripts.
