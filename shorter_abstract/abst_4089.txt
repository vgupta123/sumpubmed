an overrepresentation of e2f, ap <dig>  egr <dig> and sp <dig> specific motifs was also found in the promoters of the differentially expressed genes.
we have shown previously that pan-hdac inhibitors  m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide  and trichostatin a  attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in balb/c mice by inducing hyper-acetylation of cardiac chromatin that was accompanied by suppression of pro-inflammatory gene networks.
therefore, the current study was undertaken with a primary goal of elucidating temporal changes in the transcriptomes of cardiac myocytes exposed to cbha and tsa.
we analyzed cbha- and tsa-induced differentially expressed genes by ingenuity pathway , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and core_tf programs and discovered that cbha and tsa impinged on several common gene networks.
initially, both hdacis impinged on numerous genes associated with adipokine signaling, intracellular metabolism and energetics, and cell cycle.
however, it was not feasible to determine the precise contribution of the myocytes- and non-myocytes to hdaci-induced gene expression in the intact heart.
we incubated h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes in growth medium containing either of the two hdacis for 6h and 24h and analyzed changes in gene expression using illumina microarrays.
thus, both hdacis induced a repertoire of signaling kinases  and transcription factors  representing canonical tgfβ, tnf-α, ifnγ and il- <dig> specific networks.
in contrast, cardiac myocytes incubated with cbha for 6h and 24h elicited differential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively.
our data show that both cbha and tsa induced similar, but not identical, time-dependent, gene networks in h9c <dig> cardiac myocytes.
these findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms of actions of hdacis on cardiac myocytes and reveal potential signaling pathways that may be targeted therapeutically.
apparently, tsa elicited predominantly tgfβ- and tnf-α-intensive gene networks regardless of the duration of treatment.
in contrast, cbha elicited tnf-α and ifnγ specific networks at  <dig> h, followed by elicitation of il- <dig> and ifnγ-centered gene networks at 24h.
a continued exposure to either cbha or tsa led to the emergence of a number of apoptosis- and inflammation-specific gene networks that were apparently suppressed by both hdacis.
h9c <dig> cells exposed to tsa for 6h and 24h led to differential expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively.
