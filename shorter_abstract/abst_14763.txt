previous biochemical, biophysical and computational analyses demonstrate that the t and c polymers are rings of nine concatenated globin domains, which are covalently joined by interdomain linkers.
the brine shrimp artemia expresses four different types of haemoglobin subunits namely c <dig>  c <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  two of these four subunits dimerize in different combinations to produce the three isoforms of the heterodimeric artemia haemoglobin: hbi , hbii  and hbiii .
crosslinking with gmbs  was also performed, and the results show good agreement with this model.
six putative egs  crosslinked tryptic peptides were identified.
this involved introducing chemical crosslinks between the two polymers, cleaving with trypsin and analyzing the resulting products by mass spectrometry.
this was followed by computational analysis of the mass spectrometry data using the program searchxlinks to identify putatively crosslinked peptides.
this research aimed to construct a quaternary structural model of artemia hbii that shows the interpolymer interface and domain-domain alignment, using the ms3d  approach.
furthermore the ef-contact is a common contact in cooperative haemoglobins and thus the model is consistent with the cooperative behaviour of artemia hbii.
all of them support a model in which the ef helices of all domains are in contact along the interpolymer surface, and domain  <dig> of the t-polymer aligns with domain  <dig> of the c-polymer.
the interpolymer ef-contact allows the hydrophobic e and f helices to be buried in the interface and therefore allow the complex to solubilize readily to facilitate efficient oxygen transport.
