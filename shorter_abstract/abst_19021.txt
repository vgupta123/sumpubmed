describing this plasticity can shed light on the functional diversity of groel.
evidence on the functional importance of coevolving sites illuminates the as yet unappreciated functional diversity of proteins.
our results highlight the evolutionary plasticity of groel across the entire bacterial phylogeny.
we conducted the first coevolution analyses in an extensive bacterial phylogeny, revealing complex networks of evolutionary dependencies between residues in groesl.
functions alternative to folding have been previously described for groel in different bacterial groups, supporting enormous functional and structural plasticity for this molecule and the existence of a hidden combinatorial code in the protein sequence enabling such functions.
these networks differed among bacterial groups and involved amino acid sites with functional importance and others with previously unsuspected functional potential.
coevolutionary networks formed statistically independent units among bacterial groups and map to structurally continuous regions in the protein, suggesting their functional link.
the folding activity proceeds through strong conformational changes mediated by the co-chaperonin groes and atp.
shifts in these coevolutionary relationships may inevitably lead to evolution of alternative functions.
moreover, coevolving sites within a bacterial group mapped to regions previously identified as involved in folding-unrelated functions, and thus, coevolution may mediate alternative functions.
sites involved in coevolution fell within narrow structural regions, supporting dynamic combinatorial functional links involving similar protein domains.
