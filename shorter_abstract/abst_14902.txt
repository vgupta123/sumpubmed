such approach should potentially raise the canola market value and likely, that of other crops.
phytate accumulation appears to be confined mainly within the embryo throughout seed development and maturation.
introduction of this new metabolic step during seed development prompted ins conversion to the corresponding monomethyl ether, ononitol, and affected phytate accumulation.
myo-inositol  metabolism during early stages of seed development plays an important role in determining the distributional relationships of some seed storage components such as the antinutritional factors, sucrose galactosides  and phytic acid  .
we have studied the initial metabolic patterns of ins in developing seeds of brassica napus and determined that early stages of seed development are marked by rapid deployment of ins into a variety of pathways, dominated by interconversion of polar  and non-polar  species.
in a time course experiment at early stages of seed development, we show ins to be a highly significant constituent of the endosperm and seed coat, but with no phytate biosynthesis occurring in either tissue.
competitive methylation of ins during seed development reduces seed antinutritional components and enhances its nutritional characteristics while maintaining adequate phosphate reserves.

additionally, changes in the raffinose content and related sugars occurred along with enhanced sucrose levels.
in our approach, the gene for myo-inositol methyltransferase , isolated from mesembryanthemum crystallinum , was transferred to b. napus under the control of the seed-specific promoters, napin and phaseolin.
phytic acid is highly negatively charged, which chelates positive ions of essential minerals and decreases their bioavailability.
our aim was to investigate the influence of competitive diversion of ins as common substrate on the biosynthesis of phytate and sucrose galactosides.
