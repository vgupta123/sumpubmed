genome-wide detection of chromosomal changes was performed using the affymetrix genechip  <dig> k single nucleotide polymorphism  array, including loss of heterozygosity  and copy number alterations , for  <dig> pairs of matched germ-line and micro-dissected tumor dna samples.
the comprehensive knowledge gained from this analysis will enable improved strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat escc.
loh regions were identified by two methods – using affymetrix's genotype call software and using affymetrix's copy number alteration tool  software – and both approaches yielded similar results.
non-random loh regions were found on  <dig> chromosomal arms , including  <dig> novel loh regions .
these studies demonstrate that the affymetrix  <dig> k snp chip is a valid platform to integrate analyses of loh and cna.
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  is a common malignancy worldwide.
