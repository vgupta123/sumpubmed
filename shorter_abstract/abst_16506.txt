circadian rhythms have a profound effect on human health.
gene expression studies in these pathologies are often studied in different mouse strains by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction .
in the present study the expression of ten candidate reference genes  was measured in  <dig> liver and  <dig> adrenal gland samples taken from three mouse strains  every  <dig> h in a  <dig> h period.
differences in ranking of the most stable reference genes were observed both between individual mouse strains as well as between tissues within each mouse strain.
we show that selection of reference gene  that is often used for analyses in individual mouse strains leads to errors if used for normalization when different mouse strains are compared.
differences between mouse strains and tissues should be taken into consideration to avoid false interpretations.
expression stability was evaluated by genorm and normfinder programs.
genetic background and circadian time influence the expression stability of reference genes.
we show that the use of a single reference gene can lead to false biological conclusions.
selection of reference genes is a crucial step of qpcr experiments.
recent studies show that reference gene stability can vary between species and tissues, but none has taken circadian experiments into consideration.
we identified alternative reference genes that are stable in these comparisons.
this manuscript provides a useful reference point for researchers that search for stable reference genes in the field of circadian biology.
