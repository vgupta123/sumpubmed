therefore, we propose to utilize a novel method, based on hybridization of ica, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms , and rough sets , that attempts to improve the effectiveness of signal decomposition techniques by providing them with "classification-awareness."
even a quick visual analysis of those results can provide an interesting insight into the problem of neural activity analysis.
one of the main advantages of our approach is the fact that rather than solely relying on often unrealistic assumptions about statistical independence of sources, components are generated in the light of a underlying classification problem itself.
the preliminary results described here are very promising and further investigation of other moeas and/or rs-based classification accuracy measures should be pursued.
independent component analysis  proves to be useful in the analysis of neural activity, as it allows for identification of distinct sources of activity.
however, the ica's assumption about statistical independence of sources is often unrealistic and turns out to be insufficient to build an accurate classifier.
applied to measurements registered in a controlled setting and under exposure to an external stimulus, it can facilitate analysis of the impact of the stimulus on those sources.
we present a methodology of classificatory decomposition of signals.
