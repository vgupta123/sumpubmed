blood samples for measurement of interleukin - <dig> were collected at tbl, t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig>  this was a prospective, randomised investigation to evaluate the efficacy of tramadol and methadone as premedications in dogs undergoing osteotomies.
heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure values were maintained within acceptable ranges, and a reduction was observed at t <dig> in met <dig>  and met <dig>  compared with tbl.
tra showed greater demand of rescue analgesia  .
however, dosage increases, administered as rescue analgesia, promoted adequate pain control even in tramadol group.
there were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to age, weight, gender, surgery time, and time to extubation.
there were no statistically significant differences in sedation scores, colorado scale scores, or interleukin levels between groups and time points.
increases in vas scores were observed in tra at t <dig> compared with tbl, t <dig>  and t <dig> and between t <dig> and t <dig> .
tra and met <dig>  showed significantly higher mean ± sd vas scores  than met <dig>   at t <dig> .
pain scores were described by visual analogue scale , modified glasgow composite, and colorado university acute pain scales.
acute postsurgical pain is of great interest due to potential risk of becoming chronic if not treated properly, worsening patient’s recovery and quality of life.
physiological parameters  were evaluated at specified times: baseline ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  hours after premedication.
in met <dig> , there was significant increase in vas score at t <dig> compared with t <dig> .
