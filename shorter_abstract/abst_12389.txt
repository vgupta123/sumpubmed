depending on the desired mutation, several experimental options exist in the isolation of clonal lines, such as selection with introduced markers, or screening by pcr amplification of genomic dna.
to assess the technique, we probed clonal isolates of 293-trex cells that were targeted with three separate sgrnas against the hur gene.
validation of knockout candidates by western blot indicated that the normalized protein abundances indicated by the dot blot serve as accurate predictors of deletion.
