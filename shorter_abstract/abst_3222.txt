we confirm that refseq protein-coding gene annotations in mammals exhibit considerable similarity.
the process flow described provides specific information on the scope and degree of conservation for the analyzed protein sequences and annotations and will be used to enrich the quality of refseq records by identifying targets for further improvement in the computational annotation pipeline, and by flagging specific genes for manual curation.
our multi-factored analysis demonstrates a high level of consistency in refseq protein representation among vertebrates.
we find that the majority of the refseq vertebrate proteins for which we have calculated orthology are good as measured by these metrics.
genome annotation results are affected by differences in available support evidence and may be impacted by annotation pipeline software changes over time.
results are available on the refseq ftp site .
we assessed an ortholog dataset that includes  <dig> annotated vertebrate refseq genomes including human.
over 50% of the orthologous protein-coding genes in  <dig> organisms are supported at the level of splicing conservation with at least three selected reference genomes.
advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have yielded a large number of publicly available vertebrate genomes, many of which are selected for inclusion in ncbi’s refseq project and subsequently processed by ncbi’s eukaryotic annotation pipeline.
to address this deficiency, we have developed a comparative protocol which integrates analysis of annotated protein-coding regions across a data set of vertebrate orthologs in genomic sequence coordinates, protein sequences, and protein features.
we use these tests to define an annotation quality metric that is based directly on the annotated proteins thus operates independently of other quality metrics such as availability of transcripts or assembly quality measures.
