important selection criteria were: a broad maximum temperature and ph range for growth , a broad spectrum of carbon sources that can be metabolized , a high total fatty acid content in combination with a low glycogen content and genetic accessibility.
tags originating from oleaginous yeasts can be used as the so-called second generation biofuels, which are based on non-food competing “waste carbon sources”.

these yeasts are usually non-pathogenic and able to store tags ranging from 20 % to 70 % of their cell mass depending on culture conditions.
based on these selection criteria, among  <dig> screened species, schwanniomyces occidentalis  cbs <dig> was selected as a promising strain for the production of high amounts of lipids.
