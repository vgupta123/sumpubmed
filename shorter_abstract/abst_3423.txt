we present a series of benchmarks to evaluate peakranger against  <dig> other peak callers, and demonstrate the performance of peakranger on both real and synthetic data sets.
compared to other peak callers tested, peakranger offers improved resolution in distinguishing extremely closely-spaced peaks.
in this paper, we introduce peakranger, a peak caller software package that works equally well on punctate and broad sites, can resolve closely-spaced peaks, has excellent performance, and is easily customized.
although there are many algorithms to call peaks from chip-seq datasets, most are tuned either to handle punctate sites, such as transcriptional factor binding sites, or broad regions, such as histone modification marks; few can do both.
other algorithms are limited in their configurability, performance on large data sets, and ability to distinguish closely-spaced peaks.
in addition, peakranger can be run in a parallel cloud computing environment to obtain extremely high performance on very large data sets.
chromatin immunoprecipitation , coupled with massively parallel short-read sequencing  is used to probe chromatin dynamics.
