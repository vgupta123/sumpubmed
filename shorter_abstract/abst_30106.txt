we have thus developed a new differentiation protocol, designated 'pre-aggregation differentiation'  which appears to favor development of electrophysiologically functional neurons and to lead to an increase in dopaminergic neurons in the rencell vm line.
rencell cx did not display the same electrophysiological properties as the vm line, generating voltage-dependant k+ currents but no na+ currents or action potentials under either stdd or pred differentiation.
in contrast, the protocol used had little effect on the differentiation of rencell cx in which dopaminergic differentiation was not observed.
however it became clear that this was not true for electrophysiological features which designate neurons, such as the firing of action potentials.
moreover, after a week of differentiation with the pred protocol, 100% of rencell vm featured ttx-sensitive na+-channels and fired action potentials, compared to 25% after stdd.
in the undifferentiated state, both rencell vm and cx are nestin positive and have resting membrane potentials of around - <dig> mv but do not display any voltage-activated conductances.
neural stem cells  are powerful research tools for the design and discovery of new approaches to neurodegenerative disease.
development of a functional neuronal phenotype may be dependent on parameters of isolation and differentiation of the cell lines, indicating that not all human nscs are functionally equivalent.
as initially hypothesized, using standard methods  for differentiation, both cell lines can form neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes according to immunohistological characteristics.
