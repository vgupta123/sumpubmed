we have used rna-seq to measure the abundance of all transcripts in an rna-seq-derived de novo gene catalog in two different experiments.
the lack of detectable daily variation in transcript levels indicates that the endogenous circadian timer of lingulodinium does not require rhythmic rna.
the second compared four different times  under a light dark cycle.
we also examined the timing of the bioluminescence and photosynthesis rhythms in the presence of the transcription inhibitors actinomycin d and cordycepin.
one compared midday and midnight in a lightâ€“dark cycle  and under constant light .
these rhythms are orchestrated by an endogenous circadian clock whose mechanism is based on transcription-translation feedback loops  where the translated products of clock genes act to inhibit their own transcription.
