in this study, we identified skeletal muscle differentiation-associated mirnas by comparing mirna expression profiles between c2c <dig> cells and wnt <dig> over-expressing c2c <dig> cells , which can spontaneously differentiate into myotubes.
transfection of mimics of these mirnas into c2c <dig> cells resulted in significantly reduced expression of myogenic differentiation markers, including troponin t and myosin heavy chain fast type and slow type, but did not affect the expression of the myogenic transcription factors, myod and myogenin.
skeletal muscle differentiation is a multistep, complex pathway in which several important signaling molecules are involved.
recently, micrornas , endogenous non-coding small rnas that regulate mrnas, have been proposed to be involved in skeletal muscle differentiation.

these mirnas were characterized as new myogenic differentiation-associated mirnas which may delay late myogenic differentiation or maturation.
