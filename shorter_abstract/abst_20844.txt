in the present study, pyrethroids induced changes in gene expression in the frontal cortex near the threshold for decreases in ambulatory motor activity in vivo.
in addition, significance analysis of function and expression  identified significantly enriched gene categories common for both pyrethroids, including some relating to branching morphogenesis.
the doses used range from those that cause minimal signs of intoxication at the behavioral level to doses well below apparent no effect levels in the whole animal.
the penalized regression methods performed similarly in detecting dose-dependent changes in gene transcription.
the responses observed are consistent with pyrethroids producing increased neuronal excitation in the cortex following a low-dose in vivo exposure.
the pir analysis was most sensitive for detecting transcripts with changes in expression at the noael dose.
exposure of primary cortical cell cultures to both compounds resulted in an increase  in the number of neurite branch points, supporting the results of the safe analysis.
finally, safe analysis of gene expression data identified branching morphogenesis as a biological process sensitive to pyrethroids and subsequent in vitro experiments confirmed this predicted effect.
the purpose of this study was to characterize and explore changes in gene expression that occur in the rat frontal cortex, an area of cns affected by pyrethroids, following an acute low-dose exposure.
pyrethroids are neurotoxic pesticides that interact with membrane bound ion channels in neurons and disrupt nerve function.
