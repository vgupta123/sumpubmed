this study resulted into the identification of daunorubicin , netropsin, nogalamycin, and ethidium bromide as the potential inhibitor molecules for the biochemical activities of pfudn with ic <dig> values ranging from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  μm.
some of the pfuvrd inhibitors identified in the present study can be utilized to further design novel and specific inhibitor molecules.
enormous efforts are being made to identify suitable drug targets in order to develop newer classes of drug.
as pfuvrd is absent in human hence on the basis of this study we propose pfuvrd as suitable drug target to control malaria.
interestingly etoposide did not inhibit the atpase activity but considerable inhibition of unwinding activity was observed at  <dig> μm.
genome wide analysis revealed that plasmodium falciparum possesses uvrd helicase, which is absent in the human host.
recently the biochemical characterization of p. falciparum uvrd helicase revealed that n-terminal uvrd  hydrolyses atp, translocates in 3’ to 5’ direction and interacts with mlh to modulate each other’s activity.
here, we screened the effect of various dna interacting compounds on the atpase and helicase activity of pfudn.
further study for analyzing the importance of pfuvrd enzyme in parasite growth revealed that pfuvrd is crucial/important for its growth ex-vivo.
