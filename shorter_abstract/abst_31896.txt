cubense race  <dig>  and maitain banana production after gros michel was destructed by race  <dig>  a new race race  <dig>  was found to infect cavendish.
pgc <dig> hydrolyzed polygalacturonic acid in an exo-manner, as demonstrated by analysis of degradation products.
pgc <dig> had an apparent mr of  <dig> kda by sds-page and  <dig>  kda by mass spectrometry.
collectively, these results suggest that pgc <dig> is the first exopg reported from the pathogen foc, and we have shown that fully functional pgc <dig> can be produced in the p. pastoris expression system.
although cavendish banana cultivars are resistant to fusarium oxysporum f.sp.
an exopolygalacturonase  was isolated and purified from the supernatant of the plant pathogen fusarium oxysporum f.sp.
