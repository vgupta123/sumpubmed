we have developed a novel approach to set generation via the use of principal component analysis of the laplacian matrix of a metabolic network.
the semi-exhaustive nature of this method has also allowed us to design a hypergeometric enrichment test to determine which genes are likely responsible for set significance.
we have analysed a relatively simple data set to show the difference in results between our method and the current state-of-the-art pathway-based sets.
we show that our method finds significant aspects of biology that would be missed  and addresses the false positive rates found with the use of simple pathway-based sets.
gene set analysis  has proven to be a useful approach to microarray analysis.
as such, set generation methods should be robust and yield as complete a representation of the extant biological knowledge as possible.
the set generation step for gsa is often neglected but is a crucial part of the analysis as it defines the full context for the analysis.
the creation of sets from individual pathways  is a poor reflection of the complexity of the underlying metabolic network.
the sets generated with this method are semi-exhaustive and capture much of the topological complexity of the metabolic network.
