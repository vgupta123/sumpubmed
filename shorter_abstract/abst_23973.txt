composite interval mapping and single-marker analysis methods were used to identify significant loci for cotyledon opening under uv-b in four sets of recombinant inbred lines.
structured mapping populations provide key information on the degree of complexity in the genetic control of uv-b-induced cotyledon opening in arabidopsis.
understanding of the genetic architecture of plant uv-b responses allows extensive targeted testing of candidate genes or regions, along with combinations of those genes, for placement in metabolic or signal transduction pathways.
the loci identified using quantitative trait analysis methods are useful for follow-up testing of candidate genes.
one candidate locus contained the gene hy <dig>  mutant analysis demonstrated that hy <dig> was required for uv-b-specific cotyledon opening.
in addition, loci important for canalization  of cotyledon opening were detected in two mapping populations.
