the aim of this study was to investigate resting brain oscillation and the default mode network based on a source space in various frequency bands such as theta, alpha, beta, and gamma using magnetoencephalography.
furthermore, schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased coherence between the pcc and mpfc in the gamma band at rest.
to do this, the power spectral density of each frequency band at rest was imaged and compared on a spatially normalized brain template in  <dig> patients and  <dig> controls.
in addition, we investigated whether these resting and dmn activities could distinguish schizophrenia patients from normal controls.
by using meg to identify the dmn regions, predominantly in the alpha band, we found that both resting and dmn activities were augmented in the posterior cingulate in schizophrenia patients.
the posterior cingulate cortex  and lateral inferior parietal cortex were activated at rest, while the medial prefrontal cortex  was deactivated at rest rather than during the task.
schizophrenia can also be characterized by a functional abnormality of the brain activity that is reflected in the resting state.
oscillatory analysis provides an important understanding of resting brain activity.
the spatial distribution of dmn activity in the alpha band was similar to that found in previous fmri studies.
the dmn and resting activities of the pcc were increased in schizophrenia patients, predominantly in the theta and alpha bands.
symptoms of schizophrenia are related to deficits in self-monitoring function, which may be a consequence of irregularity in aspects of the default mode network .
