the results of the co-sedimentation assay suggest that vimentin binds directly to stk <dig> and that no additional protein mediates the association.
for testing the enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated stk <dig> we incubated precipitated stk <dig> with recombinant vimentin proteins.
immunoprecipitated stk <dig> has enzymatic activity as shown by successful phosphorylation of recombinant vimentin proteins.
to investigate whether stk <dig> binds directly to vimentin, an in vitro co-sedimentation assay was performed.
the results of the kinase assays demonstrate that stk <dig> is able to specifically phosphorylate the non-Î±-helical amino-terminal domain of vimentin in vitro.
we hypothesize that stk <dig> is involved in the in vivo dynamics of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton by phosphorylating vimentin.
in order to prove that stk <dig> and vimentin are also in vivo associated proteins co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out.
furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments employing cultured cell extracts indicate that stk <dig> and vimentin are associated in vivo.
