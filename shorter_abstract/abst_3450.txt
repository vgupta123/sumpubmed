for example, both methods identified narrow regions of frequent amplification on chromosome 1p and narrow regions of frequent deletion on 17q.
identification of rebs using a multiple span moving binomial test produced reasonable approximations of underlying cytogenetic abnormalities.
rebs were identified from a set of hepatocellular carcinoma  gene expression profiles using a multiple span moving binomial test and compared to genetic abnormalities identified using array-based comparative genomic hybridization .
specifically, expression biases reflective of cell proliferation were frequently identified on chromosome 6p21- <dig>
regional expression biases  are genetic intervals where gene expression is coordinately changed.
as such, rebs have the potential to act as surrogates for cytogenetic data traditionally obtained using molecular technologies such as comparative genomic hybridization.
however, caution should be used when attributing rebs identified on chromosome 6p to cytogenetic events in rapidly proliferating cells.
