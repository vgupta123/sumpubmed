in the present study, we report that ndufab <dig>  a nuclear encoded subunit of nadh dehydrogenase, represented the majority of the cdna clones that interacted with p49/strap in multiple screenings using the yeast two-hybrid system.
overexpression of p49/strap altered the intracellular level of nad, and reduced the nad/nadh ratio.
the p49/strap  protein was recently identified in our laboratory as a cofactor of serum response factor that contributes to the regulation of srf target genes in the heart.
the p49/strap protein contains four classic nuclear localization sequence motifs, and it was observed to be present predominantly in the nucleus.
these data suggest that p49/strap plays a role in the regulation of intracellular processes such as cardiac cellular metabolism, gene expression, and possibly aging.
overexpression of p49/strap also induced the deacetylation of serum response factor.
