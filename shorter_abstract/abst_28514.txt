the role of aspergillus fumigatus mycotoxins in the colonization of the respiratory tract by conidia has not been studied extensively, even though patients at risk from invasive aspergillosis frequently exhibit respiratory epithelium damage.
in a previous study, we found that filtrates of a. fumigatus cultures can specifically alter the electrophysiological properties of human nasal epithelial cells  compared to those of non pathogenic moulds.
we fractionated the organic phase of filtrate from 3-day old a. fumigatus cultures using high-performance liquid chromatography.
we verified that verruculogen was produced by a collection of  <dig> human, animal, plant and environmental a. fumigatus isolates.
the role of these modifications in the colonization and invasion of the respiratory epithelium by a. fumigatus on first contact with the epithelium remains to be determined.
decrease of transepithelial resistance and increase of potential differences, and contained secondary metabolites such as helvolic acid, fumagillin, and verruculogen.
