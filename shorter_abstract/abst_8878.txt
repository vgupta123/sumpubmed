voltage-gated ca2+ alpha subunit , tetracycline resistance protein  and hemolisyn-iii channel protein  were found only here and a probably involvement with resistence to itraconazole could be investigated in the future.
yeast cells treated with itraconazole for  <dig> and 2Â h.
ergosterol levels and distribution were evaluated in paracoccidioides pb <dig> yeast cells, and the results demonstrate that both factors were changed in the fungus treated with itraconazole.
paracoccidioides pb <dig> genes up-regulated by itraconazole included genes involved in cellular transport, metabolism/energy, transcription, cell rescue, defense and virulence.
in vivo infection experiments in mice corroborated the in vitro results.
the mechanism of action of azoles has been elucidated in some fungi, although little is known regarding its mechanism of action in paracoccidioides spp.
the present work focused on identification of regulated transcripts using representational difference analysis of paracoccidioides spp.
to our knowledge, this is the first transcriptional analysis of paracoccidioides spp.
here acetyl seems to be intensively produced from different metabolic pathways to produce ergosterol by the action of ergosterol synthesis related enzymes, which were also affected in other fungi.
