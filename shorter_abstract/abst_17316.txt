chlorophyll biosynthesis was improved and the levels, and activities, of several calvin cycle and “co <dig> pump” enzymes were greater in qi319- <dig> than in qi <dig>  which led to a higher rate of photosynthesis under low-phosphate stress in this line compared with in qi <dig>
proteome and physiological analyses revealed that qi319- <dig> could better remodel the lipid composition of membranes and had higher v-atpase activity levels than qi <dig> under low-phosphate starvation, which enhanced the recycling of intracellular pi, as reflected by its increased pi levels.
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the low-phosphate tolerance of this mutant, we performed comparative proteome analyses of the leaves of qi319- <dig> and qi <dig> under inorganic phosphate -sufficient and pi-deficient conditions.
our results suggest that the increased tolerance of the maize mutant qi319- <dig> to low-phosphate levels is owing to its ability to increase pi availability.
the changes in starch and sucrose contents under these conditions also differed between genotypes.
the low-phosphate-tolerant maize mutant qi319- <dig> was obtained from qi <dig> through cellular engineering.
additionally, inbred lines of maize with low-p-tolerant traits could be obtained effectively through cellular engineering.
although the overall phosphorus contents of shoots were not significantly different between qi <dig> and qi319- <dig>  the pi level of qi319- <dig> was  <dig>  % higher than that of qi <dig>  under low phosphorus conditions, qi319- <dig> had increased chlorophyll levels and enhanced photosynthesis.
