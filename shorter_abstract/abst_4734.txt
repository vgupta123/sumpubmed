we report that mir-30a and mir- <dig> in the cerebral arteries show significant changes over time after sah, but do not differ from sham-operated rats at 24Â h post-sah.
although this finding suggests interesting novel possible mechanisms involved in post-sah cerebrovascular changes, the lack of regulation of these mirnas in serum excludes their use as blood-borne biomarkers for cerebrovascular changes following sah.
however, none of these exhibited significantly altered serum levels after sah versus post-sham surgery.
additionally, serum was analyzed for a possible spill-over to the circulation of regulated mirnas from the vessel walls.
our aim was to identify mirnas that are differentially regulated in cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage , using a rat injection model of sah and a qpcr-based screen of  <dig> rat mirnas.
we identified  <dig> different mirnas expressed in cerebral arteries post-sah.
two mirnas, mir-30a and mir- <dig>  were significantly upregulated in cerebral arteries after sah when compared to sham-operated animals.
