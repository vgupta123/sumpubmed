this study demonstrates that the molecular components of autophagic process are conserved in crustaceans, which is comparable to autophagic process in mammals.
among these atg proteins, we selected commonly used autophagy markers, including beclin  <dig>  vacuolar protein sorting   <dig>  microtubule-associated proteins 1a/1b light chain 3b , p62/sequestosome  <dig> , and lysosomal-associated membrane protein  <dig>  for further sequence analyses using comparative alignment and protein structural prediction.
western blotting using commercial antibodies raised against human atg marker proteins indicated their presence in various m. rosenbergii tissues, while immunohistochemistry localized atg marker proteins within ovarian tissue, specifically late stage oocytes.
in this study, we have performed an in silico search for transcripts encoding autophagy-related  proteins within various tissue transcriptomes of m. rosenbergii.
the giant freshwater prawn, macrobrachium rosenbergii, is a decapod crustacean that is commercially important as a food source.
basic local alignment search tool  search using previously known atg proteins as queries revealed  <dig> transcripts encoding homologous m. rosenbergii atg proteins.
we found that crustacean autophagy marker proteins contain conserved motifs typical of other animal atg proteins.
