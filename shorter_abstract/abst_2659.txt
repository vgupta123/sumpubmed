it is applied in many recent studies including population genetics, molecular genetics and pharmacogenomics.
using known as primer design tools to create primers leads to cumbersome process to inexperience users since information about snp/mutation must be acquired from public databases prior to the design.
by integrating the database for known snps , this tool facilitates the awkward process of getting flanking sequences and other related information from public snp databases.
the available web applications do not provide user-friendly graphical input interface and intuitive visualization of their primer results.
to assist scientists with collecting necessary information about target polymorphisms, this tool provides a local snp database containing over  <dig> million snps of various populations from public domain databases, namely ncbi dbsnp, hapmap and jsnp respectively.
