taken together, results suggest that the bovine  and the human  map isolates lead to anti-inflammatory and anti-invasive pathways in the macrophage environment whereas the sheep  map isolate induces a pro-inflammatory pathway.
paratuberculosis , the causative agent of johne's disease  persistently infects and survives within the host macrophages.
mdms stimulated with b <dig> up-regulated il- <dig> at the transcript level and down-regulated tnfα at the protein and transcript levels compared with stimulations by the s <dig> and hu <dig>  mdms infected with hu <dig> showed a down regulatory pattern of il- <dig> and tnfα compared to stimulations by s <dig>  cells stimulated with b <dig> and hu <dig> had low levels of matrix metalloprotease- <dig>  and high levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease- <dig>  at 96-hr pi relative to mdms stimulated by s <dig>
thus we studied strain differences in intracellular map survival and host responses in a bovine monocyte derived macrophage  system.
