helicoverpa armigera  undergoes pupal diapause, but the molecular mechanism of diapause initiation is unclear.
using suppression subtractive hybridization , we investigated differentially expressed genes in diapause- and nondiapause-destined pupal brains at diapause initiation.
we constructed two ssh libraries  to isolate genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated at diapause initiation.
finally, we classified the genes and predicted their possible roles at diapause initiation.
differentially expressed genes at pupal diapause initiation are possibly involved in the regulation of metabolism, energy, stress resistance, signaling pathways, cell cycle, transcription and translation.
we obtained  <dig> unique sequences in the f library and  <dig> unique sequences in the r library.
diapause, a state of arrested development accompanied by a marked decrease of metabolic rate, helps insects to overcome unfavorable seasons.
further, genes expression at the mrna and protein level in diapause- and nondiapause-destined pupal brains were confirmed by rt-pcr, northern blot or western blot analysis.
