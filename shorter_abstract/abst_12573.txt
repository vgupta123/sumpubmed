with a diversity of pigmented shell morphotypes governed by mendelian patterns of inheritance, the common grove snail, cepaea nemoralis, has served as a model for evolutionary biologists and population geneticists for decades.
while the c. nemoralis dataset is dominated by proteins that share little to no similarity with proteins in public databases, almost half of it shares similarity with proteins present in other molluscan shells.
surprisingly, the molecular mechanisms by which c. nemoralis generates this pigmented shelled diversity, and the degree of evolutionary conservation present between molluscan shell-forming proteomes, remain unknown.
here, using next generation sequencing and high throughput proteomics, we identify and characterize the major proteinaceous components of the c. nemoralis shell, the first shell-proteome for a pulmonate mollusc.
in addition, we could not find any indication that a protein  is directly associated with shell pigmentation in c. nemoralis.
