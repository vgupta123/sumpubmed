our data show that, underlying a unimodally distributed property, the cd <dig> level, there are subsets of naïve cd <dig> cells that vary in the time spent in the periphery receiving mhcii-mediated signals and show resultant alteration of phenotype and functionality via ros and dusp activity.
our findings also suggest the feasibility of potential pharmacological interventions for improved cd <dig> t cell responses during vaccination of older people via either anti-oxidant or dusp inhibitor small molecules.
human naïve cd4lo and cd4hi cells showed similar differences.
naïve cd <dig> t cells show unimodal distribution for many phenotypic properties, suggesting that the variation is caused by intrinsic stochasticity, although underlying variation due to subsets created by different histories of microenvironmental interactions remains possible.
