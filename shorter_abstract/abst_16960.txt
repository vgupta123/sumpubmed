we also demonstrated the ability to detect minor allele frequencies within the pooled samples that conform to predicted models.
often, sample availability is limited requiring the use of whole genome amplification .
we tested sample pooling or multiplexing strategies at different stages of the tested targeted ngs  workflow.
in our evaluation, we compared the performance of six non-amplified gdna samples from two hapmap family trios.
we did not detect any errors in the mendelian patterns of inheritance of genotypes between the parents and offspring within each trio.
the results demonstrated comparable sequence performance between non-amplified and preamplified samples and between different indexing strategies .
