between closely related species and even among multiple isolates of the same species, fa contents may be rather variable.
among the various biochemical markers, fatty acids or lipid profiles represent a chemically relatively inert class of compounds that is easy to isolate from biological material.
however, due to their extensive variation at the species level it is difficult to make predictions about the fa profile in a novel isolate.
fatty acid  profiles are considered as chemotaxonomic markers to define groups of various taxonomic ranks in flowering plants, trees and other embryophytes.
using this database we tested whether fa profiles are suitable as chemotaxonomic markers.
fa distribution patterns are suitable chemotaxonomic markers to define taxa of higher rank in algae.
the obtained fa profiles were added into a database providing information about fatty acid composition.
fa distribution patterns were found to reflect phylogenetic relationships at the level of phyla and classes.
overall  <dig> different fatty acids and  <dig> other lipophilic substances were identified and quantified.
