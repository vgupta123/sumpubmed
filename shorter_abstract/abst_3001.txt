our results demonstrated the specific epitope located in dr <dig> that plays a crucial role in antibody binding and even antineoplastic bioactivity.
using computer-guided molecular modeling method, the 3-d structure of ladr <dig> fv fragment was constructed.
according to the crystal structure of dr <dig>  the 3-d complex structure of dr <dig> and ladr <dig> was modeled using molecular docking method.
some monoclonal antibodies against dr <dig> or dr <dig> have been reported to have anti-tumor activity.
and then, three mutants of dr <dig> was expressed in prokaryotic system and purified by affinity chromatograph to determine the epitope of dr <dig> identified by ladr <dig>  which was consistent with the theoretical results of computer-aided analysis.
based on distance geometry method and intermolecular hydrogen bonding analysis, the key functional domain in dr <dig> was predicted and the dr <dig> mutants were designed.
in this study, we reported a novel mouse anti-human dr <dig> monoclonal antibody, named as ladr <dig>  which could compete with trail to bind dr <dig> and induce the apoptosis of jurkat cells in the absence of second cross-linking in vitro.
