these results provide a basis for future studies that may enable the development of a biological control not only for cots, but also other native pest or invasive starfish.

in this study, we have analysed the cots sensory organs through histological and electron microscopy.
in situ hybridisation confirmed the presence of four apors, apor <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> within cots sensory organs, however expression of these genes was not specific to the adhesive epidermis, but also within the nerve plexus of tube feet stems and within the myomesothelium.
g alpha subunit proteins were also identified in the sensory organs, and we report the spatial localisation of gαi within the tube foot and sensory tentacle.
we have identified putative cots olfactory receptors that localise to sensory organs.
tube feet and terminal sensory tentacles contain the highest proportion of apors.
such knowledge also offers avenues for potential development of novel biological control methods for pest species such as the predatory crown-of-thorns starfish , acanthaster planci which are the primary biological cause of coral cover loss in the indo-pacific.
until recently natural product chemistry was the primary investigative approach to elucidate the nature of chemical signals but advances in genomics and transcriptomics over the last decade have facilitated breakthroughs in understanding not only the chemistry but also the molecular mechanisms underpinning chemosensation in aquatic environments.
many of the identified acanthaster planci olfactory receptors  genes were found to cluster within the cots genome, indicating rapid evolution and replication from an ancestral olfactory gpcr sequence.
