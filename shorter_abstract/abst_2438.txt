the predicted protein encoded by pa <dig> contains a typical leader peptide at its amino terminus end as well as metalloendopeptidase and carbohydrate binding motifs at its amino terminus and carboxy terminus regions, respectively.
pa <dig> codes for a secreted metalloendopeptidase, which we named mep <dig>  mep <dig>  which has metalloendopeptidase and carbohydrate-binding domains, produced proteolytic and endopeptidase activities in e. coli.
an in-frame pa2783::phoa fusion encoded a hybrid protein that was exported to the periplasmic space of escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa.
in pao <dig>  the proteolytic activity of the pa2783-encoded protein was masked by other p. aeruginosa extracellular proteases but an e. coli strain carrying a pa <dig> recombinant plasmid produced considerable proteolytic activity.
the outer membrane fraction of an e. coli strain in which pa <dig> was overexpressed contained specific endopeptidase activity.
the expression of pa <dig> throughout the growth cycle of p. aeruginosa follows a unique pattern.
in the presence of camp, purified recombinant vfr  bound to a 98-bp fragment within the pa2782-pa <dig> upstream region that carries a putative vfr consensus sequence.
pseudomonas aeruginosa vfr  enhances p. aeruginosa virulence by positively regulating the expression of numerous virulence genes.
in this study, we report the detailed characterization of pa <dig> in the p. aeruginosa strain pao <dig>  rt-pcr analysis confirmed that pa2782-pa <dig> constitute an operon.
a previous microarray analysis identified numerous genes positively regulated by vfr in strain pak, including the yet uncharacterized pa <dig> and pa <dig>
vfr directly regulates the expression of the pa2782-mep <dig> operon by binding to its upstream region.
through a series of electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we localized rvfr binding to a 33-bp fragment that contains part of the vfr consensus sequence and a 5-bp imperfect  inverted repeat at its 3′ and 5′ ends .
however, unlike other vfr-targeted genes, vfr binding does not require an intact vfr consensus binding sequence.
