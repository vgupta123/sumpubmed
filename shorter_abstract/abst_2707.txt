our results provide new insights into the biogeography of the mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, and contribute important findings relevant to the systematics and evolution of this speciose lizard genus.
only one or two ndna groups were identified within each main island .
the posterior mean divergence time for the corsican and sardinian lineages was  <dig>  ma ago .
the results support the evolutionary distinctiveness of corsican and sardinian populations and also indicate a lack of post-divergence migration despite periods of contact being possible.
podarcis tiliguerta is a wall lizard endemic to the mediterranean islands of corsica and sardinia.
here, we analysed mitochondrial and nuclear markers  in p. tiliguerta sampled from thirty-two localities across corsica and sardinia.
we find much greater intraspecific genetic divergence than between sister species of other mediterranean island podarcis, i.e., between p. lilfordi and p. pityusensis.
