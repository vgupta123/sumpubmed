finally, the estimates of the number of true null hypotheses under various dependence conditions are variable.
our simulation set-up allows for a structural study of the effect of dependencies on multiple testing criterions and is useful for testing a potentially new method on Ï€ <dig> or fdr estimation in a dependency context.
recent simulation studies consider only simple correlation structures among variables, which is hardly inspired by real data features.
we discuss a new method for efficient guided simulation of dependent data, which satisfy imposed network constraints as conditional independence structures.
our simulation study shows that methods such as sam and the q-value do not adequately control the fdr to the level claimed under dependence conditions.
our aim is to systematically study effects of several network features like sparsity and correlation strength by imposing dependence structures among variables using random correlation matrices.
we consider effects of dependence among variables of high-dimensional data in multiple hypothesis testing problems, in particular the false discovery rate  control procedures.
