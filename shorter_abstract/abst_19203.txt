p <dig> is a transcription factor that plays an important role in skin epidermal development and differentiation.
we included an additional step in the chip procedure to enrich for Δnp <dig> targets by screening the library of immunoprecipitated dna for its ability to bind recombinant gst-Δnp <dig>  cloning of Δnp63-chip-derived dna fragments identified more than  <dig> potential Δnp <dig> target loci that were located close to or embedded within known or predicted genes.
identity of these target genes suggests that they may participate in a myriad of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, signaling and metabolism.
finally we show that the expression of many of these target genes is altered when Δnp <dig> levels in keratinocytes are reduced by sirna, further confirming that these are bona fide targets.
both the ta and Δn transcripts are also alternatively spliced at the 3' end producing proteins with unique c-termini that are designated as α, β and γ isoforms.
to better elucidate the biological role of p <dig> in regulating gene expression in keratinocytes we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments with Δnp63-specific antibodies.
