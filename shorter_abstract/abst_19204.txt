the scfvh <dig> generated by this method is the first human antibody which is able to detect ycd in routinary laboratory techniques without interfering with its enzymatic function.
the selection and characterization of a human monoclonal antibody in single chain fragment  format represents a powerful reagent to allow in in vitro and in vivo detection of cd expression in gdept/adept studies.
the ability of cytosine deaminase  to convert the antifungal agent 5-fluorocytosine  into one of the most potent and largely used anticancer compound such as 5-fluorouracil  raised considerable interest in this enzyme to model gene or antibody â€“ directed enzyme-prodrug therapy  aiming to improve the therapeutic ratio  of cancer chemotherapy.
several scfvs were isolated and specificity towards ycd was confirmed by western blot and elisa.
the construction of libraries of recombinant antibody fragments that are displayed on the surface of filamentous phage, and the selection of phage antibodies against target antigens, have become an important biotechnological tool in generating new monoclonal antibodies for research and clinical applications.
