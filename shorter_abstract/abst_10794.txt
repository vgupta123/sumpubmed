functional sites are predicted using six different methods .
the resultant phylogenetic trees always contain six major subfamilies are consistent with the functional diversity across the family.
the results presented herein clearly establish the viability of sequence-based bioinformatic strategies to provide functional insight within the nss family.
moreover, in well-represented subfamilies, phylogenetic clustering recapitulates several nuanced functional distinctions.
within the recently solved leutaa structure is used to assess the quality of the predictions, most of which are predicted by the bioinformatic methods.
consequently, sequence-based methods represent an important alternative to illuminate functional roles.
first, can phylogenomic methods accurately describe the functional diversity across a membrane integral protein family?
interestingly, the various prediction schemes provide results that are predominantly orthogonal to each other.
however, when the methods do provide overlapping results, specificity is shown to increase dramatically .
furthermore, the collective set of functional site predictions qualitatively clusters along the proposed transport pathway, further demonstrating their utility.
unfortunately, despite several recent technological advances, structural coverage of membrane integral proteins continues to be sparse.
efforts to predict functional sites from globular proteins is increasingly common; however, the most successful of these methods generally require structural insight.
and second, can sequence-based strategies accurately predict key functional sites?
a canonical set of  <dig> functional sites identified by yamashita et al.
in this report, we critically examine the ability of several computational methods to provide functional insight within two specific areas.
