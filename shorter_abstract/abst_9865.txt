then, manual curation was performed based on a collective knowledge base and a combination of genomic, biochemical, and physiological information.
the model predictions under these growth conditions were consistent with the experimental results.
we validated iak <dig> by conducting fermentation experiments and simulating the model under autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic growth conditions using cobra toolbox.

additionally, the metabolic states of iak <dig> during autotrophic and mixotrophic growths were described by phenotypic phase plane  analysis.
this study proposes the first genome-scale model of s. platensis c <dig>  iak <dig>  which is a predictive metabolic platform for a global understanding of physiological behaviors and metabolic engineering.
in this work, we present the genome-scale metabolic network analysis of s. platensis c <dig>  iak <dig>  its topological properties, and its metabolic capabilities and functions.
this platform could accelerate the integrative analysis of various “-omics” data, leading to strain improvement towards a diverse range of desired industrial products from spirulina.
the iak <dig> model was further used to predict the unique active reactions and essential genes for each growth condition.
the genome-scale metabolic model consists of  <dig> genes,  <dig> metabolites, and  <dig> reactions.
however, the overall description of the metabolic and biotechnological capabilities of s. platensis requires the development of a whole cellular metabolism model.
recently, the s. platensis c <dig>  genome sequence has become available, allowing systems-level studies of this commercial cyanobacterium.
the network was reconstructed from the s. platensis c <dig> annotated genomic sequence using pathway tools software to generate a preliminary network.
