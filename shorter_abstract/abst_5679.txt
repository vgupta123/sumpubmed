more importantly, there are more similarities in embryonic transcriptomes between bovine and humans than between humans and mice, demonstrating that bovine embryos are better models for human embryonic development.
a total of  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed among different stages, of which the largest change was observed between the 4- and 8-cell stages, demonstrating that the bovine embryonic genome is activated at this transition.
during mammalian pre-implantation embryonic development dramatic and orchestrated changes occur in gene transcription.
their vast association with other embryonic genes suggests that they may have important regulatory roles in embryo development; yet, the majority of the hub genes are relatively unknown/under-studied in embryos.
we also conducted the first comparison of embryonic expression profiles across three mammalian species, human, mouse and bovine, for which rna-seq data are available.
here we report comprehensive transcriptome dynamics of single matured bovine oocytes and pre-implantation embryos developed in vivo.
this study provides a comprehensive examination of gene activities in bovine embryos and identified little-known potential master regulators of pre-implantation development.

despite the similarity in the total numbers of genes expressed across stages, the nature of the expressed genes is dramatically different.
we found that the three species share more maternally deposited genes than embryonic genome activated genes.
using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we found  <dig> stage-specific modules of co-expressed genes that can be used to represent the corresponding stage of development.
