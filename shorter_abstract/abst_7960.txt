for qsar modeling, multiple linear regression  model was engendered using best four energy-based descriptors yielding correlation values r/q <dig> of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig> .
to validate the performance of qsar models, external cross-validation procedure was adopted which accomplished high training/testing correlation values  in the range of  <dig> - <dig> / <dig> - <dig> .
in view of its importance, the development and prediction of potent inhibitors against dhdps may be valuable to design effective drugs against bacteria, in general.
this paper describes a methodology for predicting novel/potent inhibitors against dhdps.
to serve the experimentalist to develop novel/potent inhibitors, a webserver "kidoq" has been developed http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/kidoq, which allows the prediction of ki value of a new ligand molecule against dhdps.
our results suggests that ligand-receptor binding interactions for dhdps employing qsar modeling seems to be a promising approach for prediction of antibacterial agents.
one of the essential enzymes of this pathway is dihydrodipicolinate synthase , considered to be crucial for the bacterial survival.
here, quantitative structure activity relationship  models were trained and tested on experimentally verified  <dig> enzyme's inhibitors having inhibitory value  in the range of  <dig> - <dig>  these inhibitors were docked at the active site of dhdps  using autodock software, which resulted in  <dig> energy-based descriptors.
