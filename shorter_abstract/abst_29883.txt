analysis of genomic and epigenetic features of hkgs and tegs reveals that the high expression of hkgs across different tissues is associated with decreased nucleosome occupancy at the transcription start site as indicated by enhanced dnase hypersensitivity.
we have compiled a set of high quality hkgs that should provide higher and more consistent expression when used as references in laboratory experiments than currently used hkgs.
cross-species comparison shows that both the functions and expression patterns of hkgs are conserved.
histone methylation patterns differ significantly between hkgs and tegs, suggesting that methylation contributes to the differential expression patterns as well.
in addition, our results identify chromatin structure and epigenetic features of hkgs and tegs that are likely to play an important role in regulating their strikingly different expression patterns.
here, we generate gene expression profiles of  <dig> normal human tissues on custom high-density microarrays to systematically identify  <dig>  hkgs and  <dig> tegs and compile a small subset of  <dig> housekeeping genes which are highly expressed in all tissues with lower variance than many commonly used hkgs.
additionally, we systematically and quantitatively demonstrated that the cpg islands' enrichment in hkgs transcription start sites  and their depletion in tegs tss.
the comparison of genomic features between hkgs and tegs shows that hkgs are more conserved than tegs in terms of functions, expression pattern and polymorphisms.
housekeeping genes  are constitutively expressed in all tissues while tissue-enriched genes  are expressed at a much higher level in a single tissue type than in others.
tegs are enriched with respect to both segmental duplication and copy number variation, while no such enrichment is observed for hkgs, suggesting the high expression of hkgs are not due to high copy numbers.
