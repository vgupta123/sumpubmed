the ribosomal promoter region rrna-p <dig> was validated as referential product under the stress conditions checked by qrt-pcr.
in this work, we have quantified transcriptional responses to stress suggesting that, the opportunistic pathogen m. fortuitum is more resistant and differs in behaviour in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, when compared to the major pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis and the saprophyte mycobacterium smegmatis.
in this work, we investigate the effects of hydrogen peroxide on the transcription and expression of these genes by developing a real time quantitative pcr technique  using the ribosomal promoter region  as reference product for quantification of the mrna levels.
besides, we demonstrate the mycobacterial non-coding region rrna-p <dig> to be a suitable reference product in the analysis of qrt-pcr transcriptional data of m. fortuitum.
m. fortuitum cultures were treated with different hydrogen peroxide concentrations  during several periods of time .
minor changes were observed under the conditions tested except when bacteria were incubated in the presence of  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide.
mycobacterium fortuitum is a bacteria that contains genes involved in the detoxification of the oxygen reactive species such as those produced by the host during the infection.
