streptococcus uberis, a gram positive bacterial pathogen responsible for a significant proportion of bovine mastitis in commercial dairy herds, colonises multiple body sites of the cow including the gut, genital tract and mammary gland.
comparisons with related pyogenic streptococci identified a conserved core  of orthologous cdss.
the genome revealed  <dig>  predicted coding sequences  of which  <dig> were identified as pseudogenes or gene fragments.
intriguingly, s. uberis 0140j displayed a lower number of mobile genetic elements when compared with other pyogenic streptococci, however bacteriophage-derived islands and a putative genomic island were identified.
s. uberis utilises nutritional flexibility derived from a diversity of metabolic options to successfully occupy a discrete ecological niche.
comparative analysis of the complete genome sequence of s. uberis strain 0140j was undertaken to help elucidate the biology of this effective bovine pathogen.
the features observed in s. uberis are strongly suggestive of an opportunistic pathogen adapted to challenging and changing environmental parameters.
