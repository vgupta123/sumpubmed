in our study, we built the svm-based porcine pre-mirnas classifier with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of  <dig> % and a total prediction accuracy of  <dig> %, respectively.
we identified the porcine pre-mirna in genome-wide through computational approaches by utilizing the data sets of pigs and set up the porcine pre-mirnas library which may provide us a global scanning on the pre-mirnas of pigs in genome level and would benefit subsequent experimental research on porcine mirna functional and expression analysis.
here, we adopted computational approaches including support vector machine  and homology searching to make a global scanning on the pre-mirnas of pigs.
moreover,  <dig> novel porcine pre-mirna candidates were found by using svm-based pre-mirnas classifier.
besides,  <dig> porcine pre-mirna candidates were detected by homology searching.
