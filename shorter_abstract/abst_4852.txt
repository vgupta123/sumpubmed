in addition, we found that atp, which is required for mcm4/6/ <dig> activity, shifts the equilibrium towards larger oligomers, likely hexamers of mcm4/6/ <dig>  atpÎ³s and to a lesser extent adp also shift the equilibrium towards hexamers.
the functional significance of the different mcm4/6/ <dig> oligomeric states has not been assessed.
study of mcm4/6/ <dig> complexes containing mutations that interfere with the formation of inter-subunit atp sites  indicates that full activity of mcm4/6/ <dig> requires all of its atp sites, which are formed in a hexamer and not a trimer.
the results of such an assessment would have implications for studies of both mcm4/6/ <dig> and mcm2- <dig>
here, we show that saccharomyces cerevisiae mcm4/6/ <dig> reconstituted from individual subunits exists in an equilibrium of oligomeric forms in which smaller oligomers predominate in the absence of atp.
minichromosome maintenance proteins   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are related by sequence and form a variety of complexes that unwind dna, including mcm4/6/ <dig>  a mcm4/6/ <dig> trimer forms one half of the mcm2- <dig> hexameric ring and can be thought of as the catalytic core of mcm2- <dig>  the replicative helicase in eukaryotic cells.
