variants within a known haplotype block for cat lca and specific candidate genes for both phenotypes were prioritized by the predicted variant effect on the proteins and concordant segregation within the trio.
persian cats are models for leber’s congenital amaurosis , the most severe and earliest onset form of visual impairment in humans.
the efficiency of wgs of a single trio of domestic cats was evaluated.
a sub-set of cats was genotyped for the hes <dig> variant, supporting the variant as private to the japanese bobtail breed.
the reduced cost and improved efficiency of whole genome sequencing  is drastically improving the development of cats as biomedical models.
cats with innocuous breed-defining traits, such as a bobbed tail, can also be models for somite segmentation and vertebral column development.
the hes <dig> variant should further calibrate the somite segmentation clock.
a stop gain was identified at position c.577c > t in cat aipl <dig>  a predicted p.arg193*.
the cat aipl <dig> variant would have been considered a high priority variant for evaluation, regardless of a priori knowledge from previous genetic studies.
this study represents the first effort of the  <dig> lives cat genome sequencing initiative to identify disease - causing variants in the domestic cat using wgs.

however, as the feline variant database improves, development of cats as biomedical models for human disease will be more efficient, providing an alternative, large animal model for drug and gene therapy trials.
undiagnosed human patients with early-onset blindness should be screened for this aipl <dig> variant.
the current cat reference assembly is efficient for gene and variant identification.
over  <dig> cats from  <dig> different breeds and populations were genotyped for the aipl <dig> variant, defining an allelic frequency in only persian –related breeds of  <dig>  %.
