however, it is still difficult to identify the correct docking complex structure within top ranks among alternative conformations.
many important cellular processes are carried out by protein complexes.
benchmark results on bound and unbound cases show that pi-lzerd consistently improves the docking prediction accuracy as compared with docking without using binding site prediction or using the binding site prediction as post-filtering.
pi-lzerd consistently showed better prediction accuracy over alternative methods in the series of benchmark experiments including docking using actual docking interface site predictions as well as unbound docking cases.
since the accuracy of protein binding site prediction varies depending on cases, the challenge is to develop a method which does not deteriorate but improves docking results by using a binding site prediction which may not be 100% accurate.
we present a novel protein docking algorithm that utilizes imperfect protein-protein binding interface prediction for guiding protein docking.
