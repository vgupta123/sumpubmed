we have previously adapted this technology to generate, directly from fosmid-based genomic clones, fusion gene reporter constructs designed to investigate gene expression patterns in c. elegans.
gene expression patterns for three genes located on the same genomic clone were investigated via a set of fosmid-based reporter constructs generated with the modified protocol.
utilizing this resource we generated single-, double- and triple-tagged fosmid-based reporters to investigate expression patterns of three c. elegans genes located on a single genomic clone.
these latter constructs are used in pairs the first member of which provides a template for pcr-amplification of an rt-cassette while the second provides, as an excised restriction fragment, the desired fluorescent protein reporter sequence.
furthermore, use of a restriction fragment minimizes artefacts negating the need for final clone sequencing.
we describe the generation and application of a resource designed to facilitate counter-selection recombineering of fosmid-based c. elegans genomic clones.
in our adaptation a rpsl-tet positive/negative-selection cassette  is first inserted and then, under negative selection, seamlessly replaced with the desired sequence.
as the rt-cassette is flanked by approximately  <dig> bp from the ends of the reporter sequence the subsequent negative selection replacement step is highly efficient.
