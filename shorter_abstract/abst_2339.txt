the majority of ripening-associated fruit starch hydrolysis, colour change and softening occurs in the apparent absence of ethylene production  whilst phase  <dig> ripening requires autocatalytic ethylene production and is associated with further softening and an increase in aroma volatiles.
as the fruit progressed through phase  <dig> ripening, the fruit became less responsive to ethylene and endogeneous ethylene production was partially repressed.
transient over-expression of sep4/rin in kiwifruit caused an increase in ethylene production.
as fruit progressed through maturation and phase  <dig> ripening, fruit were treated with different concentrations of propylene and ethylene.
these results suggest that the non-ethylene/ethylene ripening response observed in kiwifruit is a hybrid of both the tomato and grape ripening progression, with phase  <dig> being akin to the rin/ethylene inhibitory response observed in grape and phase  <dig> akin to the rin-associated autocatalytic ethylene response observed in tomato.
the ability to respond to ethylene however coincided with a change in expression of another mads-box gene sepallata4/ripening inhibitor-like .
the promoter of sep4/rin was shown to be transactivated by ein3-like transcription factors, but unlike tomato, not by sep4/rin itself.
at the start of phase  <dig> ripening, treated fruit responded to ethylene, and were capable of producing endogenous ethylene.
to dissect the ripening response in the yellow-fleshed kiwifruit a. chinensis , a two dimensional developmental stage x ethylene response time study was undertaken.
