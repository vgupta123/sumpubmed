each hr was characterized by the presence of  <dig> to  <dig> clustered imperfect palindromes which are similar to previously described palindromes of tortricid-specific gvs.
this study, along with previous characterization of epapgv infection, is useful for the better understanding of the pathology caused by this virus and its potential utilization as a bioinsecticide.
of these,  <dig> found no homologues in genbank, and one encoded a thymidylate kinase.
phylogenetic study performed with  <dig> core genes of  <dig> baculoviral genomes suggests that epapgv is the baculovirus isolate closest to the putative common ancestor of tortricid specific betabaculoviruses.
analysis of nucleotide sequence repeats revealed the presence of  <dig> homologous regions  interspersed throughout the genome.
also, one of the hrs  has flanking sequences suggestive of a putative non-hr ori.
