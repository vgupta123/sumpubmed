the complexity and diversity of environmental samples such as the human gut microflora, combined with the sustained exponential growth in sequencing capacity, has led to the challenge of identifying microbial organisms by dna sequence.
smart is the first scalable, efficient, and rapid metagenomics classification algorithm capable of matching against all the species and sequences present in the ncbi genbank and allows for a single step classification of microorganisms as well as large plant, mammalian, or invertebrate genomes from which the metagenomic sample may have been derived.
we sought to validate a scalable metagenomics alignment research tool , a novel searching heuristic for shotgun metagenomics sequencing results.
we demonstrated the application of this technique applied to conjunctival and gut microbiome metagenomics sequencing results.
next generation sequencing technology has enabled characterization of metagenomics through massively parallel genomic dna sequencing.
after retrieving all genomic dna sequences from the ncbi genbank, over  <dig> ×  <dig> base pairs of  <dig>  ×  <dig> sequences from  <dig>  ×  <dig> species were indexed using  <dig> base pair hashtable shards.
in addition, a one base pair permutation algorithm was used to account for single nucleotide polymorphisms and sequencing errors.
with permutation matching, we achieved sensitivity greater than 83 % and precision greater than 94 % with simulated datasets at the species classification level.
in our head to head comparison, smart and clark had similar accuracy gains over kraken at the species classification level, but smart required approximately half the amount of ram of clark.
