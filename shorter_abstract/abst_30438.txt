in present study, we employed a genetic algorithm-based boolean model to represent nf-Îºb signaling pathway.
thus, a systematic approach to integrate experimental data and qualitative knowledge to identify the physiological consequences of environmental stimuli is needed.
signal transduction is the major mechanism through which cells transmit external stimuli to evoke intracellular biochemical responses.
we designed an effective algorithm to elucidate the process of immune response using comprehensive knowledge about network structure and limited experimental data on dynamic responses.
understanding relationship between external stimuli and corresponding cellular responses, as well as the subsequent effects on downstream genes, is a major challenge in systems biology.
