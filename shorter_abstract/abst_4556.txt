they are typically encoded by gene families with a small number of gene copies whose evolutionary origin has been poorly investigated.
bac clone and genome sequence analyses showed that the soybean genome contains two pgip loci.
the analyzed homeologous soybean genomic regions  that include the pgip loci are strongly conserved and this conservation extends also to the genomes of the legume species phaseolus vulgaris l., medicago truncatula gaertn.
the paleopolyploid soybean genome contains two pgip loci comprised in large and highly conserved duplicated regions, which are also conserved in bean, m. truncatula and c. arietinum.
the genomic features of these legume pgip families suggest that the forces driving the evolution of pgip genes follow the birth-and-death model, similar to that proposed for the evolution of resistance  genes of nbs-lrr-type.
each locus is composed of three clustered genes that are induced following infection with the fungal pathogen sclerotinia sclerotiorum  de bary, and remnant sequences of pgip genes.
and cicer arietinum l., each containing a single pgip locus.
here we report the complete characterization of the full complement of the pgip family in soybean  and the characterization of the genomic region surrounding the pgip family in four legume species.
maximum likelihood-based gene trees suggest that the genes within the pgip clusters have independently undergone tandem duplication in each species.
