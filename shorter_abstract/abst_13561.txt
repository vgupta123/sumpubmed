ct images of the craniocervical junction were prospectively obtained in  <dig> dogs and our method of osic analysis was applied in all dogs.
a new method for determination of optimal implant placement is provided.
canine ventral atlantoaxial  stabilization is most commonly performed in very small dogs and is technically challenging due to extremely narrow bone corridors.
for each dog,  <dig> optimal implant sites were simulated via geometrical simplification of the bone corridors.
each implant 3d position was then defined with respect to anatomical axes using  <dig> projected angles .
the landmarks simulating anatomical axes were also positioned  <dig> times to determine their effect on proja reproducibility.
semi-automated calculation of optimal implant 3d positions could be further developed to facilitate preoperative planning and to generate large descriptive anatomical datasets.
the safety margins around each implant were also estimated with angles  measured in  <dig> orthogonal directions.
the 95Â % tolerance interval comparing proja obtained with  <dig> different sets of anatomical axis landmarks was  which was considered appropriate for clinical use.
there was excellent agreement between the calculated and measured values for both proja  and safa .
