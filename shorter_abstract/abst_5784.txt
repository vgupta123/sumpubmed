conversely for two prostate growth control genes, androgen receptor  and vascular endothelial growth factor , known to be transcriptionally regulated by wt <dig>  regulatory sequence conservation was observed and tf binding in vivo was confirmed by chip.
we and others have identified the presence of several zinc finger transcription factors in the neoplastic prostate, suggesting a potential role for these genes in the regulation of the prostate cancer transcriptome.
one of the transcription factors  identified in the prostate cancer epithelial cells was the wilms tumor gene .
overall, this targeted approach rapidly identified important candidate wt1-binding elements in genes coordinately expressed with wt <dig> in prostate cancer cells, thus enabling a more focused functional analysis of the most likely target genes in prostate cancer progression.
to test the relationship between sequence conservation and function, chromatin of lncap prostate cancer and kidney  <dig> cells were tested for tf binding using chromatin immunoprecipitation .
gene expression analyses have led to a better understanding of growth control of prostate cancer cells.
to rapidly identify coordinately expressed prostate cancer growth control genes that may be regulated by wt <dig>  we used an in silico approach.
identifying these genes will help to better understand how gene regulation is altered in these tumor cells.
multiple putative tfbs in gene promoters of placental mammals were found to be shared with those in human gene promoters and some were conserved between genomes that diverged about  <dig> million years ago , therefore implicating these sites as candidate binding sites.
evolutionary conserved transcription factor binding sites  recognized by wt <dig>  egr <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig>  ap <dig> and gata <dig> were identified in the promoters of  <dig> differentially expressed prostate cancer genes from eight mammalian species.
