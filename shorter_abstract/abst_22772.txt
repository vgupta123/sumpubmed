designing small-molecule kinase inhibitors with desirable selectivity profiles is a major challenge in drug discovery.
a series of chemical modifications are usually required before a compound exhibits an acceptable selectivity profile.
rationalizing the selectivity profile for a small-molecule inhibitor in terms of the specificity-determining kinase residues for that molecule can be an important step toward the goal of developing selective kinase inhibitors.
here we describe s-filter, a method that combines sequence and structural information to predict specificity-determining residues for a small molecule and its kinase selectivity profile.
s-filter is a valuable tool for analyzing kinase selectivity profiles.
the method identifies potential specificity determinants that are not readily apparent, and provokes further investigation at the structural level.
s-filter correctly predicts specificity determinants that were described by independent groups.
analysis was performed on seven selective kinase inhibitors where a structural basis for selectivity is known.
