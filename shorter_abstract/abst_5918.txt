allergic contact dermatitis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects a significant proportion of the population.
by analyzing the transcriptome of the human cell line mutz- <dig> after  <dig> h stimulation, using  <dig> different sensitizing chemicals,  <dig> non-sensitizing chemicals and vehicle controls, we have identified a biomarker signature of  <dig> genes with potent discriminatory ability.
using a support vector machine for supervised classification, the prediction performance of the assay revealed an area under the roc curve of  <dig> .
the aim is to replace animal experiments with in vitro tests displaying a higher predictive power.
this simple and robust cell-based assay has the potential to completely replace or drastically reduce the utilization of test systems based on experimental animals.
current test of sensitizing chemicals rely on animal experimentation.
in addition, categorizing the chemicals according to the llna assay, this gene signature could also predict sensitizing potency.
a gene signature predicting sensitization, using a human cell line in vitro, has been identified.
