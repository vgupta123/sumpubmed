certain transcript isoforms characterizing these processes are potential targets for breeding for drought tolerance.
the chip data confirmed 79% of the tag-based results, whereas rt-pcr confirmed the supersage data in all cases.
it demonstrates that – inter alias – signal transduction, transcription regulation, osmolyte accumulation, and ros scavenging undergo strong transcriptional remodelling in chickpea roots already  <dig> h after drought stress.
further, supersage tags may be immediately used to produce microarrays and probes for real-time-pcr, thereby overcoming the lack of genomic tools in non-model organisms.
supersage, an improved version of the serial analysis of gene expression  technique, generating genome-wide, high-quality transcription profiles from any eukaryote, has been employed in the present study.
to this end, we sequenced  <dig>   <dig> bp tags representing  <dig>  unique transcripts  from drought-stressed and non-stressed control roots.
we applied supersage to the analysis of gene expression in chickpea roots in response to drought.
their large size enabled the unambiguous annotation of  <dig>   unitags to genes or proteins in public data bases and thus to stress-response processes.
improving drought tolerance is therefore of outmost importance for breeding.
drought is the major constraint to increase yield in chickpea .
