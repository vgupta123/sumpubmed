users can import default array specifications, import probe sequences for a default array specification, design and import a custom array specification, export any array specification to multiple output formats, export the probe sequences for any array specification and browse high-level information about the microarray, such as version and number of probes.
the initial release of arrayinitiative supports the affymetrix 3' ivt expression arrays we currently analyze, but as an open source application, we hope that others will contribute modules for other platforms.
arrayinitiative is a standalone, cross-platform, rich client desktop application for creating correctly formatted, custom versions of manufacturer-provided  array specifications, requiring only minimal knowledge of the array specification rules and file formats.
there are several bioinformatics approaches to improve probe assignments, but without in-house programming expertise, standardizing these custom array specifications as a usable file  is difficult, owing mostly to the complexity of the specification file format.
the need to test combinations of probe assignments and analysis algorithms led us to develop arrayinitiative, a tool for creating and managing custom array specifications.
since the custom array specifications are easily exported to the manufacturer's standard format, researchers can analyze these customized microarray experiments using established software tools, such as those available in bioconductor.
arrayinitiative allows researchers to create new array specifications, in a standard format, based upon their own requirements.
