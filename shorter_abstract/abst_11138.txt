the objective of this study was to compare a triple ligature for mesenteric vessels composed of three sliding knots with a triple ligature composed of a modified transfixing and two surgeon’s knots.
portions of jejunum with associated mesenteric vessels were collected from  <dig> horses at a local abattoir.
ligation of mesenteric arteries was significantly faster to perform with sliding knots than with surgeon’s knots, both with monofilament and multifilament suture material.
with multifilament suture material, the leaking pressure of sliding knot ligatures was significantly higher than that of surgeon’s knot ligatures.
both ligating methods were stronger with monofilament suture material than with multifilament suture material.
regardless of the ligature used, monofilament suture material performed better than multifilament suture material to achieve hemostatic knots.
both groups were divided ino two subgroups depending on suture material used .
independently of the suture material, the sliding knot is comparable or better than the surgeon’s knot in providing hemostasis, and is faster to perform.
with monofilament suture, there were no statistically significant differences in leaking pressure between ligature methods.
in group a, a surgeon’s knot was used to tie the ligatures  while in group b all ligatures  were tied with a parallel alternating sliding knot.
in literature only one article describes and compares methods of achieving hemostasis in equine mesenteric arteries during jejunal resection and anastomosis, and most textbooks favor ligating-dividing mechanical devices.
these were divided into  <dig> specimens containing five mesenteric arteries each.
after closure, arteries were cannulated and intraluminal pressures were increased until ligature failure.
each artery was closed with a triple ligature.
