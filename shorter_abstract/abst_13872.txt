some defense proteins such as beta-glucosidase aggregating factor were strongly down regulated and may be regulated directly by opaque <dig>  the mutant also had altered expression of a number of starch biosynthesis genes and this was associated with a more highly crystalline starch.
in this study, we combined transcript profiling and proteomic analysis to better understand which genes and proteins are altered by opaque <dig> in the w64a inbred line.
the results of these studies revealed specific target genes that can be investigated to further improve nutritional quality and agronomic performance of high lysine maize lines, particularly those based on the presence of the opaque <dig> mutation.
the opaque <dig> mutant is valuable for producing maize varieties with enhanced nutritional value.
these analyses showed that the accumulation of some lysine-rich proteins, such as sorbitol dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was increased in mature kernels and may contribute substantially to the lysine content of opaque <dig> endosperm.
given the importance of improving nutritional quality in grain crops, a better understanding of the physiological basis for these traits is necessary.
