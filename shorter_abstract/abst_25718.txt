in the present study, we evaluate several descriptive statistics that can be used to optimize the scoring of the aflp analysis, and we describe a new statistic, the information content per bin  that represents a valuable estimator during the optimization process.
although justified in this context, the use of automated scoring procedures may result in technical biases that weaken the power and reliability of further analyses.
rawgeno was implemented in an r cran package  and can be found at .
to our knowledge, rawgeno is the only freely available public-domain software for fully automated aflp scoring, from electropherogram files to user-defined working binary matrices.
our algorithm appears to perform as well as a commercial program in automating aflp scoring, at least in the context of population genetics or phylogeographic studies.
using a new scoring algorithm, rawgeno, we show that scoring errors – in particular "bin oversplitting"  and "technical homoplasy"  – induce a loss of discriminatory power, decrease the robustness of results and, in extreme cases, introduce erroneous information in genetic structure analyses.
indeed, although a reasonable amount of flexibility is allowed during the optimization of the scoring procedure without causing considerable changes in the detection of genetic structure patterns, notable discrepancies are observed when estimating genetic diversities from differently scored datasets.
