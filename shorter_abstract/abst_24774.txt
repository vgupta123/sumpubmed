recent advancements in interactive web technologies require us to rethink the standard submit-and-wait paradigm, and craft bioinformatics web applications that share analytical and interactive power with their desktop relatives, while retaining simplicity and availability.
we have developed dictyexpress, a web application that features a graphical, highly interactive explorative interface to our database that consists of more than  <dig> dictyostelium discoideum gene expression experiments.
most importantly, these tasks are achieved through web applications whose components are seamlessly interlinked and immediately respond to events triggered by the user, thus providing a powerful explorative data analysis environment.
