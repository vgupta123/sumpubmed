ha is a membrane bound homotrimer in the influenza virus envelope, and the purified rha protein assembles into higher order rosette structures in the final formulation of the vaccine.
the five cysteine residues in the transmembrane  and cytoplasmic  domains of the rha protein from the h <dig> a/perth/16/ <dig> human influenza strain have been substituted to alanine and/or serine residues to produce three different site directed variants .
the strategy of substituting tm and ct cysteines to prevent potency loss has been successfully applied to another h <dig> rha protein  further demonstrating the utility of the approach.
modification of these cysteine residues prevents disulfide bond cross-linking in the tm and ct, and the resulting rha maintains potency for at least 12 months at 25°c.
during purification and storage of the rha, disulfide mediated cross-linking of the trimers within the rosette occurs and results in reduced potency.
these sdvs have been evaluated to determine the impact of the tm and ct cysteines on potency, cross-linking, and the biochemical and biophysical properties of the rha.
