homologs of this gene, all defined as "coding for hypothetical proteins" in public databases, were exclusively found in ascomycetous fungi and in plants.
bioinformatics tools, phylogenetic analysis and expression studies were used to support the hypothesis that this sequence, named tbdhn <dig>  is the first dehydrin -like coding gene isolated in fungi.
expression studies provide experimental evidence of a transcript induction of tbdhn <dig> during cellular dehydration.
expression pattern and sequence similarities to known plant dhns indicate that tbdhn <dig> is the first characterized dhn-like protein in fungi.
although complete  fungal genomes and est collections of some basidiomycota and glomeromycota are already available, dhn-like proteins appear to be represented only in ascomycota.
the expressed sequence tag m6g <dig> was originally isolated from a screening for differentially expressed transcripts during the reproductive stage of the white truffle tuber borchii.
the high similarity of tbdhn <dig> with homolog coding sequences implies the existence of a novel fungal/plant group of lea class ii proteins characterized by a previously undescribed signature pattern.
a new and previously uncharacterized conserved signature pattern was identified and proposed to uniprot database as the main distinguishing feature of this new group of dhns.
