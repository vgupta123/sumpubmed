lastly, map construction techniques presented here points the way to new types of comparative genome analysis that would focus on discernment of structural differences revealed by optical maps constructed from a broad range of rice subspecies and varieties.
although the rice genome is sequenced, validation and gap closing efforts require purely independent means for accurate finishing of sequence build data.
to facilitate ongoing sequencing finishing and validation efforts, we have constructed a whole-genome swai optical restriction map of the rice genome.
the physical map consists of  <dig> contigs, covering  <dig> chromosomes, with a total genome size of  <dig>  mb; this value is about 11% smaller than original estimates.
alignments between optical and in silico restriction maps constructed from irgsp  and tigr  genome sequence sources are comprehensive and informative, evidenced by map coverage across virtually all published gaps, discovery of new ones, and characterization of sequence misassemblies; all totalling ~ <dig> mb.
rice feeds much of the world, and possesses the simplest genome analyzed to date within the grass family, making it an economically relevant model system for other cereal crops.
furthermore, since optical maps are ordered restriction maps, identified discordances are pinpointed on a reliable physical scaffold providing an independent resource for closure of gaps and rectification of misassemblies.
given this conclusion we envision new applications of such single molecule analysis that will merge advantages offered by high-resolution optical maps with inexpensive, but short sequence reads generated by emerging sequencing platforms.
