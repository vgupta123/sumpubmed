as sfm is a free web-application, the user does not need to install any software or databases.
these are usually located in the untranslated regions  of mrna sequences, particularly the 3′utrs.
gene expression in vertebrate cells may be controlled post-transcriptionally through regulatory elements in mrnas.
scan for motifs  simplifies the process of identifying a wide range of regulatory elements on alignments of vertebrate 3′utrs.
the regulatory elements may be filtered by expected value cutoffs and are cross-referenced back to their respective sources and literature.
the output is an interactive graphical representation, highlighting potential regulatory elements and overlaps between them.
visualisation of the binding sites of different classes of effectors that bind to 3′utrs will facilitate the study of regulatory elements in 3′ utrs.
