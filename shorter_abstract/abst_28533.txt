melting  <dig>  is a direct update of version  <dig> , integrating newly available thermodynamic parameters for inosine, a modified adenine base with an universal base capacity, and incorporates a correction for magnesium.
it incorporates all the thermodynamic parameters and corrections provided in melting  <dig> x and introduces a large set of thermodynamic formulae and parameters, to facilitate the calculation of melting temperatures for perfectly matching sequences, mismatches, bulge loops, cng repeats, dangling ends, inosines, locked nucleic acids, 2-hydroxyadenines and azobenzenes.
melting is a free open source software which computes the enthalpy, entropy and melting temperature of nucleic acids.
it also includes temperature corrections for monovalent ions , magnesium ions and commonly used denaturing agents such as formamide and dmso.
melting  <dig> is a complete reimplementation which allows much greater flexibility and extensibility.
the program can use either an approximative approach or a more accurate nearest-neighbor approach.
two new versions of the melting software have been released.
melting is a useful and very flexible tool for predicting melting temperatures using approximative formulae or nearest-neighbor approaches, where one can select different sets of nearest-neighbor parameters, corrections and formulae.
