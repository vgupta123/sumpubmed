the multiscale nature of our model allows the reproduction and explanation of some acquired characteristics and functions of cd8+ t cells, and of their responses to multiple stimulation conditions, that would not be accessible in a classical description of cell population dynamics that would not consider intracellular dynamics.
our results suggest that the productive contact duration of cd8+ t cell-apc is influenced by the sensitivity of individual cd8+ t cells to the activation signal and by the il- <dig> concentration in the extracellular environment.
we then showed the model’s ability to reproduce the proliferative responses of cd5hi and cd5lo cd8+ t cells to exogenous il- <dig> under a weak tcr stimulation.
to understand the endogenous and exogenous mechanisms controlling the activation of cd8+ t cells and to investigate the influence of early molecular events on the long-term cell population behavior, we developed a multiscale computational model.
it integrates three levels of description: a cellular potts model describing the individual behavior of cd8+ t cells, a system of ordinary differential equations describing a decision-making molecular regulatory network at the intracellular level, and a partial differential equation describing the diffusion of il- <dig> in the extracellular environment.
we first calibrated the model parameters based on in vivo data and showed the model’s ability to reproduce early dynamics of cd8+ t cells in murine lymph nodes after influenza infection, both at the cell population and intracellular levels.

the cd8+ t cell immune response fights acute infections by intracellular pathogens and, by generating an immune memory, enables immune responses against secondary infections.
activation of the cd8+ t cell immune response involves a succession of molecular events leading to modifications of cd8+ t cell population.
