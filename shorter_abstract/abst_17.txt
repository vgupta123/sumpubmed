in this paper, we propose an adaptive ant colony algorithm that simulates the behaviour of biological immune system.
this makes the solutions more diverse so as to avoid the stagnation and premature phenomena.
however, the classical ant colony algorithm also has its defects of stagnation and premature.
ant colony algorithm has emerged recently as a new meta-heuristic method, which is inspired from the behaviours of real ants for solving np-hard problems.
the solutions of the problem are much more diversified than traditional ant colony algorithms.
the proposed method for improving the performance of traditional ant colony algorithm takes into account the polarization of the colonies, and adaptively adjusts the distribution of the solutions obtained by the ants.
