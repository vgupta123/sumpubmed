selection of probes is a key factor in designing successful mixed microarrays because redundant sequences are inefficient and limited representation of diversity can restrict application of the microarray.
a novel approach is used for probe redundancy reduction, and probe selection is accomplished via stepwise discriminant analysis.
weights generated using stepwise discriminant analysis can be stored for analysis of subsequent experimental data.
additionally, plasmid can be used to construct virtual microarrays with genomes from public databases, which can then be used to identify an optimal set of probes.
we have developed a java-based software tool, called plasmid, for use in selecting the minimum set of probe sequences needed to classify different groups of plasmids or bacteria.
classification microarrays are used for purposes such as identifying strains of bacteria and determining genetic relationships to understand the epidemiology of an infectious disease.
in this paper we describe a new software tool for selecting a set of probes for a classification microarray.
the software program was successfully applied to several different sets of data.
data can be entered in different formats , and dendrogram, heat map, and scatter plot images can be saved in several different formats .
the utility of plasmid was illustrated using existing mixed-plasmid microarray data as well as data from a virtual mixed-genome microarray constructed from different strains of streptococcus.
