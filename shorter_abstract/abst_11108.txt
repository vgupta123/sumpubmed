the string-based approach achieved an error rate of  <dig> , with a mean reciprocal rank of  <dig> .
the context-based and string-based approaches were found to be complementary, and the error rate was reduced further by applying a linear combination of the two classifiers.
the advantage of combining the two approaches was especially manifested on test data with sufficient contextual features, achieving the lowest error rate of  <dig>  and a mean reciprocal rank of  <dig> .
in this paper, we introduce another classification approach based on words of the concept strings and compare it to the contextual syntactic approach.
biomedical ontologies are critical for integration of data from diverse sources and for use by knowledge-based biomedical applications, especially natural language processing as well as associated mining and reasoning systems.
in previous work, we developed an approach using contextual syntactic features obtained from a large domain corpus to reclassify and validate concepts of the unified medical language system , a comprehensive resource of biomedical terminology.
to assist in developing and maintaining the ontologies objectively, we propose automatic approaches to classify and/or validate their semantic categories.
