intervention using the tripeptide macrophage/microglia inhibitory factor mif  and the tetrapeptide macrophage/microglial stimulator tuftsin  attenuated eae symptoms and revealed that the timing of macrophage/microglial activation is critical for the clinical outcome of eae.
microglial activation is mediated by the extracellular protease tissue plasminogen activator , and mice lacking tpa display altered eae progression.
in this study, we have used pharmacological inhibitors and stimulators of microglial/macrophage activation to examine the temporal requirement for microglial activation in eae progression and to determine whether such approaches might potentially be of therapeutic value.
we show that the disease progression can potentially be manipulated favorably at early stages by altering the timing of microglial activation, which in turn alters the systemic immune response to favor upregulation of t helper cell  <dig> genes that promote recovery from eae.
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  is the most commonly used mouse model for multiple sclerosis .
