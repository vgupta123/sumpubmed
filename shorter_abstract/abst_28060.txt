here, we demonstrate that endogenous eps <dig> protein is restrictively expressed in neurons , but not in glial cells  in area ca <dig> of the mouse hippocampus.
these results reveal a previously unknown cell type-specific expression pattern of endogenous eps <dig> protein in the mouse hippocampus and speculate that the role of eps <dig> in controlling and orchestrating neuronal morphogenesis and structural plasticity might be more prominent in interneurons than in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus.
surprisingly, eps <dig> immunoreactivity is rarely found in pyramidal cell somata, but is expressed predominantly in the somata and dendrites of 67Â kda isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase-expressing gabaergic interneurons in the stratum radiatum and at the border of stratum radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare of area ca <dig>  on the basis of co-localizing markers, we found that eps <dig> is not present in perisomatic inhibitory parvalbumin-expressing cells or calretinin-expressing interneurons.
in cultured hippocampal neurons, eps <dig> is enriched at dendritic spine heads and is required for spine morphogenesis; however, the detailed expression pattern of eps <dig> in the hippocampus has not yet been explored.
furthermore, eps <dig> is also present in cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons, but not in somatostatin-expressing interneurons in area ca <dig> stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum.
