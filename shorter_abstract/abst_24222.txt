an assay for the total fluorescence intensity of the biofilm using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed an obvious increase.
quorum sensing  systems influence biofilm formation, an important virulence factor related to the bacterial survival and antibiotic resistance.
in acinetobacter baumannii, biofilm formation depends on pili biosynthesis, structures assembled via the csua/babcde chaperone-usher secretion system.
this study aimed to demonstrate the possible role of qs signaling molecules in regulating pili formation and mediating the ability to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces.
qs signaling molecules are hypothesized to affect pili formation; however, the mechanism behind this remains unclear.
our study demonstrated that, increased transcription of the bfms and bfmr genes, qs signaling molecules enhance the expression of the chaperone-usher secretion system, and this expression is required for twitching motility in a. baumannii.
the concomitant pili expression and strain twitching allowed a. baumannii to attach easily to abiotic surfaces and form biofilms at an earlier timepoint.

transmission electron microscopy analysis of cells lifted from a mh broth co-cultured with c6-hsl showed more abundant pili-like structures than the control strain.
under the same experimental conditions, expression of bfms and bfmr was significantly higher than the control strain .
we then tested the idea that the addition of a qs signal, and therefore induction of chaperone-usher secretion system genes, provides a greater benefit at higher biofilm densities.
