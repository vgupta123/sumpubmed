seven objective functions used with flux balance analysis  were compared for their capacity to predict the mixture of storage compounds accumulated after the sudden onset of n-limitation.
the r. jostii rha <dig> model  produced during this study contains  <dig>  balanced metabolites,  <dig>  unique reactions, and  <dig>  open reading frames .
we analyzed the growth of r. jostii rha <dig> under n-limited conditions using a genome-scale metabolic modelling approach to determine which global metabolic objective function could be used for the prediction.
the best fba simulation results were obtained using a novel objective function for the n-limited condition which combined the maximization of the storage fluxes and the minimization of metabolic adjustments  with the preceding non-limited conditions .
the fba solutions for the non-limited growth conditions were simply constrained by the objective function of growth rate maximization.
rhodococcus jostii rha <dig> growing on different substrates is capable of accumulating simultaneously three types of carbon storage compounds: glycogen, polyhydroxyalkanoates , and triacylglycerols .
predictive abilities were determined using a bayesian approach.
finally, it was found that the quantitative predictions of the storage mixture during n-limited storage accumulation were fairly sensitive to the biomass composition, as expected.
experimental data on storage accumulation mixture  were obtained for batch cultures grown on glucose or acetate.
the proportion of each storage compound changes with substrate, but it remains unclear what modelling approach should be adopted to predict the relative composition of the mixture of the storage compounds.
