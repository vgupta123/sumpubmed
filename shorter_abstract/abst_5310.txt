together with previously described laser scanning confocal microscope-based photoconversion methods, this technique promises to further increase the general usability of photoconvertible pafps to track the dynamic movement of cells and proteins over time.
comparable efficient, irreversible green-to-red photoconversion of selected portions of cell nuclei, gap junctions, microtubules and clathrin-coated vesicles was achieved.
use of a dapi-filter cube with long-pass emission filter  allowed the observation and control of the photoconversion process in real time.
here, we report that by closing the field diaphragm, selective, precise and irreversible green-to-red photoconversion  of discrete subcellular protein pools was achieved on a wide-field fluorescence microscope equipped with standard dapi, fluorescein, and rhodamine filter sets and mercury arc illumination within 5- <dig> seconds.
the advantage of this technique is that it can be performed on a standard, relatively inexpensive wide-field fluorescence microscope with mercury arc illumination.
recently, development of photoactivatable, photoswitchable and photoconvertible fluorescent proteins  has made it possible to investigate the fate of discrete subpopulations of tagged proteins.
