19â€“ <dig> february  <dig> seventh annual mcbios conference.
we demonstrate the capabilities of gomodeler with a dataset of nine differentially expressed cytokine genes and compare the results to those obtained through manual analysis of the dataset by an immunologist.
the direction of overall effects on all hypothesis terms except one was consistent with the results obtained by manual analysis.
the results are provided in both tabular and graphical formats.
it matches the go identifiers  of the genes with the go ids of the hypothesis terms and parses the names of those ids that match to assign effects.
gomodeler summarizes the overall effect of a user defined gene/protein differential expression dataset on specific go hypothesis terms selected by the user to describe a biological experiment.
gomodeler tests the relevance of the hypothesis terms chosen by the user for the input gene dataset by providing the individual effects of the genes on the hypothesis terms and the overall effect of the entire dataset on each of the hypothesis terms.
using this tool, researchers can quickly evaluate the overall effect of quantitative expression changes of gene set on specific biological processes of interest.
however, there are few tools that support hypothesis-based testing using the go and none that support testing with user defined hypothesis terms.
