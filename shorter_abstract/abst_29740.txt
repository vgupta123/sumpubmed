in order to develop such tools it would be helpful if simulated populations based on a variety of models of the tetraploid meiosis would be available.
it allows to generate data for tetraploid and diploid populations, and to investigate different models of tetraploid meiosis.
simulation of quadrivalent meiosis results as expected in double reduction and recombination between more than two homologous chromosomes.

while the genetics of diploid inheritance are well studied and software for linkage mapping, haplotyping and qtl analysis are available, for tetraploids the available tools are limited.
for tetraploids a variety of models can be used, including both bivalent and quadrivalent formation, varying degrees of preferential pairing of homologous chromosomes, different quadrivalent configurations and more.
the results are shown to match theoretical predictions.
this is the first simulation software that implements all features of meiosis in tetraploids.
