three primary isolates  and two established cervical cancer cell lines were compared to normal keratinocytes  for their ability to replicate aav.
these data also suggest that pt <dig> will be a useful reagent for investigating the aav-permissive transcriptome and aav anti-cancer effect.
one isolate, pt <dig>  allowed for high levels of aav dna replication and virion production compared to others.
in research by others, four cellular components are known required for in vitro aav dna replication: replication protein a , replication factor c , proliferating cell nuclear antigen , and dna polymerase delta .
however, this super-permissiveness did not result in pt <dig> cell death by aav infection.
aav, a dependo-parvovirus, autonomously replicates in stratified squamous epithelium.
related autonomous parvoviruses also demonstrate cell tropism and preferentially replicate in oncogenically transformed cells.
thus, we examined pt <dig> cells for expression of these components by dna microarray and real-time quantitative pcr.
these data, for the first time, provide evidence that these four cellular components are likely important for aav in vivo dna replication as well as in vitro.
