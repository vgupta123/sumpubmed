the base composition skews in the coding sequences were used to derive quantitatively the effect of replication-driven mutation plus subsequent selection , and the effect of transcription-driven mutation plus subsequent selection at translation level .
the study reveals the diverse mutation and selection forces associated with replication and transcription in various groups of bacteria that shape the distinct patterns of base composition skews in the chromosomes during evolution.
some closely relative species with distinct base composition parameters are uncovered in this study, which also provides opportunities for comparative bioinformatic and genetic investigations to uncover the underlying principles for mutation and selection.
most bacterial chromosomes exhibit asymmetry of base composition with respect to leading vs. lagging strands .
a strong negative correlation between tap and g+c content and between tap and chromosomal size were also revealed.
analysis of  <dig> representative bacterial chromosomes showed diverse and characteristic patterns of skews among different clades.
while different clades exhibit distinct patterns of rap and tap, rap is absent or nearly absent in some bacteria, but tap is present in all.
these skews reflect mainly those in protein coding sequences, which are driven by asymmetric mutation pressures during replication and transcription  plus subsequent selection for preferred structures, signals, amino acid or codons.
the selection pressure at the translation level is evident in all bacteria based on the analysis of the skews at the three codon positions.
