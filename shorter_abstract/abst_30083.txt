furthermore, we compared the transcript expression profiles from the three different cdna libraries by customized bioinformatics analysis and validated these findings by semi-quantitative pcr and real-time pcr.
moreover, we identified sandfly midgut transcripts that are expressed only after a blood meal, such as microvilli associated-like protein , a peritrophin , trypsin  <dig> , chymotrypsin ppchym <dig>  and two unknown proteins.
in sandflies, the blood meal is responsible for the induction of several physiologic processes that culminate in egg development and maturation.
of interest, many of these overabundant transcripts such as ppchym <dig>  ppmvp <dig>  ppmvp <dig>  ppper <dig> and ppper <dig> were of lower abundance when the sandfly was given a blood meal in the presence of l. major.
transcriptome analysis of  <dig> cdna clones resulted in the identification of the most abundant p. papatasi midgut-specific transcripts.
this tissue-specific transcriptome analysis provides a comprehensive look at the repertoire of transcripts present in the midgut of the sandfly p. papatasi.
additionally, the findings presented in this work suggest that the leishmania parasite is modulating key enzymes or proteins in the gut of the sandfly that may be beneficial for its establishment and survival.
the suggested upregulation of specific transcripts in a blood-fed cdna library were validated by real-time pcr, suggesting that this customized bioinformatic analysis is a powerful and accurate tool useful in analysing expression profiles from different cdna libraries.
during blood feeding, infected sandflies are also able to transmit the parasite leishmania to a suitable host.
many blood-induced molecules play significant roles during leishmania development in the sandfly midgut, including parasite killing within the endoperitrophic space.
