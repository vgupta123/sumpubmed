to provide insight into the pathways underlying bbs and alström phenotypes, we carried out whole organism transcriptome analysis by rna sequencing in established zebrafish models of the syndromes.
in contrast, neuronal pathways were significantly downregulated only in the bbs model but not in the alström model.
although bbs and alström genes are necessary for the proper function of primary cilia, their role in defects across multiple organ systems is unclear.
pathway network analyses of both models indicate that visual system defects may be driven by genetic mechanisms independent of other phenotypes whereas the majority of other phenotypes are a result of genetic players that contribute to multiple pathways simultaneously.
additionally, examination of genes differentially expressed in opposing directions between the two models suggest a deficit in pancreatic function in the alström model, that is not present in the bbs model.
bardet-biedl syndrome  and alström syndrome are two pleiotropic ciliopathies with significant phenotypic overlap between them across many tissues.
these included multiple pathways shared between the two disease models as well as those unique to each model.
