furthermore, through mutagenesis kinetic assay, we identified that the 2-cell stage is the earliest time point at which indels can be observed.
with this technique, we were able to genotype adult zebrafish using genomic dna extracted from fin-clips in less than 2 h. we were also able to obtain a reliable and early read-out of the effectiveness of guide rnas only 4 h after the embryos were injected with the constructs for the crispr/cas <dig> mutagenic system.
by combining an inexpensive and rapid genomic dna extraction method with an hrm-based assay, our approach allows for high-throughput genotyping of adult zebrafish and embryos, and is more sensitive than standard pcr approaches, permitting early identification of crispr-induced indels and with applications for other model organisms as well.
here we have combined and optimized the hotshot genomic dna extraction technique with a two-steps evagreen pcr, followed by a high-resolution melting  assay, which facilitates rapid identification of crispr-induced indels.
