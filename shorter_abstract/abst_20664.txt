the mature seed kernel and initial stages of pericarp were found to contain the highest amount of limonoids.
two short-chain prenyltransferases, geranyl diphosphate synthase  and farnesyl diphosphate synthase  and squalene synthase  were cloned and functionally characterized using transcriptome data.
transcriptome analysis was used to identify the initial genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis.
transcriptome annotation led to the identification of the putative genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis.
furthermore, a wide diversity of triterpenoids, especially c-seco triterpenoids were observed in kernel as compared to the other tissues.
neem tree  is one of the richest sources of skeletally diverse triterpenoids and they are well-known for their broad-spectrum pharmacological and insecticidal properties.
rt-pcr studies indicated five-fold and ten-fold higher relative expression level of aisqs in fruits as compared to leaves and flowers, respectively.
based on transcriptome analysis, two short-chain prenyltransferases and squalene synthase  were cloned and functionally characterized.
here, we delineate quantitative profiling of fifteen major triterpenoids across various tissues including developmental stages of kernel and pericarp, flower, leaf, stem and bark using uplc-esi-hrms based profiling.
pericarp, flower and leaf contained mainly ring-intact triterpenoids.
triterpenoid profiling indicated that there is tissue specific variation in their abundance.
quantitative profiling revealed differential abundance of both total and individual triterpenoid content across various tissues.
the initial genes such as aigds, aifds and aisqs involved in the isoprenoids biosynthesis have been functionally characterized.
