the main features of this process include cytochrome c release, caspase activation, atp depletion, increase of adp/atp ratio, apoptotic nuclear morphology, progressive intracellular acidification, and egg swelling.
mature fertilization-competent frog eggs are arrested at the meiotic metaphase ii with high activity of the key meiotic regulators, maturation promoting factor  and cytostatic factor , awaiting fertilization.
meiotic exit seems to be a prerequisite for execution of the apoptotic program, since  it precedes apoptosis,  apoptotic events cannot be observed in the eggs maintaining high activity of mpf and csf, and  apoptosis in unfertilized frog eggs is accelerated upon early meiotic exit.
the study reveals that naturally laid intact frog eggs die by apoptosis if they are not fertilized.
a maternal apoptotic program is evoked in frog oocytes upon maturation and executed after meiotic exit in unfertilized eggs.
the meiotic exit is required for execution of the apoptotic program in eggs.
here, we report that the vast majority of naturally laid unfertilized eggs of the african clawed frog xenopus laevis spontaneously exit metaphase arrest under various environmental conditions and degrade by a well-defined apoptotic process within  <dig> hours after ovulation.
the emerging anti-apoptotic role of meiotic metaphase arrest needs further investigation.
