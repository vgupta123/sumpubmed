our analysis demonstrated that the use of multiple probes per target sequence is not essential for in-situ synthesized 60mer oligonucleotide arrays designed against bacteria.
probes were designed using the arrayoligosel <dig>  software package and whole-genome microarrays synthesized by agilent, inc. using their in-situ, ink-jet technology platform.
we first validated the quality of the microarrays as demonstrated by an average signal to noise ratio of > <dig>  next, we determined that the variance of replicate probes  of identical sequence was  <dig> % whereas the variance of alternative probes  designs was  <dig> %.
we determined that depending upon the definition, about  <dig> % of replicate and  <dig> % of alternative probes produced outlier conclusions.
although probes producing outlier signals were identified, the use of ratios results in less than 10% of such outlier conclusions.
it is well documented that 25mer probes directed against different regions of the same gene produce variable signal intensity values.
we report here an analysis of alternative 60mer probe designs for an in-situ synthesized oligonucleotide array for the gc rich, Î²-proteobacterium burkholderia cenocepacia.
finally, we determined none of the probe design subscores  produced by arrayoligosel <dig>  were predictive or probes that produced outlier signals.
