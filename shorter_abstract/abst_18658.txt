in this study, we therefore compared the response of porcine macrophages and dc differentiated from peripheral blood monocytes to s. typhimurium and one of the most potent bacterial pathogen associated molecular patterns, bacterial lipopolysaccharide.
out of these,  <dig> proteins were inducible in macrophages either after infection with s. typhimurium or lps exposure and  <dig> proteins were inducible in dc.
to avoid any bias, the expression was determined by protein lc-ms/ms and verified at the level of transcription by quantitative rt-pcr.
mass spectrometry identified  <dig> proteins in macrophages and  <dig> in dc.
although macrophages and dc may differentiate from a common precursor, their capacities to process and present antigen differ significantly.
out of these,  <dig> genes were induced in both cell types,  <dig> genes  were significantly induced in macrophages only and oldlr <dig> and cdc <dig> were induced exclusively in dc.
following infection and initial multiplication in the gut lumen, salmonella typhimurium crosses the intestinal epithelial barrier and comes into contact with cells of the host immune system.
mononuclear phagocytes which comprise macrophages and dendritic cells  are of key importance for the outcome of salmonella infection.
within 4Â days of culture, peripheral blood monocytes differentiated into two populations with distinct morphology and expression of mhc ii.
the expression of the  <dig> most inducible proteins was verified at the level of transcription and the differential expression was confirmed in  <dig> of them.
