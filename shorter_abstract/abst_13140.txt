however is are commonly present in multiple copies in a single genome, which complicates genome assembly and the identification of is insertion sites.
ismapper provides a rapid and robust method for identifying is insertion sites directly from short read data, with a high degree of accuracy demonstrated across a wide range of bacteria.
in each a. baumannii genome, ismapper successfully identified an is insertion upstream of the ampc beta-lactamase that could explain phenotypic resistance to third-generation cephalosporins.
insertion sequences  are small transposable elements, commonly found in bacterial genomes.
identifying the location of is in bacterial genomes can be useful for a variety of purposes including epidemiological tracking and predicting antibiotic resistance.
here we present ismapper, a mapping-based tool for identification of the site and orientation of is insertions in bacterial genomes, directly from paired-end short read data.
subsampling of real illumina reads to lower depths indicated ismapper was able to correctly detect insertions for average genome-wide read depths >20x, although read depths >50x were required to obtain confident calls that were highly-supported by evidence from reads.
the utility of ismapper was further demonstrated by profiling genome-wide is <dig> insertions in  <dig> publicly available mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes, revealing lineage-specific insertions and multiple insertion hotspots.
