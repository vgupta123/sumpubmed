the top three ranked genes, hla-g, tap <dig> and hla-drb <dig>  are implicated in autoimmune diseases, while tap <dig> is associated with snps characteristic for mg. within the top  <dig> prioritized genes our method identifies 90% of the  <dig> already known mg-associated genes from the considered region without using any information that directly links genes to mg. among the top eight genes we identified hla-g and tubb as new candidates.
about 5% of western populations are afflicted by autoimmune diseases many of which are affected by sex hormones.
autoimmune diseases are complex and involve many genes.
our method uses various types of information available for the genes, but no information that directly links genes with the disease.
we have developed a method to prioritize disease-associated genes for diseases affected strongly by sex hormones.
we have developed a method to prioritize disease-associated genes under the potential control of sex hormones.
the method has a potential to be adapted to prioritize genes relevant to other diseases.
