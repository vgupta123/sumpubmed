we identified  <dig> known and  <dig> new candidate micrornas during reproductive development of b. juncea.
targeted genes of the micrornas were identified by high-throughput sequencing and degradome approaches, including auxin response factor, nac  domain transcription factor, gras family transcription factor, myb transcription factor, squamosa promoter binding protein, ap2-type transcription factor, homeobox/homeobox-leucine zipper family and tcp family transcription factors, which were observed to be differentially expressed between cms and mf.
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed micrornas between cms and its mf lines were discovered, according to their sequencing reads number.
different expression levels of selected micrornas were confirmed by using real-time quantitative pcr between cms and mf lines.
the differential expression of mirnas observed between cms and mf lines suggested that biogenesis of mirnas could be influenced in the cms.
taken together, from these findings we suggested microrna might participate in the regulatory network of cms by tuning fork in gene expressions in cms b. juncea.
regulatory network of cytoplasmic male sterility  occurrence is still largely unknown in plants, although numerous researches have been attempted to isolate genes involved in cms.
here, we employed high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis to identify micrornas and their targets using high-throughput sequencing in cms and its maintainer fertile  lines of brassica juncea.
