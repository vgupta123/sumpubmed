although several viruses, including tobacco mosaic virus, potato virus x and cowpea mosaic virus, have been developed as vectors, we aimed to develop a new viral vaccine delivery system, a bamboo mosaic virus , that would carry larger transgene loads, and generate better immunity in the target animals with fewer adverse environmental effects.
real-time pcr analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the bvp1-immunized swine revealed that they produced vp1-specific ifn-Î³.
the pbvp <dig> was able to infect host plants and to generate a chimeric virion bvp <dig> expressing vp <dig> epitopes in its coat protein.
chimeric bamv virions that express partial sequence of fmdv vp <dig> can effectively induce not only humoral and cell-mediated immune responses but also full protection against fmdv in target animals.
the recombinant bamv plasmid  was constructed by replacing dna encoding the  <dig> n-terminal amino acid residues of the bamv coat protein with that encoding  <dig> amino acid residues  of fmdv vp <dig>
we engineered the bamv as a vaccine vector expressing the antigenic epitope of the capsid protein vp <dig> of foot-and-mouth disease virus .
furthermore, all bvp1-immunized swine were protected against fmdv challenge.
plant viruses can be employed as versatile vectors for the production of vaccines by expressing immunogenic epitopes on the surface of chimeric viral particles.
