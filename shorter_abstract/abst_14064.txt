sds-page and rp-hplc analysis of grain proteins showed that brachypodium has few gliadins and high molecular weight glutenin subunits.
in particular, the lmw-c type subunits in brachypodium were more abundant than the equivalent proteins in common wheat.
southern blotting analysis confirmed that brachypodium has 4â€“ <dig> copies of lmw-gs genes.
a total of  <dig> lmw-gs genes were cloned from brachypodium by allele specific pcr.
the presence of lmw-gs in b. distachyon grains indicates that b. distachyon may be used as a model system for studying wheat quality attributes.
brachypodium distachyon l. is a newly emerging model plant system for temperate cereal crop species.
however, its grain protein compositions are still not clear.
in the current study, we carried out a detailed proteomics and molecular genetics study on grain glutenin proteins in b. distachyon.
