from  <dig> intensive farms, six ort isolates were identified by pcr and biochemical assays, and two h9n <dig> viruses were isolated.
the results of this study suggest that ort infections of domestic poultry have been occurring frequently in china.
ort infection can induce higher economic losses and mortality if h9n <dig> aiv is also present.
this is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ort and h9n <dig> virus, and this co-infection is probably associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in china, which has caused extensive economic losses.
this disease occurrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30â€‰days, resulting in approximately 70% morbidity and 30% mortality in broilers.
specifically, the survival rate was 30%, 20%, 70%, 50% and 90% in birds inoculated with ort+h9n <dig> virus, ort followed by h9n <dig> virus, h9n <dig> virus followed by ort, and ort or h9n <dig> virus alone, respectively.
typical pneumonia and airsacculitis were observed both in broilers inoculated intraperitoneally with an ort isolate alone and in those co-infected with ort and h9n <dig> virus isolates.
newcastle disease virus  and infectious bronchitisvirus  were excluded.
our clinical survey showed that  <dig> % to 100% of breeding broilers, breeding layers, broilers and laying hens were seropositive for ort antibodies.
