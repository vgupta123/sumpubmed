in primary cultures, trh cells constitute 2% of the total fetal hypothalamic cell population.
trh cells undergoing the terminal phase of differentiation, expressed genes implicated in protein biosynthesis, intracellular signaling and transcriptional control.
to purify these cells, we took advantage of the fact that the segment spanning - <dig> to + <dig> bp of the trh gene regulatory region confers specific expression of the green fluorescent protein  in the trh cells.
transfected trh cells were purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting, various cell preparations pooled, and their transcriptome compared to that of gfp- hypothalamic cells.
thyrotropin releasing hormone  is a peptide that regulates energy homeostasis and autonomic responses.
to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying trh neuron development, we performed a genome wide study of its transcriptome during fetal hypothalamic development.
this genome-scale study forms a rational foundation for identifying genes that might participate in the development and function of hypothalamic trh neurons.
a balance between programs that include cell proliferation, cell cycle withdrawal as well as epigenetic regulation of gene expression characterizes neurogenesis.
