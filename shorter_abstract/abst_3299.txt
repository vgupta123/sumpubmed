results of the experimental infection are consistent with previous clinical observations and pathological studies suggesting that f. tularensis ssp.
significant differences were observed in total weight loss values and scores of clinical signs between the two genotypes with more rats succumbing to tularemia in groups infected with the b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype.
experimental infection of fischer  <dig> rats was performed by intra-peritoneal injection of three dilutions of a hungarian  and an italian  f. tularensis ssp.
<dig> group were isolated mainly in northern, central and eastern europe.

the clinical course of tularemia in the european brown hare  also shows distinct patterns according to the geographical area.
holarctica genotype b.ftnf002- <dig> has higher pathogenic potential than the b.
moderate difference was observed in the virulence of the two genotypes.
two main genetic groups  of francisella tularensis ssp.
the b.ftnf002- <dig> group proved to be dominant in western european countries, while strains of the b.
acute course of the disease is observed in hares in western european countries, while signs of sub-acute or chronic infection are more frequently detected in the eastern part of the continent.
