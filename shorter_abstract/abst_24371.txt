to address the influence of hucb cells on neuronal tissue after stroke we established and employed a human in vitro model of neuronal hypoxia using fully differentiated vulnerable sh-sy5y cells.
we established an in vitro model of neuronal hypoxia that affords the possibility to investigate both, apoptotic neuronal cell death and neuroprotective therapies.
subsequently, hucb mononuclear cells  were added to post-hypoxic neuronal cultures.
the impact of hucb cells and hypoxia on secretion of neuroprotective and inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and expression of adhesion molecules was proved.
specific cytokine  patterns also suggest anti-apoptotic strategies of neuronal cells.
in parallel, clustering of administered mnc next to axons and somata of neuronal cells was observed.
we hypothesize that the neuroprotective effect of mnc was due to anti-apoptotic mechanisms related to direct cell-cell contacts with injured neuronal cells and distinct changes in neuroprotective, inflammatory cytokines as well as to the upregulation of chemokines within the co-cultures.
hypoxic cultivation of neurons initially induced a rate of 26% ± 13% of apoptosis.
based on this we investigated the therapeutic influence of hucb mnc on the progression of apoptotic cell death.
however, complexity of animal models has thus far limited the understanding of beneficial cellular mechanisms.
remarkably, the administration of mnc showed a noticeable reduction of apoptosis rates to levels of normoxic control cultures .
within the next three days rate of apoptosis in untreated hypoxic cultures cumulated to 85% ± 11% .
