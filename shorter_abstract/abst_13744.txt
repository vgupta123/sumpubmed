the normalized relative variable fluorescence at the k step  and the relative variable fluorescence at the j step  increased while the maximal quantum yield of psii  and the density of qa-reducing psii reaction centers per cross section  decreased, indicating that the reaction centers, and the donor and acceptor sides of psii were all severely damaged after pst infection.
photoinhibition and photoinhibition-like damage were observed under light and dark conditions, respectively, after pst infection of tobacco leaves.
the psbo, d <dig> and psaa proteins appear to be the targets during pst infection under light and dark conditions.
the net photosynthetic rate  and carboxylation efficiency  were inhibited by pst infection.
ros over-accumulation was not the primary cause of the photoinhibition and photoinhibition-like damage.
the objective of this study was to clarify the responses of photosystem i  and photosystem ii  to pst infection in tobacco leaves.
furthermore, we observed a considerable overall degradation of psbo, d <dig>  psaa proteins and an over-accumulation of reactive oxygen species .
the psi activity decreased as the infection progressed.
