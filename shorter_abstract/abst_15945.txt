the first analysis shows that mpda can characterize genomic patterns of preferential amplification/hybridization and provide calibration information for pooled dna data analysis.
mpda, the software that integrates pooled dna association analysis and allelic imbalance analysis, provides a convenient analysis system for extensive whole-genome pooled dna data analysis.
graphic and numerical outputs from mpda support global and detailed inspection of large amounts of genomic data.
mpda enables whole-genome dna preferential amplification/hybridization analysis, allele frequency estimation, association mapping, allelic imbalance detection, and permits integration with shared data resources online.
however, few publicly shared tools are available to systematically analyze the rapidly accumulating volume of whole-genome pooled dna data.
the software, user manual and illustrated examples are freely available online at the mpda website listed in the availability and requirements section.
the final analysis shows that mpda can identify regions of chromosomal aberration in cancer without paired-normal tissue.
we propose a generalized concept of pooled dna and present a user-friendly tool named microarray pooled dna analyzer  that we developed to analyze hybridization intensity data from microarray-based pooled dna experiments.
