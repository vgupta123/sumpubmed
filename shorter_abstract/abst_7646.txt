these genes acted as hubs linking summer-biased adaptive pathways, winter-biased innate pathways and other organismal processes, including growth, metabolic dynamics and responses to stress and temperature.
extremes of season were the dominant predictor of immune expression .
further consideration should be given to the effects of such responses in seasonally-occurring disease.
in contrast, late winter was accompanied by signatures of innate immunity  and modulated toll-like receptor signalling.
signatures of adaptive immunity were elevated in late summer.
our results suggest major and predictable seasonal re-adjustments of immunity.
fishes show seasonal patterns of immunity, but such phenomena are imperfectly understood in vertebrates generally, even in humans and mice.
as these seasonal patterns may link to infectious disease risk and individual condition, the nature of their control has real practical implications.
network analyses identified a small set of immune genes that might lie close to a regulatory axis.
negative regulators of t-cell activity were prominent amongst winter-biased genes, suggesting that adaptive immunity is actively down-regulated during winter rather than passively tracking ambient temperature.
seasonal change was most pronounced in the gill, which contains a considerable concentration of t-cell activity in the stickleback.
we made genome-wide measurements  of whole-fish mrna pools  at the end of summer and winter in contrasting habitats  and focussed on common trends to filter habitat-specific from overarching temporal responses.
here we characterize seasonal dynamics in the expression of conserved vertebrate immunity genes in a naturally-occurring piscine model, the three-spined stickleback.
