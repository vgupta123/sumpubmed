results indicated an overall conservation of the components and transcriptome alterations underlying innate and adaptive immunity in fish and other vertebrate models.
results can contribute to the in-depth study of candidate genes in marine fish immunity, and help improve current understanding of host-pathogen interactions and evolutionary history of immunogenetics from fish to mammals.
dge analysis revealed that the host transcriptome profile of vibrio harveyi-challenged l. japonicus is considerably altered, as indicated by the significant up- or down-regulation of  <dig>  strong infection-responsive transcripts.
the newly developed solexa/illumina rna-seq and digital gene expression  are high-throughput sequencing approaches and are powerful tools for genomic studies at the transcriptome level.
analysis suggested the acquisition of numerous fish-specific immune system components during early vertebrate evolution.
systematic research on fish immunogenetics is indispensable in understanding the origin and evolution of immune systems.
this study provided a global survey of host defence gene activities against bacterial challenge in a non-model marine fish.
this has long been a challenging task because of the limited number of deep sequencing technologies and genome backgrounds of non-model fish available.
more than 52% of these transcripts are possibly involved in approximately  <dig> known metabolic or signalling pathways, while  <dig>  transcripts were associated with immune-relevant genes.
this study reports the transcriptome profiling analysis of bacteria-challenged lateolabrax japonicus using rna-seq and dge in an attempt to gain insights into the immunogenetics of marine fish.
