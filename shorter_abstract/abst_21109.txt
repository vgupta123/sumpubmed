serratia marcescens is a gram-negative bacterium and often causes nosocomial infections.
phla induces destabilization of target cell membranes in the presence of phospholipids.
however, the deletion mutant retained hemolytic activity on human blood agar plates, indicating the presence of another s. marcescens hemolytic factor.
functional cloning of s. marcescens identified a phospholipase a  with hemolytic activity on human blood agar plates.
a phlab deletion mutant lost hemolytic activity on human blood agar plates.
we have shown that the s. marcescens phla gene produces hemolysis on human blood agar plates.
the only s. marcescens hemolytic and cytotoxic factor reported, thus far, is the hemolysin shla.
our results indicated that the lysophospholipids produced by phla affected cell membranes resulting in hemolysis and cell death.
the cytotoxic and hemolytic activities of phla both required phospholipids as substrates.
an s. marcescens shlab deletion mutant was constructed and shown to have no contact hemolytic activity.
