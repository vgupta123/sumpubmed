to determine the contribution of each individual iron acquisition system to the virulence of apec and upec, isogenic mutants affecting iron uptake in apec e <dig> and upec u <dig> were constructed and compared in a chicken challenge model.
results indicated that apec and upec utilize similar iron acquisition mechanisms in chickens.
both types have multiple iron acquisition systems, including heme and siderophores.

aerobactin defective mutants e058Δiucd and u17Δiucd demonstrated reduced colonization in several internal organs, whereas the heme defective mutants e058Δchut and u17Δchut colonized internal organs to the same extent as their wild-type strains.
the histopathological lesions in visceral organs of birds challenged with the wild-type strains were more severe than those from birds challenged with Δirod, Δiucd or the triple mutants.
however, no significant differences were observed between the mutants and the wild-type strains in resistance to serum, cellular invasion and intracellular survival in hd- <dig>  and growth in iron-rich or iron-restricted medium.
avian pathogenic escherichia coli  and uropathogenic e. coli  are the two main subsets of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli .
no differences were observed between the mutants and their wild-type parents in other phenotypic traits, suggesting that other virulence mechanisms compensate for the effect of the mutations.
salmochelin-defective mutants e058Δirod and u17Δirod showed significantly decreased pathogenicity compared to the wild-type strains.
conversely, chickens inoculated with the Δchut mutants had lesions comparable to those in chickens inoculated with the wild-type strains.
both salmochelin and aerobactin systems appeared to be important in apec and upec virulence, while salmochelin contributed more to the virulence.
