similarity of this molecule to the structure space covered by natural products, is a useful criterion in screening compound libraries and in designing new lead compounds.
in this note, we report an open-source and open-data re-implementation of this scoring system, illustrate its efficiency in ranking small molecules for natural product likeness and discuss its potential applications.
our open-source, open-data natural-product-likeness scoring system can be used as a filter for metabolites in computer assisted structure elucidation or to select natural-product-like molecules from molecular libraries for the use as leads in drug discovery.
natural product-likeness of a molecule, i.e.
a closed source implementation of a natural product-likeness score, that finds its application in virtual screening, library design and compound selection, has been previously reported by one of us.
