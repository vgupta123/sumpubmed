microarrays were hybridised with the amplified targets and the amplification protocols were compared with respect to the quality of expression profiles, reproducibility within a concentration range of input rna, and sensitivity.
in this study, four commercial protocols for amplification of picograms amounts of input rna for microarray expression profiling were evaluated and compared.
to address this issue, rna amplification methods have been developed to generate sufficient targets from picogram amounts of total rna to perform microarray hybridisation.
this comparative study will be useful to scientists needing to choose an amplification method to carry out microarray experiments involving samples comprising only a few cells and generating picogram amounts of rna.
the results demonstrate significant differences between these four methods.
in our hands, the wt-ovation pico system proposed by nugen appears to be the most suitable for rna amplification.
however, the amount of biological material from cell sorting or laser capture microdissection is much too small to perform microarray studies.
