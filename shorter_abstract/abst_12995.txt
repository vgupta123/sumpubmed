we have solved the crystal structure of the gene-product of locus spy_ <dig> from s. pyogenes, , and found it to comprise an anti-parallel four-helix bundle that is structurally similar to other bacteriocin immunity proteins.
combined structural, genomic and proteomic analyses have allowed the identification and in silico characterization of a new putative immunity protein from s. pyogenes, possibly the first structure of an immunity protein protective against potential class iib two-peptide bacteriocins.
many gram-positive lactic acid bacteria  produce anti-bacterial peptides and small proteins called bacteriocins, which enable them to compete against other bacteria in the environment.
these peptides fall structurally into three different classes, i, ii, iii, with class iia being pediocin-like single entities and class iib being two-peptide bacteriocins.
however, given that s. pyogenes appears to lack any iia pediocin-like proteins but does possess class iib bacteriocins, we suggest this protein confers immunity to iib-like peptides.
sequence analyses indicate this protein to be a possible immunity protein protective against class iia or iib bacteriocins.
streptococcus pyogenes, closely related to lab, is one of the most common human pathogens, so knowledge of how it competes against other lab species is likely to prove invaluable.
self-protective cognate immunity proteins are usually co-transcribed with these toxins.
we have named the two pairs of putative bacteriocins found in s. pyogenes pyogenecin  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>
