in addition, experimental results show that our method is able to identify the different dna-binding behaviors of proteins in the same scop family based on the use of evolutionary conservation of dna-contact residues.
our method achieves high precision and recall for  <dig> families of dna-binding domains, with a false positive rate less than 5% for  <dig> non-dna-binding proteins.
we conclude that the members in the same subfamily bind dna specifically and the members in different subfamilies often recognize different dna targets.
the identification of dna-binding domains is useful for understanding the regulation mechanisms of dna-binding proteins.
this study shows the conservation of dna-contact residues in dna-binding domains.
additionally, we observe the co-evolution of dna-contact residues and interacting dna base-pairs.
in this study, we proposed a method to determine whether a domain or a protein can has dna binding capability by considering evolutionary conservation of dna-binding residues.
