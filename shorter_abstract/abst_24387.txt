the between species comparison reveals that the human-specific gly38ser polymorphism evolved under strong positive darwinian selection, probably in adaptation to specific challenges in the fine-tuning of iks channels.
coincidence of positive darwinian selection and polymorphism with a sporadically suppressed expression of one allele.
variants of kcne <dig> have repeatedly been linked to the long-qt syndrome , a disorder which predisposes to deafness, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, syncope, and sudden cardiac death.
the involved amino acid exchanges  are moderately radical and do not induce apparent changes in posttranslational modification.
we speculate that individual differences in genomic imprinting or genomic recoding might have contributed to conflicting results of recent association studies between gly38ser polymorphism and qt phenotype.
to the best of our knowledge, they moreover provide first time evidence for a unique pattern; i.e.
kcne <dig> represents the regulatory beta-subunit of the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel .
the findings thus highlight the relevance of mrna data in future association studies of genotypes and clinical disorders.
on the other hand, the expression of the 38ser allele seems to be disadvantageous under certain conditions, as suggested by the sporadic deficiency of 38ser-coding mrnas in heterozygote central europeans and the depletion of homozygotes 38ser in the yoruban sample.
according to population genetic analyses  a heterozygote advantage accounts for the maintenance of the gly38ser polymorphism in humans.
we here analyze the evolution of the common gly38ser variant , using genomic dnas, complementary dnas, and hek293-expressed variants of altogether  <dig> mammalian species.
