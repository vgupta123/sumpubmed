antibacterial activity was exhibited by  <dig> of the isolates  against at least one of the indicator microorganisms: enterococcus faecalis , bacillus thuringiensis , pseudomonas aeruginosa , staphylococcus aureus , proteus vulgaris  and bacillus subtilis .
a sea isolate mai <dig>  exhibited the highest antibacterial activity .
in this study, a total of  <dig> aquatic microbial isolates from  <dig> samples  were screened by the agar-well diffusion method for ability to produce antibacterial-metabolites.
this study has therefore uncovered the potential of water bodies in the west african sub-region as reservoirs of potent bioactive metabolite producing microorganisms.
