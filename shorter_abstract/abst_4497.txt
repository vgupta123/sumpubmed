in a significant number of publications the classical threshold concept plays a central role in modelling and explaining psychophysical experimental results such as in stochastic resonance  phenomena.
we conclude that a more suitable model of the tactile sensory system is needed.
using a second choice experiment, we show that individuals can order sensorial events below the level known as the classical threshold.
according to the classical threshold assumptions, a correct second choice response corresponds to a guess attempt with a statistical frequency of 50%.
results show an average of  <dig> %  for the second choice response that is not explained by the classical threshold definition.
using a second choice experiment, we show that individuals can order sensorial events below the level known as a classical threshold.
therefore, if detection exists below the classical threshold level, then the model to explain the sr phenomenon or any other tactile perception phenomena based on the psychophysical classical threshold is not valid.
in sr, noise enhances detection of sub-threshold stimuli and the phenomenon is explained stating that the required amplitude to exceed the sensory threshold barrier can be reached by adding noise to a sub-threshold stimulus.
nevertheless, our experimental results are above that chance level contradicting the definition of the classical tactile threshold.
nevertheless, our experimental results are above that chance level.
if the observer's sensorial system is not activated by stimuli below the threshold, then a second choice could not be above the chance level.
additionally, for low stimulus amplitudes, second choice correct detection is above chance level for any detectability level.
the tactile sense is being used in a variety of applications involving tactile human-machine interfaces.
