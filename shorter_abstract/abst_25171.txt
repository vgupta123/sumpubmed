the grass carp gccited3a and gccited3b genes are differentially expressed and regulated in different fish organs in response to hypoxic stress.
luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that both gene promoters are activated by gchif- <dig>  further, chip assays comparing normal and hypoxic conditions reveal differential in vivo binding of gchif- <dig> to both gene promoters in kidney and liver tissues.
we have characterized two closely related but distinct cited <dig> genes, gccited3a and gccited3b, from the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp.
hre-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that both gccited3a and gccited3b proteins inhibit gchif- <dig> transcriptional activity, and gst pull-down assays confirmed that both proteins bind specifically to the ch <dig> domain of the grass carp p <dig> protein.
overall, our findings suggest that unique molecular mechanisms operate through these two gccited <dig> isoforms that likely play an important regulatory role in the hypoxic response in the grass carp.
cited proteins belong to a family of non-dna-binding transcriptional co-regulators that are characterized by a conserved ed-rich domain at the c-terminus.
northern blot analysis indicates that the mrna expression of gccited3a and gccited3b is strongly induced by hypoxia in the kidney and liver, respectively.
the deduced gccited3a and gccited3b proteins share 72% amino acid identity, and are highly similar to the cited <dig> proteins of both chicken and xenopus.
this is the first report demonstrating in vivo regulation of two closely-related cited <dig> isogenes by hif- <dig>  as well as cited <dig> regulation of hif- <dig> transcriptional activity in fish.
