the mesencephalic dopaminergic  cell system is composed of two major groups of projecting cells in the substantia nigra   and the ventral tegmental area  .
by screening  <dig> potential ligands on  <dig> mda ors recombinantly expressed in an heterologous in vitro system, we identified carvone enantiomers as agonists at olfr <dig> and able to evoke an intracellular ca2+ increase in solitary mda neurons.
gene expression analysis was integrated with the fantom <dig> helicos cage sequencing datasets, showing the presence of these ors in selected tissues and brain areas outside of the olfactory epithelium.
by taking advantage of transgenic labeling, laser capture microdissection coupled to nano cap-analysis of gene expression  technology on isolated a <dig> and a <dig> cells, we found that a subset of olfactory receptors s is expressed in mda neurons.
our study indicates that mda neurons express ors and respond to odor-like molecules providing new opportunities for pharmacological intervention in disease.
ors were found expressed in human sn and down-regulated in pd post mortem brains.
or expression in the mesencephalon was validated by rt-pcr and in situ hybridization.
selective degeneration of a <dig> neurons occurs in parkinsonâ€™s disease  while abnormal function of a <dig> cells has been linked to schizophrenia, attention deficit and addiction.
