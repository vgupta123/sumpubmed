using time-resolved expression profiling of embryos, we then identified a small subset of  <dig> genes within the hdac1-regulated transcriptome that specifically exhibit robust and sustained hdac1-dependent expression from early neurogenesis onwards.
relatively few genes are strongly repressed by hdac <dig> but expression of the notch target gene her <dig> is attenuated by hdac <dig> in specific sub-regions of the developing cns, from early stages of neurogenesis onwards.
our in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation results also suggest a specific function for hdac <dig> in directly regulating transcription of a key member of this group of genes, ascl1b, from the beginning of neurogenesis onwards.
surprisingly, we found that hdac <dig> is specifically and stably associated with dna sequences within the promoter region of ascl1b during neurogenesis, and that this hdac1-ascl1b interaction is abolished in hdac <dig> mutant embryos.
taken together, our observations indicate a novel role for hdac <dig> as a positive regulator of gene transcription during development of the vertebrate cns, in addition to its more well-established function in transcriptional repression.
<dig> of these  <dig> stringently hdac1-regulated genes encode dna-binding transcription factors that are implicated in promoting neuronal specification and cns patterning, including the proneural bhlh proteins ascl1a and ascl1b, as well as neurod <dig> and neurod.
we conclude that hdac <dig> regulates histone acetylation and methylation in the developing zebrafish embryo and promotes the sustained, co-ordinate transcription of a small set of transcription factor genes that control expansion and diversification of cell fates within the developing cns.
a genome-wide comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of hdac1-deficient and wild-type zebrafish embryos was performed, which identified an extensive programme of gene expression that is regulated by hdac <dig> in the developing embryo.
