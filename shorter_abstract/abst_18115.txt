in the present study, we administered da to rats intraperitoneally, then used liquid chromatography/ion trap tandem mass spectrometry  to identify and quantify da in the brains of the rats and performed histological examinations of the hippocampus.
domoic acid  is an excitatory amino acid analogue of kainic acid  that acts via activation of glutamate receptors to elicit a rapid and potent excitotoxic response, resulting in neuronal cell death.
we further investigated the potential involvement of glutamate receptors, ros, p <dig> mapk, and wdr <dig> in da-induced toxicity in vivo.
our results showed that intraperitoneally administered da was present in the brain and induced neurodegenerative changes including apoptosis in the ca <dig> region of the hippocampus.
in summary, our results indicated that da activated ampa/ka receptors and induced ros production and p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in the expression of wdr <dig> in vivo.
we have reported that wdr <dig>  a wd-repeat protein, may mediate apoptosis in several animal models.
in addition, the radical scavenger edaravone significantly attenuated the da-induced increase in wdr <dig> protein expression.
