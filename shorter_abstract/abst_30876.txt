the aim of the present study was to verify cpse levels in negative controls and hyperplasic dogs, considering cytological findings as the reference method and taking into account the fact that controls were middle-aged intact dogs , contrarily to previous studies carried out with very young control dogs.
significant differences of median cpse levels were found between controls and hyperplasic dogs ; and significant positive correlations were found between median cpse levels and age or prostatic volume .
the agreement between methods was found to be very high, notably between cpse levels and cytological results .
benign prostatic hyperplasia  is the most common canine prostatic disorder.
taking into account the non-specific character of clinical and ultrasonographic findings, a new diagnostic approach has recently been proposed based on the augmentation of blood canine prostate-specific arginine esterase  in hyperplasic dogs.
considering the results all together, measurement of cpse is confirmed as a useful and accurate method and should be considered as an alternative or complementary tool to conventional methods for the diagnosis of bph in middle-aged dogs.
although most or even all intact male dogs may develop bph by 5â€“ <dig> years of age, many show no clinical signs.
