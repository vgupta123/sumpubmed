natural compound withaferin a inhibited the predicted protein at its active site with - <dig>  kcal/mol binding free energy.
we modelled and refined the tertiary structure of lpkc using computational methods such as homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations.
tertiary structure of leishmanial protein kinase c was predicted and found stable with a rmsd of  <dig> Ã… during md simulations.
this structure of lpkc was used to reveal mode of inhibition of two previous experimentally reported natural compounds from withania somnifera - withaferin a and withanone.
both withaferin a and withanone were found stable within the binding pocket of predicted protein when md simulations of ligand-bound protein complexes were carried out to examine the consistency of interactions between the two.
