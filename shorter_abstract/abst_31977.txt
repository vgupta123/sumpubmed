we generated and analyzed  <dig>  amino acid sequence patterns, reporting highly specific patterns for each amyloid family, along with patterns likely to be involved in protein misfolding and aggregation.
however, such an approach requires the collection of accurate data, which are inconveniently dispersed among several generalist databases.
we therefore created a free online knowledge database  dedicated to amyloid precursor proteins and we have performed large scale sequence analysis of the included data.
amypdb is a comprehensive online database aiming at the centralization of bioinformatic data regarding all amyloid proteins and their precursors.
a wiki system is available to insert data into the database, providing a sharing and collaboration environment.
our sequence pattern discovery and analysis approach unveiled protein regions of significant interest.
