this information will be reported as close to the data as possible so the user can make his own judgment on the conclusions drawn for a particular study.
the comprehensive information management scheme that we plan to use for the development of an intuitive and user-friendly gpcr-oligomerization knowledge base  is the result of a community dialog involving experimental and computational colleagues working on gpcrs.
the increase in the frequency and number of reports about gpcr dimerization/oligomerization and the implication of oligomerization in receptor function makes necessary the ability to store and access information about gpcr dimers/oligomers electronically.
the requirements and ontology described here will facilitate the development of future information systems for gpcr oligomers that contain both computational and experimental information about gpcr oligomerization.
we present here the requirements and ontology  for an information system that can manage the elements of information needed to describe comprehensively the phenomena of both homo- and hetero-oligomerization of gpcrs.
