flavonol glycosides  are major components of soybean leaves and there are substantial differences in fg composition among genotypes.
based on substrate specificity of gmf3g2″gt, 2″-glucosylation of flavonol 3-o-glycoside may be irreconcilable with 4″-glycosylation in soybean leaves.
the first objective of this study was to identify genes responsible for fg biosynthesis and to locate them in the soybean genome.
gmf3g2″gt of nezumisaya showed a broad activity for kaempferol/quercetin 3-o-glucoside/galactoside derivatives but it did not glucosylate kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl-- and 3-o-rhamnosyl--.
the second objective was to clone the candidate genes and to verify their function.
based on ssr analysis, linkage mapping and genome database survey, we cloned a candidate gene designated as gmf3g2″gt in the molecular linkage group c <dig> .
genetic analysis suggested that two genes control the pattern of attachment of these sugar moieties in fgs.
hplc comparison with authentic samples suggested that fgs having glucose at the 2″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol were present in nezumisaya, whereas fgs of harosoy were devoid of 2″-glucose.
the gmf3g2″gt recombinant protein converted kaempferol 3-o-glucoside to kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside.
the open reading frame of gmf3g2″gt is  <dig> bp long encoding  <dig> amino acids with four amino acid substitutions among the cultivars.
nezumisaya may have a dominant whereas harosoy may have a recessive allele of the gene.
gmf3g2″gt encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase and corresponds to the fg <dig> gene.
