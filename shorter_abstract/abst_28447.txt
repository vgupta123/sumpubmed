the translocated intimin receptor , the intimin  and the tir-cytoskeleton coupling protein  represent three virulence factors implicated in the intimate attachment of the bacteria to the eukaryotic cell.
of the  <dig> tested strains,  <dig> strains  presented one or several polymorphisms in the tir and eae genes, which have never previously been described.
cattle are considered to be an important reservoir of ehec and epec strains for humans.
major variants have already been described for these genes among the different serogroups but minor variations have not often been studied.
nevertheless, the two major variants of tccp <dig> were statistically associated with the pathotype .
further investigations need to be performed on a larger number of strains in order to confirm this specificity.
most of the strains were found to possess tccp <dig> variants described in strains of serogroup o <dig>  nevertheless, three strains had tccp <dig> genes respectively described in strains of serogroup o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig>  moreover, none of the polymorphisms was statistically specific to the bovine or the human isolates.
moreover, no difference was observed between human and bovine strains regarding the presence of polymorphisms.
