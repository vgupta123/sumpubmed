for example, smooth muscle actin-expressing pericytes are ensheathed by the basal lamina of the blood vessel, and vesicle vacuolar organelles , subcellular mediators of vessel-retinal nourishment, are present.
abnormalities of these intraocular vessels are easily observed, enabling application of genetic and chemical approaches in zebrafish to identify molecular regulators of hyaloid and retinal vasculature in development and disease.
finally, we identify  <dig> genes with cell membrane, extracellular matrix and unknown identity that are necessary for zebrafish hyaloid and retinal vasculature development.
the retinal vasculature is a capillary network of blood vessels that nourishes the inner retina of most mammals.
we show a detailed morphological and developmental analysis of the retinal blood supply in zebrafish.
zebrafish have a retinal blood supply with a characteristic developmental and adult morphology.
developmental abnormalities or microvascular complications in the retinal vasculature result in severe human eye diseases that lead to blindness.
to exploit the advantages of zebrafish for genetic, developmental and pharmacological studies of retinal vasculature, we characterised the intraocular vasculature in zebrafish.
ultrastructure analysis shows these vessels to exhibit distinctive hallmarks of mammalian retinal vasculature.
