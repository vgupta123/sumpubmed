in the present study, we searched for putative interaction partners of ddit <dig> and the oncogenic fus-ddit <dig> among g <dig> cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases.
it is normally expressed at very low levels but is activated by cellular stress conditions and induces g <dig> arrest and, in some cell types, apoptosis.
the ddit <dig> gene encodes a transcription factor belonging to the ccaat/enhancer binding protein  family.
