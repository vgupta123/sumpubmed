several structure comparison methods have been integrated; sub-optimal structures predicted can be optionally involved to mitigate the uncertainty of secondary structure prediction.
the rdmas web server we describe here is an online tool for evaluating structural deleteriousness of single nucleotide mutation in rna genes.
rna deleterious mutations have attracted wide attentions because some of them in cells result in serious disease, and some others in microbes influence their fitness.
rdmas can be used to explore the structure alterations which cause mutations pathogenic, and to predict deleterious mutations which may help to determine the functionally critical regions.
intuitive illustrations are provided along with the original computational results to facilitate quick analysis.
with a user-friendly interface, the web application is easy to use.
mutations in ncrnas disrupting the structures of functional sites are expected to be deleterious.
