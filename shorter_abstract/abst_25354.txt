however, direct information on prg <dig> effects in neuronal development and, in particular, its putative spatio-temporal distribution and conditions of action, is sparse.
taken together, our data indicate that endogenous prg <dig> promotes neurite shaft protrusion and therefore contributes to regulating filopodia formation in immature neurons.
prg <dig> expression in more mature neurons, however, is predominantly localized in the axon.
our results rendered both scenarios unlikely:  prg <dig> over-expression had no influence on miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents  and  blocking of incoming signals did not alter prg <dig> distribution dynamics.
we demonstrate here that prg <dig> induces filopodia formation in hek <dig> cells depending on its n-glycosylation status.
in addition, prg <dig> levels did not interfere with intrinsic neuronal properties.
therefore we tested  whether dendritic prg <dig> re-enhancement influences synaptic currents and  whether synaptic inputs contribute to the prg <dig> shift.
furthermore, in early, not yet polarized hippocampal cultured neurons, prg <dig> was expressed along the neurite shaft.
after polarization, endogenous prg <dig> expression shifted mainly to axons, specifically to the plasma membrane along the neurite shaft.
this phenotype is rescued by expression of an shrna-resistant prg <dig> construct in prg <dig> knock-down neurons.
