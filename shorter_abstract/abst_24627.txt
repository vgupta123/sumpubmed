recent studies have been mainly focused on trichoderma reesei swollenin that show relatively low activity in the promotion of cellulosic hydrolysis.
a novel gene encoding a swollenin-like protein, poswoi, was isolated from the filamentous fungus penicillium oxalicum by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr .
our aim was to isolate a novel swollenin with greater disruptive activity, to establish an efficient way of producing recombinant swollenin, and to optimize the procedure using swollenin in facilitation of cellulosic hydrolysis.
using the cellobiohydrolase i promoter, recombinant poswoi was efficiently produced in t. reesei with a yield of 105Â mg/l, and showed significant disruptive activity on crystalline cellulose.
we present a novel fungal swollenin with considerable disruptive activity on crystalline cellulose, and develop a better procedure for using swollenin in facilitating cellulosic hydrolysis.
simultaneous reaction with both poswoi and cellulases enhanced the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose avicel by approximately 50%.
plant expansins and fungal swollenin that can disrupt crystalline cellulose have great potential for applications in conversion of biomass.
