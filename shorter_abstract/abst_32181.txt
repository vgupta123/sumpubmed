this article describes how we extracted gene expression profiles from biopsies of patients with chronic renal diseases, and used network visualizations and associated quantitative measures to rapidly analyze similarities and differences between the diseases.
uniform concordance in the regulation of all genes in the network.
chronic renal diseases are currently classified based on morphological similarities such as whether they produce predominantly inflammatory or non-inflammatory responses.
unexpected combinations of renal diseases that share relatively large numbers of genes.
the overall results suggest the need to define a molecular-based classification of renal diseases, in addition to hypotheses for the unexpected patterns of shared genes and the uniformity in gene concordance.
furthermore, the results demonstrate the utility of network analyses to rapidly understand complex relationships between diseases and regulated genes.
in contrast, recent studies in diseases such as breast cancer suggest that a classification which includes molecular information could lead to more accurate diagnoses and prediction of treatment response.
