we developed the genome environment browser  in order to visualise the integration of experimental data from large scale high throughput analyses with repeat sequence features that define the local genome environment.
the genome environment browser is a versatile program which can be easily adapted for displaying all types of genome data with known genomic coordinates.
specific queries for preliminary quantitative analysis of genome features can also be formulated, results of which can be exported for further analysis.
the development of genome wide experimental analyses of gene expression, chromatin modification and chromatin proteins means that it is now possible to identify potential links between chromosomal processes and the underlying genome environment.
there is accumulating evidence that the milieu of repeat elements and other non-genic sequence features at a given chromosomal locus, here defined as the genome environment, can play an important role in regulating chromosomal processes such as transcription, replication and recombination.
the availability of whole-genome sequences has allowed us to annotate the genome environment of any locus in detail.
