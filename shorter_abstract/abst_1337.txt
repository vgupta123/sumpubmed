one of these indels led to a frame-shift in the zn2cys <dig> transcription factor xyr <dig>  the general regulator of cellulase and xylanase expression, and resulted in its c-terminal truncation by  <dig> amino acids.
trichoderma reesei is the main industrial source of cellulases and hemicellulases required for the hydrolysis of biomass to simple sugars, which can then be used in the production of biofuels and biorefineries.

retransformation of strain qm <dig> with the wild-type xyr <dig> allele fully recovered the ability to produce cellulases, and is thus the reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype.
our data present a working example of the use of genome sequencing leading to a functional explanation of the qm <dig> cellulase-negative phenotype.
