information recorded includes details about the biological samples, procedures, protocols, and experimental technologies, all of which can be easily annotated using the appropriate ontologies.
files and raw data can be imported and associated with the biological samples via the interface, from either usersâ€™ computers, or commonly used open-source data repositories.
there is a need for user-friendly software tools to aid laboratory scientists in capturing the experimental information.
we present a web based software application to aid the laboratory scientist to capture, describe and share details about their experiments.
a web application called xperimentr has been developed for use by laboratory scientists, consisting of a browser-based interface and server-side components which provide an intuitive platform for capturing and sharing experimental metadata.
