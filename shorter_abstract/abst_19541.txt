knockout insertion mutants and over-expression lines indicated the role of erf <dig> in conferring salt tolerance in arabidopsis.
the ultimate goal of this work was to detect the role of transcription factors  concordantly expressed with genes related to programmed cell death  during pcd and salt stress.
based on the results of pcd assay, knockout  t-dna insertion mutants of arabidopsis as well as over-expression lines of two selected tfs, namely erf <dig> and tfiid <dig>  analogs to those in tobacco, were tested under salt stress .
results of knockdown mutant tobacco cells confirmed the influence of these two tfs during pcd.
genes up-regulated after 2 h of oa treatment with known function during pcd were utilized as landmarks to select tfs with concordant expression.
rna-seq analysis was done for tobacco  leaves exposed to oxalic acid  at 20 mm for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h to induce pcd.
knockdown mutants of these tfs were generated in tobacco via virus induced gene silencing  in order to detect their roles during pcd.
this work was based on the hypothesis that tfs and their driven genes likely co-express under different stimuli.
the conserved superfamily ethylene responsive factor  draw attention of the present study as it participates in the response to biotic and abiotic stimuli as well as to program cell death .
