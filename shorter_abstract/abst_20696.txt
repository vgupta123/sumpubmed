it is also seen in several newly collected wild-type strains and thus does not represent an adaptation to laboratory culture conditions.
in mammals this motif represents the target site p <dig> of protein kinase a  and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase i/iv.
a likely editing site complementary sequence is found in a downstream intron indicating that the synapsin pre-mrna can form a double-stranded rna structure that is required for editing by the adenosine deaminase acting on rna  enzyme.
similar to mouse mutants, synapsin knock-out flies show no obvious structural defects but are disturbed in complex behaviour, notably learning and memory.
synapsins are abundant synaptic vesicle associated phosphoproteins that are involved in the fine regulation of neurotransmitter release.
the n-terminal synapsin undeca-peptide containing the genomic motif  represents an excellent substrate for in-vitro phosphorylation by bovine pka while the edited peptide  is not significantly phosphorylated.
a deletion in the drosophila adar gene generated by transposon remobilization prevents this modification, proving that the adar enzyme is responsible for the pre-mrna editing described here.
