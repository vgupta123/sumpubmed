we then reduce this initial network by removing simple mediators , and formalize the resulting regulatory core into logical rules that govern the dynamics of each of the network components as a function of the states of its regulators.
we also found that the regulatory core yields an epigenetic landscape that restricts temporal patterns of progression between the steady states, such that recovered patterns resemble the time–ordered transitions observed during the spontaneous immortalization of epithelial cells, both in vivo and in vitro.
tumorigenic transformation of human epithelial cells in vitro has been described experimentally as the potential result of spontaneous immortalization.

to this end, we first integrate published functional and well–curated molecular data of the components and interactions that have been found to be involved in such cell states and transitions into a network of  <dig> molecular components.
this process is characterized by a series of cell–state transitions, in which normal epithelial cells acquire first a senescent state which is later surpassed to attain a mesenchymal stem–like phenotype with a potentially tumorigenic behavior.
our study strongly suggests that the in vitro tumorigenic transformation of epithelial cells, which strongly correlates with the patterns observed during the pathological progression of epithelial carcinogenesis in vivo, emerges from underlying regulatory networks involved in epithelial trans–differentiation during development.
