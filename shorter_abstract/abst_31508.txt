the results suggested that oswd <dig> genes may perform their diverse functions by complex network, thus were predictive for understanding their biological pathways.
the analysis also revealed that oswd <dig> genes might interact with each other to take part in metabolic pathways, suggesting a more complex feedback network.
all of these analyses suggest that the functions of oswd <dig> genes are diversified, which provide useful references for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies.
systematic characterization and co-expression analysis of oswd <dig> genes enable us to understand the networks of the wd <dig> proteins and their biological processes and gene functions in rice.
we also used a combined analysis of expression correlation and gene ontology annotation to infer the biological role of the oswd <dig> genes in rice.
under phytohormone treatments,  <dig> oswd <dig> genes were differentially expressed with treatments of one or more of the phytohormone naa, kt, or ga <dig> in rice seedlings.
in this study, we identify and analyze  <dig> potential oswd <dig> genes in rice, describing their gene structures, genome localizations, and evolutionary relationship of each member.
expression profiles covering the whole life cycle in rice has revealed that transcripts of oswd <dig> were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive development and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues.
