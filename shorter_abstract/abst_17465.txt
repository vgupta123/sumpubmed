a pumilio rna binding protein-coding gene, arabidopsis pumilio rna binding protein  <dig> , was obtained from this screening.
the apum5-pumilio homology domain  protein bound to the 3′ untranslated region  of the abiotic stress-responsive genes which contained putative pumilio rna binding motifs at the 3′ utr.
apum <dig> transcriptional profiling was carried out using a bioinformatics tool.
we also showed that some abiotic stress-responsive genes were negatively regulated in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants.
35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants showed hypersensitive phenotypes under salt and drought stresses during germination, primary root elongation at the seedling stage, and at the vegetative stage in soil.
these results suggest that apum <dig> may be a new post-transcriptional regulator of the abiotic stress response by direct binding of target genes 3′ utrs.
we found that apum <dig> was associated with both biotic and abiotic stress responses.
in contrast, apum <dig> was involved in the abiotic stress response.
however, bacterial and fungal pathogen infection susceptibility was not changed in apum <dig> transgenic plants compared to that in wild type plants although apum <dig> expression was induced upon pathogen infection.
