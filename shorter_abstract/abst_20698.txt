this study demonstrates that teratogen-induced limb dysmorphogenesis may be associated with alterations in mirna- <dig>  mirna-125b and mirna- <dig> expression.
the limbs of p <dig> positive embryos were more sensitive to cp-induced teratogenic insult than the limbs of p <dig> negative embryos.
the analysis of correlations between the expression pattern of the tested mirnas and cp induced limb phenotypes implies that mirnas regulating apoptosis may differ from each other with respect to their functional role in teratogenesis: some mirnas act to protect embryos, whereas other mirnas boost a teratogen-induced process of maldevelopment to induce embryonic death.
robust mirna-34a expression was observed in the fore- and hindlimbs of p53+/+ embryos exposed to  <dig>  mg/kg cp.
the dose of  <dig> mg/kg cp induced almost a two-fold increase in the level of mirna-34a expression as compared to that exhibited by p53+/+ embryos exposed to a lower dose.
however, this dose suppressed mirna-125b and mirna- <dig> expression in the fore- and hindlimbs of p53+/+ embryos.
increased mirna-34b and mirna-34c expression was also observed.
we evaluated how cp-induced alterations in the expression of these mirnas in the embryonic limbs correlate with embryonic p <dig> genotype and cp-induced limb phenotypes.
of note, this dose activated mirna-34a and mirna-34c in the forelimbs of p53-/- embryos.
it also suggests for the first time that p53-independent mechanisms exist contributing to teratogen-induced activation of mirna-34a and mirna-34c.
the ability of these mirnas to perform this function is mainly attributed to their ability to interact with the p <dig> tumor suppressor, which is a powerful regulator of the teratologic susceptibility of embryos.
when embryos were exposed to  <dig> mg/kg cp, the expression pattern of the mirna-34a/b/c was identical to that registered in the limbs of embryos exposed to  <dig> mg/kg cp.
