transcriptome sequencing was performed on in vitro adventitious root and leaf tissues using the illumina platform.
a putative withanolide biosynthetic pathway was deduced by mapping the assembled transcripts to the kegg database, and the expression of candidate withanolide biosynthesis genes -were validated by qrt pcr.
about 13% of the transcripts were unique to in vitro adventitious roots but no unique transcripts were observed in in vitro-grown leaves.

further, we demonstrated that in vitro leaf extracts exhibit anticancer activity against human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines at sub g <dig> phase.
we report here a validated large-scale transcriptome data set and the potential biological activity of in vitro cultures of w. somnifera.
this study provides important information to enhance tissue-specific expression and accumulation of secondary metabolites, paving the way for industrialization of in vitro cultures of w. somnifera.
however, only a few attempts have been made to identify key candidate genes involved in withanolide biosynthesis.
understanding the steps involved in withanolide biosynthesis is essential for metabolic engineering of this plant to increase withanolide production.
