these gene tags aligned  <dig> contigs with  <dig> mb of rice genome sequence, showing that brachypodium and rice genomes are generally highly colinear.
a dot-plot of brachypodium contigs against the rice genome sequences revealed remnants of the whole-genome duplication caused by paleotetraploidy, which were previously found in rice and sorghum.
the construction of the brachypodium physical map, and its comparison with the rice genome sequence demonstrated the utility of the snapshot-hicf method in the construction of bac-based physical maps.
a total of  <dig>  gene-related sequences were detected in the bac end sequences .
brachypodium distachyon  has been recognized as a new model species for comparative and functional genomics of cereal and bioenergy crops because it possesses many biological attributes desirable in a model, such as a small genome size, short stature, self-pollinating habit, and short generation cycle.
a bac-based physical map is one of them.
a physical map will facilitate analysis of genome structure, comparative genomics, and assembly of the entire genome sequence.
a total of  <dig>  brachypodium bac clones were fingerprinted with the snapshot hicf fingerprinting method and a genome-wide physical map of the brachypodium genome was constructed.
a draft of the physical map and its comparisons with rice and wheat are available at .
brachypodium contigs were anchored to the wheat deletion bin maps with the bes gene-tags, opening the door to brachypodium-triticeae comparative genomics.
the map represents an important genomic resource for the completion of brachypodium genome sequence and grass comparative genomics.
