three groups of topological properties were used in this study: network indices, degree distribution measures and motif profile measure.
in this study, we compared the metabolic network structures of eleven single cell organisms representing the three domains of life using these measurements, hoping to find out whether the intrinsic network design principle, reflected by these measurements, are different among species in the three domains of life.
metabolic networks in archaeal species are found to be different from those in s. cerevisiae and the six bacterial species in almost all measured higher-level topological properties.
our findings also indicate that the metabolic network in archaeal species is similar to the exponential random network.
if these metabolic network properties of the organisms studied can be extended to other species in their respective domains , then the design principle of archaea are fundamentally different from those of bacteria and eukaryote.
furthermore, the functional mechanisms of archaeal metabolic networks revealed in this study differentiate significantly from those of bacterial and eukaryotic organisms, which warrant further investigation.
all of which are higher-level topological properties except for the marginal degree distribution.
