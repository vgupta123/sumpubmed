genes that decline in expression with age and are thought to coordinate growth cessation have been identified in various organs, but their expression in skeletal muscle is unknown.
gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time pcr.
therefore, our objective was to determine expression of these genes  in skeletal muscle from birth to maturity.
we hypothesized that expression of these genes would decline with age in skeletal muscle but differ between sexes and between wild type and myostatin null mice.
female and male wild type and myostatin null mice  were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by decapitation at d - <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days of age.
expression of ezh <dig> was increased at d  <dig> and expression of mdk was increased at d  <dig> in myostatin null mice compared with wild type, but no other genotype effects were present.
in general, expression of these growth-regulating genes was reduced at d  <dig> compared with day  <dig> and d - <dig>  expression of gpc <dig>  mest, and peg <dig> was further reduced at d  <dig> and  <dig> compared with d  <dig>  however the expression of mycn increased from d  <dig> to d  <dig> and  <dig>  myostatin null mice, as expected, were heavier with increased biceps femoris weight at d  <dig>  however, with respect to sex and genotype, there were few differences in expression.
overall, these data suggest the downregulation of these growth-regulating genes with age might play a role in the coordinated cessation of muscle growth similar to organ growth but likely have a limited role in the differences between sexes or genotypes.
