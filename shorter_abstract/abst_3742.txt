to understand the molecular mechanisms that give rise to a protein's function, biologists often need to  find and access all related atomic-resolution 3d structures, and  map sequence-based features  onto these structures.
in this work, we provide a requirements analysis for several frequently occuring tasks in molecular biology and describe how design choices in aquaria meet these requirements.
finally, we show how the interface can be used to explore features of a protein and gain biologically meaningful insights in two case studies conducted by domain experts.
