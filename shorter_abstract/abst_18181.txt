these results indicate firstly, that the plasminogen coated beads binded selectively to prpsc and secondly, that a hr-us system can discriminate between scrapie affected and non-affected samples and thus has potential as a tool for the rapid diagnosis for prion diseases.
the aim of this study was to use hr-us to characterize the real-time interactions between plasminogen coated beads and prpsc and to determine if this approach could be applied to the identification of animals affected by prion diseases.
this approach has the significant advantage of not requiring a proteinase k pre-digestion step, which is routinely used in current prpsc detection assays.
