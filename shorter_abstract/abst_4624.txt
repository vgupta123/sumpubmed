both n and c clusters displayed high genetic diversity  of  <dig> , average genetic diversity over loci of  <dig> , mean private alleles  of 11), low differentiation, and an absence of an inbreeding depression signal .
management practices of african buffalo populations should consider the micro-evolutionary changes highlighted in the present study.
african wildlife experienced a reduction in population size and geographical distribution over the last millennium, particularly since the 19th century as a result of human demographic expansion, wildlife overexploitation, habitat degradation and cattle-borne diseases.
the results suggest that splitting of the n and c clusters occurred around  <dig> to  <dig> years ago.
we showed that the current genetic structure of southern african cape buffalo populations results from both ancient and recent processes.
the splitting time of n and c clusters suggests that the current pattern results from human-induced factors and/or from the aridification process that occurred during the holocene period.
the more recent s cluster genetic drift probably results of processes that occurred over the last centuries .
in this context, we assessed the “genetic health” of free ranging southern african cape buffalo populations  and investigated the origins of their current genetic structure.
the third  cluster, a tiny population enclosed within a small isolated protected area, likely originated from a more recent isolation and experienced genetic drift .
the analyses differentiated three significant genetic clusters, hereafter referred to as northern , central  and southern  clusters.
this study also highlighted the impact of translocations between clusters on the genetic structure of several african buffalo populations.
