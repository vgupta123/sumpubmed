text mining tools have gained popularity to process the vast amount of available research articles in the biomedical literature.
the results from this study will enable us in the near future to annotate semantic relations between molecular entities in the entire scientific literature available through pubmed.
we describe, compare and evaluate two frameworks developed for the prediction of non-causal or 'entity' relations  between gene symbols and domain terms.
the recent release of the evex dataset, containing biomolecular event predictions for millions of pubmed articles, is an interesting and exciting opportunity to overlay these entity relations with event predictions on a literature-wide scale.
we further construct a hybrid system combining the two frameworks and experiment with intersection and union combinations, achieving respectively high-precision and high-recall results.
more importantly, these studies help to enhance integration of text mining results with database facts.
finally, we highlight extremely high-performance results  obtained for the specific subclass of embedded entity relations that are essential for integrating text mining predictions with database facts.
in this paper, we investigate the performance discrepancy of  <dig> percentage points by benchmarking on a related and more extensive dataset, analysing the contribution of both the term detection and relation extraction modules.
studies of mining non-causal molecular relations attribute to this goal by formally identifying the relations between genes, promoters, complexes and various other molecular entities found in text.
