a large magnitude of an indigenous mnp  was obtained from white rot fungal strain g. lucidum in solid state bio-processing of wheat straw under optimized fermentation conditions .
an eco-friendly treatment of industrial effluents is a major environmental concern of the modern world in the face of stringent environmental legislations.
the maximally decolorized effluent was analyzed for formaldehyde and nitroamines and results showed that the toxicity parameters were below the permissible limits.
by keeping in mind the extensive industrial applications of ligninolytic enzymes, this study was performed to purify, and immobilize the manganese peroxidase  produced from an indigenous strain of ganoderma lucidum.
g. lucidum mnp was monomeric protein as evident by single band corresponding to  <dig> kda on native and denaturing sds-page.
in conclusion, g. lucidum mnp was immobilized by sol–gel matrix entrapment with an objective to enhance its practical efficiencies.
after  <dig> h reaction time, the industrial effluents were decolorized to different extents .
the sol- gel entrapped mnp seems to have prospective capabilities which can be useful for industrial purposes, especially for bioremediation of industrial effluents.
the present study was also focused on investigating the capability of immobilized mnp for decolorization of dye containing textile effluents.
to explore the industrial applicability of mnp produced by g. lucidum, the immobilized mnp was tested against different textile effluents.
the purified mnp  was immobilized using a sol–gel matrix of tetramethoxysilane  and proplytrimethoxysilane .
after ammonium sulfate fractionation and sephadex-g- <dig> gel filtration chromatography, mnp was  <dig> -fold purified with specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg.
