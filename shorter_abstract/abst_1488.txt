gxcc provides a novel link between rap and rac signalling and is one of the rap effectors regulating the progression of multicellular development.
deletion studies revealed that this pathway is involved in regulating dictyostelium development.
gxcc binds directly and specifically to active rapa and binds to a subset of dictyostelium rac proteins.
rap proteins belong to the ras family of small g-proteins.
in early development and chemotaxis competent cells rapa induces pseudopod formation by activating pi3k and it regulates substrate attachment and myosin disassembly via the serine/threonine kinase phg <dig>  rapa is also important in late development, however so far little is known about the downstream effectors of rapa that play a role in this process.
with a pull-down screen coupled to mass spectrometry, we identified the rac specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, gxcc, as rap binding partner.
dictyostelium rapa is essential and implicated in processes throughout the life cycle.
here we show that cells expressing constitutively active rapa exhibit a high level of rac activation.
