this study, for the first time, elucidated the embryonic expression pattern of drosophila, amphioxus, and zebrafish prl genes.
in amphioxus, initially prl gene is expressed ubiquitously during early embryogenesis, but its expression become restricted to the anterior neural tube in the cerebral vesicle.
in this study, we demonstrated and characterized the comprehensive expression pattern of drosophila prl, amphioxus prl, and zebrafish prls during embryonic development by either whole mount immunostaining or in situ hybridization.
our results indicate that drosophila prl is mainly enriched in developing mid-guts and central nervous system  in embryogenesis.
in zebrafish, prl- <dig> and prl- <dig> share similar expression patterns, most of which are neuronal lineages.
prl phosphatases have been implicated in a number of tumorigenesis and metastasis processes and are highly conserved.
however, the understanding of prl expression profiles during embryonic development is very limited.
phosphatase of regenerating liver  family is classified as class iva of protein tyrosine phosphatase  that removes phosphate groups from phosphorylated tyrosine residues on proteins.
