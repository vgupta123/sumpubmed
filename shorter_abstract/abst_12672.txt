in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy 60% had their second epileptic seizure within three months of seizure onset.
the objective of this study was to prospectively investigate causes for seizures  in a cohort of dogs with new-onset untreated seizures, and for those dogs with newly diagnosed epilepsy to investigate epilepsy type, seizure type and the course of disease over time, including the risk of seizure recurrence.

seventy-nine dogs  were diagnosed with epilepsy:  <dig> dogs  with idiopathic epilepsy,  <dig> dogs  with structural epilepsy and five dogs  with suspected structural epilepsy.
twenty-six dogs with idiopathic epilepsy  completed the study without receiving antiepileptic treatment.
untreated client-owned dogs experiencing new-onset seizures were prospectively enrolled in a longitudinal observational study including clinical investigations and long-term monitoring at the copenhagen university hospital for companion animals.
the natural course of idiopathic epilepsy  was illustrated by highly individual and fluctuating seizure patterns, including long periods of remission.
a baseline clinical assessment was followed by investigator/owner contact every eight weeks from inclusion to death or end of study.
the course of idiopathic epilepsy is highly individual and might not necessarily require long-term treatment.
epilepsy is the most likely diagnosis in dogs presenting with new-onset seizures.
