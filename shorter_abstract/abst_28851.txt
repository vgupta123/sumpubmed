strain and tissue-specific expression patterns furthermore provide a strong basis for studying the role of small rnas in regulatory networks as well as biological process like physiology and neurobiology that are extensively studied in this model system.
taken together, the small rna compendium described here advances the annotation of small rnas in the rat genome.
notably, our experiments also revealed robust strain-specific differential mirna expression in the liver that is caused by genetic variation between the strains.
we describe the expression patterns of known and novel micro rnas and piwi-interacting rnas.
we confirmed the expression of  <dig> known mirnas  and identified  <dig> mirnas homologous to known human or mouse mirnas, as well as  <dig> new rat mirnas.
digital gene expression  profiling has become an established tool to study rna expression.
