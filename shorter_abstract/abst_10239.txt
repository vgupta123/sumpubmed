however, comparing insertion sites between pneumococcal sequences indicates that they appear to transpose at a much lower rate than is elements.
box, rup and sprite repeats appear to have proliferated extensively throughout the pneumococcal chromosome during the species' past, but novel insertions are currently occurring at a relatively slow rate.
two families of repeats  have previously been identified in the genome of streptococcus pneumoniae, a nasopharyngeal commensal and respiratory pathogen of humans.
some large box elements in s. pneumoniae were found to encode open reading frames on both strands of the genome, whilst another was found to form a composite rna structure with two t box riboswitches.
analysis of the genome of s. pneumoniae atcc  <dig> revealed the presence of a third repeat family, which we have named sprite.
in conjunction with information regarding their distribution within the pneumococcal chromosome, this suggests that it is unlikely that these repeats are specialised sequences performing a particular role for the host, but rather that they constitute parasitic elements.
