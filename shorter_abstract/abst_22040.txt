all nd proteins from three model plant species arabidopsis, rice and physcomitrella were cloned as n- and c-terminal gfp fusions and subcellular localisations were determined.
phylogenetic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions were carried out for all proteins.
type ii nad dehydrogenases are located on the inner mitochondrial membrane of plants, fungi, protists and some primitive animals.
dual targeting of plant type ii dehydrogenases was observed to have evolved early in plant evolution and to be widespread throughout different plant species.
the dual targeting of ndc type proteins was found to have evolved later in plant evolution.
in addition two ndb type proteins from physcomitrella were also found to target chloroplasts.
