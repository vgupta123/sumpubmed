despite its important role during development, there are still relatively few genes with specific expression in the organizer and its derivatives.
to identify genes specific to the spemann/mangold organizer, we performed a microarray-based screen that compared wild-type and foxa <dig> mutant embryos at late gastrulation stage .
foxa <dig> is a forkhead transcription factor that is absolutely required for formation of the mammalian equivalent of the organizer, the node, the axial mesoderm and the definitive endoderm .
we identified  <dig> novel expression patterns in the node and  <dig> in the definitive endoderm.
we also found significant reduction of markers expressed in secondary tissues that require interaction with the organizer and its derivatives, such as cardiac mesoderm, vasculature, primitive streak, and anterior neuroectoderm.
however, the targets of foxa <dig> during embryogenesis, and the molecular impact of organizer loss on the gastrula embryo, have not been well defined.
we selected  <dig> genes without previously published data at e <dig>  and screened for expression by whole mount in situ hybridization.
the spemann/mangold organizer is a transient tissue critical for patterning the gastrula stage vertebrate embryo and formation of the three germ layers.
we could detect genes that were consistently down-regulated in replicate pools of mutant embryos versus wild-type, and these included a number of known node and de markers.
