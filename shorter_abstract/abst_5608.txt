in the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus b. tetramera kf <dig> from rhizospheric soil.
the results showed effective antimicrobial activity of agnps against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aeroginosa and trichoderma sp.
the nanoparticles were assessed for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy.
this phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction.
the capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles.
in conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus b. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.
at higher concentrations, however, aunps possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity.
cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on j <dig> and thp <dig> Î± cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of agnps, while aunps were non-toxic at both low and high doses.
silver  and gold nanoparticles  were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopic analysis.
