aep enabled the selection of the best models in 40% of all targets; compared to 25% for a normal ga.
intermediate rounds within the ga runs where unrestrained, linear growth of the model populations is allowed.
we apply the concept of alternating evolutionary pressure , i.e.
nevertheless, there are still potential improvements to be made in template selection, refinement and protein model selection.
