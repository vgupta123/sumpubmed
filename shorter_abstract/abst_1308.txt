trees of molecules uncovered the tripartite nature of life and the early origin of archaeal rprs.
the study provides a detailed account of the history and early diversification of a fundamental ribonucleoprotein and offers further evidence in support of the existence of a tripartite organismal world that originated by the segregation of archaeal lineages from an ancient community of primordial organisms.
ribonuclease p is an ancient endonuclease that cleaves precursor trna and generally consists of a catalytic rna subunit  and one or more proteins .
to study the evolution of this complex, we constructed rooted phylogenetic trees of rpr molecules and substructures and estimated rpp age using a cladistic method that embeds structure directly into phylogenetic analysis.
the general approach was used previously to study the evolution of trna, sine rna and 5s rrna, the origins of metabolism, and the evolution and complexity of the protein world, and revealed here remarkable evolutionary patterns.
finally, a census of protein domain structure in hundreds of genomes established rpps appeared after the rise of metabolic enzymes at the onset of the protein world.
