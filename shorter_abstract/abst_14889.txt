in the complete genome sequence of k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig>  approximately one-fourth of the genome encodes for hypothetical proteins .
three-dimensional model of the protein showed that its secondary structure topology and active site are similar with those found among metalloproteases where two his residues, namely his <dig> and his <dig> and an asp residue, asp <dig> in kpn_ <dig> were found to be zn-chelating residues.
as more k. pneumoniae strains are becoming highly resistant to various antibiotics, treatment of this bacterium has been rendered more difficult.
medical inflictions by the pathogen can range from respiratory and urinary tract infections, septicemia and primarily, pneumonia.
some members of this superfamily are metalloproteases which are involved in cell wall metabolism.
as lipoproteins and other components of the cell wall are important pathogenic factors, homology modeling of kpn_ <dig> was attempted to predict the structure and function of this protein.
we postulate that kpn_ <dig> is a zn metalloprotease and may play a role in bacterial cell wall metabolism.

structural biology studies to understand its structure, function and mechanism of action pose the possibility of utilizing this protein as a new drug target against k. pneumoniae in the future.
klebsiella pneumoniae plays a major role in causing nosocomial infection in immunocompromised patients.
blastp similarity search on kpn_ <dig>  revealed that majority of the hits were hypothetical proteins although two of the hits suggested that it may be a lipoprotein or related to twin-arginine translocation  pathway important for transport of proteins to the cell membrane and periplasmic space.
this situation, as a consequence, poses a threat to public health.
sequence analysis on the hps of k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> revealed that a particular hp termed kpn_ <dig>  contains a m15_ <dig> peptidases superfamily conserved domain.
due to their low homology and relatedness to other known proteins, hps may serve as potential, new drug targets.
