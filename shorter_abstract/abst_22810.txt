the existing software systems for microarray data analysis implement the mentioned standards only partially and are often hard to use and extend.
analysis functionality is based on r and bioconductor packages and can make use of a compute cluster for distributed services.
attempts to standardize the annotation of microarray data include the minimum information about a microarray experiment  recommendations, the mage-ml format for data interchange, and the use of controlled vocabularies or ontologies.
data integration via soap-based web-services is advantageous in a distributed client-server environment as the collaborative analysis of microarray data is gaining more and more relevance in international research consortia.
the emma  <dig> software has been designed to resolve shortcomings with respect to full mage-ml and ontology support and makes use of modern data integration techniques.
the system is based on the full mage object model.
our model-driven approach for automatically implementing a full mage object model provides high flexibility and compatibility.
