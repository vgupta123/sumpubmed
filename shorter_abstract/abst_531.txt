third, we analyze the hierarchical organization of network components of the whole inferred b-cell gene regulatory network by introducing a new approach which exploits the variability within the data as well as the inferential characteristics of c3net.
however, our current knowledge about the gene regulatory mechanisms that are governed by extracellular signals is severely limited.
the physical periphery of a biological cell is mainly described by signaling pathways which are triggered by transmembrane proteins and receptors that are sentinels to control the whole gene regulatory network of a cell.
overall, our study allows to highlight the peripheral gene regulatory network of b-cells and shows that it is centered around hub transmembrane proteins located at the physical periphery of the cell.
in addition, we identify a variety of novel pathological transmembrane proteins such as ion channel complexes and signaling receptors in b-cell lymphoma.
first, we infer a gene regulatory network from a large-scale b-cell lymphoma expression data set using the c3net algorithm.

second, we provide a functional and structural analysis of the largest connected component of this network, revealing that this network component corresponds to the peripheral region of a cell.
