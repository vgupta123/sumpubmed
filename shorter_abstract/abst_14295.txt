an essential first step in the genomic characterisation of a new species, in this case atlantic halibut , is the generation of est information.
a unigene collection of  <dig> functionally annotated ests has been assembled from atlantic halibut.
removal of ests and contigs that originated from bacteria or food organisms resulted in a total of  <dig> unique halibut sequences.
recombination efficiency of the libraries ranged from 91â€“98% and insert size averaged  <dig>  kb.
these have been incorporated into a publicly available, searchable database and form the basis for an oligonucleotide microarray that can be used as a tool to study gene expression in this economically important aquacultured fish.
redundancy within each library was very low and assembly of the entire est collection into contigs resulted in  <dig> unique sequences of which  <dig>  had matches in genbank.
