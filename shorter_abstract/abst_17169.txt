expressed from the recombinant ndv , hbd <dig> effectively inhibited the pseudomonal growths in cell culture media.
harassed with extensive epithelial burn wounds, patients can be affected by complications, such as infection, hypovolemic shock, hypothermia, and respiratory failure.
however, secondary bacterial infection is hard to be controlled in burn patients, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  is one of the top listed pathogens perturbing burn wounds beyond the antibiotics spectrum.
the newcastle disease virus  was used as a viral vector for the expression of hbd <dig> in burn wounds.
in a mouse model, severely burn-injured skin was recovered by the direct installation of the rndv-hbd <dig> infected cells in the burn wounds whereas that of control mice remained severely damaged.

to find the way for efficacious protection from the pseudomonas-mediated complications in burn patients, we assessed the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory values of human β-defensin  <dig> , which is known as a member of the cationic, antimicrobial peptides found in human cells of many kinds.
