our purpose was to obtain genome-wide expression data for the rabbit species on the responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  after in vitro stimulation by lipopolysaccharide  or phorbol myristate acetate  and ionomycin.
we report new data on the responses of pbmcs to lps and pma-ionomycin in the rabbit species, thus enlarging the set of mammalian species for which such reports exist.
lps induced an inflammatory response as shown by a significant up-regulation of il12a and cxcl <dig> at t <dig>  followed by an increased transcription of il <dig>  il1b, il1a, il <dig>  il <dig>  tnf, and ccl <dig> at t <dig>  surprisingly, we could not find an up-regulation of il <dig> either at t <dig> or at t <dig>  and detected a down-regulation of defb <dig> and bpi at t <dig>  a concerted up-regulation of saa <dig>  s100a <dig> and f <dig> was found upon stimulation by lps.
the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  was by far the most over-expressed gene at both t <dig> and t <dig> by comparison to mock-stimulated cells, confirming a major impact of pma-ionomycin on cell growth and proliferation.
the lps affected  <dig> to  <dig> times fewer genes than pma-ionomycin after both 4 hours  and 24 hours , of in vitro stimulation, in comparison with mock-stimulated pbmcs.
