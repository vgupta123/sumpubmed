these results demonstrate that whole larval injection with dsrna results in a high and systemic decrease of both mrna and protein in the bacteriome tissue.
to gain access to the different insect developmental stages, weevil females were allowed to lay their eggs on starch pellets and hatched embryos were collected by dissolving starch with water.
are among the most important cosmopolitan pests of stored cereal grains.
however, their biology and physiology are poorly understood, mainly because the insect developmental stages take place within cereal grains and because of the lack of gene specific molecular manipulation.
embryos were transferred between two glass plates filled with packed flour  to mimic compact texture of the cereal grain, and this system allowed us to recover specific developmental stages.
