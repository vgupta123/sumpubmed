a subset of rnaz predictions overlapping with trf <dig> and brf binding sites , which are plausible candidates of pol iii transcripts, have been studied in more detail.
taking a pessimistically estimated false discovery rate of 40% into account, this implies that at least some ten thousand loci in the drosophila genome show the hallmarks of stabilizing selection action of rna structure, and hence are most likely functional at the rna level.
the deep-sequencing of  <dig> drosophilid species coordinated by the nhgri provides an ideal data set of comparative computational approaches to determine those genomic loci that code for evolutionarily conserved rna motifs.
this class of loci includes the majority of the known small ncrnas as well as structured rna motifs in mrnas.
one subclass consists of those rnas that require distinctive secondary structure motifs to exert their biological function and hence exhibit distinctive patterns of sequence conservation characteristic for positive selection on rna secondary structure.
the intergenic rna structures, however, are concentrated much more closely around known protein-coding loci, suggesting that flies have significantly smaller complement of independent structured ncrnas compared to mammals.
the statistical evaluation of the rnaz predictions in comparison with a similar analysis of vertebrate genomes  shows that qualitatively similar fractions of structured rnas are found in introns, utrs, and intergenic regions.
