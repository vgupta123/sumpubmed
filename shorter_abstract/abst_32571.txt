the first block, referred to as dupa, contains a polymorphic  <dig> microsatellite; the second block, dupb, has a complex 4--8- <dig> polymorphic motif, known as rs <dig>  polymorphisms in rs <dig> have been associated with variation in sociobehavioral traits in humans, including autism spectrum disorders.
the arginine vasopressin v1a receptor  modulates social cognition and behavior in a wide variety of species.
finally, a phylogenetic reconstruction suggests two alternate evolutionary histories for this locus.
variation in a repetitive microsatellite element in the 5' flanking region of the v1ar gene  in rodents has been associated with variation in brain v1ar expression and in social behavior.
while our initial studies show no signs of directional selection on this locus in chimps, pharmacological and genetic association studies support a potential role for this region in influencing v1ar expression and social behavior.
thus, evolution of these regions may have contributed to variation in social behavior in primates.
in particular, the presence of both single and duplicated alleles in chimpanzees provides a unique opportunity to assess the functional role of this duplication in contributing to variation in social behavior in primates.
we examined the structure of these regions in six ape, six monkey, and one prosimian species.
there is no obvious relationship between the presence of the rs <dig> duplication and social organization in primates.
however, polymorphisms identified in some species may be useful in future genetic association studies.
as in humans, the microsatellites within dupa and dupb are polymorphic in many primate species.
