compound  <dig> inhibited fgf- <dig> induced angiogenesis by binding to its cognate receptors and is an addition to the small number of natural product inhibitors of angiogenesis
compound  <dig> -[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-}-β-d-glucopyranoside was the more hydrophilic and inhibited fgf-2-induced proliferation, wound healing, invasion in matrigel, tube formation and angiogenesis in large and small vessel-derived endothelial cells and also in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay.
we have investigated the anti-angiogenic potential of two naturally occurring stilbene glycosides  isolated from the medicinal plant boswellia papyriferai using large and smallvessel-derived endothelial cells.
angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature is associated with pathological processes, in particular tumour development, and is a target for the development of new therapies.
