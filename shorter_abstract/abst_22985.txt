the direct transcriptional activation of genes/mirnas that potentiate endocytosis  gtpase family) and autophagy  genes, beclin- <dig>  mir-33a) and the transcriptional repression of micrornas  that directly target the hbv pgrna and would inhibit hbv replication, contribute to hbx-mediated increase of hbv replication.
our chip-seq analysis of hbx genome wide chromatin recruitment defined the repertoire of genes and ncrnas directly targeted by hbx and led to the identification of new mechanisms by which hbx positively regulates cccdna transcription and hbv replication.
the hepatitis b virus  hbx regulatory protein is required for hbv replication and involved in hbv-related carcinogenesis.
protein-coding genes and ncrnas involved in cell metabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer were enriched among hbx targets together with genes/ncrnas known to modulate hbv replication.
chip-seq high throughput sequencing of hbx-bound fragments was used to obtain a high-resolution, unbiased, mapping of hbx binding sites across the genome in hbv replicating cells.
