our mtdna data indicates that the evolution of the different genetic groups is more related to ancient geological and climatic events  than to the current hydrographic configuration of the basins.
in general, mitochondrial and nuclear data supported the same relationships between populations, with the exception of some reduced populations in highly polluted basins , where the effects of genetic drift are suggested by the different analyses at the nuclear and mitochondrial level.
tectonic, volcanic and climatic events that produce changes in hydrographic systems are the main causes of diversification and speciation of freshwater fishes.
the freshwater ecosystems in central mexico are characterized by their genesis dynamism, destruction, and compartmentalization induced by intense geologic activity and climatic changes since the early miocene.
we addressed the phylogeography, evolutionary history and genetic structure of populations of z. quitzeoensis through a sequential approach, based on both microsatellite and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences.
significant genetic structure was found among populations at the mitochondrial and nuclear level .
all the populations analysed showed a remarkable number of haplotypes.
elucidate the evolutionary history of freshwater fishes permits to infer theories on the biotic and geological evolution of a region, which can further be applied to understand processes of population divergence, speciation and for conservation purposes.
however, in general the nucleotide diversity was low, π =  <dig>  .
<dig>  ×  <dig> years ago for lineage i and ca.
<dig>  years ago for lineage ii.
the level of gene diversity within populations was h¯d =  <dig>  .
