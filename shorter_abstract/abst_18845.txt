repeated measures analysis of variance were utilized to test for possible differences between treatment groups and a success/failure analysis was also employed, based on the need for rescue analgesia.
in a masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center pilot field study, dogs undergoing lateral retinacular suture placement for cranial cruciate insufficiency were randomly assigned to surgical site infiltration with at- <dig>  or an equivalent volume of saline.
we hypothesized that a single local infiltration of a novel bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension  would provide clinically effective analgesia over a 72-h period.

local anesthetics are an important component of perioperative pain management, but the duration of action of available products is limited.
further work is indicated to develop this product for clinical use.
at- <dig>  provided measurable local analgesia over a 72-h period following post-stifle surgery surgical site tissue infiltration.
for cmps-sf scores there was a significant overall treatment effect  in favor of at- <dig>  there were significantly more successes in the at- <dig> group compared to placebo over each time period .
forty-six dogs were enrolled and evaluated.
infiltration of the surgical site was done prior to closure.
