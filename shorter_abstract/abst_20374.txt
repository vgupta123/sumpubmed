the rules utilise general pathway-specific keywords, syntactic information and gene/protein mentions.
in contrast to existing text-mining efforts that target the automatic reconstruction of pathway details from molecular interactions mentioned in the literature, pathner focuses on identifying specific named pathway mentions.
on a gold-standard corpus, pathner achieved an f1-score of 84%.

pathner is based on soft dictionary matching and rules, with the dictionary generated from public pathway databases.
detection results from both components are merged.
yet, there has been little focus on enabling systematic detection of pathway mentions in the literature.
we developed a tool, named pathner , for the systematic identification of pathway mentions in the literature.
pathner is implemented in java and made freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pathner/.
biological pathways are central to many biomedical studies and are frequently discussed in the literature.
