janus kinases are important targets that are amenable to structure-based drug design.
structure-based drug design  can accelerate inhibitor lead design and optimization, and efficient methods including protein purification, characterization, crystallization, and high-resolution diffraction are all needed for rapid, iterative structure determination.
high-throughput cloning and expression methods were coupled with an abbreviated purification protocol to optimize protein solubility and stability.
practical criteria for construct performance and prioritization, the optimization of purification protocols to enhance protein yields and stability, and use of high-throughput construct exploration enable structure determination methods early in the drug discovery process.
one kinase-inactive murine tyk <dig> construct, complexed with an atp-competitive 3-aminoindazole inhibitor, provided crystals that diffracted to  <dig> – <dig>  Å resolution.
