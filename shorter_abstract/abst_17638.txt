recent advances in global genomic profiling methodologies have enabled multi-dimensional characterization of biological systems.
md-seegh is a new platform for the integrative analysis of diverse microarray data, facilitating multiple profile analyses and group comparisons.
with md-seegh, users have the flexibility to easily update datasets in accordance with new genomic builds, make a quality assessment of data using the filtering features, and identify genetic alterations within single or across multiple experiments.
to address this issue, we have developed an integrative genomic analysis platform md-seegh, a software tool that allows users to rapidly and directly analyze genomic datasets spanning multiple genomic experiments.
complete analysis of these genomic profiles require an in depth look at parallel profiles of segmental dna copy number status, dna methylation state, single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as gene expression profiles.
