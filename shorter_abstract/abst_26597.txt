we also argue here that the genes needed for viral genome replication, as well as for host cell lysis, belong to the "nonself" category of genes.
we show here that the previously proposed most conserved viral "self" determinants, the major coat protein and the packaging atpase, were the only proteins that could be recognized in all detected corticoviral elements.
furthermore, we suggest that abundance of pm2-like viruses in the aquatic environment as well as their importance in the ecology of aquatic microorganisms might have been underestimated.
one element in this discussion is the innate viral "self" concept, which suggests that viral structures and functions can be divided into two categories.
here we identified thirteen putative prophages  closely related to the virulent icosahedral tailless lipid-containing bacteriophage pm <dig>  using the comparative genomics approach, we present evidence to support the viral "self" hypothesis and divide genes of the bacteriophage pm <dig> and related prophages into "self" and "nonself" categories.
