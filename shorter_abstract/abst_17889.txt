the differential expression of mirnas between cultivars and their wild progenitor, together with our analysis of go annotation and confirmation of mirna: target pairs, might provide insight into know the differences between wild progenitor and cultivated cassava.
here, using ngs, we profiled small non-coding rnas and mrna genes in two cassava cultivars and their wild progenitor to identify and characterise mirnas that are potentially involved in plant growth and starch biosynthesis.
co-expression analysis revealed that the expression level of some targets had negative relationship with their corresponding mirnas in storage roots and leaves; these targets included myb <dig>  arf <dig>  grf <dig>  rd <dig>  apl <dig>  nf-ya <dig> and spl <dig>  which are known to be involved in plant development, starch biosynthesis and response to environmental stimuli.
more than  <dig> cassava mirnas have been identified in a conservation analysis and a repertoire of cassava mirnas have also been characterised by next-generation sequencing  in recent studies.
whereas  <dig> mirna families were highly expressed in cultivar leaves, another  <dig> mirna families were highly expressed in storage roots of cultivars.
analysis of the sequencing data revealed  <dig> conserved mirna families and  <dig> new mirna families.
six small rna and six mrna libraries from leaves and roots of the two cultivars, ku <dig> and arg <dig>  and their wild progenitor, w <dig>  were subjected to ngs.

the identified mirnas, target mrnas and target gene ontology annotation all shed light on the possible functions of mirnas in manihot species.
