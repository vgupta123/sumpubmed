5-lipoxygenase  is a key enzyme in the synthesis of leukotrienes and 5-oxo-6e,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetraenoic acid .
the catalytic cycles of the enzymes were reconstructed and kinetic parameters estimated on the basis of available experimental data.
this phenomena can be explained in terms of the pseudo-peroxidase activity of 5-lo and the ability of lipid peroxides to transform 5-lo into its active form even in the presence of redox inhibitors.
these inflammatory signaling molecules play a role in the pathology of asthma and so 5-lo inhibition is a promising target for asthma therapy.
the model enabled us to reveal differences between redox and non-redox 5-lo inhibitors under conditions of oxidative stress.
despite both redox and non-redox inhibitors suppressing leukotriene a <dig>  synthesis, redox inhibitors are predicted to increase oxoete production, thus compromising efficacy.
a mathematical model describing the operation of 5-lo, phospholipase a <dig>  glutathione peroxidase and 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase was developed.
the mathematical model developed described quantitatively different mechanisms of 5-lo inhibition and simulations revealed differences between the potential therapeutic outcomes for these mechanisms.
the final model describes each stage of cys-leukotriene biosynthesis and the reactions involved in oxoete production.
