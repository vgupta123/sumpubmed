short-term transcriptomic responses entailed a rapid stimulation of plant defence and abiotic stress signalling pathways, including ethylene and jasmonic acid signalling but also photosynthesis process regulation.

the combination of clustering, gene ontology categorization and time-series expression approaches revealed the diversity of gene expression patterns and biological processes affected by stem bending.
this syndrome affects tree productivity but is also believed to improve tree acclimation to chronic wind.
an analysis of the molecular impact of recurring bending found that the vast majority  of the genes differentially expressed after a first bending presented reduced or even net-zero amplitude regulation after the second exposure to bending.
however, data on the molecular processes underpinning mechanoperception and transduction of mechanical signals, and their dynamics, are still dramatically lacking in trees.
moreover, the global attenuation of the transcriptional responses, observed from as early as after a second bending, indicates the existence of a mechanism governing a fine tuning of plant responsiveness.
here we performed a genome-wide and time-series analysis of poplar transcriptional responsiveness to transitory and recurring controlled stem bending, mimicking wind.
trees experience mechanical stimuli -like wind- that trigger thigmomorphogenetic syndrome, leading to modifications of plant growth and wood quality.
