additionally, a new validity index is proposed in order to find the correct number of sub-grids in the image, and the correct number of spots in each sub-grid.
processing cdna microarray images is a crucial step in gene expression analysis, since any errors in early stages affect subsequent steps, leading to possibly erroneous biological conclusions.
extensive experiments on real-life microarray images and a comparison to other methods show that the proposed method performs these tasks fully automatically and with a very high degree of accuracy.
moreover, unlike previous methods, the proposed approach can be used in various type of microarray images with different resolutions and spot sizes and does not need any parameter to be adjusted.
moreover, a refinement procedure is used to correct possible misalignments and increase the accuracy of the method.
