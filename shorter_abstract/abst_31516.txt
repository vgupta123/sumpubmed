particularly, we uncovered substantial evolutionary rate variation among lineages, some of which are previously not reported.
subsequently we amplified, using experimental methods, many of these amplicons from diverse primate taxa, including a ring-tailed lemur, which is distantly related to the genomic resources.
here we present a method to develop numerous markers from putatively neutral regions of primate genomes.
we successfully developed numerous markers from putatively neutral regions of primate genomes using a strategy combining computational and experimental methods.
markers from neutrally evolving genomic regions may be particularly useful for inferring evolutionary histories because they escape the constraints of natural selection.
for the majority of taxa however, obtaining such markers is challenging.
diverse ecological and evolutionary analyses will benefit from these markers.
advances in genomics have the potential to alleviate the shortage of neutral markers.
