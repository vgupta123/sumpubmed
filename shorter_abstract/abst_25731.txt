it is assumed that multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells  reside in the periodontal ligament  and play a crucial role in regulating physiological periodontal tissue regeneration.
tissue samples were obtained from four healthy horses.
colony-forming cells were grown on uncoated culture dishes and typical in vitro characteristics of non-human msc, i.e.
due to the demonstrated in vitro characteristics cells were referred to as equine subcutaneous msc , equine gingival msc  and equine periodontal msc .
the equine periodontium provides tooth support and lifelong tooth eruption on a remarkable scale.
considering current concepts of cell-based regenerative therapies in horses, ep-msc might be promising candidates for future clinical applications in equine orthopedic and periodontal diseases.
primary cell populations were har-vested and cultured from the gingiva, from three horizontal levels of the pdl  and for comparison purposes from the subcutis .
colony-forming cell populations from all locations showed expression of the stemness markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  in vitro self-renewal capacity was demonstrated by colony-forming unit fibroblast  assays.
cfu-efficiency was highest in cell populations from the apical and from the mid-tooth pdl.
all investigated cell populations possessed trilineage differentiation potential into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages.
the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize equine periodontal msc.
self-renewal capacity, population doubling time, expression of stemness markers and trilineage differentiation were analyzed.
