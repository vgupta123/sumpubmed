these results implicate hsi <dig> as a negative regulator of drought stress response in arabidopsis, acting, at least in part, by regulating transpirational water loss.
instead, data are consistent with mutants experiencing a relatively milder dehydration stress following water withdrawal.
high-level expression of sugar inducible gene <dig> , also known as val <dig>  is a b <dig> domain transcriptional repressor that acts redundantly with its closest relative, hsi2-like <dig> , to suppress the seed maturation program following germination.
to test the potential requirement for hsi <dig> during abiotic stress, hsi <dig> single mutants and plants overexpressing hsi <dig> were subjected to simulated drought stress by withholding watering, and characterized through physiological, metabolic and gene expression studies.
mutant hsi <dig> hsl <dig> seedlings are arrested early in development and differentially express a number of abiotic stress-related genes.
the hsi <dig> mutant displayed lower constitutive and aba-induced stomatal conductance than wild-type and accumulated lower levels of aba metabolites and several osmolytes and osmoprotectants following water withdrawal.
plants with altered levels of hsi <dig> responded to exogenous application of aba and a long-lived aba analog, but the hsi <dig> mutant did not show altered expression of several aba-responsive or aba signalling genes 4Â hr after application.
the hsi <dig> mutants demonstrated reduced wilting and maintained higher relative water content than wild-type after withholding watering, while the overexpressing lines displayed the opposite phenotype.
metabolic and global transcript profiling comparisons of the hsi <dig> mutant and wild-type plants do not support a model whereby the greater drought tolerance observed in the hsi <dig> mutant is conferred by the accumulation of known osmolytes and osmoprotectants.
