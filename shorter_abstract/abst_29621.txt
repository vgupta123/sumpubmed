we found that the methylation profiles of  <dig> % of cytosines and the expression profiles of neighboring transcriptional start sites  were significantly negatively correlated.
dna methylation in promoters is closely linked to downstream gene repression.
however, whether dna methylation is a cause or a consequence of gene repression remains an open question.
if it is a consequence, then gene repression caused by chromatin modification may be stabilized by dna methylation.
an average promoter methylation is usually used in studies, whereas recent results suggested that methylation of individual cytosines can also be important.
our results indicate that direct and selective methylation of certain tfbs that prevents tf binding is restricted to special cases and cannot be considered as a general regulatory mechanism of transcription.
if it is a cause, then dna methylation may affect the affinity of transcription factors  for their binding sites .

the negative selection was stronger for transcriptional repressors as compared with transcriptional activators or multifunctional tfs as well as for core tfbs positions as compared with flanking tfbs positions.
we observed a strong selection against cpg “traffic lights” within tfbss.
