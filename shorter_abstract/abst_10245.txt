approximately 13% of dart markers mapped to identical map positions, thus the composite map contained  <dig> unique loci at an average interval of  <dig>  cm.
as the majority of dart markers contained on the map have been sequenced, the map provides a direct link to the e. grandis genome sequence and will serve as an important reference for progressing eucalypt research.
several high density linkage maps have recently been constructed for the main commercial forestry species in the genus  using sequenced diversity arrays technology  and microsatellite markers.
eucalypts are the dominant tree species in most australian ecosystems and of economic importance globally as plantation trees.
the composite map totalled 1107 cm and contained  <dig> markers; comprising  <dig> dart,  <dig> microsatellite and eight candidate genes.
genetic linkage maps are invaluable resources in plant research.
a robust reference linkage map containing sequence-based molecular markers is needed to capitalise on this resource.
to provide a single reference linkage map for eucalypts a composite map was produced through the integration of data from seven independent mapping experiments  using a marker-merging method.
the composite map represents the most saturated linkage map yet produced in eucalyptus.
eighty-one dart markers were mapped to two or more linkage groups, resulting in the  <dig> markers being mapped to  <dig> map positions.
