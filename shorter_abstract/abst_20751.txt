however,  <dig> perfect or imperfect direct repeats  with a high degree of at content were found within the intergenic spacer regions that may function as non-hr, ori-like regions found in grlegv, cpgv and adorgv.
<dig> drs were also found in intragenic spacer regions of anpenpv.
furthermore, there are still  <dig> and  <dig> conserved genes present in all baculoviruses and all lepidopteran baculoviruses respectively.
<dig> open reading frames  that putatively encode proteins of  <dig> or more amino acid residues with minimal overlap were determined.
in addition, the total number of genes common to all lepidopteran npvs is sill  <dig>  however the  <dig> genes are somewhat different from the  <dig> genes identified before because of some new sequenced npvs.
only  <dig> genes were found exclusively in all lepidopteran npvs and  <dig> genes were found exclusively in all group i npvs.
anpenpv encodes v-trex, which was observed only in cfmnpv and cfdefnpv in group i npvs.
anpenpv belongs to group i npvs and is most similar to hycunpv, epponpv, opmnpv and cfmnpv based on gene content, genome arrangement, and amino acid identity.
the g+c content of the genome,  <dig> %, was higher than that of most of the sequenced baculoviruses.
the completion and reporting of baculovirus genomes is extremely important as it advances our understanding of gene function and evolution.
