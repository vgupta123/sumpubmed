sh-sy5y cells were treated cd led to increase in intracellular ros levels.
basal constitutive gadd <dig> recruitment to the – <dig> /– <dig>  region of the bak promoter is observed in sh-sy5y cells.
the exposure of sh-sy5y cells to cd led to increase in intracellular ros levels in a doses and time dependent manner.
ros generation is not consistent with intracellular .
the mechanism cd induced cell death of neuroblastoma cells complex, involving cellular signaling pathways as yet incompletely defined but, in part, involving the generation of reactive oxygen species .
several studies have correlated gadd <dig> expression with cell death, but a mechanistic link between gadd <dig> and apoptosis has never been demonstrated.
gadd <dig> regulates bak expression by its binding to promoter region .
the exposure of neuroblastoma cells to cd led to increase in intracellular gadd <dig> and bak levels in a doses and time dependent manner.
the effect of gadd <dig> on the binding of c/ebp to the bak promoters were analyzed chip assay.
