<dig> % of the total biovolume represented cells in the form of small aggregates .
an increase of the total biovolume was observed .
in a previous study, we demonstrated that the high methane pressure  stimulated in vitro sr-aom activity.
anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulphate reduction  prevents more than 90% of the oceanic methane emission to the atmosphere.
