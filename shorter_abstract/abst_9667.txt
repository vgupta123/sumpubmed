comparative analysis of three mycobacteruim bovis and nine m. bovis bcg genomes shown that differences between “early” and “late” sub-strains bcg genomes were associated with specific prophage profiles.
surprisingly very different prophage profiles characterized bcg tice and bcg montreal genomes.
phylogeny of strains cohort based on genome maps restriction analysis and whole genomes sequence data were in agreement with prophage profiles.
bcg sub-strains whole genome comparative analysis and revealing the triggers of sub-strains transition were the purpose of our investigation.
the control of genome stability is relevant for the worldwide bcg vaccine preventing the acute forms of childhood tuberculosis.
pair-wise alignment of unique bcg tice and bcg montreal prophage sequences and bcg russia  <dig> genome demonstrated only similarity of fragmetary sequences that suggested the contribution of prophages in genome mosaic structure formation.
several prophages common to all bcg genomes included orfs which were homologues to caudovirales.
whole genome sequencing of three bcg russia seed lots  confirmed the stability of vaccine sub-strain genome.
control of the extended sequences is important for genome with mosaic structure.
