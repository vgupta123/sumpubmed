a library of  <dig> active site motifs has been created with promol, based on definitions published in the catalytic site atlas .
alignments are evaluated by visual superposition, levenshtein distance and root-mean-square deviation  and are reasonably consistent with related search methods.
searches with promol produce better than 50% useful enzyme commission  class suggestions for level  <dig> searches in ec classes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and produce some useful results for other classes.
recent improvements to promol, including the expanded motif library, rmsd calculations and output selection formatting, have greatly increased the programâ€™s usability and speed, and have improved the way that the results are presented.
promol is a plugin for the pymol molecular graphics environment that can be used to create active site motifs for enzymes.
we have implemented a novel method, to complement current approaches, which detects motifs solely on the basis of distance restraints between catalytic residues.
