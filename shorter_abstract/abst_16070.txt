we investigated the expression of p <dig> receptors on primary human b cells and lcls using the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  method for revealing the gene expression profile of the p <dig> receptor subtypes and their changes during transformation.
epstein-barr virus  infection immortalizes primary b cells in vitro and generates lymphoblastoid cell lines , which are used for several purposes in immunological and genetic studies.
in b cells, especially ebv-induced lcls, their expression and function have not been well studied.
the mrna transcripts of most p <dig> receptors were detected in primary b cells; the expression of p2x <dig> and p2x <dig> receptors was the lowest of all the p <dig> receptors.
by contrast, lcls expressed several dominant p <dig> receptors – p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  and p2y <dig> – in amounts similar to those seen in b cells infected with ebv for  <dig> weeks.
the amount of most p <dig> subtypes in lcls or ebv-infected b cells was lower than in normal b cells.
atp increased the intracellular free ca2+ concentration  by enhancing the ca2+ influx in both b cells and lcls in a dose-dependent manner.
these findings describe p <dig> receptor expression profiles and the effects of purinergic stimuli on b cells and suggest some plasticity in the expression of the p <dig> receptor phenotype.
this may help explain the nature and effect of p <dig> receptors on b cells and their role in altering the characteristics of lcls.
purinergic receptors, consisting of p2x and p2y, are activated by extracellular nucleotides in most tissues and exert various physiological effects.
