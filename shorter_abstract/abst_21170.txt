all qnr genes were in mdr strains carrying integrons containing the iscr <dig>  close to 88% of blatem- <dig> were linked to is <dig> while ≥ 80% of blactx-ms and blacmys were linked to isecp <dig>  only a few studies have identified a blactx-m- <dig> containing an isecp <dig> element as reported in this study.
there is therefore a need to monitor the spread of these highly resistant strains in developing countries through proper infection control and appropriate use of antimicrobials.
majority of tn <dig> containing integrons carried a complete set of transposition genes while class  <dig> integrons were borne on tn <dig> transposon.
the dfras were the most common cassettes and their prevalence was: - dfra <dig>  dfra <dig>  dfa <dig>  dfra <dig>  and dfra <dig>  the aada were the second most abundant cassettes and their prevalence was: - aada <dig>  aada <dig>  and aada <dig>  other cassettes occurred in lower prevalence of below 5%.
multiple genetic elements, especially those borne on incil, incfii, and incl/m plasmids, and their associated resistance genes were transferrable en bloc to e. coli strain j <dig> in mating experiments.
proliferation of such strains carrying multiple resistance elements is likely to compromise the use of affordable and available treatment options for majority of poor patients in africa.
this is the first detailed study on the prevalence of selected elements implicated in evolution of resistance determinants in a large collection of clinical e. coli in africa.
we determined the prevalence and evidence for physical linkage amongst integrons, insertion sequences, tn <dig> and tn <dig> transposons in a collection of  <dig> e. coli obtained over a 19-year period from patients in kenya.
