we also showed that these mir- <dig> members selectively cleaved one of the nf-ya genes, os03g <dig>  which is a ccaat-box binding transcription factor and participates in transcriptional regulation of large number genes.
in our previous study, we found that mir-169g was induced by the osmotic stress caused by drought via a dehydration-responsive element .
drought and high salinity are the most severe environmental abiotic stresses and cause crop losses all over the world.
in this study, we identified mir-169g and mir-169n  as high salinity-responsive mirnas in rice.
finally, we found one or more ath-mir- <dig> member that was also induced by high salinity.
mirnas silence their target genes at the post-transcriptional level.
we identified members of the mir- <dig> family as salt-induced mirnas and analyzed their evolution, gene organization, expression, transcriptional regulation motif and target gene.
the high degree of conservation and close phylogenic distance of pre-mir-169n and pre-mir-169o indicated that they were derived from a very recent tandem duplication evolutionary event.
the existence of a cis-acting abscisic acid responsive element  in the upstream region of mir-169n  suggested that mir-169n  may be regulated by aba.
our data also indicated that the salt-induction of some mir- <dig> members was a general property in plants.
mir-169n and mir169o were in a mirna cluster with a distance of  <dig> base pairs .
