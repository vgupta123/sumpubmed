the dataset we make available, together with other data reporting variability at both regulatory and coding regions of genes, represent a powerful tool for studies aiming to better understand the evolution of gene regulatory networks in humans.
ontology analyses on the differential tfbs-id further indicated several biological processes under natural selection in different populations.
together, our results strongly suggest that indels have an important role in modulating gene expression patterns in humans.
hundreds of tfbs-affecting indels  show a differential frequency between human populations, suggesting a role of natural selection in the spread of such variant indels.
a comparison with a dataset of known human genomic regions under natural selection allowed us to identify several cases of tfbs-id likely involved in populational adaptations.
a significant fraction of tfbs close to the transcription start site of known genes is affected by indels with a consequent effect at the expression of the associated gene.
differences in gene expression have a significant role in the diversity of phenotypes in humans.
