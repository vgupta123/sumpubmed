the analysis of  <dig> segment  <dig> sequences showed that only  <dig> % have been annotated for the presence of pb1-f <dig>  our analysis indicates that 75% of segment  <dig> sequences are likely to encode pb1-f <dig>  two major populations of pb1-f <dig> are of lengths  <dig> and  <dig> while minor populations include lengths  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  additional possible populations include the lengths of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  previously described sequences include only lengths  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  we observed substantial variation in pb1-f <dig> sequences where certain variants show up to 35% difference to well-defined reference sequences.
it provides an initial screen and annotation of pb1-f <dig> products.
pb1-f <dig> is a major virulence factor of influenza a. this protein is a product of an alternative reading frame in the pb1-encoding rna segment  <dig>  its presence of is dictated by the presence or absence of premature stop codons.
this virulence factor is present in every influenza pandemic and major epidemic of the 20th century.
