in particular, new inventions of chloroplast-specific mechanisms and the expansion of some gene/protein families detected in land plants lead us to suggest that the primary function of the additional nuclear-encoded components found in chloroplasts is the transgenomic suppression of point mutations, fixation of which occurred due to an enhanced genetic drift exhibited by chloroplast genomes.
thus, the complexity of chloroplast gene expression evolved to guarantee the functionality of chloroplast genetic information and may not, with some exceptions, be involved in regulatory functions.
this gain in complexity affects in particular rna metabolism, specifically the transcription and maturation of rna.
we inspected the available literature and genome databases for information on components of rna metabolism in land plant chloroplasts.
our inspections indicate that several chloroplast-specific mechanisms evolved in land plants to remedy point mutations that occurred after the water-to-land transition.
mature chloroplast rna is generated by a plethora of nuclear-encoded proteins acquired or recruited during plant evolution, comprising additional rna polymerases and sigma factors, and sequence-specific rna maturation factors promoting rna splicing, editing, end formation and translatability.
we further speculate that a fast evolution of transgenomic suppressors occurred after the water-to-land transition of plants.
