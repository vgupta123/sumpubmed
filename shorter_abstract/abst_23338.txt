steady state levels of no are suggested to act as an integrator of energy and carbon metabolism and subsequently, influence energy-demanding growth processes in plants.
global transcript profiling of seeds/siliques from wild type and transgenic plants under transient hypoxic and standard conditions using affymetrix ath <dig> chips revealed a rearrangement of transcriptional networks by athb <dig> overexpression under non-stress conditions, which included the induction of transcripts related to aba synthesis and signaling, receptor-like kinase- and map kinase-mediated signaling pathways, wrky transcription factors and ros metabolism.
seeds of transgenic athb <dig> plants did not accumulate no under transient hypoxic stress treatment, showed higher respiratory activity and energy status compared to the wild type.
under transient stress conditions transgenic seeds were able to keep low levels of endogenous no and to maintain a high energy status, in contrast to wild type.
overexpression of athb <dig> shifted seed metabolism to an energy-saving mode with the most prominent alterations occurring in cell wall metabolism.
in combination with metabolite and physiological measurements, these data demonstrate that athb <dig> overexpression improves oxidative stress tolerance compared to the wild type where a strong transcriptional and metabolic reconfiguration was observed in the hypoxic response.
seed metabolism is dynamically adjusted to oxygen availability.
athb <dig> overexpression mediates a pre-adaptation to hypoxic stress.
non-symbiotic hemoglobins have been shown to be involved in scavenging of nitric oxide  molecules, which play a key role in oxygen sensing/balancing in plants and animals.
higher weight of mature transgenic seeds demonstrated the beneficial effects of seed-specific overexpression of athb <dig>
