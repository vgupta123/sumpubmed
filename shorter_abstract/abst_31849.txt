these transcriptionally active regions represent novel exons of potentially unknown genes for future study.
the microarray design also allowed the detection of  <dig> and  <dig> novel transcriptionally active regions greater in length than  <dig> bp in unfertilized and fertilized t. castaneum eggs, respectively.
comparison of known drosophila melanogaster maternal genes to our results showed widespread conservation of maternal expression with t. castaneum.
our results lay a foundation for utilizing t. castaneum as a model for understanding the role of maternal genes in evolution.
maternal rnas play a critical role in early development.
identification of such pleiotropy is vital for proper modeling and testing of evolutionary theory using empirical data.
by studying maternal transcriptomes within and between divergent species, a better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on maternal rna allocation is possible.
we present the first maternal transcriptome of the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum.
using a tiled whole-genome microarray, we found that  <dig> % of t. castaneum genes are maternally loaded into eggs.
additionally, we found that many genes previously reported as having sex or tissue specific expression in t. castaneum were also maternally loaded.
