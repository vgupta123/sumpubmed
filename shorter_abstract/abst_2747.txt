our observations add a new layer of complexity to our current understanding of mt organization in plants, showing that not only do individual cmt dynamics influence cmt array organization, but that cmt organization itself has a strong effect on the behavior of individual mts.
however, it is an open question as to how cmt patterns may feedback to influence cmt dynamics and interactions.
the cortical microtubules  that line the plasma membrane of interphase plant cells are extensively studied owing to their importance in forming cell walls, and their usefulness as a model system for the study of mt dynamic instability and acentrosomal mt organization.
when comparing ordered  and disordered  cmt arrays, we found that disordered configurations show higher proportions of encounter-based catastrophe relative to free.
similarly, disordered cmt arrays have more catastrophes in general than ordered arrays.
to address this question, we investigated the effects of cmt array patterning on encounter-based cmt catastrophe, which occurs when one cmt grows into another and is unable to cross over.
we hypothesized that the varied cmt angles present in disordered  arrays will create more opportunities for mt-mt interactions, and thus increase encounter-based catastrophe rates and distribution.
encounter-based catastrophes were associated with frequent and sustained periods of pause prior to depolymerization, and cmts with tight anchoring to the plasma membrane were more prone to undergo encounter-based catastrophe than weakly-attached ones.
lastly, we show that the commonly used measure of catastrophe frequencies  can also be influenced by cmt ordering and plasma membrane anchoring.
these cmt patterns are controlled by the combined activities of mt dynamic instability and mt-mt interactions.
