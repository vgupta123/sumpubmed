further, very limited knowledge exists on structural variation in the gray wolf, the ancestor of the dog, or other closely related wild canids.
among the cnv regions that showed the largest differentiation between dogs and wild canids we found  <dig> genes, nine of which are related to two known functions associated with dog domestication; growth  and neurological function .
our results provide insight into the evolution of structural variation in canines, where recombination is not regulated by prdm <dig> due to the inactivation of this gene.
documenting cnvs variation in wild canids is essential to identify ancestral states and variation that may have appeared after domestication.
we also identified genes within the most differentiated cnv regions between dogs and wolves, which could reflect selection during the domestication process.
although a variety of genetic changes have been implicated in causing phenotypic differences among dogs, the role of copy number variants  and their impact on phenotypic variation is still poorly understood.
