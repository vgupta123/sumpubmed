they have been identified recently as cell type specific enhancers regulating developmentally essential genes in many species such as worm, fly and humans.
transcriptional hotspots are enriched for tissue specific enhancers near cell type specific highly expressed genes.
the genes neighbouring hotspots had a small overlap with hotspot genes in other cell types and were highly enriched for cell type specific function.
in es cells, differentially expressed genes after perturbation of activators were enriched for hotspot genes suggesting hotspots primarily act as transcriptional activator hubs.
in es cells, they are predicted to act as transcriptional activator hubs and might be under setdb <dig> control for silencing.
the in-depth analysis of hotspots across multiple cell types in same species still remains to be explored and can bring new biological insights.
we therefore collected  <dig> transcription-related factor  chip sequencing data sets in ten murine cell types and classified the peaks in each cell type in three groups according to binding occupancy as singletons , combinatorials  and hotspots .
transcriptional hotspots are defined as genomic regions bound by multiple factors.
hotspots were enriched for sequence motifs of key tfs in that cell type and more than 90% of hotspots were occupied by pioneering factors.
finally, we proposed that es hotspots might be under control of setdb <dig> and not dnmt for silencing.
the peaks in the three groups clustered largely according to the occupancy, suggesting priming of genomic loci for mid occupancy irrespective of cell type.
though we did not find any sequence signature in the three groups, the h3k4me <dig> binding profile had bimodal peaks at hotspots, distinguishing hotspots from mono-modal h3k4me <dig> singletons.
