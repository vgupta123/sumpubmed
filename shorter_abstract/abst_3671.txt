here we examine the expression of the expanded vegf family in prostate cancer, including the semaphorin  family members that compete with vegfs for neuropilin binding and can themselves have pro- or anti-angiogenic activity.
first, we used multivariate statistical methods, including partial least squares and clustering, to examine vegf/sema gene expression variability in previously published prostate cancer microarray datasets.
we show that unlike some cancers, such as kidney cancer, primary prostate cancer is characterized by both a down-regulation of the pro-angiogenic members of the vegf family and a down-regulation of anti-angiogenic members of the sema family.
in contrast to primary prostate tumors, prostate cancer metastases showed increased expression of key pro-angiogenic vegf family members and further repression of anti-angiogenic class iii sema family members.
given the lack of success of vegf-targeting molecules so far in prostate cancer, this suggests that the reduction in anti-angiogenic sema signaling may potentiate vegf signaling and even promote resistance to vegf-targeting therapies.
the combined analysis of bioinformatic data with computational modeling of ligand-receptor interactions demonstrated that enhancement of angiogenesis in prostate cancer metastases may occur through two different routes: elevation of vegfa and reduction of class  <dig> semaphorins.
therapeutic inhibition of angiogenesis in metastatic prostate cancer should account for both of these routes.
we found pro-lymphangiogenic signatures, including the genes encoding vegfc and vegfd, associated with primary tumors that ultimately became aggressive.
