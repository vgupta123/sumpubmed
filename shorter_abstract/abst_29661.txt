we found  <dig> tsgs with concordant cnl events and decreased gene expression in the tumor samples we examined.
remarkably, seven tsgs displayed concordant cnl and gene down-regulation in at least  <dig> tumor samples: mtap , pten , mcph <dig> , fbxo <dig> , smad <dig> , trim <dig> , and rb <dig> .
further network-based analysis revealed that these tsgs with concordant cnl and gene down-regulation were highly connected.
we identified  <dig> tsgs with copy number gain or loss in  <dig> tumor samples.
we further performed integrative analyses of cnv with gene expression using the data from the matched tumor samples.
copy number variation  is another important form of genetic variation, and is often involved in cancer biology and drug treatment, but studies of cnv in tsgs are less represented in literature.

the functional enrichment analysis revealed that the  <dig> tsgs were enriched in cancer-related pathways such as p <dig> signaling pathway and the p <dig> interactome.
among them,  <dig> tsgs tended to have copy number loss , from which fifteen cnl hotspot regions were identified.
in addition, there is a lack of a combinatory analysis of gene expression and cnv in this important gene set.
to meet this demand, we performed a systematic analysis of cnvs and gene expression in tsgs to provide a systematic view of cnv and gene expression change in tsgs in pan-cancer.
our findings of systematic concordance between cnl and down-regulation of gene expression may help better understand the tsg biology in tumorigenesis and cancer progression.
such a study may provide more insights into the relationship between gene dosage and tumorigenesis.
the genomic alteration of tsgs may cause tumorigenesis and promote cancer progression.
