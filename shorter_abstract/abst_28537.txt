here, we describe a simple and efficient method of isolating high-quality genomic dna for pcr amplification and enzyme digestion from calluses, various wild-type and transgenic plants.
dna extraction methods for pcr-quality dna from calluses and plants are not time efficient, since they require that the tissues be ground in liquid nitrogen, followed by precipitation of the dna pellet in ethanol, washing and drying the pellet, etc.
in addition, this method does not require expensive facilities for plant genomic dna extraction.
after centrifugation, the supernatant was directly used for dna template for pcr, resulting in successful amplification for rapd from various sources of plants and specific foreign genes from transgenic plants.
the need for a rapid and simple procedure is urgent, especially when hundreds of samples need to be analyzed.
this dna extraction procedure promises simplicity, speed, and efficiency, both in terms of time and the amount of plant sample required.
