biological actions of estrogens are mediated by the two specific estrogen receptors erα and erβ.
we describe here the generation of such cells, using an estrogen receptor negative heln cell line that was derived from hela cells stably transfected with an ere-driven luciferase plasmid.
these heln-fα and heln-fβ cell lines stably express either the alpha or beta  estrogen receptor tagged with the flag epitope.
for instance, the evaluation of such differing properties on the transcription of responsive genes using chip experiments was hindered by the deficiency of cells exhibiting the same genotypic background and properties but expressing only one of the ers.
the similar immunoprecipitation efficiency of both tagged receptors by an anti-flag antibody allowed the assessment of their kinetic recruitment on the synthetic luciferase promoter  by chip assays during  <dig> hours.
the use of antibodies directed against the flag epitope allowed a direct comparative evaluation of the respective actions of both ers using chip.
heln-fα and heln-fβ cell lines were found to express comparable levels of their corresponding tagged receptors with a kd for estradiol binding of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm respectively.
in mcf- <dig> cells, the recruitment of erα also exhibited a biphasic behaviour; with the second peak however not so important than in the hela cell lines.
in heln derived cell lines, no fundamental differences between kinetics were observed during  <dig> hours for flag-erα and flag-erβ, as well as for polymerase ii recruitment.
