our aim was to survey the expression of autophagy markers and amyloid precursor protein  in aged bovine brains.
furthermore, in aged bovine brains, immunofluorescence detected a strongly positive immunoreaction to app and lc <dig>  beclin- <dig> immunoreaction was weak or absent.
these data suggest that, in aged bovine, autophagy is significantly impaired if compared to young animals and they confirm that intraneuronal app deposition increases with age.
autophagy is a highly regulated process involving the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic macromolecules and organelles in mammalian cells via the lysosomal system.
western blot analysis confirmed an increased app expression and lc3-ii/lc3-i ratio and a decreased expression of beclin- <dig> in aged cows.
in young controls, the immunoreaction for beclin- <dig> and lc <dig> was mild while the immunoreaction for app was absent.
primary antibodies for app and autophagy markers such as beclin- <dig> and lc <dig> were used to perform immunofluorescence and western blot analysis.
