we propose that k-mer analysis of raw metagenome sequence reads should be implemented as a first quality assessment prior to more extensive bioinformatics analysis, such as sequence filtering and gene mapping.
finally, improved quality assessment will have a major impact on the robustness of biological and clinical conclusions drawn from metagenomic studies.
with the rising demand for metagenomic analysis of microbiota it is crucial to provide tools for rapid and efficient decision making.
here we demonstrate that the distribution of overlapping k-mers of metagenome sequence data predicts sequence quality as defined by gene distribution and efficiency of sequence mapping to a reference gene catalogue.
of note, k-mer distributions were also able to predict the frequency of sequences mapping to a reference gene catalogue not only for the well-defined serial dilution datasets, but also for  <dig> human gut microbiota derived metagenomic datasets.
this will eventually lead to a faster turn-around time, improved analytical quality including sample quality metrics and a significant cost reduction.
it is therefore of foremost importance to enable a robust and rapid quality assessment of metagenomic data from samples that challenge present technological limits .
we used serial dilutions of gut microbiota metagenomic datasets to generate well-defined high to low quality metagenomes.
we demonstrate that k-mer distributions of metagenomic sequence data identify sequence contaminations, such as sequences derived from “empty” ligation products.
