we use the linear noise approximation to model biochemical reactions through a stochastic dynamic model which essentially approximates a diffusion model by an ordinary differential equation model with an appropriately defined noise process.
the major advantage of the method is that in contrast to the more established diffusion approximation based methods the computationally costly methods of data augmentation are not necessary.
the application of the method to both simulated and experimental data shows that the proposed methodology provides a useful alternative to diffusion approximation based methods.
an explicit formula for the likelihood function can be derived allowing for computationally efficient parameter estimation.
given the prevalence of stochasticity and noise in biochemical systems inference for stochastic models is of special interest.
the proposed algorithm is embedded in a bayesian framework and inference is performed using markov chain monte carlo.
fluorescent and luminescent gene reporters allow us to dynamically quantify changes in molecular species concentration over time on the single cell level.
