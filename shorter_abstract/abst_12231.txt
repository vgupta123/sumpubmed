here, we manipulated maternal presence and pathogen exposure in families of the european earwig forficula auricularia to measure whether and how the survival rate and investment into two key immune parameters changed during offspring development.
our results surprisingly showed that maternal presence had no effect on offspring immunity, but reduced offspring survival.
our results show that, independent of their infection risk and developmental stage, maternal presence does not shape immune defense in young earwigs.
pathogen exposure also lowered the survival of offspring during their early development.
finally, pathogen exposure overall increased the concentration of hemocytes—but not the total-po activity—in adults, while it had no effect on these measures in offspring.
the concentration of hemocytes and the total-po activity increased during development, to be eventually higher in adult females compared to adult males.
this reveals that pathogen pressure is not a universal evolutionary driver of the emergence and maintenance of post-hatching maternal care in insects.
to optimize their resistance against pathogen infection, individuals are expected to find the right balance between investing into the immune system and other life history traits.
brunneum and the immune parameters were hemocyte concentration and phenol/pro-phenoloxidase enzyme activity .
in vertebrates, several factors were shown to critically affect the direction of this balance, such as the developmental stage of an individual, its current risk of infection and/or its access to external help such as parental care.
