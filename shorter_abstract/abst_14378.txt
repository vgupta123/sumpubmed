a series of 1h-imidazo- quinolin-4-amine derivatives, represented by luf <dig> -2-cyclohexyl-1h-imidazo quinolin-4-amine), are allosteric modulators of the human a <dig> adenosine receptor .
the observations from the present study are consistent with that predicted by mathematical modeling.
a simple explanation for the observation that luf <dig> has a much stronger effect on cl-ib-meca than on neca derived from the mathematical modeling is that neca has relatively strong intrinsic efficacy, such that the response is already close to the maximum response.
here we studied the modulation by luf <dig> of the maximum effect  of structurally diverse agonists at the a <dig> ar stably expressed in cho cells.
luf <dig> was found to be an allosteric enhancer of emax of structurally diverse agonists at the a <dig> ar, being more effective for low-emax agonists than for high-emax agonists.
luf <dig> exerted an emax-enhancing effect at a concentration of  <dig>  Î¼m or higher, and was shown to increase the emax of cl-ib-meca and other low-efficacy agonists to a larger extent than that of the high-efficacy agonist neca.
therefore, luf <dig> cannot enhance emax much further.
