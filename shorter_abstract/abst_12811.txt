all nine genes display dynamic spatial and temporal expression profiles within the larval shell field and juvenile mantle.
these expression data reflect the regulatory complexity that underlies molluscan shell construction from larval stages to adulthood, and serves to highlight the different ecological demands placed on each stage.
the use of both ancient and novel genes in all stages of shell construction also suggest that a core set of shell-making genes was provided by a shared metazoan ancestor, which has been elaborated upon to produce the range of molluscan shell types we see today.
while the genes involved in molluscan biomineralisation are beginning to be identified, there is little understanding of how these are developmentally regulated, or if the same genes are operational at different stages of the mollusc's life.
major developmental transitions in shell morphology often correlate with ecological transitions .
here we relate the developmental expression of nine genes in the tissue responsible for shell production – the mantle – to ecological transitions that occur during the lifetime of the tropical abalone haliotis asinina .
the evolutionary success of the molluscs can in part be attributed to the evolvability of the external shell.
