in contrast, low doses of both fractions inhibited pmn cell migration towards the inflammatory mediators il- <dig> and ltb <dig>  the anti-inflammatory activity was strongest for cw, where the pmn migration towards il- <dig> was inhibited down to dilutions of  <dig>
both mtb and cw inhibited spontaneous and oxidative stress-induced ros formation in human pmn cells and increased the phagocytic activity of pmn cells in response to bacteria-like carboxylated fluorospheres.
both fractions supported random pmn and f-mlp-directed pmn cell migration, indicating a support of immune surveillance and antibacterial defense mechanisms.
this study was performed to evaluate anti-inflammatory and immune modulating properties of the probiotic, spore-forming bacterial strain: bacillus coagulans: gbi- <dig>  .
the fractions directly modulated cytokine production, inducing production of the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  and inhibiting production of il- <dig>
both fractions further modulated mitogen-induced cytokine production in the following manner: both fractions enhanced the pha-induced production of il- <dig> and reduced the pha-induced production of tnf-alpha.
in addition, cell wall and metabolite fractions were assayed separately to address whether biological effects were due to cell wall components only, or whether secreted compounds from live bacteria had additional biological properties.
the data suggest that consumption of ganedenbc30tm may introduce both cell wall components and metabolites that modulate inflammatory processes in the gut.
