modeling of these integrations suggests that the previously identified sequences cover most of the sequence flanking the junction between the bacterial and human dna.
the functional and biological consequences of these bacterial dna integrations remain unknown.
further examination of these reads reveals that these integrations are rich in guanine nucleotides and the integrated bacterial dna may have complex transcript secondary structures.
the models presented here lay the foundation for future experiments to test if bacterial dna integrations alter the transcription of the human genes.
cancer is a disease driven by the accumulation of genomic alterations, including the integration of exogenous dna into the human somatic genome.
