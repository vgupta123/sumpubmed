western blot tests showed good immune response to all major proteins of the virus.
results of experimental vaccination against any lentivirus where vaccinees are challenged by natural routes, may therefore be of general interest.
compared with their unvaccinated siblings, natural infection was delayed in significant number of vaccinated twins born by seronegative and seroconverting mothers and vaccinated at birth,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> months with formalin inactivated whole mv vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide.
the maedi-visna  lentivirus causes two slowly progressive eventually fatal diseases of sheep, maedi, a progressive interstitial pneumonia, and visna, a progressive demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.
when aluminium hydroxide was added to the vaccine all vaccinees developed neutralizing antibodies to the vaccine strain at titers 1/ <dig> – 1/ <dig>  after housing  <dig> twin pairs, one twin in each pair vaccinated, the other unvaccinated, with infected sheep for  <dig> years, all the unvaccinated twins became infected, but only  <dig> of their vaccinated siblings as confirmed by virus cultivation experiments on tissues from their lungs spleens lymph nodes and choroid plexuses.
one twin in each of  <dig> female twin pairs, born into a maedi-visna-infected sheep flock and kept under natural farming conditions in cyprus, was vaccinated at birth,  <dig> weeks and  <dig> months, with formalin-inactivated whole maedi-visna lentivirus vaccine adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide.
maternal antibodies interfered with vaccination so early in life if the mother had old infection.
from 1991– <dig> experiments with formalin-inactivated whole maedi-visna virus vaccine were carried out in the department of microbiology at the university of iceland.
