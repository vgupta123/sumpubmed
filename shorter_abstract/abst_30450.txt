the analysis revealed a novel mirna, mir- <dig>  with potential regulatory effects on early embryogenesis, and involvement in neuronal cell differentiation/function in the brain during late embryonic and early neonatal development.
however, to date, no small rna profiling of the developing brain has been undertaken using this method.
we have performed deep sequencing and small rna analysis of a developing  mouse brain.
we have generated and analysed the first deep sequencing dataset of small rna sequences of the developing mouse brain.
this novel mirna has been identified as mir- <dig>
we identified the expression of  <dig> known mirnas in the e <dig>  developing mouse brain, which were mostly represented by let- <dig> family and other brain-specific mirnas such as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  we also discovered  <dig> putative 22- <dig> nt mirnas: mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig>  mm_br_e15_ <dig> and mm_br_e15_ <dig> each with a 70- <dig> nt predicted pre-mirna.
mm_br_e15_ <dig> biogenesis was dicer1-dependent and was expressed in e <dig>  blastocysts and e <dig> whole embryos.
