the genomes of two new c. trachomatis strains were sequenced, together with plasmids from six c. trachomatis isolates, including the new variant strain from sweden.
comparative analysis of the plasmid sequences has revealed the most conserved regions that should be used to design future plasmid based nucleic acid amplification tests, to avoid diagnostic failures.
there are two biovariants of c. trachomatis: 'trachoma', causing ocular and genital tract infections, and the invasive 'lymphogranuloma venereum' strains.
recently, a new variant of the genital tract c. trachomatis emerged in sweden.
moreover this analysis also shows that ocular and genital strains diverged from a common c. trachomatis progenitor.
chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted infections globally and the leading cause of preventable blindness in the developing world.
phylogenetic analysis of the plasmids and chromosomes are fully congruent.
this is essential knowledge if the plasmid is to be continued to be relied on as a key diagnostic marker, and for an understanding of the evolution of chlamydia trachomatis.
analysis of chlamydial plasmids and their cognate chromosomes was undertaken to provide insights into the evolutionary relationship between chromosome and plasmid.
