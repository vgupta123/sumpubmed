staphylococcus epidermidis, long regarded as an innocuous commensal bacterium of the human skin, is the most frequent cause of nosocomial infections associated with implanted medical devices.
the n/s ratios for virulence factors and surface proteins differed significantly from that of average snps.
we could suggest however that they were likely to belong to surface proteins or considered in priority as important for pathogenicity.
snps were detected in  <dig> pairs of orthologs with identical gene length, accounting for approximately 45% of the total pairs of orthologs.
of those gene pairs,  <dig> showed a disproportionate distribution of dn vs ds.
a comparison of strain atcc <dig>  a non-biofilm forming, non-infection associated strain and strain rp62a, a methicillin-resistant biofilm clinical isolate, revealed consistent variation, mostly single-nucleotide polymorphisms , in orthologous genes in addition to the previously investigated global changes in gene clusters.
assuming that non-synonymous mutations would mark recent evolution, and hence be associated to the onset of the pathogenic process, analysis of ratios of non-synonymous snps vs synonymous snps suggested hypotheses about possible pathogenicity determinants.
among those, the presence of the gene encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase suggested a possible involvement of reactive oxygen species.
our study proposed a novel approach to identify genes involved in pathogenic processes and provided some insight about the molecular mechanisms leading a commensal inhabitant to become an invasive pathogen.
some  <dig> genes of the list were of unknown function.
