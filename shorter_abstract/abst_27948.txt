they are distinguished, however, by the type of morf they tend to associate with, drosophila cpuorfs preferentially occurring in transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins and methyltransferases.
transcripts with cpuorfs constitute approximately  <dig> % of the total number of transcripts, a similar frequency to the arabidopsis genome, and have a mean length of  <dig> amino acids, much larger than the mean length of plant cpuorfs .
analyzing  <dig>  drosophila melanogaster transcript annotations and  <dig>  dipteran est sequences we have identified  <dig> putative conserved peptide uorfs  in drosophila melanogaster that show evidence of negative selection, and therefore are likely to be translated.
upstream open reading frames  are elements found in the 5'-region of an mrna transcript, capable of regulating protein production of the largest, or major orf , and impacting organismal development and growth in fungi, plants, and animals.
based on these data, it is clear that drosophila contain putative cpuorfs at frequencies similar to those found in plants.
