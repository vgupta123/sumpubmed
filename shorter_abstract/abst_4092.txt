both the apo- and holo-form of fnr interact with resd and plcr to form a ternary complex.
holo- and apofnr have similar affinities for the nhe and hbl promoter regions, while holofnr has a higher affinity for fnr promoter region than apofnr.
overall, this work shows that incorporation of the 2+ cluster is not required for dna binding of fnr to promoter regions of hbl and nhe enterotoxin genes or for the formation of a ternary complex with resd and plcr.
fnr has been subjected to in vitro fe-s cluster reconstitution under anoxic conditions.
diarrheal syndrome may result from the secretion of various virulence factors including hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin nhe.
bacillus cereus is a facultative anaerobe that causes diarrheal disease in humans.
uv-visible and epr spectroscopic analyses together with the chemical estimation of the iron content indicated that fnr binds one 2+ cluster per monomer.
atmospheric o <dig> causes disassembly of the fe-s cluster, which exhibited a half-life of 15â€‰min in air.
b. cereus fnr is a member of the crp/fnr family of iron-sulfur  proteins.
