as a step towards creating such computational links we developed a data-driven chemical systems biology approach to comprehensively study the relationship of  <dig> structural 3d-descriptors  of  <dig> drugs with the microarray gene expression responses  they elicited in three cancer cell lines.
as most compounds impact multiple targets and pathways, traditional methods for analyzing structure-function relationships are not comprehensive enough.
the analysis covering  <dig> genes was based on data from the connectivity map.
we decomposed the biological response profiles into components, each linked to a characteristic chemical descriptor profile.
integrated analysis of both the chemical and biological space was more informative than either dataset alone in predicting drug similarity as measured by shared protein targets.
for example, component  <dig>  strongly linked to dna damage response, while component  <dig>  was associated with metabolic stress.
