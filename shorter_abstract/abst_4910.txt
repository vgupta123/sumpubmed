the computationally efficient non-parametric, chiefly principal components analysis -based methods are thus becoming increasingly relied upon for population structure analysis.
for datasets with simple structures, the subpopulation assignments of individuals made by ippca were largely consistent with the structure, baps and awclust algorithms.
this systematic subpopulation assignment approach removes the need for prior population labels, which could be advantageous when cryptic stratification is encountered in datasets containing individuals otherwise assumed to belong to a homogenous population.
when subpopulations are closely related to one another, they overlap in pca space and appear as a conglomerate.
a novel population structure analysis algorithm called iterative pruning pca  was developed which assigns individuals to subpopulations and infers the total number of subpopulations present.
as genotypic datasets become ever larger, it is increasingly difficult to correctly estimate the number of subpopulations and assign individuals to them.
genotypic data from simulated and real population datasets with different degrees of structure were analyzed.
therefore, populations are structured into genetically distinct subpopulations.
