genomic and epidemiological studies have shown that b. mallei is a recently emerged, host restricted clone of b. pseudomallei.
this contrasted with 6/ <dig> positive clones  of a b. pseudomallei expression library screened with serum from  <dig> patients with culture-proven melioidosis.
compared with other bacterial species, the genomes of both b. mallei and b. pseudomallei contain a relative abundance of this family of proteins.
a total of 110/ <dig> positive clones  of a b. mallei expression library screened with sera from two infected horses belonged to this family.
members of the buha proteins are found in other gram-negative bacteria and have been shown to have important roles related to virulence.
a family of immunodominant antigens were identified that share protein domain architectures with hemagglutinins and invasins.
their effect on the cellular immune response to b. mallei and their potential as diagnostics for glanders requires further study.
using bacteriophage-mediated immunoscreening we identified genes expressed in vivo during experimental equine glanders infection.
