salmonella pathogenicity island - <dig> encodes a t3ss required for intracellular survival of the pathogen.
this work completes the characterization of the chaperone complement within spi- <dig> and identifies ssca as the chaperone for the ssec translocon.
here we report that ssca is the chaperone for the ssec translocon component.
we show that ssca and ssec interact in bacterial cells and that deletion of ssca results in a loss of ssec secretion, which compromises intracellular replication and leads to a loss of competitive fitness in mice.
genes in spi- <dig> include apparatus components, secreted effectors and chaperones that bind to secreted cargo to coordinate their release from the bacterial cell.
this bacterium uses two type three secretion systems  to translocate protein effectors into host cells to manipulate cellular function.
