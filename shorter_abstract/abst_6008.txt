evidence indicative of epithelial to mesenchymal transition was present at all study time points.
an increasing number of mirnas were differentially expressed compared with vehicle treated control animals as the study progressed.
our data reveal significant perturbations in canine skin mirna expression in response to mmpi administration.
histopathological changes were consistent with fibrodysplasia , characterised by fibroblast proliferation and the deposition of collagen in the subcutaneous tissues.
receiver operator curve  analysis revealed that mir- <dig> expression in the cervical subcutaneous tissue was a sensitive and specific biomarker of fd incidence.
matrix metalloproteinases  are a family of proteolytic enzymes involved in extracellular matrix  homeostasis.
cervical subcutaneous tissue and plasma were sampled during the time-course.
