the highest ratio of the secondary structure wobble site was  <dig> %, with the sequence alignments from structural comparisons of two proteins in the same family sometimes being completely different.
the results showed that  the three-dimensional  protein structures were not rigid: the root-mean-square deviation  of the backbone cα of structures with identical sequences was relatively large, with the average of the maximum rmsd from each of the  <dig> sequences being  <dig>  Å;  the derived data of the 3d structure was not constant, e.g.
17- <dig> february  <dig> proceedings of the ninth annual mcbios conference.
proteins may have several stable conformations and the data derived from resolved structures as a 'gold standard' should be optimized before being utilized as criteria to evaluate the prediction methods, e.g.
the coil ratio of the 3d structure could affect its resolution as determined by x-ray crystallography.
work on protein structure prediction is very useful in biological research.
to investigate the influence of the structure flexibility, we analysed  <dig>  protein structures of  <dig> unique sequences from  <dig> protein families.
helix/β-sheet transition exists in normal free proteins.
however, as proteins are dynamic molecular machines with structural flexibility such a standard may be unreliable.
