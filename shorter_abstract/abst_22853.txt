the user-friendly graphical user interface makes this a practical, stand-alone application.
compared with the traditional screening process based on a complex pubmed query, the svm tool reduced by about 90% the number of abstracts requiring individual review by the database curator.
synthesis of data from published human genetic association studies is a critical step in the translation of human genome discoveries into health applications.
the gapscreener, a free svm-based software tool, can be used to assist in screening pubmed abstracts for human genetic association studies.
we examined the literature on genetic associations with preterm birth as an example.
gapscreener is the first free svm-based application available for screening the human genetic association literature in pubmed with high recall and specificity.
the data source for this research was the huge navigator, formerly known as the huge pub lit database.
although genetic association studies account for a substantial proportion of the abstracts in pubmed, identifying them with standard queries is not always accurate or efficient.
