we tested the method's performance on sets of random protein cα segments between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids long, and a number of loops of length  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  fccd is fast, has a high success rate and readily generates conformations close to those of real loops.
most loop closure algorithms keep the bond angles fixed or semi-fixed, and only vary the dihedral angles.
this is appropriate for a full-atom protein backbone, since the bond angles can be considered as fixed, while the  dihedral angles are variable.
these methods require a method that alters both bond and dihedral angles, since the pseudo bond angle between three consecutive cα atoms also varies considerably.
however, many de novo structure prediction methods use protein models that only consist of cα atoms, or otherwise do not make use of all backbone atoms.
here we present a method that solves the loop closure problem for cα only protein models.
various forms of the so-called loop closure problem are crucial to protein structure prediction methods.
since the method alters both bond and dihedral angles, which is equivalent to applying a full rotation matrix, we call our method full ccd .
in de novo protein structure prediction, the problem is encountered when implementing local moves for markov chain monte carlo simulations.
we developed a variant of cyclic coordinate descent , an inverse kinematics method from the field of robotics, which was recently applied to the loop closure problem.
