these measurements for replication factory size now approach the dimensions suggested by electron microscopy.
the number of individual factories present in a single nucleus that we measure using this system is greater than has been previously reported.
these factories form in the nucleus during s phase and are sites of dna synthesis and high local concentrations of enzymes required for chromatin replication.
it has been difficult to analyse the structure of these factories as they are small in size and thus below the resolution limit of the standard confocal microscope.
we have used stimulated emission depletion  microscopy, which improves on the resolving power of the confocal microscope, to probe the structure of these factories at sub-diffraction limit resolution.
dna replication in human cells is performed in discrete sub-nuclear locations known as replication foci or factories.
the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea caused an approximately 40% reduction in number and a 30% increase in diameter of replication factories, changes that were not clearly identified by standard confocal imaging.
