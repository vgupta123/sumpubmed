in contrast, tas2r18p displayed a more complex history, suggesting an acquired function followed by a recent pseudogenization that predated the divergence of human modern and archaic species, which we hypothesize was associated with adaptions to dietary changes.
our results showed a similar worldwide distribution of allelic variation for most of the pseudogenes, with the exception of the tas2r6p and tas2r18p loci, both of which presented an unexpected higher frequency of derived alleles outside africa.
in this study, we analyzed patterns of variation at human tas2r pseudogenes in both african and non-african populations, and compared them to those observable in nonhuman primates and archaic human species.
human bitter taste receptors are encoded by a gene family consisting of  <dig> functional tas2r loci.
the human tas2r18p carried a species-specific stop-codon upstream of four polymorphic insertions in the reading frame.
since bitter taste is thought to help prevent the intake of toxic substances, diversity at tas2r genes could reflect the action of natural selection on the ability to recognize some bitter compounds rather than others.
snps at this locus showed significant positive values in a number of neutrality statistics, and age estimates indicated that they arose after the homo-chimp divergence.
at the tas2r6p locus, two snps were found in strong linkage disequilibrium  with variants in the functional tas2r <dig> gene, which showed signatures of selection.
