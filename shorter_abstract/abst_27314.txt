in previous studies, gene neighborhoods—spatial clusters of co-expressed genes in the genome—have been defined using arbitrary rules such as requiring adjacency, a minimum number of genes, a fixed window size, or a minimum expression level.
in the current study, we developed a gene neighborhood scoring tool  which combines genomic location, gene expression, and evolutionary sequence conservation data to score putative gene neighborhoods across all possible window sizes simultaneously.
mammalian gene neighborhoods contain highly and variably expressed genes.
we also found that gene orientation and protein-protein interactions are partially responsible for maintenance of gene neighborhoods.
non-essentiality, co-functionality, gene orientation, and protein-protein interactions are additional forces that maintain gene neighborhoods, especially those formed by tandem duplicates.

both the highest scoring and the largest neighborhoods in mammalian genomes are formed by tandem gene duplication.
our experiments using g-nest confirm that tandem gene duplication is the primary driver of non-random gene order in mammalian genomes.
using g-nest on atlases of mouse and human tissue expression data, we found that large neighborhoods of ten or more genes are extremely rare in mammalian genomes.
we expect g-nest to be useful for other applications such as the identification of core regulatory modules, common transcriptional backgrounds, and chromatin domains.
co-localized noisy gene pairs exhibit lower evolutionary conservation of their adjacent genome locations, suggesting that their shared transcriptional background may be disadvantageous.
