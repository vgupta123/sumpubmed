this study describes the morphological changes of reproductive development and the comparison of transcriptomes under various drought conditions.
different pathways may be activated in response to moderate and severe drought in reproductive tissues, potentially helping plant to maximize its yield and balance the resource consumption between vegetative and reproductive development under dehydration stresses.
md plants can produce similar number of siliques on the main stem and similar number of seeds per silique comparing with well-water plants.
our results showed more than four thousands genes with differential expression under severe drought and less than two thousand changed under moderate drought condition .
however, to date, most investigations on plant response to drought have focused on vegetative development.
interestingly, we also identified genes with alteration only under the moderate but not the severe drought condition, indicating the existence of distinct sets of genes responsive to different levels of water availability.
further cis-element analyses of the putative regulatory sequences provided more information about the underlying mechanisms for reproductive responses to drought, suggesting possible novel candidate genes that protect those developing flowers under drought stress.
the plants grown were studied under two drought conditions: minimum for successful reproduction  and for survival .
