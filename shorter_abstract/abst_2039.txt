sen seeks to increase the biological relevance of existing neutrality measures in two ways.
in this context, an rna sequence is considered robust if its neutrality  is greater than that expected for an artificial sequence with the same minimum free energy structure.
we evaluate several measures of neutrality for their ability to distinguish between alignments of structured rna sequences drawn from rfam and various decoy alignments.
we also introduce a new measure of rna structural neutrality, the structure ensemble neutrality .
first, it uses information from an alignment of homologous sequences to identify a conserved biologically relevant structure for comparison.
as a result, strategies for structured rna discovery rely heavily on identification of sequences sharing a common stable secondary structure.
however, correctly distinguishing structured rnas from surrounding genomic sequence remains challenging, especially during de novo discovery.
we find that several measures of neutrality are effective at separating structured rnas from decoy sequences, including both shuffled alignments and flanking genomic sequence.
finally, sen outperforms other measures of neutrality at detecting mutational robustness in bacterial regulatory rna structures.

furthermore, as an independent feature classifier to identify structured rnas, sen yields comparable performance to current approaches that consider a variety of features including stability and sequence identity.
