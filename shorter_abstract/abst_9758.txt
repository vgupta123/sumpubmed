we extracted such "common" sub-networks, defined as "phylogenetic network modules," using phylogenetic profiles and cluster analysis.
the enzymes in the same "phylogenetic network module" have similar phylogenetic profiles and related functions.
we conclude that phylogenetic network modules are evolutionary conserved functional units in the metabolic network.
we claim that our concept of phylogenetic modules provides a more accurate understanding of the evolution of biological networks.
