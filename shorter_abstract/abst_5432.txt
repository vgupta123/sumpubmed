probiotic bacteria have also gained considerable attention lately as treatment for rotavirus diarrhea.
of the six probiotic bacteria tested, lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg had the strongest influence in reducing prevalence, duration and severity of diarrhea and was therefore chosen for combination treatment with immunoglobulins.

oral delivery of specific immunoglobulins provides passive immunity and is a fast acting treatment for rotavirus diarrhea.
