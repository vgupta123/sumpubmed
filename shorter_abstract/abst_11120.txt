these results make the genus a model system for the study of complex chromosomal evolution in plants.
5s and 25s rdna loci among paphiopedilum species, representing all key phylogenetic lineages, exhibit a considerable diversity that correlates well with recognized evolutionary groups.
chromosome number is positively correlated with genome size, so rearrangement processes must include either insertion or deletion of dna segments.
paphiopedilum species display many chromosomal rearrangements - for example, duplications, translocations, and inversions - but only weak concerted evolutionary forces among highly duplicated 5s arrays, which suggests that double-strand break repair processes are dynamic and ongoing.
these plants have long been of interest regarding their chromosomal evolution, which involves a progressive aneuploid series based on either fission or fusion of centromeres.
phylogenetic analysis of cloned 5s rdna non-transcribed spacer  sequences showed evidence for both ancient and recent post-speciation duplication events, as well as interlocus and intralocus diversity.
we further studied sequence variation of the non-transcribed spacers of 5s rdna  to examine their complex duplication history, including the possibility that concerted evolutionary forces may homogenize diversity.
25s rdna signals range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  the latter representing hemizygosity.
