a comprehensive approach to evaluating network manipulation should take an "all of the above" perspective; we anticipate that theoretical studies of interaction modification, coupled with empirical advances, will ultimately provide researchers with greater flexibility in influencing system behavior.

we also apply the methodology to case studies from drought-induced signaling in plants and t-lgl leukemia and find that it is successful in both stabilizing desired behavior and in eliminating undesired outcomes.
understanding and ameliorating the effects of network damage are of significant interest, due in part to the variety of applications in which network damage is relevant.
here, we propose a complementary approach wherein interactions are instead modified to alter key regulatory functions and prevent the network damage from triggering a deregulatory cascade.
the methodology introduced in this report offers a complementary way to manipulating node expression levels.
we apply the approach to random boolean networks, and further show that the method can in some cases successfully repair synchronous limit cycles.
