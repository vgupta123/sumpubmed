we also introduce a simple and efficient way to compare the performance of different models predicting the rotational positioning of nucleosomes.
this paper presents the w/s scheme to achieve accurate prediction of rotational positioning of nucleosomes, solely based on the sequence-dependent anisotropic bending of nucleosomal dna.
one of the best established sequence patterns consistent with this anisotropy is the periodic occurrence of at-containing dinucleotides  and gc-containing dinucleotides  in the nucleosomal locations where dna is bent in the minor and major grooves, respectively.
sequence-dependent bending anisotropy dictates how dna is wrapped around a histone octamer.
this model accurately predicts the rotational positioning of nucleosomes both in vitro and in vivo, in yeast and human genomes.
about  <dig> â€“ 75% of the experimentally observed nucleosome positions are predicted with the precision of one to two base pairs.
we present a simple computational model, termed the w/s scheme, implementing this pattern, without using any training data.
