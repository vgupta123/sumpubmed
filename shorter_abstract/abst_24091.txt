the upgma analysis showed that plants from different geographical regions were distributed in different groups in both the species.
however, little is known about the genetic variation present in these species.
this anti-diabetic herb can lower blood glucose and cholesterol levels.
however, in both the species accessions from turkey did not group together and fell in different clusters.
in this report we describe the use of issr and rapd markers to study genetic diversity in both, trigonella foenum-graecum and trigonella caerulea.
genetic diversity parameters  were calculated for issr, rapd and issr+rapd approaches in both the species.
implications of these observations in the analysis of genetic diversity and in supporting the possible center of origin and/or diversity for trigonella are discussed.
seventeen accessions of trigonella foenum-graecum and nine accessions of trigonella caerulea representing various countries were analyzed using issr and rapd markers.
the genetic similarity matrices generated by issr and rapd markers in both species were highly correlated  indicating congruence between these two systems.
various species of genus trigonella are important from medical and culinary aspect.
another species, trigonella caerulea is used as food in the form of young seedlings.
among these, trigonella foenum-graecum is commonly grown as a vegetable.
dendrograms were constructed using upgma algorithm based on the similarity index values for both trigonella foenum-graecum and trigonella caerulea.
in trigonella foenum-graecum accessions from pakistan and afghanistan were grouped together in one cluster but accessions from india and nepal were grouped together in another cluster.
based on genetic similarity indices, higher diversity was observed in trigonella caerulea as compared to trigonella foenum-graecum.
