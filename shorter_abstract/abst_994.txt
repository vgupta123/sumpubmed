we have identified and characterized camnuc <dig>  a 32 kda ca2+/mg2+-dependent nuclease of the s1/p <dig> family induced by the topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin in maize cultured cells.
camptothecin inhibits cultured cell growth, induces genomic dna degradation, and induces a 32 kda ca2+/mg2+-dependent nuclease activity.
this type of nucleases are usually zn2+-dependent but our results support previous indications that s1-type nucleases have a wide variety of enzyme activities, including ca2+/mg2+-dependent.
camptothecin is a plant alkaloid that specifically binds topoisomerase i, inhibiting its activity and inducing double stranded breaks in dna and activating the cell responses to dna damage.
