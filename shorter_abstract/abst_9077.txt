horizontal gene transfer  is considered a strong evolutionary force shaping the content of microbial genomes in a substantial manner.
multiple tests are used to identify putatively alien genes, to predict putative donors and to mask putatively highly expressed genes.
we have implemented the program sigi-hmm that predicts gis and the putative donor of each individual alien gene.
it is the difference in speed enabling the rapid adaptation to changing environmental demands that distinguishes hgt from gene genesis, duplications or mutations.
frequently, the transferred pieces of dna have a considerable length, comprise several genes and are called genomic islands  or more specifically pathogenicity or symbiotic islands.
for the transition probabilities, we draw upon classical test theory with the intention of integrating a sensitivity controller in a consistent manner.
it is based on the analysis of codon usage  of each individual gene of a genome under study.
thus, we determine the states and emission probabilities of an inhomogeneous hidden markov model working on gene level.
sigi-hmm is a sensitive tool for the identification of gis in microbial genomes.
