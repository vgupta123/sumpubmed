the major and minor groove contact predictions stood out in terms of their poor predictability from sequences or pssm, which was very strongly  compensated by the addition of secondary structure and solvent accessibility information, revealing a predominant role of local protein structure in the major/minor groove dna-recognition.
the aim of this work is to take a protein sequence or structural features as inputs and predict for each amino acid residue if it binds to dna at locations identified by one of the four possible mononucleotides or one of the  <dig> unique dinucleotide steps.
in general, pssm-based predictions, supported by secondary structure and solvent accessibility, achieve a good predictability of ~70â€“80%, measured by the area under the curve  of roc graphs.
significant differences in residue preferences for specific contacts are observed, which combined with other features, lead to promising levels of prediction.
in terms of side chain, backbone and major or minor groove atoms of dna.
in this work, we formulate the problem of predicting specific dna-binding sites in terms of contacts between the residue environments of proteins and the identity of a mononucleotide or a dinucleotide step in dna.
following a detailed analysis of results, a web server to predict mononucleotide and dinucleotide-step contacts using pssm was developed and made available at  or .
major and minor groove contacts, however, depend profoundly on the local structure.
