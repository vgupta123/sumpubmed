in switzerland transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  in small ruminants have been monitored since  <dig>  while in the most recent tse cases a bse infection could be excluded, for historical cases techniques to discriminate scrapie from bse had not been available at the time of diagnosis and thus their status remained unclear.
a bayesian prevalence calculation resulted in most likely estimates of one case of bse, five cases of classical scrapie and  <dig> cases of atypical scrapie per 100' <dig> small ruminants.
the aim was to come to a statistically based overall assessment of the tse situation in the domestic small ruminant population in switzerland.
in summary, these data indicate that despite a significant epidemic of bse in cattle, there is no evidence that bse established in the small ruminant population in switzerland.
in sum  <dig> tse cases were identified in small ruminants in switzerland since  <dig>  of which eight were atypical and six were classical scrapie.
in this situation the extent of tse surveillance in small ruminants requires reevaluation based on cost-benefit analysis.
we herein applied state-of-the-art techniques to retrospectively classify these animals and to re-analyze the affected flocks for secondary cases.
classical and atypical scrapie both occur at a very low level and are not expected to escalate into an epidemic.
these results were the basis for models, simulating the course of tses over a period of  <dig> years.
in a closed population, they are rather expected to fade out in the next decades or, in case of a sporadic origin, may remain at a very low level.
in none of the affected flocks, secondary cases were identified.
after bovine spongiform encephalopathy  emerged in european cattle livestock in  <dig> a fundamental question was whether the agent established also in the small ruminants' population.
we found no evidence for an infection with the bse agent in the cases under investigation.
