however, because cystic fibrosis lungs represent ecologically complex and hostile environments, the selective forces driving this diversification in vivo remain unclear.
we took an experimental evolution approach to test the hypothesis that sub-inhibitory antibiotics can drive diversification of p. aeruginosa populations.
our study indicates that certain antibiotics can promote population diversification when present in sub-inhibitory concentrations.
replicate populations of p. aeruginosa lesb <dig> were cultured for seven days in artificial sputum medium with and without sub-inhibitory concentrations of various clinically relevant antibiotics.
alterations in colony morphology and pyocyanin production were observed following exposure to ceftazidime and colistin only.
hence, the choice of antibiotic may have previously unforeseen implications for the development of p. aeruginosa infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.
divergence occurred due to alterations in antimicrobial susceptibility profiles following exposure to azithromycin, ceftazidime and colistin.
we then characterised diversification with respect to  <dig> phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.
