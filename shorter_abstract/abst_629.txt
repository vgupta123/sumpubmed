recent genomic and bioinformatic advances have motivated the development of numerous network models intending to describe graphs of biological, technological, and sociological origin.
we show that different duplication-mutation schemes best describe the e. coli genetic network, the s. cerevisiae protein interaction network, and the c. elegans neuronal network, out of a set of network models including a linear preferential attachment model and a small-world model.
our method is a first step towards systematizing network models and assessing their predictability, and we anticipate its usefulness for a number of communities.
in such cases, these few target features are insufficient to distinguish which of the different models best describes real world networks of interest; moreover, it is not clear a priori that any of the presently-existing algorithms for network generation offers a predictive description of the networks inspiring them.
in most cases the success of a model has been evaluated by how well it reproduces a few key features of the real-world data, such as degree distributions, mean geodesic lengths, and clustering coefficients.
often pairs of models can reproduce these features with indistinguishable fidelity despite being generated by vastly different mechanisms.
