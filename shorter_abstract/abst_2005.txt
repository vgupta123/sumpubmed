in this context, optimizing experiments to be conducted in order to better estimate a system’s parameters provides a promising direction to alleviate the difficulty of the task.
dynamical models used in systems biology involve unknown kinetic parameters.
borrowing ideas from bayesian experimental design and active learning, we propose a new strategy for optimal experimental design in the context of kinetic parameter estimation in systems biology.
this analysis demonstrates that our new, fully automatic bayesian optimal experimental design strategy has the potential to support the design of experiments for kinetic parameter estimation in systems biology.
