furthermore, experimental results show the good performance of regnet.
they are very often more precise than linear regression models because they can add just different linear regressions to separate areas of the search space favoring to infer localized similarities over a more global similarity.
correlation-based methods are very useful in order to determine whether two genes have a strong global similarity but do not detect local similarities.
regnet generates gene association networks from gene expression data, and differs from correlation-based methods in that the relationship between one gene and others is calculated simultaneously.
model trees are very useful techniques to estimate the numerical values for the target genes by linear regression functions.
first, the biological coherence of the results are tested.
second the e.coli transcriptional network  is used as control to compare the results to that of a correlation-based method.
the performance of our approach, named regnet, is experimentally tested on two well-known data sets: saccharomyces cerevisiae and e.coli data set.
they are typically generated using correlation statistics as pairwise similarity measures.
for this reason we apply a statistical procedure to control the false discovery rate.
we propose model trees as a method to identify gene interaction networks.
this experiment shows that regnet performs more accurately at detecting true gene associations than the pearson and spearman zeroth and first-order correlation-based methods.
