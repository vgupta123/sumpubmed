the ltr  retrotransposons of higher plants are replicated by a mutagenic life cycle containing transcription and reverse transcription steps.
here, we present evidence for another potential mechanism for the creation of complex elements, involving abnormal template switching during reverse transcription.
complex elements, where two elements share an ltr, are not uncommon.
those complex elements are part of the genome structure of plants in the poaceae, especially in the triticeae, but not of arabidopsis.
they are thought to result from heterologous recombination between two adjacent elements that occurs following their integration.
