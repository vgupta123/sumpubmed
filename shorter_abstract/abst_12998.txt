plasmodium falciparum cysteine proteases  play indispensable roles in parasite infection and development, especially in the process of host erythrocyte rupture/invasion and hemoglobin degradation.
emsa analysis elucidated binding of distinct nuclear factors to specific sequences within the 5'upstream regions of falcipain genes.
however, we did find parasite specific sequence elements such as poly poly tracts, ccaat boxes and a single  <dig> bp-g rich sequence, ngggg in the 5' upstream regulatory regions of these genes, thereby suggesting the role of plasmodium specific transcriptional factors in the regulation of falcipain genes.
taken together, these results suggest that expression of plasmodium cysteine proteases is regulated at the transcriptional level and parasite specific factors regulate the expression of falcipain genes.
in this study, using a combination of transient transfection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays , we demonstrate the presence of stage specific nuclear factors that bind to unique sequence elements in the 5'upstream regions of the falcipains and probably modulate the expression of cysteine proteases.
falcipains differ in their timing of expression and exhibit ability to compensate each other's functions at asexual blood stages of the parasite.
no detailed molecular analysis of transcriptional regulation of parasite proteases especially cysteine proteases has yet been reported.
present study was undertaken to study the transcriptional regulation of falcipains.
analysis of falcipains' 5'upstream regulatory regions did not reveal the presence of sequences known to bind general eukaryotic factors.
