in contrast, the isoform nkcc <dig> represents the major pathway for cl- entry in endothelial cells, playing a crucial role in cell volume regulation and vascular tone.
we demonstrated that the assay is highly reproducible, offers high temporal resolution of nkcc-mediated ion flux profiles and, importantly, being a continuous assay, it offers improved sensitivity over previous endpoint nkcc functional assays.
importantly, both nkcc isoforms are involved in the regulation of blood pressure and represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of hypertension.
taking advantage of an existing thallium -based kit, we set up a tl+ influx-based fluorescent assay, that can accurately and rapidly measure nkcc transporter activity in adherent epithelial cells using the high-throughput flex station device.
