mds-related p <dig> point mutants of srsf <dig> were expressed and phosphorylated at similar levels as wildtype srsf <dig>  however, cells expressing mutant srsf <dig> exhibited higher levels of apoptosis than cells expressing wildtype srsf <dig>  regarding alternative splicing events, in nearly all examined cases, srsf <dig> p <dig> mutants acted in a similar fashion as the wildtype srsf <dig>  however, cells expressing srsf <dig> p <dig> mutants had a percent increase in the c <dig> spliced isoform of cell division cycle 25c .
effects of these mutants on apoptosis and specific alternative splicing events were evaluated.
it has been recently discovered that srsf <dig>  along with other splicing regulators, is frequently mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome .

serine–arginine rich splicing factor  <dig>  is a protein known for its role in rna splicing and genome stability.
srsf <dig> p <dig> mutants lead to alternative splicing of cdc25c in a manner that is not dependent on the dna damage response.
a tetracycline-inducible tf- <dig> erythroleukemia cell line was transduced with retroviruses to create cell lines expressing ha-tagged wildtype srsf <dig>  srsf <dig> with proline  <dig> point mutations found in mds, or srsf <dig> with a deletion of one of the four major domains of the protein.
