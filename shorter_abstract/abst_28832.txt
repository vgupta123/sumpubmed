we projected the resultant lists of ortholog genes onto kegg bacterial pathways to identify clusters and circuits, which can be linked to either pathogenicity or synergy.
present study produces for the first time, a signature, in the form of a robust list of gene circuitry whose presence or absence could potentially define the pathogenicity of a microbiome.
using data on the gene contents of these genomes, we identified sets of genes highly abundant in pathogenic but relatively absent in commensal strains and vice versa.
gene circuits relatively abundant in nonpathogenic bacteria often mediated biosynthesis of antibiotics.
pathogen-abundant gene circuits included modules in one-carbon folate, two-component system, type- <dig> secretion system, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

we used the kegg repository and extensive literature searches to identify among the  <dig> bacterial genomes in the literature those implicated as pathogenic to the host, including those which show pathogenicity in a context dependent manner.
our study also identified bacterial genera containing a circuit, elements of which were previously linked to alzheimers disease.
bacterial infections comprise a global health challenge as the incidences of antibiotic resistance increase.
pathogenic potential of bacteria has been shown to be context dependent, varying in response to environment and even within the strains of the same genus.
in addition, we carried out genome comparison within a genus for the seventeen largest genera in our genome collection.
