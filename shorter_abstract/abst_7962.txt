in contrast to water soluble proteins, transmembrane proteins face three distinct environments; a hydrophobic lipid environment inside the membrane, a hydrophilic water environment outside the membrane and an interface region rich in phospholipid head-groups.
further, we found that current state-of-the-art predictors for surface area are optimized for one of the regions and perform badly in the other regions.
therefore, it is energetically favorable for transmembrane proteins to expose different types of residues in the different regions.
in water-soluble proteins it is energetically favorable to bury hydrophobic residues and to expose polar and charged residues.
in addition, mprap performs better on complete membrane proteins than a combination of specialized predictors and acceptably on water-soluble proteins.
by including complete a-helical transmembrane proteins in the training mprap is able to predict surface accessibility accurately both inside and outside the membrane.
this predictor can aid in the prediction of 3d-structure, and in the identification of erroneous protein structures.
to circumvent this limitation we developed a new predictor, mprap, that performs well in all regions.
