we also found that dog owning households were more likely to be multi-dog households than single-dog if they also owned a cat or a bird, or if the household contained a person of 20â€“ <dig> years old.
this census-based, epidemiological study aimed to investigate factors associated with dog ownership and contact with dogs, in a semi-rural community of  <dig> households in cheshire, uk.
the age structure of the households was also associated with dog ownership, with households containing older children  and young adults , more likely to own dogs.
dog owners reported increased contact with dogs, other than their own, compared to those that did not own dogs and this contact appeared to be mainly through walking.
dog owners are also more likely to have contact with dogs other than their own, compared with those not owning a dog.
this study supports the suggestion that dogs are more common in families who have older children , as has been generally observed in other countries.
identifying differences between those who own dogs or have contact with dogs, and those who do not, is useful to those interested in the human-animal bond, human health and for provision of veterinary services.
