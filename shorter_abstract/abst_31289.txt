using electrophoresis mobility shift assays, we also provided evidence for the presence of dna-binding proteins in embryonic nuclear extracts.
this study provides a comprehensive view of six3a transcription regulation during brain and eye development and offers an opportunity to establish the gene regulatory networks underlying neurogenesis in zebrafish.
alignment of the 21-kb region surrounding the zebrafish six3a gene with the analogous region from different species identified several conserved non-coding modules.
though the function of six3a as a crucial regulator of eye and forebrain development has been thoroughly investigated, the transcriptional regulation of six3a is not well understood.
to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of six3a, we performed an in vivo reporter assay.
mutational analysis further minimized the a module to four highly conserved elements and the d module to three elements.
the d module drives the gfp reporter in the forebrain and eyes at an early stage, while the a module is responsible for the later expression.
six3a belongs to the six family of homeodomain proteins and is expressed in the most anterior neural plate at the beginning of neurogenesis in various species.
the transcription factors that may occupy those highly conserved elements were also predicted.
the a module also works as a repressor suppressing ectopic expression from the d module.
