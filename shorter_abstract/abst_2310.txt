we tested this assay with burkholderia cenocepacia and pseudomonas aeruginosa but it should be applicable to a broad range of gram negative species that produce ahls.
the co-culture assays described enable the detection of ahl production in both p. aeruginosa and b. cenocepacia and should be applicable to ahl analysis in other bacterial species.
the high-throughput adaptation of the liquid co-culture assay could facilitate the screening of large libraries for the identification of mutants or compounds that block the synthesis or activity of ahls.
in this study, we describe the usefulness of a trai-luxcdabe-based biosensor to quickly detect ahls from previously characterized mutants of burkholderia cenocepacia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in both liquid and soft-agar co-culture assays in a high-throughput manner.
the technique uses a co-culture system where the strain producing the ahls is grown simultaneously with the reporter strain.
use of this assay in liquid co-culture allows the measurement of ahl activity in real time over growth.
