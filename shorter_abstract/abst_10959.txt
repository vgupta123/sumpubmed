we show that ssrs are abundant within zebra finch ests, and that their genomic location can be predicted from sequence similarity with the assembled chicken genome sequence.
a total of  <dig>  ests were downloaded from genbank and assembled into contigs, representing an estimated  <dig>  unique sequences.
the relative exonic location  was predicted for  <dig> of the ssrs, by blast search against the ensembl chicken peptide database.
efforts to address this problem are underway, and the zebra finch  will be the first passerine to have its genome sequenced.
here we describe a bioinformatic analysis of zebra finch expressed sequence tag  genbank entries.
ten loci were examined for polymorphism in two zebra finch populations and two populations of a distantly related passerine, the house sparrow passer domesticus.
we demonstrate that a useful proportion of zebra finch est-ssrs are likely to be polymorphic, and that they can be used to build a linkage map.
finally, we show that many zebra finch est-ssrs are likely to be useful in evolutionary genetic studies of other passerines.
a chromosomal location for the majority of ssrs was predicted by blasting against assembly  <dig>  of the chicken genome sequence.
passerines  are widely studied across many biological disciplines including ecology, population biology, neurobiology, behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology.
