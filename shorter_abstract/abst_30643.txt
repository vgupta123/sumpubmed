by locating nucleation regions with refined wavelet transform technology and by calculating propensity factors with larger size data set, it is likely to get a better result.
protein secondary structure prediction is a fundamental and important component in the analytical study of protein structure and functions.
substitute the original secondary structure conformational parameters with folding type-specific secondary structure propensities.
it is able to predict protein secondary structure as good as current popular methods.
replace the nucleation regions with extreme values of coefficients calculated by the continuous wavelet transform.
the results showed that our improved chou-fasman method performs better than the original one in all indices, about 10â€“18% improvement.
we compared the indices with those obtained from the original chou-fasman method and other four popular methods.
it is also comparable to other currently popular methods considering all the indices.
however, this method has its limitations due to low accuracy, unreliable parameters, and over prediction.
thanks to the recent development in protein folding type-specific structure propensities and wavelet transformation, the shortcomings in chou-fasman method are able to be overcome.
