on the basis of these findings, we proposed that some proteins related to electron transport chain of photosynthesis, antioxidant enzymes, hsps and other stress response proteins, and glycolysis may play key roles in enhancing grapevine adaptation to and recovery capacity from heat stress.
the subcellular localization using targetp showed most proteins were located in the chloroplasts , secretory pathways  and mitochondrion .
however, these physiological changes rapidly returned to control levels during the subsequent recovery phase from heat stress.
one hundred and seventy-four proteins were differentially expressed under heat stress and/or during the recovery phase, in comparison to unstressed controls, respectively.
these results provide a better understanding of the proteins involved in, and mechanisms of thermotolerance in grapevines.
based on mapman ontology, functional categories for these dysregulated proteins included mainly photosynthesis , proteins , and stress .
thermotolerance includes the direct response to heat stress and the ability to recover from heat stress.
high temperature increased the concentrations of tbars and inhibited electronic transport in photosynthesis apparatus, indicating that grape leaves were damaged by heat stress.
stress and recovery conditions shared  <dig> proteins, while  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were respectively identified under heat stress and recovery conditions alone.
