sequence quality surrounding the snp under test is also crucially important.
wo factors were found to be most significant for validation of est-derived snps: the contig size  and the minor allele sequence frequency.
this project was designed to answer some of the questions relevant to quality assessment of est-derived snps.
stringent quality assessment measures should be used when working with est-derived snps.
application of such quality assessment measures, along with large resources of ests, should provide effective means for snp identification in species where genome sequence resources are lacking.
the larger the contigs were, the greater the validation rate although the validation rate was reasonably high when the contigs contain four or more est sequences with the minor allele sequence being represented at least twice in the contigs.
a large resource of ests is to become available in catfish allowing identification of large number of snps, but reliability of est-derived snps are relatively low because of sequencing errors.
in particular, contigs containing four or more ests should be used and the minor allele sequence should be represented at least twice.
