we hypothesize that the plastid antioxidant system serves as a priming hub and that priming-dependent regulation of chloroplast-to-nucleus ros signaling is a strategy to prepare plants under unstable environmental conditions against unpredictable stresses by supporting extra-plastidic stress protection.
transcript and protein abundance analysis and studies in specific knock-out lines linked the priming-specific regulation of zat <dig> and bap <dig> induction to the priming-induced long-term regulation of stromal and thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase  expression.
here, we compared the effect of 24 h  and of 2 week long cold-pretreatment  on the response of arabidopsis thaliana to a single 24 h cold stimulus  after a 5 day long lag-phase, to test arabidopsis for cold primability.
the plastid antioxidant system, especially, plastid ascorbate peroxidase regulation, transmits information on a previous cold stress over time without the requirement of establishing cold-acclimation.
the chloroplast ros signaling marker genes zat <dig> and bap <dig> were less activated by the triggering stimulus in primed plants.

three types of pretreatment dependent responses were observed:  the cbf-regulon controlled gene cor15a was stronger activated only after long-term cold pretreatment.
series of cold stresses improve plant performance upon a future cold stress.
