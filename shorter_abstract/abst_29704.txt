the interaction of l-selectin on lymphocytes with sulfated glycoprotein ligands on hev results in lymphocyte rolling, which represents the initial step in lymphocyte homing.
hev expression of glcnac6st- <dig> , an hev-restricted sulfotransferase, is essential for the elaboration of l-selectin functional ligands as well as a critical epitope recognized by meca- <dig> mab.
the recruitment of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs relies on interactions of circulating cells with high endothelial venules .
hev are exclusive to these organs under physiological conditions, but they can develop in chronically-inflamed tissues.
this enzyme represents a potential therapeutic target for ra.
expression of glcnac6st- <dig> was specific to ra synovial tissues as compared to osteoarthritis synovial tissues and localized to endothelial cells of hev-like vessels and small flat-walled vessels.
double meca- <dig> and glcnac6st- <dig> staining showed colocalization of the meca- <dig> epitope and glcnac6st- <dig>  we further found that both tnf-α and lymphotoxin-αβ induced glcnac6st- <dig> mrna and protein in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
