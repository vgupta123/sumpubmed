reported interactome data may also be utilized to conduct focused, hypothesis-driven research.
establishment of the host-map interactome revealed a novel iron assimilation system for carboxymycobactin.
the host-map interactome identified a number of metabolic, dna repair and virulence genes worthy for consideration as novel drug targets as well as future pathogenesis studies.
this new iron sequestration program provides an explanation for mycobactin independence in some map strains grown in vitro as well as during infection within the host cell.
the initial interaction between host cell and pathogen sets the stage for the ensuing infection and ultimately determine the course of disease.
co-culture of uninfected bovine epithelial cells  and primary bovine macrophages creates a tolerant genotype as demonstrated by downregulation of inflammatory pathways.
iron assimilation is linked to nitric oxide synthase- <dig> production by the host and subsequent nitric oxide buildup.
iron limitation as well as nitric oxide is a prompt for map to enter into an iron sequestration program.
