four putative nitroreductases, ef <dig>  ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig> from enterococcus faecalis v <dig> were overexpressed as his-tagged recombinant proteins in escherichia coli and purified following a native or a denaturing/renaturing protocol.
nitroreductases were separated of others reductases due to their capacity to reduce nitro compounds.
however, recently, azoreductases have been studied for their strong activity on nitro compounds, especially nitro pro-drugs.
we here demonstrate nitroreductase activity of the putative reductases identified in the enterococcus faecalis v <dig> genome.
interestingly, the biochemical characteristics  of ef <dig> resembled the properties of the known azoreductase azoa.
we identified the first nitroreductase able to reduce directly an azo compound, while its protein sequence is close to others nitroreductases.
ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig> showed nitroreductase activity and their cofactor preferences were in agreement with their protein sequence phylogeny.
the results provide additional data to consider a broader functionality of these reductases.
consequently, it highlights the difficulty in classifying these enzymes solely on the basis of protein sequence alignment and hereby the necessity to experimentally demonstrate the activity.
for the moment, no nitroreductase was demonstrated to possess azoreductase activity.
ef <dig> showed both nitroreductase and azoreductase activity.
identifying enzymes active on these two classes of compounds: azo and nitro is of interest to consider a common physiological role.
nitroreductases, nadh dependent flavoenzymes, are found in most of bacterial species.
