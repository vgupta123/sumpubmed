such findings have implications for the development of gbs vaccines that target the three pilus islands.
these data suggest that pilus combinations impact host specificity and disease presentation and that diversification often involves the loss or acquisition of pis.
group b streptococcus  is an opportunistic pathogen in both humans and bovines.
pilus structures in gbs facilitate colonization and invasion of host tissues and play a role in biofilm formation, though few large-scale studies have estimated the frequency and diversity of the three pilus islands  across diverse genotypes.
here, we examined the distribution of pilus islands   <dig>  2a and 2b among  <dig> gbs strains representing  <dig> multilocus sequence types  belonging to eight clonal complexes.
