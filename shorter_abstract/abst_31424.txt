together these findings suggest that the timing of hox gene expression may contribute to the heterochrony of the forelimb and hindlimb and that alteration to hox domains may influence phenotypic differences that lead to the development of marsupial syndactylous digits.
interestingly, despite the morphological differences in hindlimb patterning, there were no modifications to the polyalanine tract of either hoxa <dig> or hoxd <dig> when compared to those of the mouse and bat but there was a marked difference between the tammar and the other mammals in the region of the first polyserine tract of hoxd <dig>  there were also altered expression domains for both genes in the developing tammar limbs compared to the chicken and mouse.
the gene structure and predicted proteins were highly conserved with their eutherian orthologues.
we investigated the expression of two genes, hoxa <dig> and hoxd <dig>  that are crucial for digit patterning in mice during formation of the limbs of the tammar wallaby.
