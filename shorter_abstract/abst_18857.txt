as fimbrial systems are frequently implicated in pathogenesis, we examined the role of fim <dig> by analysing kr <dig>  a streptomycin-resistant derivative of kr <dig>  and three isogenic mutants  using biofilm assays, human cell adhesion assays and pair-wise competition-based murine models of intestinal colonization, lung infection and ascending urinary tract infection.
strains investigated, no obvious in vitro or in vivo role for the locus was identified, although there were subtle hints of involvement in urovirulence and bacterial dissemination from the respiratory tract.
although fim <dig> was present in 13% of klebsiella spp.
although no statistically significant role for fim <dig> was demonstrable, liver and kidney cfu counts for lung and urinary tract infection models, respectively, hinted at an ordered gradation of virulence: kr <dig> , kr2107∆fim <dig>  kr2107∆fim and kr2107∆fim∆fim <dig> .
through pcr interrogation of integration hotspots, chromosome walking, island-tagging and fosmid-based marker rescue we captured and sequenced kpgi- <dig>  a novel genomic island integrated into the met <dig> trna gene of k. pneumoniae kr <dig>  a bloodstream isolate from a patient with pneumonia and neutropenic sepsis.
based on our findings and on parallels with other fimbrial systems, we propose that fim <dig> has the potential to contribute beneficially to pathogenesis and/or environmental persistence of klebsiella strains, at least under specific yet-to-be identified conditions.
