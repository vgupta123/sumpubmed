the genome of kn <dig> was compared to wildtype with the goal of discovering how the network for extracellular electron transfer has changed and how these two strains evolved.

both genomes were re-annotated, resulting in  <dig> fewer genes  in the pca genome;  <dig> fewer  in the kn <dig> genome; and ca.
a new strain of geobacter sulfurreducens, strain kn <dig>  produces more electrical current in microbial fuel cells and reduces insoluble fe oxides much faster than the wildtype strain, pca.
most of the remaining genes were in regions of genomic mobility and were strain-specific or conserved in other geobacteraceae, indicating that the changes occurred post-divergence.
the increase in electron transfer rate and yield in kn <dig> may be due to changes in carbon flux towards oxidation pathways and to changes in atp metabolism, both of which indicate that the overall energy state of the cell may be different.
the electrically conductive pili appear to be unchanged, but cytochrome folding, localization, and redox potentials may all be affected, which would alter the electrical connection between the cell and the substrate.
genes known to be involved in electron transport, those used in the metabolic cell model, and those that exhibit changes in expression during growth in microbial fuel cells were examined in detail.
substantial sequence differences  were found in  <dig> % of the orthologs, and this set was enriched in cytochromes and integral membrane proteins.
25% of orthologs had sequence differences, and this set was enriched in phosphorylation and atp-dependent enzymes.
