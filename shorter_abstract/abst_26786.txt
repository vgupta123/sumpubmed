consistent with known twist <dig> functions during development and in cancer cells, twist1-dna binding regions associated with genes related to cell migration and adhesion were detected in all three tissues.
thus, while twist <dig> has similar functions in eccs, limb buds, and pnst cells, the specific genomic sequences occupied by twist <dig> were different depending on cellular context.
subgroups of shared genes, also predominantly related to cell adhesion and migration, were identified in pairwise comparisons of ecc, limb buds and pnst cells.
together, these data indicate that twist <dig> interacts with genes that regulate adhesion and migration in different tissues, potentially through distinct sets of target genes.
in addition, there is a small subset of genes occupied by twist <dig> in all three tissues that may represent a core group of twist <dig> target genes in multiple cell types.
the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor twist <dig> has well-documented roles in progenitor populations of the developing embryo, including endocardial cushions  and limb buds, and also in cancer.

the tissue-specificity of twist <dig> genomic occupancy was examined in mouse eccs, limb buds, and peripheral nerve sheath tumor  cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing  analysis.
twist <dig> genomic occupancy was detected for six binding regions in all tissue types, and twist1-binding sequences associated with chst <dig>  litaf, ror <dig>  and spata <dig> also bound the potential twist <dig> cofactor rreb <dig>  pathway analysis of the genes associated with twist <dig> binding suggests that twist <dig> may regulate genes associated with the wnt signaling pathway in eccs and limb buds.
whether twist <dig> regulates the same transcriptional targets in different tissue types is largely unknown.
however, the vast majority of twist <dig> binding regions were specific to individual tissue types.
