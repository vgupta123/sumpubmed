we searched for positive selection in rbcl sequences from over  <dig> species representing all lineages of green plants and some lineages of other phototrophs, such as brown and red algae, diatoms, euglenids and cyanobacteria.
plant systematicists have mainly used rbcl paying little attention to its function, and the question whether it evolves under darwinian selection has received little attention.
our results demonstrate that despite its conservative nature, rubisco evolves under positive selection in most lineages of land plants, and after billions of years of evolution darwinian selection still fine-tunes its performance.
the mapping of the positively selected residues on the rubisco tertiary structure revealed that they are located in regions important for dimer-dimer, intradimer, large subunit-small subunit and rubisco-rubisco activase interactions, and that some of the positively selected residues are close to the active site.
widespread positive selection in rbcl has to be taken into account when this gene is used for phylogenetic reconstructions.
our molecular phylogenetic analysis found the presence of positive selection in rbcl of most analyzed land plants, but not in algae and cyanobacteria.
the purpose of our study was to evaluate how common is positive selection in rubisco among the phototrophs and where in the rubisco structure does positive selection occur.
the large subunit of rubisco is encoded by the chloroplast rbcl gene, which is widely used for reconstruction of plant phylogenies due to its conservative nature.
