as wgs is intrinsically richer data that can provide insight into polymorphisms outside coding regions and reveal genomic rearrangements, it is likely to progressively replace exome-seq for many applications.
we set out to quantify and understand how wgs compares with the targeted capture and sequencing of the exome , for the specific purpose of identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms  in exome targeted regions.
exome-seq achieves 95% snp detection sensitivity at a mean on-target depth of  <dig> reads, whereas wgs only requires a mean of  <dig> reads.
less than two percent of the human genome is protein coding, yet that small fraction harbours the majority of known disease causing mutations.
despite rapidly falling whole genome sequencing  costs, much research and increasingly the clinical use of sequence data is likely to remain focused on the protein coding exome.
we have compared polymorphism detection sensitivity and systematic biases using a set of tissue samples that have been subject to both deep exome and whole genome sequencing.
despite evidence of incremental improvements in exome capture technology over time, whole genome sequencing has greater uniformity of sequence read coverage and reduced biases in the detection of non-reference alleles than exome-seq.
