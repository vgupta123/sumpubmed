however, eggs have found so far only limited use in the production of recombinant proteins.
embryonated chicken eggs have been used since the mid-20th century to grow a wide range of animal viruses to high titers.
soluble forms of human respiratory syncytial virus  and human metapneumovirus  fusion  proteins, devoid of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, were produced in allantoic fluids using the sendai minigenome system.
when compared with the production of the same proteins in the culture supernatant of cells infected with vaccinia recombinants, the yield in the allantoic fluid was 5â€“ <dig> fold higher.
the simplicity and economy of the sendai minigenome system, together with the high yield achieved in the allantoic fluid of eggs, makes it an attractive method to express soluble glycoproteins aimed for structural studies.
