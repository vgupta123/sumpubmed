to obtain genome-wide insights on the transcriptome changes and regulatory networks in wood formation, we used high-throughput rna sequencing to characterize cdna libraries of mature xylem from tension wood , opposite wood , and normal wood , in the industrial tree species populus tomentosa.
more than half of the differentially expressed tf showed more than 4-fold lower transcript levels in nw compared with tw or ow, indicating that tf abundances differed dramatically in different wood types and may have important roles in the formation of reaction wood.

we constructed two transcriptomic networks for the regulation of lignin and cellulose biosynthesis, including tfs, based on the co-expression patterns of different genes.
the differentially expressed genes included  <dig> encoding transcription factors ,  <dig> involved in hormone signal transduction,  <dig> in lignin biosynthesis,  <dig> in flavonoid biosynthesis, and  <dig> in cell wall metabolism, including cellulose synthase, sucrose synthase, and cobra.
in addition, transcripts of most of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were more abundant in ow compared with tw, consistent with the higher lignin content of ow.
we also identified candidate genes for molecular breeding of wood quality, and provided a starting point to decipher the molecular mechanisms of wood formation in populus.
here, we identified the global patterns and differences in gene expression among tw, ow, and nw, and constructed two transcriptomic regulatory networks involved in tw formation in p. tomentosa.
wood formation affects the chemical and physical properties of wood, and thus affects its utility as a building material or a feedstock for biofuels, pulp and paper.
