while the molecular components are well characterised, the motor behaviour measured by tethered cell experiments has been difficult to interpret.
we study the effects of sensing and signalling noise on the motor behaviour.
our analysis allows us to address how cell-to-cell variation affects motor behaviour and the question of optimal pathway design.
the chemotaxis pathway in the bacterium escherichia coli allows cells to detect changes in external ligand concentration .
specifically, we consider fluctuations stemming from ligand concentration, receptor switching between their signalling states, adaptation, modification of proteins by phosphorylation, and motor switching between its two rotational states.
we find that the noise characteristics of the motor contain signatures from all these processes, albeit with varying magnitudes.
