to screen for candidate genes involved in the water deficit response, we used the illumina hiseq2000/miseq sequencing platform to conduct a global transcriptome analysis of peanut seedlings under water deficit with or without an aba pretreatment.
the results indicate that the main drought response mechanisms in peanut function through an aba-dependent pathway.
previously, we found that peanut stomata close rapidly during water deficit and in response to abscisic acid  treatment, and many genes show changes in their expression levels.
we analyzed these sequence libraries to identify differentially expressed genes  under water deficit with or without aba pretreatment.
in total,  <dig> genes were induced rapidly  under water deficit,  <dig>  genes were induced rapidly under water deficit + aba pretreatment, and  <dig> genes overlapped between water deficit and water deficit + aba pretreatment.
among the degs,  <dig> were highly induced  by water deficit + aba pretreatment, while  <dig> were highly induced  by water deficit alone.
the genes induced under water deficit + aba pretreatment included  <dig> putative transcription factor  genes, while those induced under water deficit alone included only  <dig> putative tf genes.
the degs results show that many genes are rapidly induced in peanut in response to water deficit without or with aba pretreatment.
to validate the transcriptome results, we conducted quantitative pcr  analyses to quantify the transcript levels of nine candidate genes.
our data provide a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular genetics research on peanut stress responses.
