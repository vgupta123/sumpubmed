in silico analysis revealed the presence of potential adpa-binding sites upstream from these genes; electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that adpa binds directly to their promoter regions.
furthermore, in silico analysis suggests that over hundred genes may be directly activated or repressed by s. lividans adpa, although few have been described as being part of any streptomyces adpa regulons.
several of these genes are orthologous to blda-dependent genes in s. coelicolor.
microarray experiments revealed that the expression of hundreds of genes was affected in a s. lividans adpa mutant during early stationary phase cultures in yeme liquid medium.
we recently discovered interplay between clpp peptidases and adpa in s. lividans.
here, we report the identification of genes directly regulated by adpa in s. lividans.
we studied the expression of the s. lividans adpa-regulated genes by quantitative real-time pcr analysis after various times of growth.
this work identifies new pathways directly controlled by adpa and that are involved in s. lividans development , and primary  or secondary  metabolism.
we characterised six s. lividans adpa-dependent genes whose expression is directly activated by this pleiotropic regulator.
most work on adpa has been in s. griseus, and little is known about the pathways it controls in other streptomyces spp.
streptomyces are gram-positive bacteria well-known for their production of secondary metabolites and antibiotics.
