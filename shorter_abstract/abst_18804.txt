in this study, a dynamic model of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway was constructed based on the hybrid functional petri net  technique.
this technique is a fusion of three other extended petri net techniques, namely hybrid petri net , dynamic petri net  and functional petri net .
the development and simulation of dynamic models of terpenoid biosynthesis has yielded a systems perspective that provides new insights into how the structure of this biochemical pathway affects compound synthesis.
although this metabolic model is only preliminary, it will provide a platform for analysing various high-throughput data, and it should lead to a more holistic understanding of terpenoid biosynthesis.
interactions between the intermediates that affect the production of terpenes could be observed through the introduction of inhibitors that established feedback loops within and crosstalk between the pathways.
