ab initio gene callers offer a significant reduction in the computational burden of annotating individual nucleic acid reads and are used in many metagenomic annotation systems.
while gene prediction tools have similar accuracies predicting genes on error-free fragments, in the presence of sequencing errors considerable differences between tools become evident.
for predicting reading frames on raw reads, we find the hidden markov model approach in fraggenescan is more sensitive than other gene prediction tools, while prodigal, mga, and mgm are better suited for higher-quality sequences such as assembled contigs.

gene prediction algorithms  are an essential tool for analyzing shotgun nucleic acid sequence data.
gene prediction is a ubiquitous step in sequence analysis pipelines; it reduces the volume of data by identifying the most likely reading frame for a fragment, permitting the out-of-frame translations to be ignored.
