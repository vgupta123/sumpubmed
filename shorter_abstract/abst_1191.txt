this suggests that a csf reduced turnover may play an important role in the decrease of csf aβ <dig> concentration.
the possible involvement of a decrease in csf turnover in a4β <dig> deposit formation is up to now poorly known.
we therefore investigated a possible relationship between a reduced csf turnover and the csf levels of the a4β <dig> peptide.
to this aim, csf of  <dig> patients with decreased csf turnover were studied.
the appearance of aβ <dig> peptide deposits is admitted to be a key event in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease, although amyloid deposits also occur in aged non-demented subjects.
the  <dig> patients with lumbar csf analysis had similar levels of lumbar and ventricular aβ <dig>  a significant reduction in aβ <dig> ventricular levels was observed in  <dig> /  <dig> patients with hydrocephalus.
nine subjects had idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus , and the other  <dig> chronic hydrocephalus from other origins .
these patients presented chronic hydrocephalus communicating or obstructive, which required surgery .
the decrease of csf aβ <dig> seems to occur independently of the surgical hydrocephalus aetiology.
it can be catabolized by several enzymes, reabsorbed by capillaries or cleared into cerebrospinal fluid .
