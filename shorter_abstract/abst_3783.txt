specifically, we propose a computationally efficient procedure for shrinkage estimation of car scores from high-dimensional data.
identification of causal snps in most genome wide association studies relies on approaches that consider each snp individually.
subsequently, we conduct a comprehensive comparison study including five advanced regression approaches  and a univariate approach  to determine the effectiveness in finding true causal snps.
we demonstrate that our car score-based algorithm consistently outperforms all competing approaches, both uni- and multivariate, in terms of correctly recovered causal snps and snp ranking.
we develop a novel multivariate algorithm for large scale snp selection using car score regression, a promising new approach for prioritizing biomarkers.
simultaneous snp selection is a challenging task.
