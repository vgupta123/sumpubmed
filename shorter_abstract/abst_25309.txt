tests of selection reveal a cluster of candidate genes in each locus, suggesting that weak directional selection may be occurring within a small region of each locus, but coding changes alone are unlikely to explain the full range of wing pattern diversity.
amongst the remaining genes, hm <dig> and kinesin possessed the highest background ω values within the hmyb and hmb loci, respectively.
protein-coding change is one possible genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of adaptive wing colour pattern variation in heliconius butterflies.
preliminary analyses using  <dig> transcriptome and bacterial artificial chromosome  sequences from three heliconius species highlighted a cluster of genes within each region showing relatively higher rates of sequence evolution.
here we determine whether  <dig> putative genes within two major heliconius patterning loci, hmyb and hmb, show evidence of positive selection.
ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide changes  were used to test for selection, as a means of identifying candidate genes within each locus that control wing pattern.
three genes from each locus with the highest average pairwise ω values were amplified from additional heliconius species and races.
other genes within the region appear to be highly constrained, and no ω estimates exceeded one.
after accounting for recombination, these two genes both showed evidence of having codons with a signature of selection, although statistical support for this signal was not strong in any case.
