having demonstrated the ability of snail to bind and recruit histone deacetylase  <dig> and dna methyltransferase  <dig> in this context, we set out to look for other interactions that could affect its ability to promote oncogenic transformation and cancer cell invasion.
using cells that stably expressed snail, we characterized snail protein interactors by tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry.
we previously reported that the aberrant expression of snail via activation of reactive oxygen species contributes to the invasive property of hcc, in part by downregulation of e-cadherin through both transcriptional repression and epigenetic modification of the e-cadherin promoter.
hepatocellular carcinoma  is a common, highly invasive malignant tumor associated with a high mortality rate.
interestingly, nicd inhibited snail-dependent invasive properties in both hcc cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
our study demonstrates that nicd can oppose snail-dependent hcc cell invasion by binding and inducing proteolytic degradation of snail.
