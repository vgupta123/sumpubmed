this includes the mid-hindbrain boundary , pharyngeal endoderm, otic vesicle, hindbrain, and kupffer's vesicle.
these compounds were counter screened with the transgenic line tgy <dig>  that serves as an indirect read-out for vascular endothelial growth factor  signalling in order to determine the specificity between related receptor tyrosine kinases .
the dusp <dig> promoter was isolated from zebrafish and used to drive expression of destabilized green fluorescent protein  in transgenic embryos ).
the expression of d2egfp is under the control of fgf signalling as treatment with fgf receptor  inhibitors results in the suppression of d2egfp expression.
at later stages, d2egfp is detected within structures that correlate with the expression of fgf ligands and their receptors.
the generation of transgenic reporter zebrafish lines has allowed direct visualization of fgf signalling within the developing embryo.
in a pilot screen of commercially available small molecules we have evaluated the effectiveness of the transgenic lines to identify specific fgf inhibitors within the class of indolinones.
these fgf reporter transgenic lines provide a tool to screen for specific compounds that can distinguish between two conserved members of the rtk family.
fibroblast growth factors  represent a large family of secreted proteins that are required for proper development and physiological processes.
