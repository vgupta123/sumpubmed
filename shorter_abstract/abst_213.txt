these included sco7449- <dig> that affect spore pigment biogenesis; sco1773- <dig> that encode an l-alanine dehydrogenase and a regulator-like protein and are required for maturation of spores; sco <dig> that encodes a protein highly similar to a nosiheptide resistance regulator and affects spore maturation; and four additional loci  that show developmental regulation but no overt mutant phenotype.
the sporulation of aerial hyphae of streptomyces coelicolor is a complex developmental process.
seven new sporulation loci were investigated in more detail with respect to expression patterns and mutant phenotypes.
here we show that by comparing a wild-type to mutants lacking regulators that are specifically affecting processes in aerial hypha, it is possible to identify previously unknown genes with important roles in sporulation.
we report a dna microarray-based investigation of developmentally controlled gene expression in s. coelicolor.
a whia mutant showed the largest effects on gene expression, while only a few genes were specifically affected by whih mutation.
aerial hyphal sporulation in s. coelicolor is a technically challenging process for global transcriptomic investigations since it occurs only as a small fraction of the colony biomass and is not highly synchronized.
by comparing global transcription patterns of the wild-type parent and two mutants lacking key regulators of aerial hyphal sporulation, we found a total of  <dig> genes that had significantly different expression in at least one of the two mutants compared to the wild-type during sporulation.
the aim of this study was to expand our knowledge of the gene repertoire involved in s. coelicolor sporulation.
