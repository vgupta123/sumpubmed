we introduce a solexa-based method to perform large numbers of ase assays using only a single lane of a solexa flowcell.
we present a new method with the capacity to measure ase for large numbers of assays using as little as one lane of a solexa flowcell.
to validate this method, we measured the allelic bias in a dilution series and found high correlations between measured and expected values .
this will be a valuable technique for molecular and population genetic studies, as well as for verification of genome-wide data sets.
we applied this method to a set of  <dig> genes in a drosophila simulans parental mix, f <dig> and introgression and found that for these genes the majority of expression divergence can be explained by cis-regulatory variation.
