by letting dissociation constants kd be either freely estimated, infinity, zero, or equal to other kd, and by letting undamaged protein fractions be either freely estimated or  <dig>  many g models are formed.
a standard space of g models for ligand-induced protein dimerization equilibria is given.
the problem with this approach is that different analysts can propose and select different models and thus extract different binding parameter estimates from the same data.
an alternative is to first generate a comprehensive standardized list of plausible models, and to then fit them exhaustively, or semi-exhaustively.
thereafter, upon fitting a batch, the next batch of models  was fitted only if the current batch yielded a model that was better  than the best model in the previous batch .
