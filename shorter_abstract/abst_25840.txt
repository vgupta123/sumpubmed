three of them comprise orthologs of the pdrp sensu stricto, pdr5p, pdr10p, pdr12p, pdr15p, snq2p and ynr070wp.
the evolutive pathway of the orthologs of snq <dig> and ynr070w is particularly complex due to a tandem gene array in eremothecium gossypii, kluyveromyces lactis and saccharomyces  kluyveri.
a tandem gene array is observed in eremothecium gossypii.
this study was carried out on  <dig> pdrp from nine hemiascomycetous species, seven of which span  <dig> of the  <dig> clades of the saccharomyces complex while the two others species, debaryomyces hansenii and yarrowia lipolytica, are further apart from an evolutive point of view.
this pathway and different cases of duplications and deletions were clarified by using a neighborhood analysis based on synteny.
the neighborhood analysis provides an efficient method to trace the history of genes and disentangle the orthology and paralogy relationships.
one of the copies is the ortholog of snq <dig> while the other one is lost in the post-wgd species.
for the two distant species, yarrowia lipolytica and debaryomyces hansenii, no neighborhood evidence is available for these clusters and many homologs of pdr <dig> and pdr <dig> are phylogenetically assigned to species-based clusters.
the role of the whole genome duplication  is sorted out and our analyses confirm the common ancestrality of pdr5p and pdr15p.
this subfamily of transmembrane transporters has nine known members in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
