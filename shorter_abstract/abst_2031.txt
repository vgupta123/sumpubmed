through the whole life of eukaryotes, autophagy plays an important role in various biological events including development, differentiation and determination of lifespan.
these findings suggest that the autophagy should play an important role in bombyx mori silkgland.
using the mrna extracted from the silkgland, we cloned the full length cdna fragments of some key genes via reverse transcription pcr and 3' rapid amplification of cdna ends .
based on the autophagy pathway in several model organisms and a series of bioinformatic analyses, we have found more than  <dig> autophagy-related genes from the current database of the silkworm bombyx mori.
in addition, we found that the transcription levels of two indicator genes bmatg <dig> and bmatg <dig> in the silkgland tend to be increased from 1st to 8th day of the fifth instar larvae.
these genes could be further classified into the signal transduction pathway and two ubiquitin-like pathways.
