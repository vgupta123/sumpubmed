the rhesus shares approximately 93% similarity with human in genome sequences and mirna genes are evolutionarily conserved.
therefore, we searched the rhesus genome for sequences similar to human mirna precursor sequences to identify putative rhesus mirna genes.
in addition to  <dig> mirnas previously reported, we identified  <dig> novel mirna genes in the rhesus genome.
some mirnas in the rhesus genome are present as clusters similar to human, such as mir-371/ <dig>  mir-367/302b, mir-17/ <dig>  or have multiple copies distributed in the same or different chromosomes.
we compared the total  <dig> mirnas identified so far in rhesus to human homologs,  <dig> mirna genes showed 100% homology in precursor sequences between rhesus and human; the remaining  <dig> show more than 90%, less than 100% homology in precursor sequences.
rt-pcr analysis of expression of eight rhesus mirna genes in rhesus tissues demonstrated tissue-specific regulation of expression.
investigation of rhesus mirnas will also expand our understanding of their biological function through mirna knockout, knockdown or overexpression.
identification of mirna genes in rhesus will provide the resources for analysis of expression profiles in various tissues by creating a rhesus mirna array, which is currently not available for this species.
micrornas  are about  <dig> nucleotide  endogenous small rnas that negatively regulate gene expression.
