we previously characterized genomic instability in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas  in terms of loss of heterozygosity  and copy number  changes in tumors using the affymetrix genechip human mapping 500k array in  <dig> cases from a high-risk region of china.
in the current study we focused on copy number neutral  loh  and its relation to gene expression in escc.
in contrast, loh with cn loss represented 19% of all loh, occurred in just half of esccs , and was most frequent on 3p , 5q , and 21q .
our results indicate that cnnloh has a profound impact on gene expression in escc, which in turn may affect tumor development.
ninety percent of esccs showed cnnloh  and this was the most common type of loh in two-thirds of cases.
genomic instability plays an important role in human cancers.
to examine the effect of genomic instability on gene expression, we evaluated rna profiles from  <dig> pairs of matched normal and tumor samples  using affymetrix u133a  <dig>  arrays.
loh with cn gain was 11% of all loh, occurred in 93% of esccs , and was most common on 20p , 8q , and 3q .
