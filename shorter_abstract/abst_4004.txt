in order to achieve a greater understanding of nmd regulated gene expression we used 2d-dige proteomics technology to examine the changes in protein expression induced in hela cells by upf <dig> knockdown.
despite the large number of changes in protein expression upon upf <dig> knockdown, a relatively small fraction of them can be directly attributed to the action of nmd on the corresponding mrna.
overexpression of gfp tagged hnrnp a <dig> resulted in a decrease in endogenous hnrnp a <dig> and b <dig> mrna with a concurrent increase in the nmd sensitive isoforms.
most of these were associated with bioinformatically predicted nmd activating features, predominantly upstream open reading frames .
in addition to acting as an rna quality control pathway, nonsense-mediated mrna decay  plays roles in regulating normal gene expression.
furthermore, the mrna abundance of several down-regulated proteins failed to change upon upf <dig> knockdown, indicating that upf1's role in regulating mrna and protein abundance is more complex than previously appreciated.
qpcr based validation of the corresponding mrnas, in response to both upf <dig> knockdown and cycloheximide treatment, identified  <dig> bona fide nmd targets.
among the bona fide nmd targets, we identified a highly conserved as-nmd event within the 3' utr of the hnrnpa2b <dig> gene.
from amongst these we have identified a conserved as-nmd event within hnrnpa2b <dig> that appears to mediate autoregulation of hnrnpa2b <dig> expression levels.
strikingly, however, the majority of transcripts up-regulated by upf <dig> knockdown were either insensitive to, or even down-regulated by, cycloheximide treatment.
