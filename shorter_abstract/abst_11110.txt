capable of processing thousands of names in a single operation, the tnrs parses and corrects misspelled names and authorities, standardizes variant spellings, and converts nomenclatural synonyms to accepted names.
source code is available at https://github.com/iplantcollaborativeopensource/tnrs/.
although the tnrs was developed to aid in standardizing plant names, its underlying algorithms and design can be extended to all organisms and nomenclatural codes.
the ultimate consequences of misspelled names and bad taxonomy are erroneous scientific conclusions and faulty policy decisions.
the tnrs, or taxonomic name resolution service, is an online application for automated and user-supervised standardization of plant scientific names.
the digitization of biodiversity data is leading to the widespread application of taxon names that are superfluous, ambiguous or incorrect, resulting in mismatched records and inflated species numbers.
family names can be included to increase match accuracy and resolve many types of homonyms.
the tnrs is accessible via a web interface at http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/ and as a restful web service and application programming interface.
