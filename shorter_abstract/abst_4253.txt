diffusion tensor imaging  detects pathological changes in white matter fibres in vivo, based on alterations in the degree  and directedness  of proton movement.
using the technique herein, we could demonstrate dti changes at follow-up which correlated well with clinical progression.
these structural changes correlated well with disease duration, alsfrs-r, and physical and executive functions.
changes are widespread in the subcortical white matter in als.
decreased fa in the corticospinal tract  and frontal areas confirm existing results.
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, caused by progressive loss of motor neurons.
fa and adc were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping.
with a direct comparison of baseline and follow-up dataset, the progression of upper motor neuron degeneration, reflected in fa decrease, could be captured along the cst and in frontal areas.
