the new metagenomic data analysis method rapid analysis of multiple metagenomes with a clustering and annotation pipeline  was developed using an ultra-fast sequence clustering algorithm, fast protein family annotation tools, and a novel statistical metagenome comparison method that employs a unique graphic interface.
metagenomic datasets  are large collections of sequencing reads from anonymous species within particular environments.
rammcap is a very fast method that can cluster and annotate one million metagenomic reads in only hundreds of cpu hours.
rammcap processes extremely large datasets with only moderate computational effort.
in this study, rammcap was applied to the two largest available metagenomic collections, the "global ocean sampling" and the "metagenomic profiling of nine biomes".
computational analyses for very large metagenomes are extremely time-consuming, and there are often many novel sequences in these metagenomes that are not fully utilized.
