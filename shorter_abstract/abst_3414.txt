also there was a difference of shannon entropy and global selection pressure values  in different infectious ecosystems.
the biological significance of the “lsd” insert and mutations in ltr-u <dig> needs to be further studied.
this study is to explore the selection of infectious ecosystems on dominant variants and their evolutionary dynamics of alv-j between df <dig> cells and specific-pathogen-free  chickens.
the top  <dig> dominant variants among alv-j from chicken plasmas, df <dig> cells and liver tumor were completely different from each other.
in parallel studies, the ltr-u <dig> region of alv-j from the chicken plasmas demonstrated more variants with mutations in their transcription regulatory elements than those from df <dig> cells.
as a typical retrovirus, the evolution of avian leukosis virus subgroup j  in different infectious ecosystems is not characterized, what we know is there are a cloud of diverse variants, namely quasispecies with considerable genetic diversity.
an average of about  <dig>  valid reads were obtained from two variable regions of gp <dig> gene and ltr-u <dig> region from each sample in different infectious ecosystems.
our data taken together suggest that the molecular epidemiology based on isolated alv-j in cell culture may not represent the true evolution of virus in chicken flocks in the field.
high-throughput sequencing platforms provide an approach for detecting quasispecies diversity more fully.
in the plasmas of two chickens, a large portion of quasispecies contained a 3-peptides “lsd” repeat insertion that was only less than  <dig> % in df <dig> cell culture supernatants.
