additionally, we extract additional connections in the topology of the protein fold space from the orthogonal features contained in scop and cath.
their domain definitions as well as their hierarchic partitioning of the fold space on every level of the two classifications.
scop and cath are widely used as gold standards to benchmark novel protein structure comparison methods as well as to train machine learning approaches for protein structure classification and prediction.
for machine learning methods being trained for protein structure classification.
ignoring such differences leads to problems when being used to train or benchmark automatic structure classification methods.
we create a new mapping between scop and cath and define a consistent benchmark set which is shown to largely reduce errors made by structure comparison methods such as tm-align and has useful further applications, e.g.
