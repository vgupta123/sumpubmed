the choice of a reasonable number of singular values is crucial for svd-based studies.
we found that fewer singular values are needed to produce biologically significant clusters when svd is employed.
subsequently, we developed a method to determine the lowest number of singular values and fewest clusters needed to guarantee biological significance; this system was developed and validated by comparison with linnaean taxonomic classification.
singular value decomposition  is a powerful technique for information retrieval; it helps uncover relationships between elements that are not prima facie related.
we found that svd applied to amino acid sequences demonstrates relationships and provides a basis for producing clusters and cladograms, demonstrating evolutionary relatedness of species that correlates well with linnaean taxonomy.
in tests, clusters that we developed with svd perfectly matched what was expected based on linnaean taxonomy.
