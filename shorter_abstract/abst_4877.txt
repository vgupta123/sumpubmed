p. quinquefasciatus can have an associated fitness cost in the absence of permethrin, relative to a susceptible allele.
allele and genotype frequencies were examined for  <dig> generations under three environmental conditions: standard laboratory, temephos exposure  and cold temperature stress .
a fitness cost was inferred for the p <dig> mechanism in the standard laboratory environment.
we conducted allele competition experiments by crossing two highly related strains of culex pipiens quinquefasciatus mosquitoes.
additionally, these results indicate that a p <dig> resistance allele can persist  in colder temperatures and could potentially be carried into the culex pipiens hybrid zone.
experimental determination of fitness is difficult, but fitness can be inferred by measuring changes in allele frequencies in appropriate environments.
the strength of the cost varies depending on the environmental conditions.
no observed cost was associated with the p <dig> resistance locus in the cold temperature environment, but there was a significant heterozygote advantage.
the evolution of insecticide resistance and persistence of resistance phenotypes are influenced by the fitness of resistance alleles in the absence of insecticide pressure.
