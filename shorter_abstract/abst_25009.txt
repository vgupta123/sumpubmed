however, the development of its molecular tools is extremely limited, thus its genes, genetics and genomics.
due to these characteristics, kelp may serve as a reference for the biological and genetic studies of volvox, mosses and ferns.
this map will facilitate the genetic studies of kelp including for example the evaluation of germplasm and the decipherment of the genetic bases of economic traits.
a high density snp linkage map was constructed for kelp, an intensively cultured brown alga in china.
kelp performs an alternative life cycle during which sporophyte generation alternates with gametophyte generation.
the length of rad tags  was extended to 400–500 bp with miseq method, offering us an easiness of developing snp chips and shifting snp genotyping to a high throughput track.
the rad tags were also extended so that a snp chip could be developed.
in addition, we identified a set of microsatellites  from the extended rad tags.
a gametophyte sex determining locus was mapped on linkage group  <dig> in a window about  <dig>  cm in width, which was  <dig>  cm up to marker_ <dig> and  <dig>  cm down to marker_ <dig>
in addition, a set of microsatellites were identified among mapped loci, and a gametophyte sex determining locus was mapped.
the map expanded a total genetic distance of  <dig> .75 cm, covering  <dig> % of the expected .
its genetic improvement is comparable with that of rice.
in total,  <dig>  snp-containing physical  rad loci were mapped on  <dig> linkage groups.
the number of linkage groups was in accordance with the documented with cytological methods.
