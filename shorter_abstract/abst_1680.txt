a large effort to discover micrornas  has been under way.
our primary goal is not the discovery of novel mirnas but the mapping of validated mirnas in one species to their most likely orthologues in other species.
in addition precomputed mirna mappings of mirbase mirnas across a large number of species are provided.
currently mirbase is their primary repository, providing annotations of primary sequences, precursors and probable genomic loci.
