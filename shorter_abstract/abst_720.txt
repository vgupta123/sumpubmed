we propose the use of polynomial or spline regression models as an alternative to mi for capturing non-linear relationships between quantitative variables.
our results indicate that mi networks can safely be replaced by correlation networks when it comes to measuring co-expression relationships in stationary data.
we show that a robust measure of correlation  leads to modules that are superior to mi based modules and maximal information coefficient  based modules in terms of gene ontology enrichment.
spline and polynomial networks form attractive alternatives to mi in case of non-linear relationships.
we also study different approaches for transforming an adjacency matrix, e.g.
the biweight midcorrelation outperforms mi in terms of elucidating gene pairwise relationships.
it is not clear how much mi adds beyond standard  correlation measures or regression model based association measures.
coupled with the topological overlap matrix transformation, it often leads to more significantly enriched co-expression modules.
co-expression measures are often used to define networks among genes.
further, it is important to assess what transformations of these and other co-expression measures lead to biologically meaningful modules .
we provide a comprehensive comparison between mutual information and several correlation measures in  <dig> empirical data sets and in simulations.
overall, we confirm close relationships between mi and correlation in all data sets which reflects the fact that most gene pairs satisfy linear or monotonic relationships.
mutual information  is often used as a generalized correlation measure.
we present a function that relates correlation to mutual information which can be used to approximate the mutual information from the corresponding correlation coefficient.
