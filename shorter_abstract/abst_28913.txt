although influenza resistance in inbred mice has been mapped to several quantitative trait loci , which have greatly narrowed down the search for host resistance genes, only few underlying genes have been identified.
this study considerably cuts down the list of candidate genes responsible for host resistance to influenza and proposed novel pathways and mechanisms.
the genetic make-up of humans and other mammals  affects their resistance to influenza virus infection.
we suggested that the delicate balance between tnf’s pro-survival and apoptotic effects may affect hosts’ conditions after influenza virus infection.
the significance of top-ranked genes was supported by different lines of evidence from independent genetic associations, qtl studies, rna interference  screenings, and gene expression analysis.
considering the complexity and moral issues associated with experiments on human subjects, we have only acquired partial knowledge regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms.
to prioritize a list of promising candidates for future functional investigation, we applied network-based approaches to leverage the information of known resistance genes and the expression profiles contrasting susceptible and resistant mouse strains.
