they have been previously identified as susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel diseases in humans and are, therefore, suitable candidate genes for inflammatory disease resistance in cattle.
the objective of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the bovine tlr <dig> and card <dig> and evaluate the association of these snps with health and production traits in a population of canadian holstein bulls.
a total of four snps, including one in intron  <dig>  and three in the exon  <dig>  were identified in card15; none were identified in tlr <dig>  canadian holstein bulls  were genotyped and haplotypes were reconstructed.
the snp, c.3020a>t, for example, was associated with scs ebvs  with an allele substitution effect of  <dig>  score.
all significant comparison-wise associations retained significance at 8% experimental-wise level by permutation test.
two snps, c.3020a>t and c.4500a>c, were associated with ebvs for health and production traits.
gene segments were amplified from this pool in pcr reactions and the amplicons sequenced to reveal polymorphisms.
this study indicates that snp c.3020a>t might play a role in the host response against mastitis and further detailed studies are needed to understand its functional mechanisms.
