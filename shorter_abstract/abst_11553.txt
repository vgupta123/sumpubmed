deficit in kcc <dig> expression and/or activity is associated with epilepsy and neuropathic pain, and effective strategies are required to search for novel drugs augmenting kcc <dig> function.
transport activities of the n-terminal splice isoforms kcc2a and kcc2b obtained by the novel approach matched to those reported previously using standard methods for measuring chloride fluxes.
as a proof of concept, we used this approach to compare transport activities of the two known kcc <dig> splice isoforms, kcc2a and kcc2b, in mouse neuronal neuro-2a cells.
our protocol directly assesses dynamics of kcc2-mediated chloride efflux and allows measuring genuine kcc <dig> activity with good spatial and temporal resolution.
our noninvasive optical protocol proved to be efficient for assessment of furosemide-sensitive chloride fluxes.
cation-chloride cotransporters  are indispensable for maintaining chloride homeostasis in multiple cell types, but k–cl cotransporter kcc <dig> is the only ccc member with an exclusively neuronal expression in mammals.
kcc <dig> is critical for rendering fast hyperpolarizing responses of ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine receptors in adult neurons, for neuronal migration in the developing central nervous system, and for the formation and maintenance of small dendritic protrusions—dendritic spines.
