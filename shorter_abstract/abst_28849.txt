this raises an intriguing possibility that an increase in chromatin accessibility in inflammatory macrophages results from broad downregulation of negative chromatin remodelers.
however, the hierarchy of transcriptional responses to gr activation and the molecular basis of their oftentimes non-linear dynamics are not understood.
analysis of lps-downregulated genes revealed striking enrichment in multimerized zn-fingers- and krab domain-containing proteins known to bind nucleic acids and repress transcription by propagating heterochromatin.
the expression dynamics of several glucocorticoid-responsive genes are consistent with feed forward loops  and coincide with rapid gr recruitment.
using whole transcriptome analyses in resting and acutely lipopolysaccharide -stimulated macrophages, we show that early gr target genes form dense networks with the majority of control nodes represented by transcription factors.
pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli alter the expression of a vast array of transcription factors and chromatin remodelers.
by regulating multiple transcription factors, which propagate the initial hormonal signal, gr acts as a coordinating hub in anti-inflammatory responses.

moreover, our gene expression, transcription factor binding and computational data are consistent with the existence of the gr-klf9-klf <dig> incoherent ffl.
