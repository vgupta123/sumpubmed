notably, the master-scaffold protein shank might have been lost secondarily in the placozoan lineage.
searches for orthologous proteins and reconstruction of gene gains/losses based on the taxon phylogeny indicate that post-synaptic proteins originated in two main steps.
the backbone of the scaffold emerged in a unicellular context and was probably not involved in cell-cell communication.
newly available genomes from monosiga brevicollis  and trichoplax adhaerens  offer an opportunity to refine our understanding of post-synaptic protein evolution.
a recent analysis found that the genome of the nerve-less sponges encodes the homologues of most vertebrate post-synaptic proteins.
the time of origination of most post-synaptic proteins was not concomitant with the acquisition of synapses or neural-like cells.
in vertebrate excitatory synapses, these proteins assemble to form the post-synaptic density, a complex molecular platform linking membrane receptors, components of their signalling pathways, and the cytoskeleton.
comparative genomics of the early diverging metazoan lineages and of their unicellular sister-groups opens new window to reconstructing the genetic changes which preceded or accompanied the evolution of multicellular body plans.
a substantial additional set appeared in an exclusive ancestor of the metazoa.
the placozoan genome contains most post-synaptic genes but lacks some of them.
based on the reconstructed protein composition and potential interactions, its ancestral function could have been to link calcium signalling and cytoskeleton regulation.
