moreover, gene expression profile in prochloraz-resistant strain hs-f <dig> is quite different from that in hs-e <dig> before prochloraz-treatment,  <dig> differential expression genes were identified between the two strains.
the whole rna was extracted from a prochloraz-resistant strain  and a prochloraz-susceptible strain  before and after prochloraz-treatment and sequenced by illumina technology.
a total of more than  <dig> million reads were generated and de novo assembled into  <dig> transcripts that contained annotated genes after quality control and sequence assembling.
the sequencing-based transcriptome data of p. digitatum demonstrate differences between prochloraz-resistant and prochloraz-susceptible strains with prochloraz-treatment.
the emergence of fungicide-resistant strains made the control of p. digitatum more difficult.
while the genome of p. digitatum is available, there has been few reports about its resistant mechanism from the transcriptome perspective and there has been no large-scale functional annotation of the genome using expressed genes derived from transcriptomes.
total rna of p. digitatum strain hs-f <dig>  and hs-e <dig>  before and after prochloraz-treatment were extracted and sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform.
we present a large scale analysis about the transcriptome data of p. digitatum.
the differences existed in expressed transcripts, splice isoforms and go categories, which would contribute to our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in drug resistance of p. digitatum.
gene expression profiling analysis was performed upon prochloraz treatment in hs-f <dig> and hs-e <dig>  and differential expression analysis was used to identify genes related to prochloraz-response and drug-resistance: there are  <dig> differentially expressed genes in hs-e <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes in hs-f <dig> after prochloraz-treatment.

<dig> single nucleotide variations  were identified from the sequences aligned against the reference genome.
penicillium digitatum is one of the most destructive postharvest pathogen of citrus fruits, causing fruit decay and economic loss.
the transcriptome data of four samples were compared and analyzed using differential expression analysis, novel transcripts prediction and alternative splicing analysis, snp analysis and quantitative real-time pcr.
gene ontology  term enrichment and kegg enrichment were then performed to classify the differential expression genes.
meanwhile, the roles of typical mfs, abc and mate proteins in prochloraz resistance were investigated using real-time quantitative pcr.
