we describe three tools for comparative analysis of pairs of bac-sized genomic regions.
these tools have been shown to effectively identify regulatory regions in echinoderms, mammals, and nematodes.
familyrelationsii is a graphical viewer for comparisons that enables interactive exploration of several different kinds of comparisons.
cartwheel is a web site and compute-cluster management system used to execute and store comparisons for display by familyrelationsii.
comparative sequence analysis is an effective and increasingly common way to identify cis-regulatory regions in animal genomes.
these tools are specialized for the discovery of cis-regulatory regions in animal genomes.
