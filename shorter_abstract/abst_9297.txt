we describe the co-expression network of three core metabolic processes in the genetic model plant arabidopsis thaliana: fatty acid biosynthesis, starch metabolism and amino acid  catabolism.
these co-expression networks form modules populated by genes coding for enzymes that represent the reactions generally considered to define each pathway.
elucidating metabolic network structures and functions in multicellular organisms is an emerging goal of functional genomics.
indeed, knockout lines of atperk <dig> have an altered starch accumulation.
each of these core metabolic pathways is structured as a module of co-expressed transcripts that co-accumulate over a wide range of environmental and genetic perturbations and developmental stages, and represent an expanded set of macromolecules associated with the common task of supporting the functionality of each metabolic pathway.
we tested experimentally the hypothesis that one of the genes tightly co-expressed with starch metabolism module, a putative kinase atperk <dig>  will have a role in this process.
however, the modules also incorporate a wider set of genes that encode transporters, cofactor biosynthetic enzymes, precursor-producing enzymes, and regulatory molecules.
