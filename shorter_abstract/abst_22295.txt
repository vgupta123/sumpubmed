we show how our method ensures improved estimations with faster and more stable convergence.
parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models remains a very challenging inverse problem due to its nonconvexity and ill-conditioning.
here we present a method for robust and efficient parameter estimation which uses two main strategies to surmount the aforementioned difficulties:  efficient global optimization to deal with nonconvexity, and  proper regularization methods to handle ill-conditioning.
here we provide a parameter estimation strategy which combines efficient global optimization with a regularization scheme.

associated issues like overfitting and local solutions are usually not properly addressed in the systems biology literature despite their importance.
finally, we give a set of simple guidelines to apply this strategy to a wide variety of calibration problems.
we illustrate the performance of the presented method with seven case studies of different nature and increasing complexity, considering several scenarios of data availability, measurement noise and prior knowledge.
dynamic modelling provides a systematic framework to understand function in biological systems.
in the case of regularization, we present a detailed critical comparison of methods and guidelines for properly tuning them.
this method is able to calibrate dynamic models in an efficient and robust way, effectively fighting overfitting and allowing the incorporation of prior information.
