birth weight and faecal consistency on the day of birth were minor risk factors, each significant within one herd.
the study evaluated sow and piglet-level risk factors for developing nnpds and described the epidemiologic characteristics within four herds previously diagnosed with the syndrome.
this association may be explained by an infectious background of the syndrome, but further studies are needed to explain this association.
nnpds was observed in a total of 60%  of first parity piglets and 36%  of piglets born by mature sows.
piglets in herd  <dig> had <dig>  times higher probability of developing nnpds than piglets in herd  <dig>  first parity piglets had a  <dig>  higher probability of developing nnpds than piglets born by mature sows.
the epidemiological pattern of diarrhoea varied a lot between herds; however, in all herds first parity piglets seemed predisposed.
the reason for one of the herds experiencing a considerably more severe outbreak than the others was not explained by factors addressed in this study.
the most important factors associated with nnpds were herd of origin and sow-parity.
in total of 26% of piglets had liquid faeces on the day of birth.
