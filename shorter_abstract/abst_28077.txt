the data highlights the h. capsulatum and pneumocystis spp.co-infection in bat populationâ€™s suggesting interplay with this wild host.
infections in this flying mammal,  <dig> bat lungs from argentina ,  <dig> from french guyana , and  <dig> from mexico  were screened using nested-pcr of the fragments, employing the hcp <dig> locus for h. capsulatum and the mtlsurrna and mtssurrna loci for pneumocystis organisms.
histoplasma capsulatum and pneumocystis organisms cause host infections primarily affecting the lung tissue.
h. capsulatum is endemic in the united states of america and latin american countries.
in special environments, h. capsulatum is commonly associated with bat and bird droppings.
bats infected with h. capsulatum or pneumocystis spp.
to evaluate the impact of h. capsulatum and pneumocystis spp.
of the  <dig> bats studied,  <dig> revealed h. capsulatum infections in which  <dig> of these bats exhibited this infection alone.
in addition,  <dig> bats revealed pneumocystis spp.
