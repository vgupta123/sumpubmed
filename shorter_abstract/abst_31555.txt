hypoxic exposure induced a marked alteration in the retinal transcriptome with significantly different expression levels of  <dig> genes immediately after hypoxic exposure.
retinal degeneration is a main cause of blindness in humans.
hypoxic preconditioning stabilizes the transcription factor hif-1Î± in the retina and strongly protects photoreceptors in an animal model of light-induced retinal degeneration.
to address the molecular mechanisms of the protection, we analyzed the transcriptome of the hypoxic retina using microarrays and real-time pcr.
our data suggest that neuroprotection after hypoxic preconditioning is the result of the differential expression of a multitude of genes which may act in concert to protect visual cells against a toxic insult.
