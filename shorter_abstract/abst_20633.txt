most described species live freely on the exterior of their hosts as adults , while other taxa permanently reside in galls, cysts, or within the host’s mouth, digestive system, coelom, or gonads.
gall- and some cyst-dwellers were recovered as a clade, while cyst-to-free-living forms were found as a grade including two clades of internal host-eaters , mouth/digestive system inhabitants, and other cyst-dwellers.
taxa that dwell within the mouth or digestive system and some cyst forms are arguably derived from cyst-to-free-living ancestors – possibly the result of a free-living form moving to the mouth and paedomorphic retention of the juvenile cyst.
previous molecular studies of myzostomids have had limited sampling with respect to assessing the evolutionary relationships within the group; therefore molecular data from  <dig> myzostomid taxa were analyzed using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods.
co-phylogenetic analyses rejected a null-hypothesis of random associations at the global level, but not for individual associations.
phylogenetic conservatism in host use was observed among related myzostomid taxa.
clades of myzostomids were recovered that associated with asteroids, ophiuroids, and stalked or feather star crinoids.
