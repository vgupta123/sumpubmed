since this method is so simple, general, and yet powerful, it can be applied to various organisms and cells, especially single-celled, uncluturable ones, for their genome analysis.
in this paper, we have developed a method which provides a sufficient amount of data from an unculturable organism.
there is no effective method to obtain genome information from single-celled unculturable organisms such as radiolarians.
sequence analysis of 18s rdna has been carried out, but obtaining the data has been difficult and it has provided a rather limited amount of genome information.
this fact has shown that genome profiling-based technology developed here can obtain genome information being sufficient for identifying and classifying species from a single-celled organism.
the effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by applying it to the provisional classification of a set of unculturable organisms .
