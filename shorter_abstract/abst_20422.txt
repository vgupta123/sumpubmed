conformational diseases are a class of disorders associated with the expression of misfolded protein.
in this context, we sought to identify er stress signals associated with mutant c282y hfe protein expression, which may have a role in the molecular pathogenesis of hh.
we have shown that expression of c282y hfe protein triggers both an unfolded protein response , as revealed by the increased grp <dig>  atf <dig> and chop expression, and an er overload response , as indicated by nf-Îºb activation.
furthermore, c282y hfe protein induced apoptotic responses associated with activation of er stress.
our novel observations suggest that both the er overload response  and the unfolded protein response  are activated by mutant c282y hfe protein.
inhibition studies demonstrated that tauroursodeoxycholic acid, an endogenous bile acid, downregulates these events.
hfe c282y is a mutant protein that does not fold correctly and consequently is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum .
finally, we found that the co-existence of both c282y hfe and z alpha 1-antitrypsin protein  expression on er stress responses acted as potential disease modifiers with respect to each other.
hereditary hemochromatosis  is a genetic disease associated with iron overload, in which individuals homozygous for the mutant c282y hfe associated allele are at risk for the development of a range of disorders particularly liver disease.
vector constructs of wild type hfe and mutant c282y hfe were made and transfected into hek <dig> cell lines.
