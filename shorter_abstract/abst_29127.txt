indoor-housed sows had an increased risk of wounds , calluses  and capped hock  on their limbs when housed on fully slatted floors compared with solid concrete floors.
in lactating sows housed indoors there was a general trend for an increased risk of limb and body lesions in sows housed on slatted floors compared with those housed on solid concrete floors with bedding.
the prevalence of and risks for limb and body lesions on lactating sows on commercial english pig farms were investigated using direct observation of the sows and their housing.
in addition, there was an increased risk of bursitis , capped hock  and shoulder lesions  in sows that were unwilling to rise to their feet.
there was a decreased risk of shoulder lesions  and lesions elsewhere on the body  in sows with more than  <dig> cm between their tail and the back of the crate compared with sows with less than  <dig> cm.
sows that were less responsive to human presence and sows that had the least space to move within their crates had an additional increased risk of lesions.
the prevalence of limb and body lesions was significantly lower in outdoor-housed sows compared with indoor-housed sows.
the sample of outdoor housed sows in this study had the lowest prevalence of limb and body lesions.
