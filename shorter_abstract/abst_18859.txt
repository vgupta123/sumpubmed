the results indicate that horizontal gene transfer contributes to the emergence of rpbp <dig> by phylogeny restricted transformation.
group ii low-rpbp <dig> predominated , with significant proportions of isolates non-susceptible to cefotaxime  and meropenem .
we combined multilocus sequence typing  and ftsi/pbp <dig> typing to study the emergence and spread of rpbp <dig> in nontypeable h. influenzae  in norway.
this study is the first to link ftsi alleles to sts in h. influenzae.
the need of continuous monitoring of beta-lactam susceptibility and a global system for molecular surveillance of rpbp <dig> strains is underlined.
four mlst sequence types  with characteristic, highly diverging ftsi alleles accounted for 61% of the rpbp <dig> isolates.
the prevalence of rpbp <dig> in a population of  <dig> eye, ear and respiratory isolates  from  <dig> was 15%.
infection sites, age groups, hospitalization rates and rpbp <dig> frequencies differed between sts and phylogenetic groups.
beta-lactam resistance in haemophilus influenzae due to ftsi mutations causing altered penicillin-binding protein  <dig>  is increasing worldwide.
knowledge about the molecular epidemiology of rpbp <dig> strains is limited.
low-level resistant isolates with the n526k substitution  predominate in most geographical regions, while high-level resistant isolates with the additional s385t substitution  are common in japan and south korea.
clonally related virulent rpbp <dig> strains are widely disseminated and high-level resistant isolates emerge in new geographical regions, threatening current empiric antibiotic treatment.
combining mlst and ftsi/pbp <dig> typing is a powerful tool for this purpose.
group iii high-rpbp <dig> was identified for the first time in northern europe.
