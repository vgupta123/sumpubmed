sensitive remote homology detection and accurate alignments especially in the midnight zone of sequence similarity are needed for better function annotation and structural modeling of proteins.
the effect of using adjoining column information has also been investigated and is found to increase the sensitivity of hmm-hmm alignments and remote homology detection.
an algorithm, alignhush for hmm-hmm alignment has been developed which is capable of recognizing distantly related domain families the method uses structural information, in the form of predicted secondary structure probabilities, and hydrophobicity of amino acids to align hmms of two sets of aligned sequences.
the alignment length and the alignment quality are found to be appropriate for homology modeling and function annotation.
the proposed method could effectively aid obtaining clues to functions of proteins of yet unknown function.
alignhush performs better than the best hmm-hmm alignment methods and is observed to be even more sensitive at higher error rates.
the alignment accuracy is found to be comparable to existing methods for profile-profile alignments.
a web-server incorporating the alignhush method is available at http://crick.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~alignhush/
