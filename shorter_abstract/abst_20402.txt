so we established the antennal transcriptome of e. hippophaecolus and characterized the expression profiles of odorant binding proteins.
eogystia hippophaecolus   is the major threat to seabuckthorn plantations in china.
based on phylogenetic analysis, we found one orco and three pheromone receptors of e. hippophaecolus and found that ehipgr <dig> detects sugar, ehipgr <dig> and ehipgr <dig> detect bitter.
these results establish and improve the basis knowledge of the olfactory receptive system, furthermore provide a theoretical basis for the development of new pest control method.
obp <dig> was the highest and biased expressed in the foot and may function as identification of host plant volatiles.
nine obps expression profile indicated that most were the highest expression in antennae, consistent with functions of obps in binding and transporting odors during the antennal recognition process.
we identified  <dig> transcripts encoding putative odorant-binding proteins ,  <dig> putative chemosensory proteins ,  <dig> odorant receptors ,  <dig> gustatory receptors ,  <dig> ionotropic receptors , and two sensory neuron membrane proteins .
however, few obp was detected biased expression in the foot and external genitalia, and these loci may function in pheromone recognition, mating, and the recognition of plant volatiles.
one hundred thirty-seven chemosensory proteins were identified and the accurate functions and groups of part proteins were obtained by phylogenetic analysis.
