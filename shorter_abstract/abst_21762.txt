human endogenous retroviruses  are surviving traces of ancient retrovirus infections and now reside within the human dna.
few of the active hervs have open reading frames for retroviral proteins.
we introduce a generative mixture model, based on hidden markov models, for estimating the activities of the individual herv sequences from est  databases.
we also empirically justify a faster heuristic method for herv activity estimation and use it to estimate the activities of  <dig> hervs.
17â€“ <dig> june  <dig> probabilistic modeling and machine learning in structural and systems biology tuusula, finland
the active ones are spread unevenly into herv groups and relatively uniformly in terms of estimated age.
recently herv expression has been detected in both normal tissues and diseased patients.
the majority of the herv activities were previously unknown.
however, the activities  of individual herv sequences are mostly unknown.
we use the model to estimate the relative activities of  <dig> hervs.
