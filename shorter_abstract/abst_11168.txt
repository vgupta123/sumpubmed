analysis of publicly available microarray data revealed that the transcriptional responses of the crks to o <dig> were very similar to responses to microbes or pathogen-associated molecular patterns .
plant receptor-like/pelle kinases  are a group of conserved signalling components that regulate developmental programs and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.
although o <dig> is classified as an abiotic stress to plants, transcriptional profiling of crks showed strong similarities between the o <dig> and biotic stress responses.
several crks were transcriptionally induced by exposure to o <dig> but not by light stress.
o <dig> induces an extracellular oxidative burst, whilst light stress leads to ros production in chloroplasts.
one of the largest rlk groups is formed by the domain of unknown function  <dig>  rlks, also called cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases , which have been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of pathogen defence and programmed cell death.
we examined the transcriptional regulation of all arabidopsis crks by ozone , high light and pathogen/elicitor treatment - conditions known to induce the production of reactive oxygen species  in various subcellular compartments.
several mutants altered in hormone biosynthesis or signalling showed changes in basal and o3-induced transcriptional responses.
combining expression analysis from multiple treatments with mutants altered in hormone biosynthesis or signalling suggest a model in which o <dig> and salicylic acid  activate separate signaling pathways that exhibit negative crosstalk.
