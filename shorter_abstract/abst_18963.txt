in accordance with the eu regulation 1266/ <dig>  veterinary authorities are requested to determine vector-free periods for loosing trade and movement restrictions of susceptible livestock.
restrictions to trade and movement are always associated with an economic impact during epidemic diseases.
within the last few decades culicoides spp.
to minimize these impacts, risk assessments based on the vector-free period or the basic reproduction number r <dig> can essentially support veterinary authorities to improve protection and control measurements.
for the determination of vector-free period and r <dig> a continuously operating daily culicoides spp.
contrary, values of r0< <dig> were estimated for ahs during the whole period.
the vector-free period lasted about  <dig> days inside stables, while less than five culicoides were trapped outdoors on  <dig> days per season, i.e.

emerged europe-wide as a major vector for epizootic viral diseases e.g.
values of r0< <dig> indicate periods with no disease transmission risk.
the periods without transmission risk, i.e.
finally, the basic reproduction numbers were projected to the future by using temperature forecasts for the period 2014– <dig>  while the mean summer peak values for bt increase from of r0= <dig>  to r0= <dig>  until  <dig> , no risk for ahs was estimated even under climate warming assumptions.
additionally, the widely used basic reproduction number r <dig> is optionally applied for risk assessment of vector-borne diseases.
for bt, a basic reproduction number of r0> <dig> was found each year between june and august.
