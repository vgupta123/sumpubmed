here, we present the parent-of-origin-based detection  method for chromosomal abnormality detection in trio-based snp microarray data.
our software implementation, tripod, was benchmarked using a simulated dataset, outperformed comparable software for sensitivity of abnormality detection, and displayed substantial improvement in the detection of low-level mosaicism while maintaining comparable specificity.
examples of low-level mosaic abnormalities from a large autism dataset demonstrate the benefits of the increased sensitivity provided by tripod.
our method and software provide a significant advancement in the ability to detect low-level mosaic abnormalities, thereby opening new avenues for research into the implications of mosaicism in pathogenic and non-pathogenic processes.
the tripod analyses showed robustness across multiple types of illumina microarray chips.
mosaic somatic alterations are present in all multi-cellular organisms, but the physiological effects of low-level mosaicism are largely unknown.
