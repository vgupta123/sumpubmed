these findings expand the knowledge of the developing porcine microbiota which is important for understanding susceptibility to disease, particularly for vulnerable neonatal pigs.
the purpose of this study was to use high-throughput next-generation sequencing to characterize the fecal and nasal microbiotas of pigs during early life.
however, knowledge of the early-age microbiota of pigs is lacking.
dna was extracted from fecal and nasal samples and the hypervariable region v <dig> of the 16s rrna gene was amplified.
during this developmental period, a pig was exposed to an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  species of bacteria by way of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, respectively.
the mammalian microbiota plays a key role in host health and disease susceptibility.
aging was significantly associated with an increasing measure of richness and diversity as well as with distinct changes to the core microbiota.
in total,  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million high-quality sequences were recovered from fecal and nasal samples, respectively.
analysis revealed that these microbiotas contain a very rich and diverse population of bacteria that display a remarkable evolution during the first 7 weeks of life.
at 2– <dig> weeks post-weaning, the rapidly developing microbiotas appeared to reach a developmental milestone as a relative degree of stability was evident.
