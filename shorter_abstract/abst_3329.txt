our previously published purification method used ceramic filtration followed by two chromatography steps, resulting in a protein recovery of 30%.
griffithsin extracted with this protocol maintains activity comparable to griffithsin purified by the previously published method and we are able to recover a substantially higher yield: 88 ± 5% of griffithsin from the initial extract.
the methodology developed to purify griffithsin introduces and develops multiple tools for purification of recombinant proteins from plants at an industrial scale.
considering the future need to transfer griffithsin manufacturing technology to resource poor areas, we chose to focus modifying the purification process, paying particular attention to introducing simple, low-cost, and scalable procedures such as use of temperature, ph, ion concentration, and filtration to enhance product recovery.
the method was scaled to produce gram quantities of griffithsin with high yields, low endotoxin levels, and low purification costs maintained.
an efficient, scaleable manufacturing process for griffithsin active pharmaceutical ingredient  is essential for particularly cost-sensitive products such as griffithsin -based topical microbicides for hiv- <dig> prevention in resource poor settings.
our objective was to develop a scalable purification method for griffithsin expressed in nicotiana benthamiana plants that would increase yield, reduce production costs, and simplify manufacturing techniques.
