the arm0029b mt genome contains a group i intron, with an orf containing two laglidadg motifs, in cox <dig>  the intronic orf is shared by c. vulgaris and prototheca.
to elucidate the evolution of organelle genomes and genetic information of chlorella, we have sequenced and characterized the cp and mt genomes of arctic chlorella sp.
chlorella cp genomes are highly rearranged except for a chlorella-specific six-gene cluster, and the arm0029b plastid resembles that of chlorella variabilis except for a 15-kb gene cluster inversion.
the plastid genome of arm0029b is similar to that of c. variabilis.
mitochondrial phylogenomic analyses, however, indicated that arm0029b shows a greater affinity to mx-az <dig> and coccomyxa than to the helicosporidium-prototheca clade, although the detailed phylogenetic relationships among the three taxa remain to be resolved.
the  <dig> -bp cp genome lacking inverted repeats and  <dig> -bp mt genome were sequenced.
in the mt genome,  <dig> conserved genes, including  <dig> trna genes,  <dig> rrna genes, and  <dig> genes encoding proteins were determined.
the mt genome of arm0029b is similar to that of the non-photosynthetic species prototheca and heicosporidium.
the presence of the cox <dig> intron at  <dig> in all four investigated chlorellales taxa indicates that the cox <dig> intron had been introduced in early chorellales as a cis-splice form and that the cis-splicing intron was inherited to recent chlorellales and was recently trans-spliced in helicosporidium.
chorella is the representative taxon of chlorellales in trebouxiophyceae, and its chloroplast  genomic information has been thought to depend only on studies concerning chlorella vulgaris and genbank information of c. variablis.
the phylogeny of the plastid genome reveals that arm0029b showed a close relationship of chlorella to parachlorella and oocystis within chlorellales.
the mt sequence of arm0029b is the first genome to be reported for chlorella.
