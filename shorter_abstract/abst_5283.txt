after chromatography the eluted proteins were further separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by tandem mass spectrometry.
our results demonstrate that endonuclein interacts with several proteins indicating a broad function including signal transduction and chaperone activity.
we have previously identified endonuclein as a cell cycle regulated wd-repeat protein that is up-regulated in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
the interacting proteins were identified as; tax interaction protein  <dig> , aα fibrinogen transcription factor , immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein , human er-associated dnaj , endonuclein interaction protein  <dig> , and pregnancy specific β- <dig> glycoproteins .
using the cdna encoding human endonuclein, we have expressed and purified the recombinant protein from escherichia coli using metal affinity chromatography.
