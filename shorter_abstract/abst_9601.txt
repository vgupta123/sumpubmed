the radiation and abundance of core-sines in marsupial genomes indicates that they may be a major player in the evolution of marsupials.
a correlation between a speciation event and a major burst of retroposon activity is for the first time shown in a marsupial genome.
moreover, we discovered a new subtype of wsine <dig>  that comprises at least 90% of all tasmanian devil wsine1s.
to better understand the tasmanian devil genome, we screened it for transposable elements and investigated the dynamics of short interspersed element  retroposons.
the temporal history of tasmanian devil sines, elucidated using a transposition in transposition analysis, indicates that wsine <dig>  a core-sine present in around  <dig>  copies, is the most recently active element.
it is evident that the early phases of evolution of the carnivorous marsupial order dasyuromorphia was characterized by a burst of sine activity.
the frequencies of wsine <dig> subtypes differ in the genomes of two of the other australian marsupial orders.
the genome of the carnivorous marsupial, the tasmanian devil , was sequenced in the hopes of finding a cure for or gaining a better understanding of the contagious devil facial tumor disease that is threatening the speciesâ€™ survival.
phylogenetic analyses and divergence time estimates of mitochondrial genome data indicate a rapid radiation of the tasmanian devil and the closest relative the quolls  around  <dig> million years ago.
