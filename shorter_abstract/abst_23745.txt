we proposed a gene network modular-based linear discriminant analysis approach by integrating 'essential' correlation structure among genes into the predictor in order that the modules or cluster structures of genes, which are related to the diagnostic classes we look for, can have potential biological interpretation.
the modular-based linear discriminant analysis approach induced in the study has the potential to increase the power of discriminant analysis for which sample sizes are small and there are large number of genes in the microarray studies.
we evaluated performance of the new method with other established classification methods using three real data sets.
our results show that the new approach has the advantage of computational simplicity and efficiency with relatively lower classification error rates than the compared methods in many cases.
