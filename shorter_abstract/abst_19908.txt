in a compound conversion network from human liver, the  <dig> branch points involved showed a dramatically higher average degree, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality as a whole.
from global topological organization, rate-limiting enzymes as a whole surround most of the branch points; so they can influence the flux through branch points.
nearly half of the in vivo inhibitors were products of rate-limiting enzymes, and covered  <dig> % of the inhibited targets in metabolic inhibitory networks.
since nearly half of the in vivo enzyme inhibitors are produced by rate-limiting enzymes in human liver, these enzymes can initiate inhibitory regulation and then influence metabolic flux through their natural products.
rate-limiting enzymes, because of their relatively low velocity, are believed to influence metabolic flux in pathways.
to investigate their regulatory role in metabolic networks, we look at the global organization and interactions between rate-limiting enzymes and compounds such as branch point metabolites and enzyme inhibitors in human liver.
based on  <dig> rate-limiting enzymes and  <dig> branch point compounds from human liver, we found that rate-limiting enzymes surrounded  <dig> % of branch points.
