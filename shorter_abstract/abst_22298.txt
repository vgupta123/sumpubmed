besides, the role in sldab overexpression, coenzyme and respiratory chain engineering and their subsequent effects on 5-kga production were investigated.
furthermore, through the coenzyme and respiratory chain engineering, the titer and productivity of 5-kga reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l and  <dig>  g/, respectively, in a 15 l fermenter.
the 5-kga production could be significantly enhanced with the combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy in gluconobacter strain, including sldab overexpression, coenzyme and respiratory chain engineering.
it could be further improved the 5-kga titer by  <dig>  % through the fed-batch fermentation under the ph shift and dissolved oxygen tension  control condition, obtained 162 ±  <dig>  g/l with the productivity of  <dig>  g/ within 64 h.
the aim of this work is to enhance 5-kga accumulation using combinatorial metabolic engineering strategies in g. oxydans.
the sldab gene, encoding sorbitol dehydrogenase, was overexpressed in an industrial strain g. oxydans zju <dig> under a carefully selected promoter, p <dig>  to enhance the efficiency of the oxidation by sldab, the coenzyme pyrroloquinoline quinone  and respiratory chain were engineered.

by self-overexpressing the sldab gene in g. oxydans zju <dig> under the constitutive promoter p <dig>  the resulting strain, g. oxydans zju <dig>  produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l of 5-kga.
production of 5-keto-d-gluconate  from glucose by gluconobacter oxydans is the first step to produce l-ta.
l--tartaric acid  is an important organic acid, which is produced from the cream of tartar or stereospecific hydrolysis of the cis-epoxysuccinate.
all of these demonstrated that the robust recombinant strain can efficiently produce 5-kga in larger scale to fulfill the industrial production of l-ta from 5-kga.
fed-batch fermentation could further enlarge the positive effect and increase the 5-kga production.
an efficient, stable recombinant strain was constructed, whereas the 5-kga production could be enhanced.
