tyrosine phosphorylation of the cd300a itims created docking sites for both src homology  <dig> domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase - <dig> and shp- <dig>  suppression of shp- <dig> and shp- <dig> expression in kir-cd300a jurkat t cells with sirna and the use of dt <dig> chicken b cell lines expressing cd300a and deficient in several phosphatases revealed that shp- <dig>  but not shp- <dig> or the src homology  <dig> domain containing inositol 5â€™ phosphatase ship, was utilized by cd300a for its inhibitory activity.
first, we have expressed in jurkat t cells a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domains of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2dl <dig> fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments of cd300a  to explore surrogate ligand-stimulated inhibition of superantigen stimulated t cell receptor  mediated cell signaling.
activation signals can be negatively regulated by cell surface receptors bearing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs .
we found that intact cd300a itims were essential for inhibition and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of these itims required the src tyrosine kinase lck.
cd300a, an itim bearing type i transmembrane protein, is expressed on many hematopoietic cells, including subsets of lymphocytes.
