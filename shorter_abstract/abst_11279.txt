in a mir- <dig> transfection experiment spanning  <dig> hours, for genes with measurably down-regulated mrna, exploratory functional data analysis showed differences in expression profiles over time between directly and indirectly down-regulated genes, such as response latency and biphasic response for direct mirna targets.
this approach would be applicable to the investigation of other mirnas and suggests that dynamic microarray studies at a higher time resolution could reveal further details on mirna regulation.
predictive fda models can be applied where computational mirna target predictors fail or are unreliable, e.g.
an alternative approach explored in this paper is the use of gene expression profiles from time-series microarray experiments to aid in mirna target prediction.
this requires distinguishing genuine targets from genes that are secondarily down-regulated as part of the same regulatory module.
one approach is computational: searching nucleotide sequences for mirna complementary base pairing.
exploratory fda analysis can reveal interesting aspects of dynamic microarray mirna studies.
when there is a lack of evolutionary conservation, and can provide posterior probabilities to provide additional confirmatory evidence to validate candidate mirna targets computationally predicted using sequence information.
