the rifampicin-resistance related hotspots within the rpob gene were amplified and sequenced using pcr and no rpob mutations were found in strains with rifampicin mics of >2Â mg/l.
the aim of this study was to identify the species and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of brucella strains isolated from clinical specimens, from qatar.
no resistant isolates were detected among conventionally used antimicrobial agents.
all isolates were identified as b. melitensis.
this study identified b. melitensis as the etiological agent of brucellosis in qatar.
