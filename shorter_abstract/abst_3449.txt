results revealed  <dig> c. reinhardtii mapk genes labeled crmapk2â€“crmapk <dig> with txy conserved domains and low homology to mapk in yeast, arabidopsis, and humans.
arabidopsis mapk gene sequences were used as entry data to search for homologous genes in chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome database to investigate the functions of mitogen-activated protein kinase  gene family in c. reinhardtii under iron-free conditions.
an rna interference vector was constructed and transformed into c. reinhardtii 2a <dig>  an algal strain with an exogenous fox1:ars chimeric gene, to silence crmapk <dig>  after this gene was silenced, the mrna levels and ars activities of fox1:ars chimeric gene and endogenous crfox <dig> were decreased.
crmapk <dig> regulates the expression of iron-deficiency-responsive genes in c. reinhardtii.
the mrna levels of crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig> were remarkably upregulated under iron-deficient stress.
the mrna levels of iron-responsive genes, such as crnramp <dig>  cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig>  were also remarkably reduced.
nevertheless, the response, transmission, and regulation of downstream gene expression in algae cells have not to be investigated.
considering that the mapk pathway is essential for abiotic stress responses, we determined whether this pathway is involved in iron deficiency signal transduction in chlamydomonas.
under iron-deficient conditions, chlamydomonas exhibits high affinity for iron absorption.
the expression levels of these genes were then analyzed through qrt-pcr and exposure to high salt , low nitrogen, or iron-free conditions.
the expression levels of these genes were also subjected to adverse stress conditions.
