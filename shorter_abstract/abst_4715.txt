promising results were obtained in a variety of examples in human, mouse, and rat genomes.
the novelty of the method is that it takes advantage of spatial conservation in the sequence and supports multiple species.
identifying cis-regulatory elements is crucial to understanding gene expression, which highlights the importance of the computational detection of overrepresented transcription factor binding sites  in coexpressed or coregulated genes.
however, this is a challenging problem, especially when considering higher eukaryotic organisms.
