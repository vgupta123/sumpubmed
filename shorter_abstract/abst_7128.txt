a total of  <dig>  unique singletons were identified after clustering natural and artificial duplicates from pyrosequencing reads.
next generation dna pyrosequencing technology applied to p. alba transcripts produced a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads with an average length of  <dig> bp.
this study generated a successful global analysis of the p. alba leaf transcriptome after bioinformatic and wet laboratory validations of rna-seq data.
this information will strongly contribute to genomics resources for p. alba functional analysis and genetics.
prosopis alba  is an important native tree adapted to arid and semiarid regions of north-western argentina which is of great value as multipurpose species.
regarding the non-redundant sequences or unigenes,  <dig>  out of  <dig>  were successfully annotated with gene ontology terms.
additionally, another set of  <dig> nuclear polymorphic ssrs were determined in silico, of which 50% have the probability of being effectively polymorphic.
here we describe the development of a leaf transcriptome and the identification of new molecular markers that could support functional genetic studies in natural and domesticated populations of this genus.
the limited set of molecular markers currently available will be significantly increased with the thousands of new markers that were identified in this study.
