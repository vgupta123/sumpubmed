the teleost zoarces viviparus  lives along the coasts of northern europe and has long been an established model organism for marine ecology and environmental monitoring.
in the present study we present the first comprehensive characterization of the zoarces viviparus liver transcriptome.
the generated sequence data, including the validated microarray probes, are publicly available to promote genome-wide research in zoarces viviparus.
from  <dig>  reads generated by massively parallel pyrosequencing, more than  <dig>  pieces of putative transcripts were assembled, annotated and functionally classified.
the sequence data was consequently used to design an oligonucleotide microarray for large-scale gene expression analysis.
the scarce information about this species genome has however restrained the use of efficient molecular-level assays, such as gene expression microarrays.
our results show that one run using a genome sequencer flx from  <dig> life science/roche generates enough genomic information for adequate de novo assembly of a large number of genes in a higher vertebrate.
the data was estimated to cover roughly 40% of the total transcriptome and homologues for about half of the genes of gasterosteus aculeatus  were identified.
