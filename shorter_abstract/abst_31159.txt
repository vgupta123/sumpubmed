these toxins are most likely produced by polyketide synthases .
the dinoflagellates toxins known as azaspiracids  are structurally polyethers; we therefore analyse the transcriptome of a. spinosum with respect to polyketide synthases , the primary biosynthetic enzymes in polyketide synthesis.
despite the global distribution of a. spinosum, little is known about molecular features.
in this study, we investigate the genomic and transcriptomic features of a. spinosum with a focus on polyketide synthesis and pks evolution.
we identify orphan and homologous genes by comparing the transcriptome data of a. spinosum with a diverse set of  <dig> other dinoflagellates, five further species out of the rhizaria alveolate stramelopile -group, and one representative from the plantae.
in contrast, within the a. spinosum transcriptome, we discovered  <dig>  orphan transcripts .
we find all the genes thought to be potentially essential for polyketide toxin synthesis to be expressed in a. spinosum, whose pks transcripts fall into the dinoflagellate sub-clade in pks evolution.
overall, we demonstrate that the number of orphan genes in the a. spinosum genome is relatively small compared to other dinoflagellate species.
in addition, all pks domains needed to produce the azaspiracid carbon backbone are present in a. spinosum.
many of these species are capable of forming harmful algae blooms  and of producing potent phycotoxins, thereby causing deleterious impacts on their environment and posing a threat to human health.
the number of orphan genes in the analysed dinoflagellate species averaged 27%.
recently, pks i-like transcripts have been identified in a number of dinoflagellate species.
