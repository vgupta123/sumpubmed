the implemented r package is available online .
for the three mapped ptm databases which had sufficient numbers of modification sites for generating models , the resulting models yielded high overall predictive performance as judged by a combined performance score .
compared to the other classifiers we also evaluated, the svm provided the best performance overall.
among the multiple properties of amino acids that were used in the classification tasks, hydrophobicity was found to contribute substantially to the performance of the final predictive models.
thus, in order to predict localization within or outside of ppirs for the vast majority of ptms, a machine learning strategy was used to generate predictive models from these mapped databases.
the models and data presented here should be useful in prioritizing both known and newly identified ptms for further studies to determine the functional relationship between specific ptms and protein-protein interactions.
the ability to predict whether sites of protein modifications are inside or outside of ppirs would be useful in further elucidating the regulatory mechanisms by which modifications of specific proteins regulate their cellular functions.
using two of the comprehensive databases for protein-protein interaction and protein modification site data , we created new databases that map ptms to their locations inside or outside of ppirs.
