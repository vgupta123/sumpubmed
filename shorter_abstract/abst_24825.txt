common software testing procedures involve executing the target program with a set of test inputs and then verifying the correctness of the test outputs.
the correctness of such programs is crucial as incorrectly computed results may lead to wrong biological conclusion or misguide downstream experimentation.
instead of requiring a mechanism to verify whether an individual test output is correct, the mt technique verifies whether a pair of test outputs conform to a set of domain specific properties, called metamorphic relations , thus greatly increases the number and variety of test cases that can be applied.
recent advances in experimental and computational technologies have fueled the development of many sophisticated bioinformatics programs.
however, due to the complexity of many bioinformatics programs, it is often difficult to verify the correctness of the test outputs.
we propose to use a novel software testing technique, metamorphic testing , to test a range of bioinformatics programs.
to demonstrate how mt is used in practice, we applied mt to test two open-source bioinformatics programs, namely gnlab and seqmap.
this paper describes the application of a simple, effective and automated technique to systematically test a range of bioinformatics programs.
since many bioinformatics programs, particularly those for large scale simulation and data analysis, are hard to test systematically, their developers may benefit from using mt as part of the testing strategy.
