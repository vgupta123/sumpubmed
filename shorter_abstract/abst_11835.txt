the meta-, conditional and allelic effect analyses suggested that pleiotropy, rather than tight linkage, was the genetic basis of the three pairs of co-localized of sw and sl qtls.
in addition, the significance level and genetic effect of the three co-localized qtls for both sw and sl showed great variation before and after the conditional analysis.
the main objectives of this study were to dissect the genetic basis of sw and sl in rapeseed through the preliminary mapping of quantitative trait locus  by linkage analysis and fine mapping of the target major qtl by regional association analysis.
regional association analysis was an effective and highly efficient strategy for the direct fine mapping of target major qtl identified by preliminary linkage mapping.
these qtls were validated and fine mapped  by regional association analysis with a panel of  <dig> inbred lines, which has a relatively rapid linkage disequilibrium decay  in the target qtl region.
preliminary linkage mapping identified thirteen and nine consensus qtls for sw and sl, respectively.
of these qtls, three pairs of sw and sl qtls were co-localized and integrated into three unique qtls.
however, the genetic basis of both traits is poorly understood.
seed weight  and silique length  are important determinants of the yield potential in rapeseed .

these qtls explained  <dig> - <dig> % and  <dig> - <dig> % of the phenotypic variance for sw and sl, respectively.
