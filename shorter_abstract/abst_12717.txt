the observed patterns provide new insights into the mechanisms of the adverse effects associated with these pollutants.
ionizing radiation in low doses is the ubiquitous environmental factor with harmful stochastic effects.
environmental pollutants are capable of altering the expression of a variety of genes.
to identify the similarities and differences in the effects of low-dose ionizing radiation, formaldehyde and dioxin on gene expression, we performed the bioinformatic analysis of all available published data.
