it appears that horizontal gene transfer generally does not totally obliterate evolutionary relationships between phages.
in the genus "t4-like viruses" proper, four groups sharing >70% proteins are distinguished: t4-type, 44rr-type, rb43-type, and rb49-type viruses.
the peduovirinae subfamily, derived from the p2-related phages, is composed of two distinct genera: the "p2-like viruses", and the "hp1-like viruses".
we advocate unifying classical and genomic classification of bacteriophages by integration of proteomic data and physicochemical parameters.
our previous application of this approach to the entirely sequenced members of the podoviridae fully supported the current phage classification of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses .
