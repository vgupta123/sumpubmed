in this study, we mined the available expressed sequence tags  of b. napus and identified a total of  <dig> cpk genes, among which cdna sequences of  <dig> genes were successfully cloned from a double haploid cultivar of canola.
we identified novel, interesting interaction partners for some of the bnacpk proteins.
the yield and quality of canola is frequently threatened by environmental stresses including drought, cold and high salinity.
we also identified and cloned five and eight clade a basic leucine zipper  and protein phosphatase type 2c  genes from canola and, using yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation , determined the interaction between individual bnacpks and bnabzips or bnapp2cs .
cpks are ca2+ sensors that have both ca2+ sensing function and kinase activity within a single protein and play crucial roles in plant development and responses to various environmental stresses.
the subcellular localization of five selected bnacpks was determined using green fluorescence protein  as the reporter.
furthermore, the expression levels of  <dig> bnacpk genes in response to salt, drought, cold, heat, abscisic acid , low potassium  and oxidative stress were studied by quantitative rt-pcr and were found to respond to multiple stimuli, suggesting that canola cpks may be convergence points of different signaling pathways.
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that they could be clustered into four subgroups.
