genome amplification through duplication or proliferation of transposable elements has its counterpart in genome reduction, by elimination of dna or by gene inactivation.
both the contiguous regions of reduction-resistant pairs and the concentration of runs of single copy genes on a single chromosome are evidence of transcriptional co-regulation, dosage sensitivity or other functional interaction constraining the reduction process.
