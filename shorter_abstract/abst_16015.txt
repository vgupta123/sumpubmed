the large number of insect species with medical or economic importance makes this a critical problem to address.
we have shown that this program is a viable tool for cost-effective assembly of a modestly-sized insect genome.
insects, which may yield too little dna from individual specimens for long-read sequencing library construction and often have highly heterozygous genomes, can be particularly hard to assemble using inexpensive short-read sequencing data.
discovar de novo appeared to perform better than allpaths-lg in regions of low complexity.
arabiensis assembly produced with reads from three sequencing libraries and much greater resources.
de novo reference assemblies that are affordable, practical to produce, and of sufficient quality for most downstream applications, remain an unattained goal for many taxa.
discovar de novo performed well assembling the genome of an insect of medical importance, using simpler sequencing input than previous anopheline assemblies.
