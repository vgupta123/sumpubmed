the evident diversification of cids may be neutral or may be important for plant adaptation to the environment and for acquisition of specific traits during evolution.
the fact that cids subclasses are maintained in early lineages suggest that a presumed interference between duplicates was resolved, and a defined function for each subclass was achieved.
we recently found that a novel class that lacks the lsmad domain is present in cid b proteins.
we found that novel variants also evolved in classes cid a and cid c. a specific transcription factor domain is present in a distinct lineage in class a, and a variant that lacks at least two distinct domains was also identified in a divergent lineage in class c. we did not detect any variants in class d cids.
poly-binding proteins  are evolutionarily conserved proteins that have important functions in the regulation of translation and the control of mrna stability in eukaryotes.
most pabps encode a c-terminal domain known as the mlle domain , which can mediate protein interactions.
in earlier work we identified and predicted that four classes of mlle-interacting proteins were present in arabidopsis thaliana, which we named cid a, b, c, and d. these proteins encode transcription-activating domains , the lsm and lsmad domains of ataxin- <dig> , the cue and small muts-related domains , and two rna recognition domains .
