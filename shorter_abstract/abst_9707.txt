new variant of random drift particle swarm optimization , which is used to
problem, it is in general difficult for gradient-based local optimization methods
the experimental results show that the novel variant of rdpso algorithm is able to
solve the above mentioned inverse problem and compared with other well known
two case studies on estimating the parameters of
finding an efficient method to solve the parameter estimation problem  for nonlinear biochemical dynamical systems could help promote the
two nonlinear biochemical dynamic models have been taken as benchmarks, under both
