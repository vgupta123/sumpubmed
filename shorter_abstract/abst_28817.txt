jol <dig> provided superior immunogenicity and effective protection against challenge with a sublethal dose, which demonstrates its potential as a candidate vaccine against edema disease.
salmonella typhimurium  inactivated by a regulated autolysis system was genetically engineered to express the homo-pentameric b subunit of shiga toxin 2e  on its surface.

the expression of stx2eb fused to the signal peptide in jol <dig> was validated by immunoblot analysis.
the increased titers of igg <dig> and igg2a, and of immunomodulatory cytokines indicated that the immunization elicited th <dig> and th <dig> immune responses.
further, immunomodulatory cytokine genes  efficiently upregulated in naïve porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells  pulsed with jol <dig>  at week  <dig> pi, following the challenge with a virulent stx2e-producing escherichia coli in the mice, all immunized mice survived whereas approximately 30% of the mice in the control group died.
2eb gene was transformed into the attenuated s. typhimurium strain, jol <dig>  stx2eb subcloned into the antigen delivery cassette of the plasmid was expressed as fusion protein with the outer membrane protein
proportion of cd3+cd4+ t lymphocyte subpopulation was also significantly augmented in in vivo stimulated splenocytes relative to that in the control group.
