moreover, most of these genes could improve salt tolerance of the transgenic arabidopsis plants, corroborated by a detection of expression variation of several key genes in the salt-tolerance pathways.
sequence identities were extremely high between the orthologous pairs between soybeans, while the paralogous copies in a soybean species showed a relatively high divergence.
moreover, the expression variation of da1-like paralogous genes in soybean was much greater than the orthologous gene pairs between the wild and cultivated soybeans during development and challenging abiotic stresses such as salinity.
to evaluate whether da1-like genes were involved in the evolution of soybeans, we compared variation at both sequence and expression levels of da1-like genes from g. max  and g. soja .
our work suggested that expression diversification of da1-like genes is functionally associated with adaptive radiation of soybeans, reinforcing that the plant-specific da <dig> gene family might have contributed to the successful adaption to complex environments and radiation of the plants.
nevertheless, overexpressing them reduced transgenic arabidopsis seed germination sensitivity to salt stress.
we further found that overexpressing gsoda <dig> genes did not affect seed size.
