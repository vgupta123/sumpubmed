the functional core of mistic consists of  <dig> moderately conserved residues that are sufficient for membrane targeting and integration.
mistic is a unique bacillus subtilis protein with virtually no detectable homologues in genbank, which appears to integrate into the bacterial membrane despite an overall hydrophilic composition.
residue variation amongst these sequences is restricted to loop regions of the protein's structure, suggesting that secondary structure elements and overall fold have been conserved.
to better understand the structure and function of mistic, we systematically searched for and characterized homologous proteins among closely related bacteria.
three homologues of mistic were found with 62% to 93% residue identity, all only  <dig> residues in length, corresponding to the c-terminal residues of b. subtilis mistic.
understanding the minimal structural and chemical complexity of mistic will lead to insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of mistic-chaperoned membrane integration, as well as how to optimize its use for the recombinant heterologous expression of other integral membrane proteins of interest.
