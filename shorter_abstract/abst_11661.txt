a major difference between the two platforms was uncovered by analysis of alternatively spliced genes.
despite the fact that the results of gene expression analysis were highly consistent between human transcriptome arrays and rna-seq platforms, the analysis of alternative splicing produced discordant results.
this reduced the number of differentially expressed genes and genes with predictive potential for rna-seq compared to microarray data.
investigation of differential exon abundance showed insufficient reads for many exons and exon junctions in rna-seq while the detection on the array platform was more stable.

we concluded that modern microarrays can still outperform sequencing for standard analysis of gene expression in terms of reproducibility and cost.
both platforms performed equally well for protein-coding rnas, however the stochastic variability was higher for the sequencing data than for microarrays.
analysis of this variability revealed a lack of reads for short and low abundant genes; lncrnas, being shorter and less abundant rnas, were found especially susceptible to this issue.
