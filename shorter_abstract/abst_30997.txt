without affecting basal no, hypoxia increased no concentration in pgf2α-contracted arteries, and an no synthase inhibitor, l-noarg, reduced hypoxic vasodilation.
the present results in porcine coronary arteries suggest no contributes to hypoxic vasodilation, probably through k channel opening, which is reversed by addition of et- <dig> and enhanced by endothelin receptor antagonism.
these latter findings suggest that endothelin receptor activation counteracts hypoxic vasodilation.
we investigated the role of et- <dig>  the no pathway, the potassium channels and radical oxygen species in hypoxia-induced vasodilation of large coronary arteries.
et- <dig> is reported to augment superoxide anion generation and may counteract nitric oxide  vasodilation.
the systemic vascular response to hypoxia is vasodilation.
moreover, et- <dig> was proposed to contribute to increased vascular resistance in heart failure by increasing the production of asymmetric dimethylarginine .
blocking of potassium channels with tea  inhibited vasodilation to o <dig> lowering as well as to no.
in prostaglandin f2α -contracted segments with endothelium, gradual lowering of oxygen tension from  <dig> to 1% o <dig> resulted in vasodilation.
the superoxide scavenger tiron  and the putative nadph oxidase inhibitor apocynin  leftward shifted concentration-response curves for o <dig> lowering without changing vasodilation to 1% o <dig>  peg  catalase  inhibited h2o <dig> vasodilation, but failed to affect vasodilation to o <dig> lowering.
the mitochondrial inhibitors rotenone  and antimycin a  both inhibited hypoxic vasodilatation.
the vasodilation to o <dig> lowering was rightward shifted in segments without endothelium at all o <dig> concentrations except at 1% o <dig>  the endothelin receptor antagonist sb <dig>  markedly increased hypoxic dilation despite the free tissue et- <dig> concentration in the arterial wall was unchanged in 1% o <dig> versus 95% o <dig>  exogenous et- <dig> reversed hypoxic dilation in segments with and without endothelium, and the hypoxic arteries showed an increased sensitivity towards et- <dig> compared to the normoxic controls.
