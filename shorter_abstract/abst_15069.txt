then, to test whether pg interaction was required for this immobilization, we genetically removed the pg binding domain and repeated the frap experiment.
therefore, other mechanisms are needed to explain this observation, such as the presence of physical barriers in the om, or strong interactions with other elements in the cell envelope.
ompa is an abundant outer membrane protein in e. coli containing a pg-binding domain.
first, we show that ompa, containing a pg binding domain, does not exhibit long-range lateral diffusion in the om.
