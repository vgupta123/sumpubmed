gene expression profiles using microarrays revealed differential expression of most "housekeeping" genes during the course of hcv-hcc, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and beta-actin , genes frequently used for normalization.
tumorigenesis is associated with changes in gene expression and involves many pathways.
dysregulated genes include "housekeeping" genes that are often used for normalization for quantitative real-time rt-pcr , which may lead to unreliable results.
using them for normalization had strong effects on the extent of differential expressed genes, leading to misinterpretation of the results.
the combination of ribosomal protein large  <dig>  and sfrs <dig> used for normalization led to very similar results as sfrs <dig> alone and is a very good choice for reference in this disease as shown on four differentially expressed genes.
this study assessed eight stages of hepatitis c virus  induced hepatocellular carcinoma  to search for appropriate genes for normalization.
the utilization of at least two genes for normalization is robust and advantageous, because they can compensate for slight differences of their expression when not co-regulated.
