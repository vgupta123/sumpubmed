recently, the use of anesthetics such as isoflurane has been shown to be protective after cerebral ischemia.
isoflurane treatment did not reduce brain edema compared with controls in any of the applied isoflurane concentrations.
brain water content, neurological outcomes and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> and - <dig>  plasma levels were quantified at 24 hours.
in this study, male sprague–dawley rats  were subjected to ich and randomized into controls and  <dig> % or  <dig> % isoflurane posttreatment groups.
moreover, consistent with this lack of effect on brain edema, isoflurane posttreatment did not affect neurological outcomes in any of the tests used.
intracerebral hemorrhage is a subtype of stroke that has a poor prognosis without an adequate therapy.
however, the potential therapeutic effect of isoflurane after intracerebral hemorrhage  has not been fully explored.
our data suggested that there is no neuroprotection after isoflurane posttreatment in a rat model of ich.
