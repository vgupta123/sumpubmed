the antibacterial activity of p-prp, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration , was determined through the microdilution twofold serial method.
in this study, the antimicrobial effect of pure platelet-rich plasma  was evaluated against oral cavity microorganisms such as enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
p-prp inhibited the growth of enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus oralis, but not of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.
autologous platelet concentrates  have been extensively used in a variety of medical fields to promote soft and hard tissue regeneration.
p-prp is a potentially useful substance in the fight against postoperative infections.
the significance behind their use lies in the abundance of growth factors in platelets Î±-granules that promotes wound healing.
blood samples were obtained from  <dig> patients who underwent oral surgery procedures involving the use of p-prp.

this might represent a valuable property in adjunct to the enhancement of tissue regeneration.
