our study shows that the genus trichoderma/hypocrea has a proliferated arsenal of class ii hydrophobins which arose by birth-and-death evolution followed by purifying selection.
a combined phylogeny of these sequences with those of trichoderma showed that the trichoderma hfbs mostly formed their own clades, whereas those of other sordariomycetes occurred in shared clades.
a genome database search for class ii hfbs from other ascomycetes retrieved a much smaller number of hydrophobins  from each species, and most were from sordariomycetes.
we have investigated the mechanisms driving the evolution of the class ii hydrophobins in nine species of the mycoparasitic ascomycetous genus trichoderma/hypocrea, using three draft sequenced genomes  an additional  <dig>  ests from six other trichoderma spp.
