our study innovates a semi-supervised iterative pattern learning approach that is used to build an precise, large-scale disease-disease risk relationship  knowledge base  from a vast corpus of free-text published biomedical literature.
systems approaches to studying observable phenotypic relationships among diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease gene discovery and drug repositioning.
this unique driskkb, when combined with existing phenotypic, genetic, and genomic datasets, can have profound implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in drug repositioning.
we show that diseases and their risk diseases as well as diseases with similar risk profiles tend to share both genes and drugs.
discerning the genetic contributions to complex human diseases is a challenging mandate that demands new types of data and calls for new avenues for advancing the state-of-the-art in computational approaches to uncovering disease etiology.
<dig> , <dig> medline records comprised the text corpus under study.
finally, we analyzed the correlations between disease-disease risk pairs and their associated genes and drugs.
the identified patterns are highly precise  in specifying the risk-specific relationships among diseases.
the newly created driskkb consists of a total of  <dig>  unique d <dig> â†’d <dig> pairs, representing the risk-specific semantic relationships among  <dig>  diseases with each disease linked to its associated genes and drugs.
