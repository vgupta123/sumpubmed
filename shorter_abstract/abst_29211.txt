the stem-loop structures of intrinsic terminators of mycoplasma diverge from the pattern of terminators found in other bacteria due the low content of guanine and cytosine.
these analysis provided insights into the gene organisation and transcription initiation at the genome scale.
m. hyopneumoniae genome is organised in long transcriptional units and promoter sequences have been mapped upstream of all transcription units.
however, the presence of transcriptional terminator sequences in the m. hyopneumoniae genome is poorly understood.
analysis of all terminators found by three software algorithms, combined with experimental results, allowed us to propose a pattern of rna hairpin formation during the termination process and to predict the location of terminators in the m. hyopneumoniae genome sequence.
in silico analyses demonstrated the presence of putative terminators in 82% of the  <dig> monocistronic units  and in 74% of the  <dig> polycistronic units  considering different classes of terminators.
in m. hyopneumoniae, transcription can end after a transcriptional unit and before its terminator sequence and can also continue past the terminator sequence with rna polymerases gradually releasing the rna.
the functional activity of  <dig> intrinsic terminators was confirmed by rt-pcr and qpcr.
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, an important pathogen of swine, exhibits a low guanine and cytosine  content genome.
