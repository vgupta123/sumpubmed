the downregulation of several genes, including those found in this co-expression module, such as cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> , was associated with poor survival.
a transcriptional module enriched in cell cycle processes was correlated with the recurrence-free survival of the cc patients in the discovery  and validation  datasets.
network-based approaches may facilitate the discovery of biomarkers for the prognosis of a subset of patients with stage ii or iii cc, these approaches may also help direct personalised therapies.
colon cancer  is a heterogeneous disease influenced by complex gene networks.
weighted gene co-expression network analysis, a powerful technique used to extract co-expressed gene networks from mrna expressions, was conducted to identify  <dig> co-regulated modules in a discovery dataset with  <dig> patients.
another cell cycle phase-related gene module was correlated with the survival of the patients with a kras mutation cc subtype.
