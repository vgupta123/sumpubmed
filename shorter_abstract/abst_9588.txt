this genome sequence has remained stable for  <dig> generations of lab culture.
o. tauri is the smallest free-living photosynthetic eukaryote known to date, a coccoid green alga that was first isolated in  <dig> in a lagoon by the mediterranean sea.
here, we investigated the quality of genome assemblies of illumina gaiix 75 bp paired-end reads from ostreococcus tauri, thereby also improving the existing assembly and showing the genome to be stably maintained in culture.

its simple features, ease of culture and the sequencing of its 13 mb haploid nuclear genome have promoted this microalga as a new model organism for cell biology.
high coverage  paired-end illumina sequencing enables a high quality 95% complete genome assembly of a compact ~13 mb haploid eukaryote.
