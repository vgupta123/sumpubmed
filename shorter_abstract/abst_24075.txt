the  <dig> Ã… structure reveals that hdj <dig> forms a homodimer in the crystal by a crystallographic two-fold axis.
this structural observation indicates that the domain i of hsp <dig> may possess significant flexibility.
to investigate the mechanisms, we determined the crystal structure of the putative peptide-binding fragment of hdj <dig>  a human member of the type ii hsp <dig> family.
how hsp <dig> co-operates with hsp <dig> to facilitate protein folding is not well understood.
when compared with another hsp <dig> sis <dig> structure, the domain i of hdj <dig> is rotated by  <dig>  degree from the main body of the molecule, which makes the cleft between the two hdj <dig> monomers smaller that that of sis <dig>
the mechanism by which hsp <dig> and other molecular chaperones recognize and interact with non-native polypeptides is a fundamental question.
we propose an "anchoring and docking" model for hsp <dig> to utilize the flexibility of domain i to interact with non-native polypeptides and transfer them to hsp <dig>
the hdj <dig> dimer has a u-shaped architecture and a large cleft is formed between the two elongated monomers.
