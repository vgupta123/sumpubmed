this algorithm relies on certain assumptions and favourable properties of the model to forgo the simulation of the whole temporal trajectory of protein numbers in the system, instead returning only the number of protein and mrna molecules present in the system at a specified time point.
we employ this simulation algorithm with approximate bayesian computation to jointly infer the modelâ€™s rate and noise parameters from published gene expression data.
gene expression is known to be an intrinsically stochastic process which can involve single-digit numbers of mrna molecules in a cell at any given time.
in this work we focus on the specific case of trying to infer model parameters describing reaction rates and extrinsic noise on the basis of measurements of molecule numbers in individual cells at a given time point.

methods based on approximate bayesian computation can be used to obtain posterior parameter distributions given the observed data.
the modelling of such processes calls for the use of exact stochastic simulation methods, most notably the gillespie algorithm.
however, such inference procedures require large numbers of simulations of the model and exact stochastic simulation is computationally costly.
to make the problem computationally tractable we develop an exact, model-specific, stochastic simulation algorithm for the commonly used two-state model of gene expression.
the computational gain is proportional to the number of protein molecules created in the system and becomes significant for systems involving hundreds or thousands of protein molecules.
