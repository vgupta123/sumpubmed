the three related epsps homoeologues of wheat exhibited conservation of the exon/intron structure and of coding region sequence, but contained significant sequence variation within intron regions.
the three genomic copies of wheat epsps differed by insertion/deletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms , largely in intron sequences.
the epsps genes of allohexaploid wheat  have not been well characterized.
the wheat epsps genes are more closely related to lolium multiflorum and brachypodium distachyon than to oryza sativa .
phylogenetic analysis of 1190-bp cdna clones from wheat and wheat relatives revealed that: 1) taepsps-7a <dig> is most similar to epsps from the tetraploid ab genome donor, t. turgidum ; 2) taepsps-7d <dig> most resembles epsps from the diploid d genome donor, aegilops tauschii ; and 3) taepsps-4a <dig> resembles epsps from the diploid b genome relative, ae.
herein, the three homoeologous copies of the allohexaploid wheat epsps gene were cloned and characterized.
5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase  is the sixth and penultimate enzyme in the shikimate biosynthesis pathway, and is the target of the herbicide glyphosate.
genomic and coding dna sequences of epsps from the three related genomes of allohexaploid wheat were isolated using pcr and inverse pcr approaches from soft white spring “louise’.
thus, epsps sequences in allohexaploid wheat are preserved from the most two recent ancestors.
sequence alignments of cdna sequences from wheat and wheat relatives served as a basis for phylogenetic analysis.
the genome-specific primers developed will enable future characterization of natural and induced variation in epsps sequence and expression.
development of genome-specific primers allowed the mapping and expression analysis of taepsps-7a <dig>  taepsps-7d <dig>  and taepsps-4a <dig> on chromosomes 7a, 7d, and 4a, respectively.
