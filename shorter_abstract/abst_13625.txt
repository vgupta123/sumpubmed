in case of computational and topological redundancy, we constrain the classified group size of pair candidates within a multiobjective combinatorial optimization  pattern.
thus, we reveal the inherent design mechanisms for genetic networks by quantitative means, facilitating further theoretic analysis and experimental design with diverse research purposes.
we testify the proposed approach on two real-world microarray datasets of different statistical characteristics.
