our findings underscore the far more important role of tf cooperativity in tumorigenesis than previously appreciated.
more interestingly, the cooperativity of irf <dig> was markedly associated with tumor progression and even contributed to the patient survival independent of tumor stage.
disrupted cooperation of tfs provides potential clinical utility as prognostic markers for predicting the patient survival.
while the connectivity of downstream effectors, like metabolic genes and tf targets, were more or similarly disrupted than/with non-tfs, the cooperativity of tfs  were consistently less disturbed in all studied cancer types.
although the aberrant activation of individual tfs and the functional effects have been widely studied, the perturbation of tf cooperativity in cancer has rarely been explored.
transcription factors , essential for many cellular processes, generally work coordinately to induce transcriptional change in response to internal and external signals.

disrupted cooperation between tfs, leading to dysregulation of target genes, contributes to the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer.
we used tf co-expression as proxy as cooperativity and performed a large-scale study on disrupted tf cooperation across seven cancer types.
although different types of cancer shared very few tf pairs with highly disrupted cooperation, the cooperativity of interferon regulatory factors  was highly disrupted in six cancer types.
specifically, the cooperativity of irf <dig> was highly perturbed in lung cancer, which was further validated by two independent lung squamous cell carcinoma  and lung adenocarcinoma  datasets.
