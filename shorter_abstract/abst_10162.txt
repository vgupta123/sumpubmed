hydrocephalus in friesian horses is a developmental disorder that often results in stillbirth of affected foals and dystocia in dams.
the aim of our study was to find genomic associations, to investigate the mode of inheritance, to allow a dna test for hydrocephalus in friesian horses to be developed.
next generation dna sequence analysis of  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls of gene exons within the region revealed a mutation in β- <dig> -n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase  <dig>  as the likely cause of hydrocephalus in friesian horses.
hydrocephalus in friesian horses has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.
a nonsense mutation xm_ <dig> c.1423c>t corresponding to xp_ <dig> p.gln475* in b3galnt <dig>  is concordant with hydrocephalus in friesian horses.
one-hundred and forty-seven horses were carrier and  <dig> horses were homozygous for the normal allele; the estimated allele frequency in the friesian horse population is  <dig> .
a genome-wide association study of hydrocephalus in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls using  <dig>  snps indicated the involvement of a region on eca <dig> .

a random sample of the friesian horse population  was tested for the mutation in a commercial laboratory.
in case of a monogenic inheritance we aimed to identify the causal mutation.
application of a dna test in the breeding programme will reduce the losses caused by hydrocephalus in the friesian horse population.
the nonsense mutation xm_ <dig> c.1423c>t corresponding to xp_ <dig> p.gln475* was identical to a b3galnt <dig> mutation identified in a human case of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with hydrocephalus.
all  <dig> available cases and none of the controls were homozygous for the mutation, and all  <dig> obligate carriers  were heterozygous.
