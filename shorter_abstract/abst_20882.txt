the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of tropisetron, a 5-ht <dig> receptor antagonist, on infarct size and neurological score in a model of ischemic stroke induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion  in the rat.
neurological deficit scores, mortality rate and infarct volume were determined  <dig> h after permanent focal cerebral ischemia.
animals receiving tropisetron showed a significant increase  in neurological deficits and mortality rate.
two different doses of tropisetron  or vehicle were administered intraperitoneally  <dig> min before pmcao.
tropisetron failed to reduce cerebral infarction.
patients taking tropisetron, and possibly other 5-ht <dig> antagonists, could potentially have a worse outcome following a brain infarct.
these findings could have important clinical implications.
