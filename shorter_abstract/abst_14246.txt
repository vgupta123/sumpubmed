these surrogate models can be used in various parametric analysis task such as identifiability analysis, parameter estimation, or sensitivity analysis.

this is a particular problem for analysis tasks requiring repeated simulations for different parameter values.
the results show that the parametric model reduction yields efficient models of stochastic biochemical reaction networks, and that these models can be useful for systems biology applications involving parametric analysis problems such as parameter exploration, optimization, estimation or sensitivity analysis.
stochastic biochemical reaction networks are commonly modelled by the chemical master equation, and can be simulated as first order linear differential equations through a finite state projection.
such tasks are computationally expensive to the point of infeasibility with the chemical master equation.
in this article, we apply parametric model order reduction techniques in order to construct accurate low-dimensional parametric models of the chemical master equation.
as biological examples, we consider two models for gene regulation networks, a bistable switch and a network displaying stochastic oscillations.
