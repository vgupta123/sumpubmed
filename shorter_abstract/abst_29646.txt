this is the first description of a complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a representative of the phylum echiura, that of the fat innkeeper worm, urechis caupo.
their comparison serves as a model system for understanding the processes of genome evolution.
it contains the  <dig> genes that are typical for animal mtdnas in an arrangement somewhat similar to that of annelid worms.
urechis caupo mtdna shares many features with those of the few studied annelids, including the common usage of atg start codons, unusual among animal mtdnas, as well as gene arrangements, trna structures, and codon usage biases.
the largest non-coding region is only  <dig> nts long, is 71% a+t, and has potential for secondary structures.
this mtdna is  <dig>  nts in length and 62% a+t.
all genes are encoded by the same dna strand which is rich in a and c relative to the opposite strand.
