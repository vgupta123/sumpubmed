about 20% of the cnvs co-localized with segmental duplications, while 30% encompass genes, of which the majority is involved in environmental response.
notwithstanding, little is known about the extent to which cnv contributes to genetic variation in cattle.
copy number variations , which represent a significant source of genetic diversity in mammals, have been shown to be associated with phenotypes of clinical relevance and to be causative of disease.
this study reports the highest resolution map of copy number variation in the cattle genome, with  <dig> cnv regions  being identified among the genomes of  <dig> bovine samples from  <dig> dairy and beef breeds.
we designed and used a set of nimblegen cgh arrays that tile across the assayable portion of the cattle genome with approximately  <dig>  million probes, at a median probe spacing of  <dig> bp.
