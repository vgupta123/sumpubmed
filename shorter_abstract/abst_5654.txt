on the other hand, psychophysiological techniques such as event-related potentials  can help in evaluating cognitive impairment in different pathologies.
our data indicate that both ms groups showed poorer task performance , a latency delay for the n <dig> and p <dig> component, and a different amplitude for the frontal n <dig>  moreover, the deficit in the bms group, indexed by behavioural and pyschophysiological variables, was more pronounced compared to the rrms group.
the paradigm employed was a spatial attention task with central cues .
the present results suggest a cognitive impairment in the information processing in all of these patients.
comparing both pathological groups, cognitive impairment was more accentuated in the bms group compared to the rmss group.
unfortunately, neurological examination does not always agree with the neuropsychological evaluation in determining the cognitive profile of the patient.
behavioural responses and eeg signals were recorded during the experiment in three experimental groups: 1) a relapsing-remitting group , 2) a benign multiple sclerosis group  and 3) a control group.
cognitive impairment is a common feature in multiple sclerosis  patients and occurs in 60% of all cases.
