this study proposes a versatile and trainable java library that implements gene/protein tagger and normalization steps based on machine learning approaches.
moara can be used as a stand-alone application or can be incorporated in the workflow of a more general text mining system.
the system has been trained for several model organisms and corpora but can be expanded to support new organisms and documents.
gene/protein recognition and normalization are important preliminary steps for many biological text mining tasks, such as information retrieval, protein-protein interactions, and extraction of semantic information, among others.
