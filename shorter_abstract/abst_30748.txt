the aims of this study were to compare the pharmacokinetics of albendazole sulfoxide  in goats and sheep at a dose of 5 mg/kg bodyweight , after intravenous  and subcutaneous  administrations, and to investigate the effects of increased doses  on the plasma disposition of abz-so in goats following sc administration.
on the other side, dose-dependent plasma dispositions of abz-so were observed following sc administration at increased doses  in goats.
abz-so was applied to group i  and group ii  animals subcutaneously, and to group iii  animals intravenously, all at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg bw.
in phase- <dig>  the sheep in the group i received abz-so intravenously in a dose of 5 mg/kg bw; the goats in group ii and group iii received abz-so subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg bw, respectively.
in goats, the area under the curve, terminal half-life and plasma persistence of abz-so were significantly smaller and shorter, respectively, compared with those observed in sheep following both iv and sc administrations at a dose of 5 mg/kg bw.
the plasma concentrations of abz-so and its metabolites were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography.
consequently, abz-so might be used at higher doses to provide higher plasma concentration and thus to achieve greater efficacy against the target parasites.
