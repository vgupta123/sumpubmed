pathwayvoyager retrieves user-defined subsets of the kegg database and stores the data as local, blast-formatted databases.
the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  represents a database consisting of known genes and their respective biochemical functionalities.
equally important and challenging as genome annotation, is the subsequent classification of predicted genes into their respective pathways.
whole or partial genomes can be automatically analyzed using ncbi's blastp algorithm and orfs with similarities below the user-defined threshold will be marked on pathway maps.
