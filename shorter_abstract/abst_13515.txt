these results not only demonstrate the high level of complexity in the genetic mechanisms controlling gli <dig> expression, but also reveal the evolutionary significance of cis-acting regulatory networks of early developmental regulators in vertebrates.
in vertebrates, the mechanism of shh signal transduction and its action on target genes by means of activating or repressing forms of gli <dig> have been studied most extensively during limb development and the specification of the central nervous system.
in the mouse limb bud, different cnes enhance gli3-specific expression in evolutionary ancient stylopod and zeugopod versus modern skeletal structures of the autopod.
here, we demonstrate in chicken and mouse transgenic embryos that human gli3-intronic conserved non-coding sequence elements  autonomously control individual aspects of gli <dig> expression.
limb bud specificity is also found in chicken but had not been detected in zebrafish embryos.
their combined action shows many aspects of a gli3-specific pattern of transcriptional activity.
three of these elements govern central nervous system specific gene expression during mouse embryogenesis, each targeting a subset of endogenous gli <dig> transcription sites.
however, the genetic mechanisms and the cis-acting elements controlling the expression of gli <dig> remained largely unknown.
even though fish, birds, and mammals share an ancient repertoire of gene regulatory elements within gli <dig>  the functions of individual enhancers from this catalog have diverged significantly.
