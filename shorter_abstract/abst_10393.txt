extracellular signal-regulated kinase  <dig>  is an s/t kinase with more than  <dig> known substrates, and with critical roles in regulation of cell growth and differentiation and currently no membrane proteins have been linked to erk <dig> scaffolding.
time-resolved nmr spectroscopy revealed that erk <dig> phosphorylated the disordered tail of hnhe <dig> at six sites in vitro, in a distinct temporal order, with the phosphorylation rates at the individual sites being modulated by the docking sites in a distant dependent manner.
using nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy and immunofluorescence analysis we demonstrate that erk <dig> scaffolding by hnhe <dig> occurs by one of three d-domains and by two non-canonical f-sites located in the disordered intracellular tail of hnhe <dig>  mutation of which reduced cellular hnhe1-erk1/ <dig> co-localization, as well as reduced cellular erk1/ <dig> activation.
this work characterizes a new type of scaffolding complex, which we term a “shuffle complex”, between the disordered hnhe1-tail and erk <dig>  and provides a molecular mechanism for the important erk <dig> scaffolding function of the membrane protein hnhe <dig>  which regulates the phosphorylation of both hnhe <dig> and erk <dig>
