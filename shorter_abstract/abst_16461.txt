cgs detected  <dig> of  <dig> small sequence differences, one large deletion, and  <dig> of  <dig> is element insertions present in w <dig>  but did not detect a large chromosomal inversion.
in addition, we confirmed that cgs also detected  <dig> snps, one deletion and  <dig> is element insertions that are not present in the genome sequence, which we attribute to changes that occurred after the creation of the w <dig> lambda clone library.
it is also critical to follow up on regions of interest in which snps were not called because they often indicate deletions or is element insertions.
in order to evaluate the accuracy of genome resequencing using the microarray-based comparative genome sequencing service provided by nimblegen systems inc., we resequenced the e. coli strain w <dig> kohara using mg <dig> as a reference, both of which have been completely sequenced using traditional sequencing methods.
the false positive rate for snps was one per  <dig> kb of genome sequence.
