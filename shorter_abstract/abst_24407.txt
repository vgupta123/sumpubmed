this methodology was able to detect candidatus liberibacter asiaticus from different kinds of samples including infected citrus plants and psyllids.
a recent dna amplification technique known as loop mediated isothermal amplification  was adapted for the detection of candidatus liberibacter asiaticus.
our results indicate that the methodology here reported constitutes a step forward in the development of new tools for the management, control and eradication of this destructive citrus disease.
three candidatus liberibacter species are associated with different forms of the disease: candidatus liberibacter asiaticus, candidatus liberibacter americanus and candidatus liberibacter africanus.
this methodology was combined with a lateral flow dipstick  device for visual detection of the resulting amplicons, eliminating the need for gel electrophoresis.
the current management strategy of hlb is based on early and accurate detection of candidatus liberibacter asiaticus in both citrus plants and vector insects.
nowadays, real time pcr is the method of choice for this task, mainly because of its sensitivity and reliability.
this sensitivity level was proven to be similar to the values obtained running a real time pcr in parallel.
amongst them, candidatus liberibacter asiaticus is the most widespread and economically important.
