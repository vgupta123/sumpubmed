although these tools and pipelines can achieve a high precision in the accurate prediction of signal peptides and transmembrane helices, they have a much lower accuracy when other sequence characteristics are concerned.
the results are stored in the database locatep-db  <cit> .
for instance, it proved notoriously difficult to identify the fate of proteins carrying a putative type i signal peptidase  cleavage site, as many of those proteins are retained in the cell membrane as n-terminally anchored membrane proteins.
as accurate and detailed scl prediction on a genome scale is highly desired by experimental researchers, we decided to construct a new scl prediction pipeline: locatep.
locatep is by far the most accurate and detailed protein scl predictor for gram-positive bacteria currently available.
in the past decades, various protein subcellular-location  predictors have been developed.
moreover, most of the scl classifiers are based on the classification of the swiss-prot database and consequently inherited the inconsistency of that scl classification.
it distinguishes  <dig> different scls within gram-positive bacteria: intracellular, multi-transmembrane, n-terminally membrane anchored, c-terminally membrane anchored, lipid-anchored, lpxtg-type cell-wall anchored, and secreted/released proteins.
locatep was then used to predict the scls of all proteins encoded by completed gram-positive bacterial genomes.
the locatep pipeline was designed such that it mimics protein targeting and secretion processes.
locatep combines many of the existing high-precision scl identifiers with our own newly developed identifiers for specific scls.
the tests showed that locatep performs as well as, or even slightly better than other scl predictors for some locations and outperforms current tools especially where the n-terminally anchored and the spiase-cleaved secreted proteins are concerned.
