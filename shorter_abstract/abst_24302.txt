six cultivation conditions were selected to cultivate c. sorokiniana.
the paucity of genomic information, however, limits the development of genome-based genetic modification to improve lipid production in many microalgae.
the genes with expression change under different conditions are highly likely the potential targets for genetic modification to improve lipid production and co <dig> fixation efficiency in oleaginous microalgae.
finally,  <dig> genes were selected to conduct rt-qpcr and  <dig> genes showed the similar results as those identified by transcriptomic analysis in term of differential expression.
when cultivated in light with nitrogen-limited supply, c. sorokiniana can use carbon dioxide to accumulate lipid.
here, we describe the de novo sequencing, transcriptome assembly, annotation and differential expression analysis for chlorella sorokiniana cultivated in different conditions to reveal the change of genes expression associated with lipid accumulation and photosynthetic carbon fixation.
lipid content of c. sorokiniana under nitrogen-limited condition was  <dig>  times than that under nitrogen-replete condition.
de novo transcriptomic analyses have generated enormous information over c. sorokiniana, revealing a broad overview of genomic information related to lipid accumulation and photosynthetic carbon fixation.

after preprocessed, these reads were de novo assembled into  <dig>  contigs among which  <dig>  contigs were found homologous sequences in public databases through blastx.
then, transcriptome of c. sorokiniana was sequenced using illumina paired-end sequencing technology, and  <dig> , <dig> raw reads with length of 100 bp were produced.
