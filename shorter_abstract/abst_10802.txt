the exact binomial test is particularly adapted for small counts.
thanks to p-value calculation for motif counts, exceptional motifs are identified and represent candidate functional motifs.
we develop and analyze two statistical tests, an exact binomial one and an asymptotic likelihood ratio test, to decide whether the exceptionality of a given motif is equivalent or significantly different in two sequences of interest.
for large counts, we advise to use the likelihood ratio test which is asymptotic but strongly correlated with the exact binomial test and very simple to use.
finding over- or under-represented motifs in biological sequences is now a common task in genomics.
for that purpose, motif occurrences are modeled by poisson processes, with a special care for overlapping motifs.
as an illustration, we compare the octamer exceptionalities in the escherichia coli k- <dig> backbone versus variable strain-specific loops.
