our method predicted  <dig> alternative anaerobic minimal nutrient sets for escherichia coli kâ€“ <dig> mg <dig> from the ecocyc database.
our method for generating minimal nutrient sets from the metabolic network and transporters of an organism combines linear constraint solving with binary decision diagrams to efficiently produce solution sets to provided growth problems.

novel aspects of our approach include  exhaustive consideration of all combinations of nutrients rather than assuming that all element sources can substitute for one another  leveraging the notion of a machinery-duplicating constraint, namely, that all intermediate metabolites used in active reactions must be produced in increasing concentrations to prevent successive dilution from cell division,  the use of satisfiability modulo theory solvers rather than linear programming solvers, because our approach cannot be formulated as linear programming,  the use of binary decision diagrams to produce an efficient implementation.
we present a method for computationally determining alternative growth media for an organism based on its metabolic network and transporter complement.
one type of phenotypic prediction is to determine sets of compounds that will support the growth of a bacterium from the metabolic network inferred from the genome sequence of that organism.
as more complete genome sequences become available, bioinformatics challenges arise in how to exploit genome sequences to make phenotypic predictions.
