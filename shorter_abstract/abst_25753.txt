our phylogenomic and population genomic analyses revealed that the wheat blast outbreak in bangladesh was most likely caused by a wheat-infecting south american lineage of the blast fungus magnaporthe oryzae.
in february  <dig>  a new fungal disease was spotted in wheat fields across eight districts in bangladesh.
within weeks of the onset of the epidemic, we performed transcriptome sequencing of symptomatic leaf samples collected directly from bangladeshi fields.
reinoculation of seedlings with strains isolated from infected wheat grains showed wheat blast symptoms on leaves of wheat but not rice.
the epidemic spread to an estimated  <dig>  hectares, about 16 % of the cultivated wheat area in bangladesh, with yield losses reaching up to 100 %.
