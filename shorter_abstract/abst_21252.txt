the peptide hormone ghrelin has many important physiological and pathophysiological roles, including the stimulation of growth hormone  release, appetite regulation, gut motility and proliferation of cancer cells.
moreover, we have discovered that the 3' region of ghrlos is also antisense, in a tail-to-tail fashion to a novel terminal exon of the neighbouring sec <dig> gene, which is important in protein transport.
we previously identified a gene on the opposite strand of the ghrelin gene, ghrelinos , which spans the promoter and untranslated regions of the ghrelin gene .
we have described ghrlos mrna isoforms that extend over  <dig>  kb of the promoter region and  <dig> nucleotides of exon  <dig> of the ghrelin gene, ghrl.
the overlapping genomic arrangement of ghrlos with the ghrelin gene indicates that it is likely to have interesting regulatory and functional roles in the ghrelin axis.
ghrlos rna transcripts display several distinctive features of non-coding  genes, including 5' capping, polyadenylation, extensive splicing and short open reading frames.
it is highly expressed in tissues which are emerging as major sites of non-coding rna expression , as well as in the ovary and uterus.
sequence analyses revealed that ghrlos is riddled with stop codons, and that there is little nucleotide and amino-acid sequence conservation of the ghrlos gene between vertebrates.
