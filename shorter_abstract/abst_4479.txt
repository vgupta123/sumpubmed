the dynamics observed may be common for virulent parasites, such as metarhizium, that produce aggregated transmission stages.
parasite heterogeneity may not have effected virulence or the infection dynamics either because the most virulent strain outcompeted the others, or because the interaction involved scramble competition that was impervious to parasite heterogeneity.
such parasites make useful models for investigating infection dynamics and the impact of parasite competition.
in mixed infections of three strains the infection-growth dynamics were unaffected by parasite heterogeneity.
parasite heterogeneity and within-host competition are thought to be important factors influencing the dynamics of host-parasite relationships.
we investigated the effects of parasite density and heterogeneity on parasite virulence and fitness using four strains of the entomopathogenic fungus, metarhizium anisopliae var.
the relationship between parasite density and infection was sigmoidal, with there being an invasion threshold for an infection to occur .
although spore production was positively density-dependent, parasite fitness decreased with increasing parasite density, indicating within-host scramble competition.
the strength of within-host competition makes dispersal the best strategy for the parasite.
