in this study, we show that human recombinant dicer protein  processes a hairpin rna with 5' overhangs in vitro and generates an intermediate duplex with a  <dig> nt-5' strand and a  <dig> nt-3' strand, which was eventually cleaved into a canonical mirna duplex via a two-step cleavage.
the two-step cleavage of a hairpin rna with 5' overhangs shows that dicer releases double-stranded rnas after the first cleavage and binds them again in the inverse direction for a second cleavage.
on the other hand, production of mature mirna from an endogenous hairpin rna with 5' overhangs has also been reported, although the mechanism for this process is unknown.
the previously identified endogenous pre-mirna with 5' overhangs, pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna, is also determined to be a substrate of rdicer through the same two-step cleavage.
the typical form of pre-mirna processed by the drosha protein is a hairpin rna with 2-nt 3' overhangs.
