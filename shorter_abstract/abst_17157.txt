this result was obtained regardless of catalytic subunit identity.
we suggest that differential effects of pkai and pkaii in inducing cre-luciferace activity depend on r and not c subunit identity.
in spite of this the functional significance of two forms of pka in one cell has not been fully determined.
pka is a major receptor for camp and specificity is achieved partly through tissue-dependent expression and subcellular localization of subunits with different biochemical properties.
