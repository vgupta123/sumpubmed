barley seed proteins are of prime importance to the brewing industry, human and animal nutrition and in plant breeding for cultivar identification.
gene ontology  analysis indicated that the majority of the seed proteins were cytosolic, with catalytic activity and associated with carbohydrate metabolism.
spectral counting analysis showed that there are  <dig> differentially abundant seed proteins between the two-rowed conrad and six-rowed lacey cultivars.
differential abundance of hordoindoline proteins impact the seed hardness trait of barley cultivars.
the raw mass spectra data searched against uniprotâ€™s barley database using in-house mascot search engine identified  <dig> unique proteins.
this study paves the way for the use of a top-down gel-free proteomics strategy in barley for investigating more complex traits such as malting quality.
