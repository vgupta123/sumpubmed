extended 3’ utrs, and small rnas derived from them, are also present in somatic tissues; a subset of these somatic 3’utr small rna clusters are absent in mice lacking miwi <dig>  indicating a role for miwi <dig> in the metabolism of somatic small rnas.
we conducted a detailed characterization of pirnas aligning at or near the 3’ utrs of protein-coding genes in a deep dataset of small rnas from adult mouse testis.
we identified  <dig> pirna clusters associated with 3’ utrs, including  <dig> that overlapped genes not previously associated with pirnas.
the finding that pirnas are processed from extended 3’ utrs suggests a role for pirnas in the remodeling of 3’ utrs.
the function of pirnas expressed in the adult testis is not well established.
piwi-interacting rnas  are a class of small rnas; distinct types of pirnas are expressed in the mammalian testis at different stages of development.
the presence of both clusters and extended 3’utrs in somatic cells, with evidence for involvement of miwi <dig>  indicates that this pathway is more broadly distributed than currently appreciated.
