phylogenetic analysis revealed that, despite the low genetic distances between samples, the high posterior probability  values obtained strongly support the separation of the portuguese and galician sequences in an independent branch, separately from samples from the mediterranean and the canary islands.
the presence of cemv genomic rna was investigated by reverse transcription-quantitative pcr in samples from  <dig> specimens stranded along the portuguese and galician coastlines collected between  <dig> and  <dig>
furthermore, evidence suggests an endemic rather than an epidemic situation in the striped dolphin populations from portugal and galicia, since no outbreaks have been detected and positive samples have been detected annually since  <dig>  indicating that this virus is actively circulating in these populations and reaching prevalence values as high as 24 % among the galician samples tested.
screening atlantic cetacean populations for cetacean morbillivirus  is essential to understand the epidemiology of the disease.

morbillivirus infection has been associated with high morbidity and mortality in cetaceans, especially in outbreaks reported in the mediterranean sea.
