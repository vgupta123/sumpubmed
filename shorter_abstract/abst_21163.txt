then, a statistical technique is used to refine the predictions in our method.
superior accuracy achieved on different benchmark datasets, including both in silico and in vivo networks, shows that plsnet reaches state-of-the-art performance.
it remains a challenge due to the fact that the data is noisy and high dimensional, and there exists a large number of potential interactions.
we introduce an ensemble gene regulatory network inference method plsnet, which decomposes the grn inference problem with p genes into p subproblems and solves each of the subproblems by using partial least squares  based feature selection algorithm.
