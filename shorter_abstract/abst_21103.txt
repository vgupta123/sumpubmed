we applied our method to the human, mouse, and rat genomes and found that bbh-ls produced the best results when using both sequence and gene context information equally.
positional homologs are the direct descendants of a single ancestral gene in the most recent common ancestor and by definition form one-to-one correspondence.
compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as msoar <dig>  bbh-ls is able to identify more positional homologs with fewer false positives.
identifying corresponding genes  in different species is an important step in genome-wide comparative analysis.
in particular, one-to-one correspondences between genes in different species greatly simplify certain problems such as transfer of function annotation and genome rearrangement studies.
in this work, we present a simple yet effective method  for the identification of positional homologs from the comparative analysis of two genomes.
specifically, bbh-ls applies the bidirectional best hit heuristic to a combination of sequence similarity and gene context similarity scores.
our bbh-ls method integrates sequence similarity and gene context similarity in order to get more accurate ortholog assignments.
