in the present study, we report a novel single step protocol for the osteoblastic differentiation of human amniotic fluid cells.
in order to test the ability of these cells to proliferate on surfaces commonly used in oral osteointegrated implantology, we carried out cultures onto different test disks, namely smooth copper, machined titanium and sandblasted and acid etching titanium .
stem cells isolated from amniotic fluid are known to be able to differentiate into different cells types, being thus considered as a potential tool for cellular therapy of different human diseases.
the described protocol is able to provide osteoblastic cells producing nodules of calcium mineralization within  <dig> days from withdrawal of amniotic fluid samples.
the described protocol provides an efficient and time-saving tool for the production of osteogenic cells from amniotic fluid that in the future could be used in oral osteointegrated implantology.
these cells display a complete expression of osteogenic markers  within  <dig> days from withdrawal.
