in marked contrast, the e342a mutant reveals conformational flexibility of functionally relevant side chains in the vicinity of the general acid glu <dig>  including arg <dig>  a residue required for levan polymerisation.
the present structures, in conjunction with prior biochemical data, lead us to hypothesise that the conformational flexibility of arg <dig> is linked to it forming a transient docking site for the fructosyl-acceptor substrate, through an interaction network involving nearby glu <dig> and asn <dig> at the rim of a central pocket forming the active site.
still, the structural determinants of the fructosyl transfer reaction thus far have been only partially defined.
the d86a and d247a substitutions have little effect on the active site geometry.
the raffinose-complex reveals a conserved mode of donor substrate binding, involving minimal contacts with the raffinose galactosyl unit, which protrudes out of the active site, and specificity-determining contacts essentially restricted to the sucrosyl moiety.
biosynthesis of levan Î²fru n), an abundant form of bacterial fructan, is catalysed by levansucrase , utilizing sucrose as the sole substrate.
previously, we described the tertiary structure of bacillus subtilis levansucrase in the ligand-free and sucrose-bound forms, establishing the mechanistic roles of three invariant carboxylate side chains, asp <dig>  asp <dig> and glu <dig>  which are central to the double displacement reaction mechanism of fructosyl transfer.
