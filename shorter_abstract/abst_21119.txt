these included proteins implicated in cell envelope structure, regulation, molecule synthesis, substance and energy metabolism, transport, translation, and those with unknown functions.
conventional genetic and biochemical approaches used to study ss <dig> virulence factors are unable to take into account the complex and dynamic environmental stimuli associated with the infection process.
collectively, our results suggest that these in vivo-induced or upregulated genes may contribute to ss <dig> disease development.
the in vivo-induced changes in the expression of  <dig> of these  <dig> genes were measured using real-time reverse transcription -pcr, revealing that the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> genes was upregulated in the in vivo condition.
a better understanding of ss2-host molecular interactions is crucial for understanding ss <dig> pathogenesis and immunology.
convalescent-phase sera from pigs infected with ss <dig> were pooled, adsorbed against in vitro antigens, and used to screen ss <dig> genomic expression libraries.
the strain distribution of these  <dig> genes was analyzed by pcr, and they were found in the most virulent ss <dig> strains.
in this study, in vivo-induced antigen technology , an immunoscreening technique, was used to identify the immunogenic bacterial proteins that are induced or upregulated in vivo during ss <dig> infection.
