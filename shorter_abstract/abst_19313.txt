hnaa16p is ribosome associated, supporting its potential role in cotranslational nα-terminal acetylation.
hnaa <dig> is expressed in a variety of human cell lines, but is generally less abundant as compared to hnaa <dig>  specific knockdown of hnaa <dig> induces cell death, suggesting an essential role for hnaa16p in human cells.
at least two distinct nata protein nα-terminal acetyltransferases coexist in human cells potentially creating a more complex and flexible system for nα-terminal acetylation as compared to lower eukaryotes.
the gene encoding hnaa16p originates from an early vertebrate duplication event from the common ancestor of hnaa <dig> and hnaa <dig>  immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry identified both endogenous hnaa15p and hnaa16p as distinct interaction partners of hnaa10p in hek <dig> cells, thus demonstrating the presence of both hnaa15p-hnaa10p and hnaa16p-hnaa10p complexes.
protein acetylation is among the most common protein modifications.
