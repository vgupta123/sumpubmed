since the next-generation sequencing technology strives to deliver affordable and non-biased sequencing results, accurate assessment of mtdna copy numbers can be achieved effectively from the output of whole genome sequencing.
two families of the human whole genome sequencing datasets from the hapmap and the  <dig> genomes projects were used for the accurate counting of mitochondrial dna copy numbers.
the results revealed the parental mitochondrial dna copy numbers are significantly lower than that of their children in these samples.
here we propose a new computational method for the accurate assessment of mtdna copies from whole genome sequencing data.
the copy number of mtdna in human cells may therefore be a potential biomarker for diagnostics of aging.

the experiment demonstrated the possible correlations between the quantity of mitochondrial dna and aging-related diseases.
mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with various aging diseases.
