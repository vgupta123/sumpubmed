these results indicate that pxbp <dig> plays an important role during the er stress response like other animal systems and open a new opportunity for examining the upr pathway in the porcine model system.
in adult organs, pxbp <dig> mrna and protein were expressed and the spliced forms were detected.
knock-down of pxbp <dig> enhanced er stress-mediated cell death in pef cells.
however, in the porcine system, genes in the upr pathway were not investigated.
er stress was induced by the treatment of tunicamycin and cell viability was investigated by the mtt assay.
it was first found that the upr mechanisms and the function of pxbp <dig> in the porcine system.
the unfolded protein response  is an evolutionary conserved adaptive reaction for increasing cell survival under endoplasmic reticulum  stress conditions.
the upr induced by er stress was extensively studied in diseases linked to protein misfolding and aggregations.
in this study, we isolated and characterized the porcine xbp <dig>  gene in er stress using porcine embryonic fibroblast  cells and porcine organs.
we found that the pxbp <dig> mrna was the subject of the ire1Î±-mediated unconventional splicing by er stress.
