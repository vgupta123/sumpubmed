temporal correlation of spike trains was proposed as a potential code for linking the neuronal responses evoked by various features of a same object.
in the present study, synchrony strength was measured between cells following an adaptation protocol  which induce plasticity of neurons' orientation preference.
multi-unit activity from area  <dig> of anesthetized adult cats was recorded.
in primary visual cortex, each neuron is a filter for stimulus features such as orientation, motion direction and velocity, with the appropriate combination of features eliciting maximal firing rate.
we report here that, after adaptation, the neuron pairs that shared closer tuning properties display a significant increase of synchronization.
it follows that the adaptation-induced plasticity leads to changes in preferred orientation difference, i.e.
