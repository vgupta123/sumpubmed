for at least  <dig> years, one of the most common means of shipping bacteria was by inoculating bacterial samples in agar stabs.
mutants with low rpos levels emerged within  <dig> days of incubation in the stabs.
given that many e. coli strains contain high rpos levels similar to mc4100tf, the integrity of such strains during transfers and storage is questionable.
the genetic stability of mc4100tf was also tested in filter disks embedded in glycerol.
the integrity of exchanged strains is vital for archival reasons and to ensure reproducible experimental results.
here, we investigate whether short-term storage and mailing of cultures in stabs results in genetic heterogeneity.
these results raise important questions on the integrity of bacterial archives and transferred strains, explain variation like in the ecor collection between laboratories and indicate a need for the development of better methods of strain transfer.
the sigma factor rpos accumulates in response to several stresses and in the stationary phase.
reconstruction studies indicated that lb-stabs exhibited mutations previously found in gasp studies in stationary phase lb broth.
