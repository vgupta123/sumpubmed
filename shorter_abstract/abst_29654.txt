the degradation of some algal osmolytes and sugars, the genome-derived predictions of the metabolic pathways in r. litoralis differed from the phenotype.
the genome of r. litoralis och <dig> contains one circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp and three plasmids of  <dig>  bp ,  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp .
of the  <dig> genes predicted for r. litoralis,  <dig>  are not present in the genome of r. denitrificans.
many of the unique genes of r. litoralis are located in genomic islands and on plasmids.
the comparison of the heavy metal tolerance of the two organisms showed an increased zinc tolerance of r. litoralis.
in contrast to r. denitrificans, the photosynthesis genes of r. litoralis are plasmid encoded.
the photosynthetic activity of r. litoralis is probably regulated by nutrient availability.
roseobacter litoralis och <dig>  the type species of the genus, and roseobacter denitrificans och <dig> were the first described organisms of the roseobacter clade, an ecologically important group of marine bacteria.
comparative genomics with other members of the roseobacter clade revealed several genomic regions that were only conserved in the two roseobacter species.
on prlo149_ <dig> several potential heavy metal resistance genes are encoded which are not present in the genome of r. denitrificans.
the genomic differences between the two roseobacter species are mainly due to lateral gene transfer and genomic rearrangements.
several new mechanisms of substrate degradation were indicated from the combination of experimental and genomic data.
plasmid prlo149_ <dig> and one plasmid of r. denitrifcans  seem to have a common ancestor and are important for cell envelope biosynthesis.
the catabolism of different carbon and nitrogen sources was predicted from the genome and combined with experimental data.
the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus was confirmed by respiration rate measurements, indicating a growth-phase dependent response to light.
one of those regions encodes a variety of genes that might play a role in host association of the organisms.
