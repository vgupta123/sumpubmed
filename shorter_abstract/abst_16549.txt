to illustrate the practical utility of the cpba of a network, we apply it to gene expression data and to a bi-partite network model for diseases and disease genes from the online mendelian inheritance in man .
an open question is whether one can find suitable decompositions of the similarity measures employed in constructing general networks.
however, correlation networks only capture the connections between numeric variables.
in contrast to general networks, it is straightforward to test the statistical significance of an edge in a correlation network.
the cluster and propensity based approximation  of a network not only generalizes correlation network methods but also multigraph methods.
it is also easy to decompose the underlying correlation matrix and generate informative network statistics such as the module eigenvector.
the models in this article generalize current models for both correlation networks and multigraph networks.
correlation networks are widely applied in genomics research.
the cpba of a network is theoretically appealing since a) it generalizes correlation and multigraph network methods, b) it improves likelihood based significance tests for edge counts, c) it directly models higher-order relationships between clusters, and d) it suggests novel clustering algorithms.
here we present an intuitive and parsimonious parametrization of a general similarity measure such as a network adjacency matrix.
