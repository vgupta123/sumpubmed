the number of insertions and deletions shared by a range of plant parasitic nematodes were higher for proteins involved in lipid metabolism and electron transport compared with other nematodes, suggesting an association between metabolic adaptation and parasitism in plant hosts.
we also identified three sizable deletions from proteins found to be specific to and shared by parasitic nematodes, which, given their uniqueness, might serve as target candidates for drug design.
amino acid insertions and deletions in proteins are considered relatively rare events, and their associations with the evolution and adaptation of organisms are not yet understood.
in this study, we undertook a systematic analysis of over  <dig>  polypeptides from  <dig> nematode species and identified insertions and deletions unique to nematode proteins in more than  <dig> families and provided indirect evidence that these alterations are linked to the evolution and adaptation of nematodes.
the present findings showed that this reduction is more pronounced in parasitic nematodes compared with the free-living nematodes of the genus caenorhabditis.
this study illustrates the significance of using comparative genomics approaches to identify molecular elements unique to parasitic nematodes, which have adapted to a particular host organism and mode of existence during evolution.
