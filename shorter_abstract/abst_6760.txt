biofilm development is a sequential dynamic process from an initial bacterial adhesion to a three-dimensional structure formation, and a subsequent bacterial dispersion.
in particular, biofilm-dispersed cells appeared as a unique stage in the bacteria lifecycle, different from both planktonic and sessile states.
most of them included dominant functional classes, emphasizing the transcriptional changes occurring in the course of k. pneumoniae lifestyle transitions.
for each of these conditions, the combined use of z-scores and principal component analysis provided a clear illustration of distinct expression profiles.
