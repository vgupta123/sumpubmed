cellular populations demonstrate temporal profiles of flux post-mi.
we performed stability analysis to investigate the effects of the interaction strengths, the initial status, and the number of links between cells on the cellular population in the dynamic network.
our study introduces a dynamic network to model cellular interactions between two different cell types which can be used to model the cellular population changes post-mi.
computer simulations of our conceptual model verified our analysis.
the results on stability analysis can be used as a tool to predict the responses of particular cell populations.
our analysis generated a set of conditions on interaction strength, structure of the network, and initial status of the network to predict the evolutionary profiles of the network.
progressive remodelling of the left ventricle  following myocardial infarction  is an outcome of spatial-temporal cellular interactions among different cell types that leads to heart failure for a significant number of patients.
however, little is known about the relationship between cell populations and the interaction strength among cells post-mi.
