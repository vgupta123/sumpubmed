high-throughput mass spectrometric  study is the method of choice for monitoring global changes in proteome.
here we evaluate use of relative solvent accessible surface area  and depth as indices to assess experimentally determined phosphorylation events deposited in phosphositeplus.
by considering protein dynamics, autophosphorylation events and/or the sequence specificity of kinases,  <dig> % of these phosphosites can be moved to the allowed region of conformation.
while ms is a stand-alone technique for the identification of vast majority of phosphorylation events, identifications within disallowed region of conformation will benefit from techniques that independently probe for phosphorylation and protein dynamics.
our studies also imply that trapping alternate protein conformations may be a viable alternative to the design of inhibitors against mutation prone drug resistance kinases.
we also demonstrate that rsasa values can be used to increase the confidence of identification of phosphorylation sites within an ambiguous ms dataset.
