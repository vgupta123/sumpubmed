spectral imaging with polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes enables the quantification of cell and model membrane physical properties, including local hydration, fluidity, and lateral lipid packing, usually characterized by the generalized polarization  parameter.
the spectral imaging toolbox is a powerful tool for the segmentation and processing of large spectral imaging datasets with a reliable method for membrane segmentation and no ability in programming required.
with the development of commercial microscopes equipped with spectral detectors, spectral imaging has become a convenient and powerful technique for measuring gp and other membrane properties.
in addition to common operations, such as the calculation of distributions of gp values, generation of pseudo-colored gp maps, and spectral analysis, a key highlight of this tool is reliable membrane segmentation for probes that are rapidly internalized.
furthermore, handling for hyperstacks, 3d reconstruction and batch processing facilitates analysis of data sets generated by time series, z-stack, and area scan microscope operations.
