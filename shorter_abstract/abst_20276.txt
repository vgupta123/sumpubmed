immunocytological analysis showed that hpa1xoo, expressed in t- <dig>  accumulated as clustered particles along the cell walls of t- <dig>  in response to the infection caused by v. dahliae, the microscopic cell death and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates were observed in leaves of t- <dig> and these responses were absent in leaves of z <dig> inoculated with v. dahliae.
the soil-borne fungal pathogen verticillium dahliae kleb causes verticillium wilt in a wide range of crops including cotton .
to date, most upland cotton varieties are susceptible to v. dahliae and the breeding for cotton varieties with the resistance to verticillium wilt has not been successful.
hpa1xoo is a harpin protein from xanthomonas oryzae pv.
hpa1xoo accumulates along the cell walls of the transgenic t- <dig>  where it triggers the generation of h2o <dig> as an endogenous elicitor.
the results of this study suggest that the transformation of cotton with hpa1xoo could be an effective approach for the development of cotton varieties with the improved resistance against soil-borne pathogens.
cells of the transgenic t- <dig>  when mixed with the conidia suspension of v. dahliae, had a higher tolerance to v. dahliae compared to cells of untransformed z <dig>  cells of t- <dig> were more viable  <dig> h after mixing with v. dahliae conidia suspension.
quantitative rt-pcr analysis indicated that five defense-related genes, ghaox <dig>  hin <dig>  npr <dig>  ghdhg-omt, and hsr203j, were up-regulated in t- <dig> inoculated with v. dahliae.
when hpa1xoo was transformed into the susceptible cotton line z <dig> through agrobacterium-mediated transformation, the transgenic cotton line  with an improved resistance to verticillium dahliae was obtained.
