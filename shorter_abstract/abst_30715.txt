a novel genetic locus on chromosome  <dig> modulates early pro-inflammatory cytokine production and virus replication after highly pathogenic influenza virus infection.
candidate genes, samd9l and ica <dig>  may be important for the control of influenza virus infection and pathogenesis.
genetic variation in the human population is a key determinant of influenza disease severity.
to identify variant host genes associated with increased virus replication and severe disease, we performed a quantitative trait locus analysis on pro-inflammatory cytokine production  <dig> hours after intranasal infection with highly pathogenic h5n <dig> influenza virus.

sequence and rna expression analysis identified several candidate host genes containing missense mutations or deletions; samd9l, ica <dig>  and slc25a <dig>  to study the role of slc25a <dig>  we obtained slc25a <dig> knockout line, but upon challenge with h5n <dig> influenza virus observed no effect on ccl <dig> production, or morbidity and mortality.
pro-inflammatory cytokines ccl <dig>  tnfα and ifn-α, were measured by elisa in lung homogenates of dba/2j , c57bl/6j  and  <dig> different bxd recombinant inbred mouse strains.
importantly, cytokine concentration correlated very well  with virus titer suggesting that early cytokine production is due to increased virus infection and replication.
linkage analysis of cytokine concentration revealed a significant locus on chromosome  <dig> associated with differences in tnfα, ifn-α and ccl <dig> cytokine concentration .
