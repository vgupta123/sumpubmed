epstein-barr virus  presumably plays an important role in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , but the molecular mechanism of ebv-dependent neoplastic transformation is not well understood.
the results of this analysis may shed new lights to further our understanding of the ebv-led neoplastic transformation.
these genes could be key players for pathways de-regulated by ebv during latent infection and lytic proliferation.
the combination of bioinformatics with evidences from biological experiments paved a new way to gain more insights into the molecular mechanism of cancer.
we profiled gene expression using a meta-analysis approach.
our analysis suggests that npc transformation depends on timely regulation of dek, cdk inhibitor, p <dig>  rb and several transcriptional cascades, interconnected by e2f, ap- <dig>  nf-Îºb, stat <dig> among others during latent and lytic cycles.
in conclusion, our meta-analysis strategy re-analyzed ebv-related tumor data sets and identified sets of meta-genes possibly involved in maintaining latent or switching to lytic cycles of ebv in npc.
meta-b genes were obtained from differential genes commonly expressed in npc and pel .
meta-a genes were identified by finding those commonly activated/deactivated upon ebv infection/reactivation.
