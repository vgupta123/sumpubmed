bioinformatics approaches have proved to be very useful toward this goal by guiding the experimental investigations.
each genome is analyzed separately, allowing us to study the species-specific identity and genome organization of mirna loci.
we focus on genomic regions around already known mirnas, in order to exploit the property that mirnas are occasionally found in clusters.
starting with the known human, mouse and rat mirnas we analyze  <dig> kb of flanking genomic regions for the presence of putative precursor mirnas .
we only use cross-species comparisons to make conservative estimates of the number of novel mirnas.
our results show that the assumption that many mirnas occur in clusters is fruitful for the discovery of novel mirnas.
the validation rate among predicted cases that are conserved in at least one other species is higher, about 60%, and many of them have not been detected by prediction methods that used cross-species comparisons.
in this work we describe our computational method for mirna prediction and the results of its application to the discovery of novel mammalian mirnas.
around 30% of these already have experimental support in a large set of cloned mammalian small rnas.
micrornas  are endogenous  <dig> to 23-nucleotide rna molecules that regulate protein-coding gene expression in plants and animals via the rna interference pathway.
hundreds of them have been identified in the last five years and very recent works indicate that their total number is still larger.
