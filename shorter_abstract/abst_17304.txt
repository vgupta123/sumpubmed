recent studies have revealed sirt <dig> protects neurons from axonal degeneration or neurodegeneration.
zyxin could be a novel interacting partner of sirt <dig>  zyxin is an adaptor protein at focal adhesion plaque, regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction to convey signal from the ecm  to the nucleus.
further, sirt <dig> null mice exhibit growth retardation and developmental defects, suggesting its critical roles in neurons and development.
to identify novel binding partners for sirt <dig> in the central nervous system, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening on human fetal brain cdna library and found that zyxin is a possible binding partner.
sirt <dig> and zyxin transcript were both preferentially expressed in developmental mouse brain.
our results raise the possibility that sirt <dig> regulates signal transmission from ecm to the nucleus by modulating the functions of zyxin via deacetylation.
zyxin accumulates in the nucleus where it is co-localized with sirt <dig> after treatment with leptomycin b in cos- <dig> cells.
it regulates longevity in several model organisms and is involved with cell survival, differentiation, metabolism among other processes in mammalian cells.
sirt <dig> is a mammalian homologue of nad+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin family.
