secondly, we have developed svm modules using split amino acid compositions  and achieved the maximum mcc of  <dig> .
finally, a hybrid module was developed by combining svm module and hmm profile and achieved a mcc of  <dig>  with an accuracy of  <dig> %.
svm module has been developed for the first time using saac for predicting nuclear proteins, where amino acid composition of n-terminus and the remaining protein were computed separately.
firstly, support vector machines  based modules have been developed using amino acid and dipeptide compositions and achieved a mathews correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.
thirdly, a hidden markov model  based module/profile was developed for searching exclusively nuclear and non-nuclear domains in a protein.
in addition, our study is a first documentation where exclusively nuclear and non-nuclear domains have been identified and used for predicting nuclear proteins.
this study describes a highly accurate method for predicting nuclear proteins.
the nuclear proteins are crucial for chromosomal maintenance/segregation, gene expression, rna processing/export, and many other processes.
several methods have been developed for predicting the nuclear proteins in the past.
the aim of the present study is to develop a new method for predicting nuclear proteins with higher accuracy.
our method estimated  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the proteins as nuclear proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, mouse and human proteomes respectively.
based on the above modules, we have developed a web server nppred for predicting nuclear proteins .
