we conclude that traditional agroecosystems constitue active incubators of varietal diversity even for clonally propagated crop species, and even when varieties correspond to clones that are often old.
traditional agroecosystems are known to host both large crop species diversity and high within crop genetic diversity.
as only female fig is cultivated, wild fig and cultivated fig probably constitute a single evolutionary unit within these traditional agroecosystems.
further the pattern of spatial genetic structure was similar to the pattern expected in natural population for a mutation/drift/migration model at equilibrium, with homogeneous levels of local genetic diversity throughout moroccan traditional agroecosystems.
core collections, however useful, are museums and hence cannot serve the same functions as traditional agroecosystems.
we investigated this question for a clonally propagated plant, fig , within its native range, in morocco, but as far away as possible from supposed centers of domestication.
nevertheless these clones were often sufficiently old to have accumulated somatic mutations for selected traits  and at neutral loci .
