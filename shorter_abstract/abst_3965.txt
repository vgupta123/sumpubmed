our expression analysis suggests a multifaceted role of plexinb <dig> during mouse development and tissue homeostasis in the adult.
mutant mice lacking expression of semaphorin receptor plexinb <dig> are viable and fertile.
although the axon collapsing activity of sema4d is impaired in plexinb <dig> deficient neurons, we could not detect major defects in development, or in adult histology and basic functional parameters of tissues expressing plexinb <dig>  moreover, in the absence of plexinb <dig> the angiogenic response induced by orthotopically implanted tumours was not affected, suggesting that the expression of this semaphorin receptor in endothelial cells is redundant.
in particular, plexinb <dig>  the receptor for sema4d, has been suggested to play a role in neural development and in tumour angiogenesis, based on in vitro studies.
high expression of plexinb <dig> was found in lung, kidney, liver and cerebellum.
however, the tissue distribution of plexinb <dig> has not been extensively studied and the functional relevance of this receptor in vivo still awaits experimental testing.
plexins are a large family of transmembrane receptors for the semaphorins, known for their role in the assembly of neural circuitry.
we infer that plexinb <dig> plays a redundant role in mouse development and it is not strictly required for tumour induced angiogenesis.
nonetheless, the genetic deletion of plexinb <dig> does not result in major developmental defects or clear functional abnormalities.
