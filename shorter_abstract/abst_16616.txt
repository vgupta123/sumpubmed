compared with other insect herbivores feeding on the same host plant, gall-inducing insects feed on plant tissue that is more nutritious and less defended, and they do so in a favorable microhabitat that may also provide some protection from natural enemies.
here we compare the diversification rates of gall-inducing and non-galling insect lineages.
we evaluate the significance of diversity bipartitions under equal rates markov models, and use maximum likelihood model-fitting to test for shifts in diversification rates.
the effect of ecological specialization on diversification rates is complex in the case of gall-inducing insects, but host range may be an important factor.
when a gall-inducing lineage has a host range approximate to that of its non-galling sister, the gallers are more diverse.
when the non-galler clade has a much wider host range than the galler, the non-galler is also much more diverse.
ecological specialization might lead to increases in diversification rate or, alternatively, specialization might limit the evolutionary potential of specialist lineages and increase their extinction risk.
we find that, although gall-inducing insect groups are more host-specific than their non-galling relatives, there is no general significant increase in diversification rate in gallers.
we use sister-taxon comparisons to test whether gall-inducing lineages are more host-specific than non-galling lineages, and more or less diverse than non-gallers.
