cohen syndrome patients present with mental retardation in 99% of cases, but learning disabilities featured in less than half of tns affected dogs.
it has been implied that loss of the alternate transcript of vps13b in the human brain utilising an alternate exon,  <dig>  may cause mental retardation.
trapped neutrophil syndrome  is a common autosomal recessive neutropenia in border collie dogs.

we chose vps13b as a candidate because of similarities in clinical signs between tns and cohen syndrome, in human, such as neutropenia and a typical facial dysmorphism.
tns in border collies is the first animal model for cohen syndrome and can be used to study the disease aetiology.
we sequenced each of the  <dig> exons of vps13b in affected and control dogs and found that the causative mutation in border collies is a  <dig> bp deletion in exon  <dig> of the largest transcript that results in premature truncation of the protein.
we used a candidate gene approach and linkage analysis to show that the causative gene for tns is vps13b.
we show that dogs do express alternate transcripts in the brain utilising an alternate exon homologous to human exon  <dig>
linkage analysis using microsatellites close to vps13b showed positive linkage of the region to tns.
