the female-sterile phenotype segregated in the offspring of crosses between female-sterile evolved strains and female-fertile wild-type strains.
in competition experiments, female-sterile mutants produced similar numbers of viable conidia to wild-type strains, but released them more efficiently.
we induced the forced evolution of four chinese female-fertile strains in vitro by the weekly transfer of asexual spores  between petri dishes.
these results suggest that female fertility may have been lost rapidly during the dispersion of the fungus from asia to the rest of the world.
sexual reproduction is possible in vitro and requires  two strains of opposite mating types including  at least one female-fertile strain .
female-fertile strains are found only in limited areas of asia, in which evidence for contemporary recombination has recently been obtained.
we show for the first time that, in the absence of sexual reproduction, female-sterile mutants of m. oryzae rice strains can arise and increase in abundance in asexual generations.
we aimed to determine whether female fertility was rapidly lost in the absence of sexual reproduction and whether this loss was controlled genetically or epigenetically.
female-sterile evolved strains were subjected to several stresses, but none induced the restoration of female fertility.
sexual reproduction is common in eukaryotic microorganisms, with few species reproducing exclusively asexually.
however, in some organisms, such as fungi, asexual reproduction alternates with episodic sexual reproduction events.
this loss of fertility was therefore probably due to genetic rather than epigenetic mechanisms.
as no single-spore isolation was carried out, the observed decrease in the production of perithecia reflected the emergence and the invasion of female-sterile mutants.
this advantage may account for the invasion of our populations by female-sterile mutants.
