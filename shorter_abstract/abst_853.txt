as part of this procedure, immunoprecipitated dna must undergo “library preparation” to enable subsequent high-throughput sequencing.
to facilitate the analysis of biopsy samples and rare cell populations, there has been a recent proliferation of methods allowing sequencing library preparation from low-input dna amounts.
notably, recently developed single-cell chip procedures employing microfluidics must also employ library preparation reagents to allow downstream sequencing.
the results may also aid judgements on how comparable are existing datasets that have been prepared with different sample library preparation reagents.
