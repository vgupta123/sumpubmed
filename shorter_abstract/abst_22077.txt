the major contribution provided by this approach is regarding the chain influences upon a set of genes sequentially.
modeling cancer-related regulatory modules from gene expression profiling of cancer tissues is expected to contribute to our understanding of cancer biology as well as developments of new diagnose and therapies.
in this study, we introduce a genetic algorithm-recurrent neural network  hybrid method for finding feed-forward regulated genes when given some transcription factors to construct cancer-related regulatory modules in human cancer microarray data.
this hybrid approach focuses on the construction of various kinds of regulatory modules, that is, recurrent neural network has the capability of controlling feed-forward and feedback loops in regulatory modules and genetic algorithms provide the ability of global searching of common regulated genes.
we also validate our approach by demonstrating that the connections in our cancer-related regulatory modules have been most identified and verified by previously-published biological documents.
several mathematical models have been used to explore the phenomena of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
however, the contemplating on controlling of feed-forward and feedback loops in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms is not resolved adequately in saccharomyces cerevisiae, nor is in human cancer cells.
