by using confocal laser scanning microscopy, pbmls was detected in the cytoplasm and in the cell wall of the mother, but mainly of budding cells of the p. brasiliensis yeast phase.
pbmls was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and polyclonal antibody was obtained against this protein.
pbmlsr and its respective polyclonal antibody produced against this protein inhibited the interaction of p. brasiliensis with in vitro cultured epithelial cells a <dig>
inside the host, p. brasiliensis may use the glyoxylate cycle for intracellular survival.
here, we provide evidence that the malate synthase of p. brasiliensis  is located on the fungal cell surface, and is secreted.
adhesion and invasion to host cells are essential steps involved in the internalization and dissemination of pathogens.
these observations indicated that cell wall-associated pbmls could be mediating the binding of fungal cells to the host, thus contributing to the adhesion of fungus to host tissues and to the dissemination of infection, behaving as an anchorless adhesin.
