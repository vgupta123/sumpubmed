analysis of genes upregulated in fertile animals suggests a high level of conservation of the mechanisms regulating fertility between basal chordates and vertebrates.
here we characterized the transcriptome of both fertile and infertile colonies throughout blastogenesis  using differential expression analysis.
gonad differentiation is an essential function for all sexually reproducing species, and many aspects of these developmental processes are highly conserved among the metazoa.
the colonial ascidian, botryllus schlosseri is a chordate model organism which offers two unique traits that can be utilized to characterize the genes underlying germline development: a colonial life history and variable fertility.
these properties allow individual genotypes to be isolated at different stages of fertility and gene expression can be characterized comprehensively.
spatial and temporal expression of differentially expressed genes was analyzed by in situ hybridization, confirming expression in developing gonads.
several of these genes appear to drive gonad maturation, as they are expressed by follicle cells surrounding both testis and oocyte precursors.
we have identified several genes expressed in developing and mature gonads in b. schlosseri.
