the assay requirements and analytical performance will provide physicians with test results from a robust and reliable assay which will enable improved treatment decisions for men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer.
the lowest quartile of rna yields from prostate needle biopsies  was between  <dig> and  <dig> ng.
gene assays were shown to accurately measure expression over a wide range of inputs .
the standard deviations for analytical precision and reproducibility were  <dig>  and  <dig>  gps units  respectively.
assessments of reproducibility and precision were performed by testing  <dig> prostate cancer rna samples over multiple instruments, reagent lots, operators, days , and rna input levels  using appropriately parameterized linear mixed models.
the aim of this study was to validate the analytical performance of the oncotype dx prostate cancer assay using predefined acceptance criteria.
analytical validation of the process requiring as little as  <dig> ng of rna met all pre-defined acceptance criteria.
this biopsy-based assay has been analytically and subsequently clinically validated as a predictor of aggressive prostate cancer.

amplification efficiencies, analytical sensitivity, and accuracy of gene assays were measured by serially diluting an rna sample and analyzing features of the linear regression between rna expression measured by the crossing point  versus the log <dig> of the rna input per pcr assay well.
analytical accuracy was excellent with average biases at qpcr inputs representative of patient samples < <dig> % across all assays while amplification efficiencies were within ±6% of the median.
the oncotype dx® prostate cancer assay is a multi-gene rt-pcr expression assay that was developed for use with fixed paraffin-embedded  diagnostic prostate needle biopsies containing as little as  <dig> mm of prostate tumor in the greatest dimension.
the assay measures expression of  <dig> cancer-related genes representing four biological pathways and  <dig> reference genes which are algorithmically combined to calculate the genomic prostate score .
the oncotype dx prostate cancer assay, a clinical rt-pcr assay specifically designed for use with prostate needle biopsies, has been analytically validated using very limited rna inputs.
