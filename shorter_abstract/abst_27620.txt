ldca is an enzyme required for recycling murein , which is a component of the bacterial cell wall.
, which are intracellular symbionts of various lineages of arthropods.
from the bacteriocyte of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, we previously identified two clusters of expressed sequence tags that display similarity only to bacterial genes.
southern blot analysis demonstrated that they are encoded in the aphid genome.
real-time quantitative rt-pcr demonstrated that ldca and rlpa are expressed  <dig>  and 154-fold higher in the bacteriocyte than in the whole body, respectively.
we further examined their expression levels in the bacteriocyte using real-time quantitative rt-pcr.
molecular phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated that the aphid ldca was derived from a rickettsial bacterium closely related to the extant wolbachia spp.
the evolutionary origin of rlpa was not fully resolved, but it was clearly demonstrated that its double-ψ β-barrel domain is of bacterial origin.
although the function of rlpa is not well known, conspicuous up-regulation of the aphid rlpa in the bacteriocyte implies that this gene is also essential for buchnera.
in this study, in order to assess the possibility of lateral gene transfer, we determined the full-length sequences of these transcripts, and performed detailed structural and phylogenetic analyses.
buchnera lacks these genes, whereas many other bacteria, including escherichia coli, a close relative of buchnera, possess both ldca and rlpa.
as buchnera possesses a cell wall composed of murein but lacks ldca, a high level of expression of the aphid ldca in the bacteriocyte may be essential to maintain buchnera.
sequence similarity searches demonstrated that these fully sequenced transcripts are significantly similar to the bacterial genes ldca  and rlpa , respectively.
