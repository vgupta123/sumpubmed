our results illustrate the efficiency and utility of sequence capture for re-sequencing highly heterozygous tree genomes, and suggest design considerations to optimize the use of baits in future studies.
as re-sequencing the genome of large numbers of samples is still cost-prohibitive in many cases, methods for genome complexity reduction have been developed in attempts to capture most ecologically-relevant genetic variation.
high-throughput re-sequencing is rapidly becoming the method of choice for studies of neutral and adaptive processes in natural populations across taxa.
few off-target regions  were present in the data, but on average ~80bp on either side of the baits were captured and sequenced to an acceptable depth  to call heterozygous snps.
one of these approaches is sequence capture, in which oligonucleotide baits specific to genomic regions of interest are synthesized and used to retrieve and sequence those regions.
we used sequence capture to re-sequence most predicted exons, their upstream regulatory regions, as well as numerous random genomic intervals in a panel of  <dig> genotypes of the angiosperm tree populus trichocarpa .
with  <dig> indexed samples run in each of four lanes on an illumina hiseq instrument ,  <dig> % of the bait regions were on average sequenced at a depth â‰¥10x.
a total of  <dig> mb  of the poplar genome was targeted, corresponding to  <dig>  baits.
nucleotide diversity estimates within and adjacent to protein-coding genes were similar to those previously reported in populus spp., while intergenic regions had higher values consistent with a relaxation of selection.
