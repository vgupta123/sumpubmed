pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide and gfp mrna were subsequently expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig>  with high yield and thermal stability, and were easily purified.
recombinant pp <dig> vlps can be used simultaneously as a targeted delivery vector for both peptides and mrna due to their abilities to package rna and display peptides.
cell-penetrating peptides  have been widely used as carriers to transport different molecules into living cells, whereas messenger rnas  have been utilized as target molecules for the prevention and treatment of various diseases.
bacteriophage pp <dig> virus-like particles  may protect peptides and rnas from degradation through displaying foreign peptides on their surface and encapsidating rna linked with the pac site.
last, pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp could encapsidate the gfp mrna, which was translated into mature protein in mammalian cells.
