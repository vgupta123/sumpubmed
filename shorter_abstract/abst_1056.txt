fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  showed the presence of hydroxypalmitate  only in l. interrogans serovar copenhageni.
lipopolysaccharides  are complex, amphipathic biomolecules that constitute the major surface component of gram-negative bacteria.
lps from leptospira interrogans serovar copenhageni strain l1- <dig>  a pathogenic species, and l. licerasiae serovar varillal strain var  <dig>  an intermediately pathogenic species, were studied.
l. interrogans serovar copenhageni has additional sugars not found in l. licerasiae serovar varillal, including fucose , a high amount of glcnac , and two different types of dideoxy hexnac.
sds-page indicated that l. interrogans serovar copenhageni lps had a far higher molecular weight and complexity than that of l. licerasiae serovar varillal.
chemical composition showed that l. interrogans serovar copenhageni lps has an extended o-antigenic polysaccharide consisting of sugars, not present in l. licerasiae serovar varillal.
negative staining electron microscopic examination of lps showed different filamentous morphologies in l. interrogans serovar copenhageni vs. l. licerasiae serovar varillal.

lps prepared from aqueous and phenol phases were analyzed separately.
