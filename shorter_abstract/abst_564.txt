the inability to signal through the vdr resulted in the generation of pathogenic cd8+ t cells from rapidly proliferating cells that contributed to the development of ibd.
vdr ko cd8+ t cells, but not wt cd8+ t cells, induced colitis in rag ko recipients.
vdr ko cd8+ t cells proliferated in vitro without antigen stimulation and did not downregulate cd62l and upregulate cd <dig> markers following proliferation that normally occurred in wt cd8+ t cells.
the more severe colitis was associated with rapidly proliferating naïve vdr ko cd8+ t cells and increased ifn-γ and il- <dig> in the gut.
t cells have been shown to express the vdr, and t cells are targets of vitamin d. in this article we determined the effects of vdr expression on cd8+ t cells.
in addition, co-transfer of vdr ko cd8+ t cells with naïve cd4+ t cells accelerated colitis development.
our data indicate that expression of the vdr is required to prevent replication of quiescent cd8+ t cells.
