the observed biased te insertion in gene-rich regions within an individual genome  and the “patchy” distribution among different strains point to the mobile elements as major generators of verticillium intra- and inter-specific genomic variation.
we report also of their distribution in other vd and va isolates from various geographic origins.
to date, no sexual stage has been identified in either microorganism suggesting that somatic mutation is a major force in generating genetic diversity.
<dig> revealed that non-random insertions of transposable elements  have contributed to the generation of four lineage-specific  regions in vdls.

we present here a detailed analysis of class i retrotransposons and class ii “cut-and-paste” dna elements detected in the sequenced verticillium genomes.
while copia-, gypsy- and tc1/mariner-like transposons were prominent, a large variation in presence of the other types of mobile elements was detected in the other verticillium spp.
noticeably, we found evidences of repeat-induced point mutation  only in some of the gypsy retroelements.
copia-, gypsy- and tc1/mariner-like transposons are the most wide-spread tes in the phytopathogens v. dahliae and v. albo-atrum.
some of these elements have undergone diversification and subsequent selective amplification after introgression into the fungal genome.
verticillium dahliae  and verticillium albo-atrum  are cosmopolitan soil fungi causing very disruptive vascular diseases on a wide range of crop plants.
