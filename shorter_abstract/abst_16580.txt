compared with pffs and pefs, pkcs exhibited a higher proliferation rate and resulted in a 2-fold higher blastocyst rate after scnt and in vitro cultivation.
among the four transfection methods tested with a gfp expression plasmid, best results were obtained with the nucleofectortm technology, resulting in transfection efficiencies of 70% to 89% with high fluorescence intensity, low cytotoxicity, good cell proliferation, and almost no morphological signs of cell stress.
in this study, we evaluate the potential of primary porcine kidney cells  as cell source for scnt, including their proliferation capacity, transfection efficiency, and capacity to support full term development of scnt embryos after additive gene transfer or homologous recombination.
however, the efficiency of this approach is crucially dependent on the source of nuclear donor cells.
several of those pigs originated from pkcs that underwent homologous recombination and antibiotic selection before scnt.
the high proliferation capacity of pkcs facilitates the introduction of precise and complex genetic modifications in vitro.
somatic cell nuclear transfer  is currently the most efficient and precise method to generate genetically tailored pig models for biomedical research.
