here we address variation, scaling, and correlated evolution in the mechanics of the major claw by analyzing the morphology and mechanical properties of the claws of  <dig> species of fiddler crabs from the pacific, gulf and atlantic coasts of the americas.
most variables scale isometrically with body size across species but claw force production scales allometrically with body size.
fiddler crabs, genus uca, are classic examples of how intense sexual selection can produce exaggerated male traits.
however, the morphology of the major claw is highly variable across the approximately  <dig> species within the genus.
these relationships suggest that there has been correlated evolution between force production and armoring, and that there is a tradeoff between claw mechanics for signaling and claw mechanics for fighting.
