computational methods which integrate and prioritize interaction data can greatly aid in approaching this goal.
comprehensive go-based quality assessment indicates a 5% to 44% score increase in predicted interactomes compared to the input data.
we demonstrate the ability to recover known ppis in well-characterized yeast and human complexes  and suggest possible new partners interacting with the putative swi/snf chromatin remodeling complex in a. thaliana.
we apply our framework to reconcile seven eukaryotic interactomes: h. sapiens, m. musculus, r. norvegicus, d. melanogaster, c. elegans, s. cerevisiae and a. thaliana.
we developed a bayesian inference framework which uses phylogenetic relationships to guide the integration of ppi evidence across multiple datasets and species, providing more accurate predictions.
detailed analysis of predictions in selected functional modules uncovers specific ppi profiles among homologous proteins, establishing interaction-based partitioning of protein families.
