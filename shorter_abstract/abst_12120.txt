on the other hand, non-assembly genes in the "ant moron" appear to be in a state of rapid flux, and regulatory genes outside the assembly gene cluster have clearly enjoyed numerous and recent horizontal exchanges with phages outside the p22-like group.
the sequence shows that Îµ <dig> is a mosaically related member of the p <dig> branch of the lambdoid phages.
clearly, temperate phages are very major contributors to the o-antigen serotype of their salmonella hosts.
its sequence is compared with the known p22-like phages and several related but previously unanalyzed prophage sequences in reported bacterial genome sequences.
