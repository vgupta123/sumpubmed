using pairwise comparisons using ma plots , we compared this novel method to previously published normalization techniques, namely global normalization to the mean, the quantile method, and a variation on the loess normalization method designed specifically for boutique microarrays.
results indicated that, for single channel microarrays, the quantile method was superior with regard to eliminating intensity-dependent effects , but zipf's law normalization does minimize this effect by rotating the data distribution such that the maximal number of data points lie on the zero of the log ratio axis.
zipf's law normalization is a useful tool where the quantile method cannot be applied, as is the case with microarrays containing functionally specific gene sets .
for two channel boutique microarrays, the zipf's law normalizations performed as well as, or better than existing techniques.
based on the observation that our single channel and two channel microarray data sets also followed a power-law distribution, we were motivated to develop a normalization method based on this law, and examine how it compares with existing published techniques.
recent investigations of data in gene expression databases for varying organisms and tissues have shown that the majority of expressed genes exhibit a power-law distribution with an exponent close to - <dig> .
