in this study, human trypsinogen was used as a model protein to study the influence of electrostatic forces on protein–protein interactions.
our study provides an example how directed modification of the protein surface charge can be utilized for the regulation of functional protein–protein interactions, as shown here for human trypsinogen.
surface-charged trypsinogen showed practically no autoactivation compared to the wild-type but could still be activated by enteropeptidase to the fully active trypsin.
this autoactivation process can occur if a trypsinogen molecule is activated by another trypsin molecule and therefore is based on a protein–protein interaction.
trypsinogen is the inactive precursor of trypsin, a serine protease that cleaves proteins and peptides after arginine and lysine residues.
the autoactivation properties of mutant trypsinogen were characterized in comparison to the recombinant wild-type enzyme.
based on a rational protein design based on autoactivation-defective guinea pig trypsinogen, several amino acid residues, all located far away from the active site, were changed to modify the surface charge of human trypsinogen.
the kinetic parameters of surface-charged trypsinogen were comparable to the recombinant wild-type enzyme.
the variant with a modified surface charge compared to the wild-type enzyme showed a complete different activation pattern.
the influence of the surface charge on the activation pattern of trypsinogen was investigated.
