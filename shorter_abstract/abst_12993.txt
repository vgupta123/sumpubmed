analyzing yeast data, we detected long-range correlations between shortest paths between proteins in both network types suggesting a mutual correspondence of both network architectures.
here, we investigate the relationships between two distinct types of interaction networks: the metabolic pathway map and the protein-protein interaction network .
our results reveal topological equivalences between the protein interaction network and the metabolic pathway network.
in our study, we expanded this line of research to include comparisons of the underlying respective network topologies as well as to investigate whether the spatial organization of enzyme interactions correlates with metabolic efficiency.
while physical interactions between proteins are generally dissortative, enzyme interactions were observed to be assortative.
single proteins were identified that connect major components of the cellular metabolism and may thus be essential for the structural integrity of several biosynthetic systems.
we discovered that the organizing principles of physical interactions between metabolic enzymes differ from the general pin of all proteins.
evolved protein interactions may contribute significantly towards increasing the efficiency of metabolic processes by permitting higher metabolic fluxes.
thus, our results shed further light on the unifying principles shaping the evolution of both the functional  as well as the physical interaction network.
enzymes carrying high flux loads are more likely to physically interact than enzymes with lower metabolic throughput.
the study of biological interaction networks is a central theme of systems biology.
