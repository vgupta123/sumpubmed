meningiomas are the most common intracranial neoplasias, representing a clinically and histopathologically heterogeneous group of tumors.
analysis of  <dig> cpg sites distributed within  <dig> bp of the promoter region suggests that nf <dig> promoter methylation does not play a major role in meningioma development.
methylation within the nf <dig> promoter region was only identified at a single cpg site in one tumor sample.
a large set of sporadic meningiomas were analyzed for presence of 22q macro-mutations using array-cgh in order to identify tumors carrying gene dosage aberrations not encompassing nf <dig>  the nf <dig> locus was also comprehensively studied for point mutations within coding and conserved non-coding sequences.
thus, inactivation of nf <dig>  often combined with the presence of macro-mutation on 22q, is likely not as important for the development of the meningothelial subtype, as opposed to the fibroblastic form.
furthermore, cpg methylation within the nf <dig> promoter region was thoroughly analyzed.
we confirmed previous findings of pronounced differences in mutation frequency between different histopathological subtypes.
we defined at least two minimal overlapping regions outside the nf <dig> locus that are small enough  to allow analysis of a limited number of candidate genes.
