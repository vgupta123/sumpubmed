the function of tlk <dig> is not well known, although knockout of the gene in drosophila or expression of a dominant negative mutant in mouse cells causes loss of nuclear divisions and missegregation of chromosomes probably, due to alterations in chromatin remodeling capacity.
lastly, we demonstrate with an in vitro repair system that the addition of recombinant tlk1b promotes repair of a linearized plasmid incubated with nuclear extract.
in this work, we provide several lines of evidence that tlk1b protects the cells from ir by facilitating the repair of dsbs.
tlk1b specifically phosphorylates histone h <dig> and asf <dig>  likely resulting in changes in chromatin structure, particularly at double strand breaks  sites.
this was also true for repair of genomic damage.
first, the pattern of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of h2ax and h <dig> indicated that cells overexpressing tlk1b return to pre-ir steady state much more rapidly than controls.
