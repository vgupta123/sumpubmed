the molecular mechanisms underlying root development have been extensively studied to improve root system architecture, especially for the crops.
taken together, the regulatory networks mediated by the srnas highly accumulated in the root tips or in the whole roots could advance our current understanding of the srna-involved molecular mechanisms underlying rice root development.
specifically, the expression patterns of certain target genes in the root tips and the whole roots were contrary to those of the regulating srnas.
besides, several targets were indicated to play important roles in root development based on literature mining.
after argonaute  <dig>  enrichment analysis, the srnas with great potential of performing target cleavages were included for target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation.
in this study, by using srna high-throughput sequencing data, we made a comparison of the srna accumulation levels between the rice root tips and the whole roots.
the srnas highly accumulated in the root tips and in the whole roots were extracted respectively.
as a result, lists of the targets regulated by the ago1-enriched srnas were obtained for both the root tips and the whole roots.
the root systems play essential roles for plants to anchorage to the soil, and to exploit the mineral and water resources.
further evidences were identified from microarray data of the target genes to support some of the srnaâ€”target interactions.
however, whether the other small rna  species, which occupy a dominant portion of the plant endogenous srna population, possess potential roles in root development remains unclear.
several microrna  families have been demonstrated to be involved in plant root development.
