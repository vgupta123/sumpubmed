specific length amplified fragment sequencing  is a recently developed high-resolution strategy for large-scale de novo snp discovery and genotyping.
a high-density genetic map for sesame has not been published yet due to a lack of sufficient molecular markers.
slaf-seq was employed in this study to obtain sufficient markers to construct a high-density genetic map for sesame.
in total,  <dig>  high-quality slafs were detected of which  <dig>  slafs were polymorphic and  <dig>  of the polymorphic markers met the requirements for use in the construction of a genetic map.
we report here the first high-density genetic map for sesame.
results of this study will not only provide a platform for gene/qtl fine mapping, map-based gene isolation, and molecular breeding for sesame, but will also serve as a reference for positioning sequence scaffolds on a physical map, to assist in the process of assembling the sesame genome sequence.
the map was constructed using an f <dig> population and the slaf-seq approach, which allowed the efficient development of a large number of polymorphic markers in a short time.
the final map included  <dig>  markers on the  <dig> linkage groups  and was  <dig> .87 cm in length with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers.
the average coverage for each slaf marker was  <dig> -fold in the male parent,  <dig> -fold in the female parent, and  <dig> -fold average in each f <dig> individual.
'snp_only’ markers accounted for  <dig> % of the markers on the map.
to our knowledge, this map is the densest genetic linkage map to date for sesame.
