here we provide a critical assessment of current analysis methodologies that cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units  and demonstrate that small changes in algorithm parameters can lead to significantly varying results.
molecular studies of microbial diversity have provided many insights into the bacterial communities inhabiting the human body and the environment.
to date, however, there exists significant variability in analysis methods employed in these studies.
our results highlight the need for systematic and open evaluation of data analysis methodologies, especially as targeted 16s rrna diversity studies are increasingly relying on high-throughput sequencing technologies.
all data and results from our study are available through the jgi fames website http://fames.jgi-psf.org/.
a common first step in such studies is a survey of conserved marker genes  to characterize the taxonomic composition and diversity of these communities.
