the a priori network information was retrieved from gene co-expression networks and gene functional maps.
one possible solution to cope with this dimensionality problem is the use of additional constraints in the cost function optimization.
network-based regularization seems a promising framework to deal with the dimensionality problem.
when compared with ridge and lasso, degreecox shows an improvement in the classification of high and low risk patients in a par with net-cox.
the centrality metrics proposed can be easily expanded to accommodate other topological properties of different biological networks.
we applied degreecox to three datasets of ovarian cancer carcinoma and tested several centrality measures such as weighted degree, betweenness and closeness centrality.
lasso and other sparsity methods have thus already been successfully applied with such idea.
in terms of rmse and c-index, degreecox gives results that are similar to those of the best performing methods, in a few cases slightly better.
the use of network information is especially relevant with datasets that are not easily separated.
in particular, we propose to use network centrality measures to constrain the model in terms of significant genes.
