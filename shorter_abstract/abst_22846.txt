aquaporins  and aquaglyceroporins  belong to the superfamily of major intrinsic proteins  and are involved in the transport of water and neutral solutes across the membranes.
we have also found two new subfamilies  within the aqgp group.
members of this family are small in size, charged and have hydrophobic residues in the aromatic/arginine selectivity filter and these features are shared by small and basic intrinsic proteins , one of the plant mip subfamilies.
the aromatic/arginine selectivity filter of sip-like fungal mips and the Î´ aqgps are unique, hydrophobic in nature and are likely to transport novel hydrophobic solutes.

we have also identified distinguishing features in loops e and d in the newly identified subfamilies indicating their possible role in channel transport and gating.
mip channels play significant role in plant-fungi symbiotic relationship and are believed to be important in host-pathogen interactions in human fungal diseases.
they can be attractive targets for developing anti-fungal drugs.
the evolutionary pattern shared with their plant counterparts indicates possible involvement of new fungal mips in plant-fungi symbiosis and host-pathogen interactions.
phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling exhibit the existence of a new mip cluster distinct from any of the known fungal mip subfamilies.
fungal mip subfamilies include orthodox aquaporins and five subgroups within aquaglyceroporins.
fungal aqgps are the most diverse and possess the largest number of subgroups.
in this study, we have investigated the extent of diversity in fungal mips and explored further evolutionary relationships with the plant mip counterparts.
we have extensively analyzed the available fungal genomes and examined nearly  <dig> fungal mips.
