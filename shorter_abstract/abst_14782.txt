overall, our results support the view that phages play a crucial role in the generation of genetic diversity in s. enteritidis and that phage se <dig> may be a key marker for the emergence of particular isolates capable of causing epidemics.
our results confirm previous reports demonstrating a high degree of genetic homogeneity among s. enteritidis isolates.
from these,  <dig> isolates spanning different periods, genetic profiles and sources of isolation were assayed for their ability to infect human epithelial cells and subjected to comparative genomic hybridization using a salmonella pan-array and the sequenced strain s. enteritidis pt <dig> p <dig> as reference.
the  <dig> oldest pre-epidemic isolates lack phage se <dig> and harbour other phage encoded genes that are absent in the sequenced strain.
in particular, the oldest pre-epidemic isolates carry phage-associated genetic regions not previously reported in s. enteritidis.
the recent epidemic of s. enteritidis infection in uruguay has been driven by the introduction of closely related strains of phage type  <dig> lineage.
<dig> s. enteritidis isolates were genotyped using rapd-pcr and a selection were subjected to pfge analysis.
in this study we investigate genome divergence and pathogenic potential in s. enteritidis isolated before, during and after an epidemic in uruguay.
two hundred and thirty three chromosomal genes as well as the virulence plasmid were found as variable among s. enteritidis isolates.
however,  <dig> of the regions of variability described here are for the first time reported as being variable in s. enteritidis.
besides variation in prophage, we found variation in genes involved in metabolism and bacterial fitness.
ten out of the  <dig> chromosomal regions that varied between different isolates correspond to phage-like regions.
six other isolates from distant countries were included as external comparators.
