positive pcr results for a. phagocytophilum were obtained in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  specimens with primer sets ec , ee  and ge , respectively.
our results revealed that the nested pcr with primer set ec complementary to the 16s rrna gene was the most sensitive assay for detection of a. phagocytophilum in ruminant and tick specimens.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of five nested pcr assays by detection of  <dig> ruminant and tick samples, and to select the most appropriate methods for the sensitive detection of a. phagocytophilum in environmental or clinical samples.
the amplification of template dna with the primer set msp  could not be obtained in both ruminants and ticks, and a low specificity of the el primers  in tick samples was observed.
this report provides more valuable information for the diagnosis and management of granulocytic anaplasmosis in china.
currently, numerous pcr assays have been developed and used for the detection of a. phagocytophilum in various specimens.
a. phagocytophilum was detected in  <dig>  sheep,  <dig>  cattle, and  <dig>  ticks.
two a. phagocytophilum genotypes were identified, that varied between sheep and cattle in sample collection sites.
