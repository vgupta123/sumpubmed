here we describe a detailed survey of alternative splicing in grape based on  <dig> solid rnaseq analyses from different tissues, stress conditions and genotypes.
it is differentially regulated in a wide variety of cell types and plays a role in several cellular processes.
a quantitative analysis of the isoforms indicated that most of the spliced genes have one major isoform and tend to simultaneously co-express a low number of isoforms, typically two, with intron retention being the most frequent alternative splicing event.
the finding that a part the splicing machinery can change in closely related organisms can lead to some interesting hypotheses for evolutionary adaptation, that could be particularly relevant in the response to sudden and strong selective pressures.
as described in arabidopsis, also grape displays a marked as tissue-specificity, while stress conditions produce splicing changes to a minor extent.
we used the rnaseq data to update the existing grape gene prediction with  <dig>  new coding genes and  <dig>  putative long non-coding rnas.
