m.blmncii was cloned in e. coli and an internal fragment if arfbarfb was cloned into pori <dig> for insertion mutagenesis.
finally, we improved genetic accessibility for the strain b. longum subsp.
methylome data, coupled to the analysis of restriction-modification systems, allowed us to substantially increase the genetic accessibility of b. longum subsp.
bifidobacterial genome analysis has provided insights as to how these gut commensals adapt to and persist in the human git, while also revealing genetic diversity among members of a given bifidobacterial species.
comparative genomic analysis of thirty three b. longum representatives revealed a closed pan-genome for this bifidobacterial species.
furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the b. longum core genome indicated the existence of a novel subspecies.
pacbio smrt sequencing was used to determine the whole genome seqeunces of two b. longum subsp.
this analysis also highlighted differences in particular metabolic abilities between members of the b. longum subspecies infantis, longum and suis.
phylogenetic analysis of the b. longum core genome also provides evidence for a novel fifth b. longum subspecies.
the b. longum pan-genome was computed using pgap v <dig>  and the core b. longum phylogenetic tree was constructed using a maximum-likelihood based approach in phyml v <dig> .
comparative analysis with thirty one publicly available b. longum genomes allowed the definition of the b. longum core and dispensable genomes.
