the program and source code are available at the snpscan website .
we also inspected previously generated snp data from  <dig> apparently normal individuals from the centre d'Ã‰tude du polymorphisme humain  collection, and identified three cases of uniparental isodisomy, four females having an apparently mosaic x chromosome, two mislabelled snp data sets, and one microdeletion on chromosome  <dig> with mosaicism from an apparently normal female.
a variety of diseases are caused by chromosomal abnormalities such as aneuploidies , microdeletions, microduplications, and uniparental disomy.
snpscan is useful to identify chromosomal abnormalities based on snp intensity  and heterozygosity data .
we have developed snpscan, a web-accessible tool to analyze and visualize high density snp data.
it enables researchers  to visually and quantitatively assess the quality of user-generated snp data relative to a benchmark data set derived from a control population,  to display snp intensity and allelic call data in order to detect chromosomal copy number anomalies ,  to display uniparental isodisomy based on loss of heterozygosity  across genomic regions,  to compare paired samples , and  to generate a file type for viewing snp data in the university of california, santa cruz  human genome browser.
the microdeletion was independently confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and a region of homozygosity in a upd case was confirmed by sequencing of genomic dna.
the identification of different classes of anomalies within snp data has been challenging.
we validated snpscan using data generated from patients with known deletions, duplications, and uniparental disomy.
high density single nucleotide polymorphism  microarrays provide information on chromosomal copy number changes, as well as genotype .
