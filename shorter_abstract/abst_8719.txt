we show that the relative mass of rna whose function and/or structure we do not understand , as a proportion of all non-ribosomal, non-mitochondrial human rna , can be greater than that of protein-encoding transcripts.
discovery that the transcriptional output of the human genome is far more complex than predicted by the current set of protein-coding annotations and that most rnas produced do not appear to encode proteins has transformed our understanding of genome complexity and suggests new paradigms of genome regulation.
we conclude that 'dark matter' rna can constitute the majority of non-ribosomal, non-mitochondrial-rna and a significant fraction arises from numerous very long, intergenic transcribed regions that could be involved in neoplastic transformation.
we further show the presence of a large number of very long, abundantly-transcribed regions  in intergenic space and further show that expression of these regions is associated with neoplastic transformation.
these overlap some regions found previously in normal human embryonic tissues and raises an interesting hypothesis as to the function of these ncrnas in both early development and neoplastic transformation.
