analysis of the connectivity distribution has inferred a fat-tailed degree distribution with parameters consistent with those found in other biological networks.
we have used publicly available databases and a novel software tool termed hubview to model the interactions of a subset of the yeast interactome, specifically protein kinases and their interaction partners.
as such, these results suggest an inherent trend to preserve scale free characteristics at a domain based modular level within large evolvable networks.
using connectivity analysis on a functional subset of proteins we have evidence that reinforces the scale free topology as a model for protein network evolution.
the complexity and average degree for each of these clusters is indicative of a specialized function  and relative age for each cluster.
