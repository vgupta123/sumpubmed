this finding was compatible with the expression pattern of the b3gnt <dig> gene in the pre-implantation embryo as shown by in situ hybridization.
the analysis of gsl profiles in embryonic stem cells heterozygous for the b3gnt5-null allele confirmed the reduced levels of lactoseries derived gsl levels and of other gsl species.
the disruption of the b3gnt <dig> gene in mice affected the expression of lactoseries derived gls and possibly of protein-bound Î²3glcnac-linked glycans, thereby demonstrating an essential contribution of these glycoconjugates in early embryonic development, and supporting the importance of these glycoconjugates in cell differentiation and adhesion processes.
breeding of heterozygous mutant mice failed to produce any viable progeny homozygous for the b3gnt5-null allele.
glycosphingolipids  are integral components of mammalian cell membranes that are involved in cell adhesion and cell signaling processes.
the genotypic examination of embryos from heterozygous crosses showed that the disruption of the b3gnt <dig> gene leads to pre-implantation lethality.
