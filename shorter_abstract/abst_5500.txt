the quality of this embryo-specific array was confirmed with a high-level of reproducibility using current agilent microarray technology.
quality control on the empv <dig> was performed and revealed an even distribution of ten clusters of spiked-in control spots and array to array  correlation was  <dig> .
a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in early embryonic development has inhibited our ability to fully elucidate these factors.
after re-annotation, the total unique genes increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig> % of them belonged to a large olfactory receptor  gene family.
with more than an estimated  <dig>  unique genes represented on the empv <dig>  this platform will provide the foundation for future research into the in vivo and in vitro factors that affect the viability of porcine embryos, as well as the effects of these factors on the live offspring that result from these embryos.
based on an initial probe sequence annotation, the empv <dig> features  <dig>  protein-coding,  <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig> retrotransposed,  <dig>  non-coding rna,  <dig>  splice variants in  <dig>  genes and a total of  <dig>  novel transcript regions .
the domestic pig is an important livestock species and there is strong interest in the factors that affect the development of viable embryos and offspring in this species.
two cdna libraries constructed from in vitro and in vivo produced preimplantation porcine embryos were normalized and sequenced using  <dig> titanium pyrosequencing technology.
next generation deep sequencing and microarray technologies are powerful tools for delineation of molecular pathways involved in the developing embryo.
