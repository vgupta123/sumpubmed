yet, some sdr families — tropinone reductase-like proteins , ‘aba2-like’-nad dehydrogenase , ‘salutaridine/menthone-reductase-like’ proteins , ‘dihydroflavonol 4-reductase’-like proteins  and ‘isoflavone-reductase-like’  proteins — have undergone significant functional diversification within vascular plants since they diverged from bryophytes.
in opposition to sdr families involved in primary metabolism which are poorly diversified.
the combination of hidden markov model  based analyses and similarity searches led to the construction of an exhaustive inventory of plant sdr.
the multiplicity of sdrs in plant kingdom is mainly explained by the diversification of large families involved in different secondary metabolism pathways, suggesting that the chemical diversification that accompanied the emergence of vascular plants acted as a driving force for sdr evolution.
wide-scale analyses were performed on ten plant genomes.
the application of hmms to plant genomes enabled us to identify  <dig> families that encompass all angiosperms  sdrs, each family being sufficiently conserved to enable simpler analyses based only on overall sequence similarity.
recent classification methods, relying on hidden-markov models , improved identification and enabled the construction of a nomenclature.

interestingly, these diversified families are either involved in the secondary metabolism routes  or participate in developmental processes ,
however, functional annotations of plant sdrs remain scarce.
the plant sdrs were first classified into three major types — ‘classical’, ‘extended’ and ‘divergent’ — but a minority  could not be classified into these general types .
in a second step, we could categorize the vast majority of land plant sdrs into a set of  <dig> families.
