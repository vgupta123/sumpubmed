we present prunier, a new method for phylogenetic detection of lgt based on the search for a maximum statistical agreement forest  between a gene tree and a reference tree.
we use prunier on a biological dataset of  <dig> universal proteins and discuss their suitability for inferring the tree of life.
phylogenetic methods are particularly promising for this purpose, but the reconciliation of a gene tree with a reference  tree is computationally hard.
we evaluate the performance of prunier and two other programs  for their ability to detect transferred genes in realistic simulations where gene trees are reconstructed from sequences.
we show that lgt scenarios carry a strong signal about the position of the root of the species tree and could be used to identify the direction of evolutionary time on the species tree.
to understand the evolutionary role of lateral gene transfer , accurate methods are needed to identify transferred genes and infer their timing of acquisition.
prunier's greedy algorithm proposes a single scenario of lgt for a gene family, but its quality always compares to the best solutions provided by the other algorithms.
when the root position is uncertain in the species tree, prunier is able to infer a scenario per root at a limited additional computational cost and can easily run on large datasets.
