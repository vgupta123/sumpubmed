semantic constraints are rules requiring the tagged entity to contain its true meaning in the sentence context.
to ensure heterogeneity of the corpus, medline sentences were first scored for term similarity to documents with known gene names, and 10k high- and 10k low-scoring sentences were chosen at random.
the original 20k sentences were run through a gene/protein name tagger, and the results were modified manually to reflect a wide definition of gene/protein names subject to a specificity constraint, a rule that required the tagged entities to refer to specific entities.
the annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name ner is a difficult process due to the complexity of gene/protein names.
each sentence in genetag was annotated with acceptable alternatives to the gene/protein names it contained, allowing for partial matching with semantic constraints.
application of these constraints results in a more meaningful measure of the performance of an ner system than unrestricted partial matching.
evaluating the performance of biomedical ner systems is impossible without a standardized test corpus.
