accordingly, we found new roles in growth control and stress response for hsf1/skn <dig> when pka activity was low .
experimental results were used to propose an interaction scheme for the pka-rn and to build an extension of a classic synchronous discrete modeling framework.
further modeling of the new data foresaw a third repressor of hsf1/skn <dig>  active only in theabsence of tpk <dig>  by averaging the network state over all its attractors, a good quantitative agreement between computational and experimental results was obtained, as the averages reflected more accurately the population measurements.
our systems level approach, which combined experimental results with theoretical modeling, unveils the relevance of the interaction scheme for the cs and offers quantitative predictions for several scenarios .
here we show that temperature stress, along with deletion of pka-rn genes, significantly affected hse-dependent gene expression and the dynamics of the pka-rn in cells growing in exponential phase.
additionally, the dynamics of hse-dependent gene expression cannot be simulated accurately by considering the activity of single pka-rn components .
furthermore, pka-rn dynamics are often measured through camp levels in nutrient-depleted cells shortly after being fed with glucose, dismissing downstream physiological processes.
our genetic analysis revealed complex regulatory interactions between the cs that influenced the inhibition of hsf1/skn <dig> transcription factors.
additional genetic analysis identified ssa <dig> and ssa <dig> chaperones as such repressors.
our computational model reproduced the experimental data and predicted complex interactions between the cs and the existence of a repressor of hsf1/skn <dig> that is activated by the cs.
