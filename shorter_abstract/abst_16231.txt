the genomic dna of  <dig> extra-pulmonary clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis derived from cerebrospinal fluid, lymph node fine needle aspirates  / biopsies, were sequenced.
genomic analysis of m. tuberculosis isolates from extra pulmonary patients has not been explored.
in addition, insertion sites of is elements were identified and their distribution revealed a variation in number and position of the element in the  <dig> extra-pulmonary isolates compared to the reference m. tuberculosis h37rv strain.
the results suggest that ngs sequencing is able to identify small variations in genomes of m. tuberculosis isolates including changes in is element insertion sites.
moreover, variations in isolates of m. tuberculosis from non-pulmonary sites were documented.
the analysis of our results indicates genomic heterogeneity in the clinical isolates.
there have been concerted efforts by whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify genomic patterns and to establish a relationship between the genotype of the organism and clinical manifestation of tuberculosis.
clinical tuberculosis manifests often as pulmonary and occasionally as extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.
