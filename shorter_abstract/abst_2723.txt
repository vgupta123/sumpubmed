in this work, we used a two-fold systems biology approach specially focused on biological processes and gene networks to conduct a comparative analysis of autism with  <dig> frequently comorbid disorders in order to define a multi-disorder subcomponent of asd and predict new genes of potential relevance to asd etiology.
therefore, identifying crucial genes in the overlap between asd and these comorbid disorders may help unravel the common biological processes involved and, ultimately, shed some light in the understanding of autism etiology.
using prior knowledge of disease-related biological processes and the interaction networks of the disorders related to autism, we identified a set of  <dig> genes not previously linked to asd that were significantly differentially regulated in individuals with autism.
in addition, these genes were of potential etiologic relevance to autism, given their enriched roles in neurological processes crucial for optimal brain development and function, learning and memory, cognition and social behavior.
taken together, our approach represents a novel perspective of autism from the point of view of related comorbid disorders and proposes a model by which prior knowledge of interaction networks may enlighten and focus the genome-wide search for autism candidate genes to better define the genetic heterogeneity of asd.
these high rates of comorbidity are not surprising taking into account the overlap of symptoms that asd shares with other pathologies.
these comorbid conditions may add further impairments to individuals with autism and are substantially more prevalent compared to neurotypical populations.
from a research perspective, this suggests common molecular mechanisms involved in these conditions.
we validated our predictions by determining the significance of our candidate genes in high throughput transcriptome expression profiling studies.
