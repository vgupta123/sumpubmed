the activity of the sortase can be inhibited by mutation of a cysteine residue in the predicted active site and by small-molecule inhibitors.
mass spectrometry reveals the cleavage site to be between the threonine and glycine residues of the pxtg peptide.
these results demonstrate for the first time that c. difficile encodes a single sortase enzyme, which cleaves motifs containing pxtg in-vitro.
strain  <dig> encodes seven predicted cell wall proteins with the pxtg sorting motif, four of which are conserved across all five c. difficile lineages and include potential adhesins and cell wall hydrolases.
small-molecule inhibitors identified through an in silico screen inhibit srtb enzymatic activity to a greater degree than mtset.
replacement of the predicted catalytic cysteine residue at position  <dig> with alanine abolishes srtb activity, as does addition of the cysteine protease inhibitor mtset to the reaction.
sortase protein anchoring is mediated by a conserved cell wall sorting signal on the anchored protein, comprising of a c-terminal recognition sequence containing an “lpxtg-like” motif, followed by a hydrophobic domain and a positively charged tail.
bacterial sortases are transpeptidases that covalently anchor surface proteins to the peptidoglycan of the gram-positive cell wall.
a fret-based assay was used to confirm that recombinant srtb catalyzes the cleavage of fluorescently labelled peptides containing pxtg motifs.
