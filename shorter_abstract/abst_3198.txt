the method predicts the coupling preferences of gpcrs to gs, gi/o and gq/ <dig>  but not g12/ <dig> subfamilies.
using a dataset of  <dig> gpcr sequences of known coupling preference to g-proteins and adopting a five-fold cross-validation procedure, the method yielded an  <dig> % correct classification rate.
due to the information explosion in biological sequence databases, the development of software algorithms that could predict properties of gpcrs is important.
utilizing this information and membrane topology information, we have developed an intensive exploratory approach to generate a refined library of statistical models  that predict the coupling preference of gpcrs to heterotrimeric g-proteins.
in a validation set comprised of all receptor sequences that are species homologues to gpcrs with known coupling preferences, excluding the sequences used to train the models, our method yields a correct classification rate of  <dig> %.
our method demonstrates high correct classification rate.
experimental data reported in the literature suggest that heterotrimeric g-proteins interact with parts of the activated receptor at the transmembrane helix-intracellular loop interface.
