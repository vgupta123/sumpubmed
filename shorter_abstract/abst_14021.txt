our model demonstrates that mortality is related to greater fire frequency, higher temperatures, lower elevations, less rocky habitats and aspect .
individuals that established in open habitats at lower, hotter elevations and experienced a greater fire frequency appear to be more vulnerable to mortality than individuals growing within protected, rocky environments at higher, cooler locations with less frequent fires.
urgent management interventions, including seedling out-planting in fire-protected high elevation sites, reducing fire frequency in higher elevation populations, and assisted migration, should be considered.
our results show that w. cedarbergensis populations have declined significantly over the recorded period, with a pronounced decline in the last 30Â years.
from an initial total of  <dig> live trees in historical photographs, 74% had died and only  <dig>  had recruited in the repeat photographs, leaving  <dig> live individuals.
a generalized linear mixed-effects model was fitted to determine the relative importance of environmental factors and fire-return interval on mortality for the species.
eighty-seven historical and repeat photo-pairs were analysed to establish 20th century changes in w. cedarbergensis demography.
we use a large and long-term  repeat photography dataset together with environmental data and fire records to account for the decline of the critically endangered widdringtonia cedarbergensis.
climate models predict increasing temperatures for our study area .
