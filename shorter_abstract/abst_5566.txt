in mammals, it has been described as a negative regulator of the sonic hedgehog pathway involved in morphogenesis, differentiation, proliferation, among other processes.
moreover, its impact is even more significant since these results, taken together with all the knowledge about gup <dig> gene  give consistence to the possibility that gup1p may be part of a yeast morphogenic pathway parallel to the mammalian hedgehog.
this work is the first study in the opportunistic yeast candida albicans, showing a role for the gup <dig> gene in virulence as well as in the mechanisms underlying antifungal resistance.
we show that candida albicans gup1p strongly interferes with the capacity of cells to develop hyphae, to adhere, to invade, and to form a biofilm, all of which are significant virulence factors.
identically to s. cerevisiae, cagup1Î” null mutant was more resistant to antifungals like fluconazole, ketoconazole, and clotrimazole, and displayed an abnormal even sterol distribution at the plasma membrane.
