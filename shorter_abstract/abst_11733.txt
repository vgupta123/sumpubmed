three isolates were selected for characterization in turkeys: the us index isolate from december  <dig> , and two poultry isolates from april  <dig> .
the unusually long mean death times, high levels of virus in feces, and increased adaptation of the later viruses may have contributed to the rapid spread of the virus during the peak of the outbreak.
four week old broad-breasted white turkeys were inoculated with one of three doses  of each of the isolates to evaluate infectious dose and pathogenesis.
the mean bird infectious dose of a/northern pintail/wa/40964/ <dig> and a/turkey/mn/12528/ <dig> was  <dig> eid <dig> per bird, but was  <dig> eid <dig> per bird for a/chicken/ia/13388/ <dig>  suggesting the latter had greater adaptation to gallinaceous birds.
most cases in commercial poultry were caused by an h5n <dig> strain which was a reassortant with  <dig> eurasian lineage genes, including a clade  <dig> .
all three isolates had unusually long mean death time of  <dig> – <dig>  days post challenge, and the primary clinical signs were severe lethargy and neurological signs which started no more than 24 h before death .
<dig>  goose/guangdong/ <dig> lineage hemagglutinin, and  <dig> genes from north american wild waterfowl low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses.
