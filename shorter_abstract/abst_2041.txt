we used ancient dna and next generation sequencing approaches to assemble complete mitochondrial genomes for eleven pigeons, including the extinct ryukyu wood pigeon , the thick-billed ground dove , the spotted green pigeon , the rodrigues solitaire , and the dodo .

our analyses indicate that the earliest radiation of the columbidae crown group most likely occurred during the oligocene, with continued divergence of major clades into the miocene, suggesting that diversification within the columbidae occurred more recently than has been reported previously.
we used a bayesian approach to infer the evolutionary relationships among  <dig> species of living and extinct pigeons and doves.
