the increase in the number of strains resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or cefoxitin seems to pose serious public health consequences.
out of the  <dig> vegetables selected,  <dig> ,  <dig> isolates  tested positive for l. monocytogenes.
noticeably, l. monocytogenes was absent from only cabbage, broccoli, palak and cowpea, and also the respective rhizospheric soils.
the study demonstrates the prevalence of pathogenic l. monocytogenes in the selected agricultural farm samples.
eric- and rep-pcr collectively revealed that isolates from vegetables and their respective rhizospheric soils had distinct pcr fingerprints.
therefore, an attempt has been made to gain further insight to their antibiotic susceptibility, serotypes and the virulence genes.

listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne pathogen is ubiquitous to different environments including the agroecosystem.
the  <dig> isolates + ve for pathogenicity, belonged to serogroup 4b, 4d or 4e, and all were positive for inla, inlc, inlj, plca, prfa, acta, hlya and iap gene except one  among the vegetable isolates that lacked the plca gene.
the organism poses serious public health problem.
