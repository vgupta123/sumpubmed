in a test data set of  <dig> subjects sequenced across ~ <dig> mb genomic sequence using multiplexing technology, our method detected mutations as small as  <dig> bp, predicted quantitative copy count, and had a low false-positive rate.
cnv calls are confirmed by testing for a signature of sequences that span the cnv breakpoint.
however, methods for cnv detection from targeted enrichment are lacking.
we present a method combining coverage with map information for the identification of deletions and duplications in targeted sequence data.
application of this method allows for identification of gains and losses in targeted sequence data, providing comprehensive mutation screening when combined with a short read aligner.
