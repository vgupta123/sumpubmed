we do not propose a single drawing but rather several alternative ways of presenting metabolism depending on the pathway on which one wishes to focus.
the tools that are available to draw and to manipulate the representations of metabolism are usually restricted to metabolic pathways.
the various attempts that have been made to draw genome-scale metabolic networks are confronted with two shortcomings: 1- they do not use contextual information which leads to dense, hard to interpret drawings, 2- they impose to fit to very constrained standards, which implies, in particular, duplicating nodes making topological analysis considerably more difficult.
