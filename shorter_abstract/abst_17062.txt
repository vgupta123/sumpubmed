sox <dig> is initially expressed broadly in the murine cartilage condensations at early stages of skeletal development, but its expression is specifically increased in the forming joint interzone as is forms.
sox <dig> overexpression can directly activate gdf <dig> expression both in vitro and in micromass cell cultures prepared from chick limb buds.
while misexpression of sox <dig> in developing chick limbs through rcas virus infection does not induce gdf <dig> expression in ectopic locations, it does enhance its expression.
however, the molecular pathways controlling joint formation and subsequent joint maintenance are largely unknown.
in this study, we focused on sox <dig>  and its contribution to the regulation of gdf <dig>  a secreted signal necessary for proper joint formation and postnatal joint homeostasis.
this work implicates sox <dig> as a potential regulator of gdf <dig> expression in joint maintenance and suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.
conserved sox family binding sites are present in the 5â€™ utr region of the gdf <dig> gene and we show sox <dig> can specifically bind to one of them.
to explore the roles of sox <dig> in joint homeostasis, we analyzed adult knee joints in an osteoarthritis mouse model where the medial meniscus and the medial collateral ligament were removed.
we also analyzed knee joints from human subjects who underwent total knee replacement surgery.
we find that sox <dig> is mainly expressed in the weight-bearing areas of knee joints, and its expression is decreased in degraded cartilage during progression of knee osteoarthritis in both mice and humans.
