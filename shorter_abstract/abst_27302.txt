we develop a novel and efficient biclustering algorithm which can be regarded as a greedy version of an existing algorithm known as pcluster algorithm.
by relaxing the constraint in homogeneity, the proposed algorithm has polynomial-time complexity in the worst case instead of exponential-time complexity as in the pcluster algorithm.
we have proposed a novel biclustering algorithm which works with pc plots for an interactive exploratory analysis of gene expression data.
the dna microarray technology allows the measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes under tens/hundreds of different conditions.
biologically significant biclusters have been validated on the yeast cell-cycle expression dataset using gene ontology annotations.
comparative study shows that the proposed approach outperforms several existing biclustering algorithms.
experiments on artificial datasets verify that our algorithm can identify both additive-related and multiplicative-related biclusters in the presence of overlap and noise.
in this article, we investigate an efficient method for identifying a popular type of biclusters called additive model.
in future, we will modify the proposed algorithm for other bicluster models such as the coherent evolution model.
