natural language processing is increasingly used for this purpose although it inherently involves errors.
since this proximity filtering is based on syntactic structure, applying it to the results of co-occurrence processing is useful, but not as effective as when applied to the output of natural language processing.
information based on the proximity postprocessing method we suggest is of sufficient quality to be profitably used for subsequent applications aimed at uncovering new biomedical knowledge.
we also applied this strategy to relations identified with co-occurrence processing.
although proximity filtering is only marginally effective for enhancing the precision of relations extracted with co-occurrence processing, it is likely to benefit methods based, even partially, on syntactic structure, regardless of the relation.
for example, if gene-gene relations are filtered for arguments at a distance of  <dig> phrase from the predicate, precision increases from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %.
based on the number of intervening phrases between an argument and its predicate, we defined a heuristic strategy to filter the extracted semantic relations according to their likelihood of being correct.
in an effort to exploit semgen predications on the etiology of disease after increasing precision with postprocessing, a gene list was derived from extracted information enhanced with postprocessing filtering and was automatically annotated with gfinder, a web application that dynamically retrieves functional and phenotypic information from structured biomolecular resources.
