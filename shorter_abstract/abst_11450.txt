the results obtained from the present study highlighted that there are no differences between anastomotic samples treated with either prp or prgf preparations, except for a significant increase in epithelization of the intestinal mucosa at the anastomotic site in the prgf group.
the use of autologous platelet-rich plasma  and plasma rich in growth factors  has been proposed for the treatment of several acute and chronic syndromes, such as corneal epithelial defects and dry eye syndrome, gum bleeding during oral surgery, and in orthopaedic surgery.
both prp and prgf suspensions should be considered a safe strategy and represent a relatively low-cost technology that is flexible enough to be applied in several therapeutic fields.
no true benefit could be proven in our study compared to the no treatment following anastomoses formation, with the exception of enhanced epithelization of the mucosa in the prgf group.
the concentration of platelets in prp was  <dig> -fold higher  that the concentration in whole blood, while the concentration in prgf was  <dig> -fold higher .
we hypothesized that prgf, rather than prp, could be more effective because of its intrinsic characteristics in promoting the healing of intestinal anastomosis.
for each animal, a total of six anastomoses were performed: two were considered controls and received no treatment, while the remaining four anastomoses were treated with prp or prgf of which both were prepared at a platelet concentration that was respectively  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher than the original platelet count.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare the effects of prp and prgf on various parameters of anastomotic healing in a swine model.
