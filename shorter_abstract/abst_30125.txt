comparative analysis revealed that 5 % of the total lincrnas derived from both species are unique in each species.
in an attempt to identify long intergenic non-coding rnas  and their possible involvement in honey bee development and diseases, we analyzed rna-seq datasets generated from asian honey bee  and western honey bee .
our comparative digital gene expression analysis revealed a high degree of tissue-specific expression among the seven major tissues of honey bee, different from mrna expression patterns.
importantly, we identified  <dig> lincrnas that are specifically regulated upon viral infection in honey bees, and  <dig> of them appear to play roles during infection with various viruses.
this study provides the first comprehensive set of lincrnas for honey bees and opens the door to discover lincrnas associated with biological and hormone signaling pathways as well as various diseases of honey bee.

we identified  <dig> lincrnas with an average length of 1011 bp from a. cerana and  <dig> lincrnas with an average length of 790 bp in a. mellifera.
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  lincrnas showed tissue-dependent expression in a. mellifera and a. cerana, respectively, most preferentially in ovary and fat body tissues.
