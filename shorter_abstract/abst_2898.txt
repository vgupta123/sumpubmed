the fragment-based inhibitor design allows an important improvement in affinity of small molecules.
we have performed docking studies of pamoic acid, a  <dig> micromolar pol beta inhibitor, and found that it binds in a single pocket at the surface of the  <dig> kda domain of pol beta.
however, docking studies provided five possible conformations for pamoic acid in this site.
chemical shift mapping data confirmed pamoic acid binding site found by docking while noesy and saturation transfer experiments provided distances between pairs of protons from the pamoic acid and those of the  <dig> kda domain that allowed the identification of the correct conformation.
this model serves as the starting point for further structural studies aimed at improving the affinity of pamoic acid for binding to dna polymerase beta.
for this reason pol beta has become a therapeutic target.
combining nmr experiments on the complex with docking results allowed us to build a three-dimensional structural model.
dna polymerase beta , the error-prone dna polymerase of single-stranded dna break repair as well as base excision repair pathways, is overexpressed in several tumors and takes part in chemotherapeutic agent resistance, like that of cisplatin, through translesion synthesis.
