there was a significant effect of genotype  on the transcript abundance of dlk <dig>  peg <dig>  and meg <dig> in the muscles of lambs with the callipyge allele.
transcript abundance of dlk <dig> and peg <dig> was highest in paternal heterozygous animals and exhibited polar overdominant gene expression patterns; therefore, both genes are candidates for causing skeletal muscle hypertrophy.
there was unique relationship of peg <dig> and peg11as transcript abundance in the paternal heterozygous animals that suggests a rna interference mechanism may have a role in peg <dig> gene regulation and polar overdominance in callipyge sheep.
the mutation is a single a to g transition in an intergenic region that results in the increased expression of several genes within the imprinted cluster without changing their parent-of-origin allele-specific expression.
analysis of peg <dig> expression by quantitative pcr shows a 200-fold induction in the hypertrophied muscles of paternal heterozygous animals and a 13-fold induction in homozygous callipyge animals.
the callipyge mutation is located within an imprinted gene cluster on ovine chromosome  <dig>  the callipyge trait exhibits polar overdominant inheritance due to the fact that only heterozygotes inheriting a mutant paternal allele  have a phenotype of muscle hypertrophy, reduced fat and a more compact skeleton.
the effect of the callipyge mutation has been to alter the expression of dlk <dig>  gtl <dig>  peg <dig> and meg <dig> in the hypertrophied skeletal muscles.
peg <dig> transcripts were 14-fold more abundant than peg11as transcripts in the gluteus medius of paternal heterozygous animals.
peg11as transcripts were expressed at higher levels than peg <dig> transcripts in the gluteus medius of animals of the other three genotypes.
dlk <dig> and peg <dig> transcript levels were elevated in the hypertrophied muscles of paternal heterozygous animals relative to animals of the other three genotypes.
peg11as transcripts were detectable over a  <dig>  kb region beginning  <dig>  kb upstream of the peg <dig> start codon and spanning the entire open reading frame.
