dynamic modules are inferred from sets of snapshots of molecular simulations.
our inferred dynamic modules in the protein npc <dig> are also shown to match functional components of the protein related to the npc <dig> disease.
we propose a graph-theory approach with significance and power testing to identify modules in protein structures.
in the first step, clusters are determined by optimizing the partition that maximizes the modularity score.
evolutionary modules are identified by analyzing homologous structures.
we also analyzed the evolutionary modularity of a data set of Î±-amylase catalytic domain homologs, and the dynamic modularity of the niemann-pick c <dig>  protein n-terminal domain.
assessing protein modularity is important to understand protein evolution.
in this data set we identified four robust evolutionary modules, one of which forms the minimal functional tim barrel topology.
