through gene expression data, we verified the correctness of these additional integrations.
this paper introduces a new method batvi to predict viral integrations.
our method uses a fast screening method to filter out chimeric reads containing possible viral integrations.
batvi ran an order of magnitude faster and was able to predict almost twice the number of true positives compared to other methods while maintaining a false positive rate less than 1%.
the study of virus integrations in human genome is important since virus integrations were shown to be associated with diseases.
in the literature, few methods have been proposed that predict virus integrations using next generation sequencing datasets.
chimeric reads that are co-localized in the human genome are clustered.
