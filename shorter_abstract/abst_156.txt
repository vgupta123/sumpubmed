in this study, pregnant mice were exposed to ionizing radiation  to induce dna damage at different embryonic stages; the kinetics and mechanisms of the establishment of dna damage-mediated g <dig> checkpoint in embryonic liver were investigated.
the established g <dig> cell cycle checkpoint, in combination with an enhanced dna repair capacity at e <dig> , displayed biologically protective effects of repairing dna double-strand breaks  and reducing apoptosis in the short term as well as reducing chromosome deletion and breakage in the long term.
we found that the g <dig> cell cycle arrest was the first response to dna damage in early developmental stages.
during embryonic development, the characteristics of cell cycle and dna damage checkpoint evolve from an extremely short g <dig> cell phase and lacking g <dig> checkpoint to lengthening g <dig> phase and the establishment of the g <dig> checkpoint.
our study is the first to demonstrate the establishment of the dna damage-mediated g <dig> cell cycle checkpoint in liver cells during embryogenesis and its in vivo biological effects during embryonic liver development.
the dna damage-mediated cell cycle checkpoint is an essential mechanism in the dna damage response .
