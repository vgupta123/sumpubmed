in this study, we demonstrate the performances of filter papers for archiving rna from local pprv field isolates for further molecular detection and genotyping of pprv, at −70°c combined with ambient temperature, for periods up to 16 months.
the material was successfully sequenced and a bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction achieved adequate resolution to establish temporal relationships within or between the geographical clusters of the pprv strains.
ppr-suspected live animals were sampled and their blood and nasal swabs were applied on filter papers then air dried.
immediately after field sampling, rt-pcr amplifying a 448-bp fragment of the f gene appeared positive for both blood and nasal swabs when animals were in febrile stage and only nasal swabs were detected positive in non-febrile stage.
at 16 months, using real time rt-pcr adapted to amplify the n gene from filter paper, high viral loads could still be detected , essentially from nasal samples.
active surveillance of peste des petits ruminants  should ease prevention and control of this disease widely present across africa, middle east, central and southern asia.

it has been shown previously that whatman® 3mm filter paper  preserves the nucleic acid of pprv for at least 3 months at 32°c.
this clearly reveals the excellent capacity of filter papers to store genetic material that can be sampled using a non-invasive approach.
