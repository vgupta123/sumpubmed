we report results from a large secondary control study of  <dig> exomes probing the pathogenicity of the above genes.

we verified de novo pathogenic single nucleotide variants  in arid1b c.1595delg and phf <dig> c.820c > t, potentially causative de novo two base indels in sqstm <dig> c.115_116delinsta and upf <dig> c.1576_1577delinsa, and de novo snvs in cacnb <dig> c.1289g > a, and spry <dig> c.508 t > a, of uncertain significance.
we also interrogated regulatory sequence variation for known and hypothesized id genes and present useful strategies for wgs data analyses for non-coding variation.
intellectual disability  is among the most common global disorders, yet etiology is unknown in ~30% of patients despite clinical assessment.

we analyzed structural variation by four different algorithms including de novo genome assembly.
whole genome sequencing  is able to interrogate the entire genome, providing potential to diagnose idiopathic patients.
the de novo assembly resulted in unmasking hidden genome instability that was missed by standard re-alignment based algorithms.
