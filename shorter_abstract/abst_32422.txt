it therefore has great potential to meet the challenges of the phylogenomic era and to deepen our understanding of the tree of life.
here we present a novel bioinformatics pipeline for downloading, formatting, filtering and analyzing public sequence data deposited in genbank.
within apocrita, our analysis suggests a topology of stephanoidea + )).
with this pipeline, it is possible to produce phylogenetic trees for any taxonomic group and to monitor new data and tree robustness in a taxon of interest.
it combines some well-established programs with numerous newly developed software tools .
data coverage is still extremely low, and additional data have to be collected to reliably infer the phylogeny of hymenoptera.
tree reconstruction was done with a partitioned maximum likelihood analysis from a supermatrix with more than  <dig>  sites and more than  <dig>  species.
despite the huge amount of data, we identified several persistent problems in the hymenoptera tree.
we used the bioinformatics pipeline to investigate the phylogeny of the megadiverse insect order hymenoptera  by retrieving and processing more than  <dig>  sequences and by selecting subsets under the criteria of compositional homogeneity and defined levels of density and overlap.
while we applied our bioinformatics pipeline to hymenoptera, we designed the approach to be as general as possible.
there is high and widespread interest in using these data for phylogenetic analyses.
