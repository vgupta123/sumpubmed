as a case study, we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of six s. cerevisiae strains in two different key steps of the fermentation process.
by comparing the results obtained using ora with previous studies and with the transcriptome structure determined with other software, it was proven that ora has a remarkable reliability.
it can also determine the size and the position of the untranslated regions  and of polycistronic transcripts.
rna-seq studies have an important role for both large-scale analysis of gene expression and for transcriptome reconstruction.
the results obtained from the training set made it possible to detect the presence of transcripts with variable utrs between s. cerevisiae strains.
by extending the transcriptome analysis to yeast species belonging to the saccharomyces genus, it was possible to examine the conservation level of unknown non-coding rnas and their putative functional role.
finally, we propose a regulatory role for some non-coding transcripts conserved within the saccharomyces genus and localized in the antisense strand to genes involved in meiosis and cell wall biosynthesis.
however, the lack of software specifically developed for the analysis of the transcriptome structure in lower eukaryotes, has so far limited the comparative studies among different species and strains.
this comparative analysis revealed differences in the utr regions of transcripts.
this software allows a simple and reliable analysis of the transcriptome structure in organisms with a low number of introns.
