source code and documentation are available at https://github.com/misshie/bioruby-ucsc-api/ under the ruby license.
here, we present the ruby ucsc api, a library to access the ucsc genome database using ruby.
the current version of the api supports databases of all organisms in the ucsc genome database including human, mammals, vertebrates, deuterostomes, insects, nematodes, and yeast.
assisted by the straightforward object-oriented design of ruby and activerecord, the ruby ucsc api will facilitate biologists to query the ucsc genome database programmatically.
the api is implemented in pure ruby and is therefore available in different environments and with different ruby interpreters .
the api also supports genomic sequence queries using locally downloaded *.2bit files that are not stored in the official mysql database.
the api uses the bin index—if available—when querying for genomic intervals.
