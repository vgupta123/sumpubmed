because available vaccines confer a low protection rate and short-lived immunity, the rapid diagnosis of infected animals combined with traditional curbing measures is seen as the best way to control the disease.
while traditional labour-intensive bacteriological methods for the detection of m. mycoides subsp.
we present a rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for m. mycoides subsp.
the lamp assay detects m. mycoides subsp.
the cbpp lamp developed in a robust kit format can be run on a battery-driven mobile device to rapidly detect m. mycoides subsp.
the disease, caused by infection with mycoplasma mycoides subsp.
contagious bovine pleuropneumonia  is the most important chronic pulmonary disease of cattle on the african continent causing severe economic losses.
a photometric detection of lamp products allows the real-time visualisation of the amplification curve and the application of a melting curve/re-association analysis presents a means of quality assurance based on the predetermined strand-inherent temperature profile supporting the diagnosis.
mycoides dna directly from crude samples of pulmonary/pleural fluids and serum/plasma within an hour using a simple dilution protocol.
