we have developed a technique based on double staining of the dna with a minor groove binding ) and a base pair intercalating  or sybr green) fluorescent stain and color deconvolution.
on this foundation we have developed a demonstrative analysis tool capable of measuring kinetoplast and nucleus dna content, size and position and cell body shape, length and width automatically.
this allows the identification of kinetoplast and nuclear dna in the micrograph based on whether the organelle has dna with a more a-t or g-c rich composition.
accurate identification and quantitation of the dna content of these organelles is a central requirement of any automated analysis method.
our approach to dna staining and automated quantitative analysis of trypanosomatid morphology accelerated analysis of trypanosomatid protozoa.
following unambiguous identification of the kinetoplasts and nuclei the resulting images are amenable to quantitative automated analysis of kinetoplast and nucleus number and dna content.
the complete data set from each cell and all analysis parameters used can be recorded ensuring repeatability and allowing complete data archiving and reanalysis.
automated analysis of t. brucei morphology was of comparable quality to manual analysis while being faster and less susceptible to experimentalist bias.
the well defined morphology and precisely choreographed division of trypanosomatid cells makes morphological analysis a powerful tool for analyzing the effect of mutations, chemical insults and changes between lifecycle stages.
trypanosomatid cells have two large dna-containing organelles, the kinetoplast  and nucleus, which provide useful markers for morphometric analysis; however they need to be accurately identified and often lie in close proximity.
