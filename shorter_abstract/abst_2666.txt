upon a longer arsenic exposure, a broad metabolic response was induced.
the early response was characterized by arsenic resistance, oxidative stress, chaperone synthesis and sulfur metabolism.
in particular our previous studies have suggested the existence of a temporal induction of arsenite oxidase, a key enzyme in arsenic metabolism, in the presence of as.
the major metabolic changes were confirmed by chemical, transcriptional, physiological and biochemical experiments.
the late response was characterized by arsenic metabolism and associated mechanisms such as phosphate transport and motility.
herminiimonas arsenicoxydans, a bacterium isolated from arsenic contaminated sludge, has acquired remarkable capabilities to cope with arsenic.
transcriptome kinetic analysis demonstrated the existence of two phases in arsenic response.
these early and late responses were defined as general stress response and specific response to as, respectively.
the expression of approximatively 14% of the whole genome was significantly affected by an as early stress and 4% by an as late exposure.
