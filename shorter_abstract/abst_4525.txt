deciphering regulatory rules between cooperative tfs is a critical step towards understanding the mechanisms of combinatorial regulation.
we present here a bayesian network approach called gbnet to search for dna motifs that may be cooperative in transcriptional regulation and the sequence constraints that these motifs may satisfy.
we thus conclude that gbnet is a useful tool for deciphering the "grammar" of transcriptional regulation.
combinatorial regulation of transcription factors  is important in determining the complex gene expression patterns particularly in higher organisms.
we also demonstrated the usefulness of gbnet on learning regulatory rules between yy <dig>  a human tf, and its co-factors.
