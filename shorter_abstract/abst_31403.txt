growing evidence suggests that mps present in peripheral blood and body fluids contribute to the development and progression of cancer, and are of pathophysiological relevance for autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious, cardiovascular, hematological, and other diseases.
mps are a heterogeneous population of cell-derived vesicles, with sizes ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> nm.
the present review summarizes current knowledge about microparticles  and provides a systematic overview of last  <dig> years of research on circulating mps, with particular focus on their clinical relevance.
