even the small variance in frequencies revealed statistically significant differences concerning the number and type of language errors.
stimulation with  <dig> hz evoked a higher number of all occurred language errors in all language tasks  vs. 12% ; pseudoword reading 4%  vs. 3% ; verb generation 13%  vs. 11% ; action naming 11%  vs. 9% ), whereas  <dig> hz evoked specifically more total speech arrests.
we furthermore investigated differences between both frequencies in case of performance of four different language tasks: object naming, pseudoword reading, verb generation, and action naming.

these findings suggest that the stimulation frequency has to be adapted to the aim of the rtms language investigation.
