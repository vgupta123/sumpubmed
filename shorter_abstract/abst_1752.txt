there is increasing evidence that micrornas  regulate translation of messenger rnas  during lung organogenesis.
this abnormal lung development is accompanied by significant increases in the levels of multiple mirnas and corresponding decreases in the levels of predicted mrna targets, many of which have known or suspected roles in pathways altered in bpd.
mir- <dig> was prominently increased in the lungs of hyperoxic mice, and several predicted mrna targets of mir- <dig> were validated with real-time pcr, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
in newborn mice, prolonged hyperoxia induces an arrest of alveolar development similar to that seen in human neonates with bpd.
gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis revealed that hyperoxia modulated genes involved in a variety of lung developmental processes, including cell cycle, cell adhesion, mobility and taxis, inflammation, and angiogenesis.
direct mir- <dig> targets were further validated in vitro using bronchoalveolar stem cells.
following exposure of neonatal mice to 80% o <dig> or room air  for either  <dig> or 29â€‰days, lungs of hyperoxic mice displayed histological changes consistent with bpd.
these data support the hypothesis that dynamic regulation of mirnas plays a prominent role in the pathophysiology of bpd.
bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic lung disease of premature neonates characterized by arrested pulmonary alveolar development.
