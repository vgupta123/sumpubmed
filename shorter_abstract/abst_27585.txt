the addition of bae to le-containing immunogenic preparations, adsorbed or not to al <dig>  clearly promoted the in vitro production of interferon Î³ , a major th1-dependent cytokine, and not of interleukin  <dig> , by le-stimulated splenocytes of immunized balb/c mice.
based on the results described above, bae, or biologically active molecules purified from it, should be further investigated as a possible adjuvant, in association or not with aluminium compounds, for the preferential induction of th1-dependent immune responses against different antigens in distinct murine strains and animal species.
in the present work, the possibility that bae can promote th <dig> immune responses in mice of a th <dig> immune response-prone strain - the balb/c was investigated.
the aqueous extract of a brazilian palm-tree fruit - the babassu -  exerts a clear immunostimulative activity in vivo.
no differences in il- <dig>  levels in the supernatants of splenocytes from mice that were injected with bae, in relation to splenocytes from control mice, were observed.
the spontaneous ex vivo production of no by splenocytes of mice that had been injected with bae was significantly higher than the production of no by splenocytes of control mice.
