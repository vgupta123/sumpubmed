some targets of gc regulation in chondrogenesis are known, but the global effects of pharmacological gc doses on chondrocyte gene expression have not been comprehensively evaluated.
in contrast, a subset of growth factors and cytokines were negatively correlated with dex treatment.
in addition, comparison of our data with microarray studies of dex treatment in other cell types demonstrated that the majority of dex effects are tissue-specific.
together, these results provide insight into the mechanisms and major molecular classes functioning downstream of dex in primary chondrocytes.
we identified the glucocorticoid receptor  as a potential regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy in a microarray screen of primary limb bud mesenchyme micromass cultures.
comparing dex-induced gene expression data to developmental changes in gene expression in micromass cultures revealed an additional layer of complexity in which dex maintains the expression of certain chondrocyte marker genes while inhibiting factors that promote vascularization and ultimately ossification of the cartilaginous template.
while useful in clinical practice, patients taking gcs often suffer from skeletal side effects including growth retardation in children and adolescents, and decreased bone quality in adults.
