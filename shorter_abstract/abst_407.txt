the luminex assay recognised all tested brucella species with ‘smooth’ lps with detection limits of 2 ×  <dig> to 8 ×  <dig> cells per ml, depending on the species tested.
most mabs recognised both b. melitensis and b. abortus and antigen binding was not impeded by inactivation of the bacterial cells by γ irradiation, formalin or heat treatment, a step required to analyse the samples immunologically under biosafety level two conditions.
goats/sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, sheep and rodents are infected by b. melitensis, b. abortus, b. suis, b. canis, b. ovis and b. neotomae, respectively, the six classical brucella species.
mabs specific for the lps o-antigen of brucella spp.
milk samples spiked with brucella spp.
in addition, the bead-based immunoassay was integrated into a multiplex format, allowing for simultaneous, rapid and specific detection of brucella spp., bacillus anthracis, francisella tularensis and yersinia pestis within a single sample.
overall, the robust luminex assay should allow detection of brucella spp.
the combination of mabs most suitable for an antigen capture assay format was identified and an immunoassay using the luminex xmap technology was developed.
to complement molecular detection systems for potential bioterror agents, as required by international biodefense regulations, sets of mabs were generated by b cell hybridoma technology and used to develop immunological assays.
most human cases are caused by b. melitensis and b. abortus.
were generated by immunising mice with inactivated b. melitensis or b. abortus cells.
in both natural outbreak and bio-threat situations.
cells were identified successfully using the luminex assay.
