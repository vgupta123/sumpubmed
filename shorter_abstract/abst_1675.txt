because dna methylation patterns are tissue and cell type specific, the detection of differentially methylated regions  with small effect size is a necessary feature of tiling microarray ‘peak’ finding algorithms, as cellular heterogeneity within a studied tissue may lead to a dilution of the phenotypically relevant effects.
the application of biotile to non-smoothed data allows for the identification of shorter length and smaller effect-size ders, while correcting for probe specific variation by inversely weighting on probe variance through a permutation corrected meta-analysis procedure employed at identified regions.
genome-wide tiling array experiments are increasingly used for the analysis of dna methylation.
biotile represents an easy to use analysis option applicable to multiple microarray platforms, allowing for its integration into the analysis workflow of array data analysis.
we present a free open-source perl application, binding intensity only tile array analysis or “biotile”, for the identification of differentially enriched regions  in tiling array data.
