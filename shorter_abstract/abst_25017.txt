finally, we show that thermodynamic stability of the site is important for its editing.
surprisingly, we find that interior loops, and especially the nucleotides at their edges, are more likely to be edited than helices.
several studies have identified weak sequence motifs characterizing the editing sites, but these alone do not account for the large diversity observed.
in addition, the sequence motifs characterizing editing sites vary with the micro-structure.
analysis of a large dataset of editing events reveals more information on sequence and structural motifs characterizing the a-to-i editing process
alu repeats in the human transcriptome undergo massive adenosine to inosine rna editing.
we focus on structural aspects, studying the double-stranded rna structure of the alu repeats, and show the editing frequency of a given site to depend strongly on the micro-structure it resides in.
