over the last decades, a vast structural knowledge has been gathered on the hiv- <dig> protease .
yet, the structural impact of this substitution on the pr structure and on the interaction with natural substrates remains poorly documented.
herein, we used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the role of this polymorphism on the interaction of pr with six of its natural cleavage-sites substrates.
the only exceptions were the rt-rh, with equivalent affinity, and the rh-in, for which an increased affinity was found.
however, in developing countries, there is a wide variety of hiv- <dig> subtypes carrying pr polymorphisms related to reduced drug susceptibility.
free energy analyses by mmpb/sa calculations showed an affinity decrease of m36i-pr for the majority of its substrates.
