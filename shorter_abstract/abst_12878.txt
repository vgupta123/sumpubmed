this procedure should be applicable to a wider variety of bacs containing lox sites flanking the genomic dna insert, including those with sequence repeats.
the procedure enables rapid generation of a large collection of bacs ready for transgenesis with the itol <dig> cassette at the new end of a progressively truncated genomic insert via lox-cre recombination.
tol <dig> ends, in the inverted orientation and flanking a  <dig> kb spacer dna , were introduced into the bac dna within the bacterial host using recombination of homologous sequences.
the new technology described here can rapidly introduce itol <dig> ends at a bac end of choice, and simultaneously generate a large collection of bacs with progressive deletions of the genomic dna from that end in a single experiment.
we constructed ptnloxp-itol2kan and ptnlox511-itol2kan to introduce the loxp or lox <dig> site and itol <dig> cassette, containing the tol <dig> cis-sequences in the inverted orientation, into bacs that have loxp and lox <dig> sites flanking genomic dna inserts by tn10-mediated transposition.
