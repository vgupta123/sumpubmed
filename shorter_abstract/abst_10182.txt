pooled hesc lines were profiled to obtain a comprehensive list of genes common to human es cells.
expression of previously identified es cell markers was confirmed and multiple genes not known to be expressed by es cells were identified by comparing with public sage databases, est libraries and parallel analysis by microarray and rt-pcr.
overall, our analysis provides a molecular signature of genes expressed by undifferentiated es cells that can be used to monitor the state of es cells isolated by different laboratories using independent methods and maintained under differing culture conditions
massively parallel signature sequencing  of approximately three million signature tags  identified close to eleven thousand unique transcripts, of which approximately 25% were uncharacterised or novel genes.
chromosomal mapping of expressed genes failed to identify major hotspots and confirmed expression of genes that map to the x and y chromosome.
