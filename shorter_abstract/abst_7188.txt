proteins belonging to the agenet/tudor domain family are known as histone modification “readers” and classified as chromatin remodeling proteins.
protein interactions were tested in two-hybrid, gst pulldown, semi-in vivo pulldown and tandem affinity purification assays.
aip <dig> is expressed in reproductive tissues and its down-regulation delays flower development timing.
dna replication and transcription are dynamic processes regulating plant development that are dependent on the chromatin accessibility.
in the present work we analyzed the family of agenet/tudor domain proteins in the plant kingdom and we mapped the organization of this family throughout plant evolution.
it is clear that members of the agenet/tudor family are important regulators of development playing roles not well known in plants.
bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses of the agenet/tudor family domain in the plant kingdom were carried out with sequences from available complete genomes databases.
aip <dig> is a novel agenet/tudor domain protein in plants that could act as a link between dna replication, transcription and chromatin remodeling during flower development.
aip <dig> interacts with abap <dig>  a plant regulator of dna replication licensing and gene transcription, with a plant histone modification “reader”  and with non modified histones.
histone modifications and chromatin remodeling have profound effects on gene expression as well as on dna replication, but how these processes are integrated has not been completely elucidated.
3d structure predictions of agenet/tudor domains were calculated by i-tasser server.
also, expression of abap <dig> and lhp <dig> target genes were repressed in flower buds of plants with reduced levels of aip <dig>
