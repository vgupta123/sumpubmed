however, relatively little is known about the regulation of the enzymatic activity of pcaf.
the results of maltose binding protein -pulldown, co-immunoprecipitation and multiangle static light scattering experiments further indicated that pcaf dimeric state is detectable and may possibly exist in vivo.
our chemical cross-linking experiments in combined with site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the pcaf hat domain mainly forms a dimer in solution through one of the observed interfaces.
taken together, our structural and biochemical studies indicate that pcaf appears to be a dimer in its functional atac complex.
