ik <dig> is localized to the anterior ring of the oocyte and to punctate structures in the nurse cells together with spn-f protein, and both proteins are mutually required for their localization.
we showed that ik <dig> phosphorylates spn-f and demonstrated that this phosphorylation does not lead to spn-f degradation.
since spn-f mutants display oocyte defects similar to those of ik <dig> mutant, we decided to investigate whether spn-f could be a direct regulatory target of ik <dig>
we conclude that ik <dig> and spn-f form a complex, which regulates cytoskeleton organization during drosophila oogenesis and in which spn-f is the direct regulatory target for ik <dig>  interestingly, ik <dig> in this complex does not function as a typical ikk in that it does not direct spnf for degradation following phosphorylation.
the drosophila genome encodes two members of the ikk family.
we found that ik <dig> binds physically to spn-f, biomolecular interaction analysis of spn-f and ik <dig> demonstrating that both proteins bind directly and form a complex.
instead, recent findings indicate that ik <dig> regulates f-actin assembly by mediating the function of nonapoptotic caspases via degradation of diap <dig>  also, it has been suggested that ik <dig> regulates interactions between the minus ends of the microtubules and the actin-rich cortex in the oocyte.
