interestingly, the presence of physiological levels of androgen or other ar agonists inhibits these effects.
these observations are consistent with the nuclear co-localization of the ar and β-catenin shown by immunohistochemistry in human prostate cancer samples.
transient transfections of several human prostate cancer cell lines with the ar and multiple components of the wnt signaling pathway demonstrate that the ar overexpression can potentiate the transcriptional activities of wnt/β-catenin signaling.
in addition, the simultaneous activation of the wnt signaling pathway and overexpression of the ar promote prostate cancer cell growth and transformation at castration levels of androgens.
a crucial event in prostate cancer progression is the conversion from a hormone-sensitive to a hormone-refractory disease state.
these results suggest that the ar is promoting wnt signaling at the chromatin level.
our findings suggest that the ar signaling through the wnt/β-catenin pathway should be added to the well established functional interactions between both pathways.
furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that wnt3a can recruit the ar to the promoter regions of myc and cyclin d <dig>  which are well-characterized downstream targets of the wnt signalling pathway.
β-catenin, an essential component of the canonical wnt signaling pathway, was shown to be a coactivator of the ar signaling in the presence of androgens.
moreover, our data show that via this interaction the ar could promote prostate cell malignancy in a ligand-independent manner.
the same assays demonstrated that the ar and β-catenin can be recruited to the promoter and enhancer regions of a known ar target gene psa upon wnt signaling.
