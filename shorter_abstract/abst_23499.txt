we mined  <dig>  interspecific polymorphisms between solanum lycopersicum and s. habrochaites or s. pennellii and  <dig>  intraspecific polymorphisms within s. lycopersicum.
finally, we developed a set of more than  <dig>  between-species molecular markers optimized by sequence quality and predicted intron position.
tomato species are of significant agricultural and ecological interest, with cultivated tomato being among the most common vegetable crops grown.
wild tomato species are native to diverse habitats in south america and show great morphological and ecological diversity that has proven useful in breeding programs.
however, relatively little is known about nucleotide diversity between tomato species.
this database holds sequences from several species, annotated with quality values, assembled into unigenes, and tested for homology against other genomes.
experimental validation of  <dig> of these molecular markers resulted in confirmation of  <dig> polymorphisms.
