protostome stomatin, as well as a newly reported arthropod subfamily slipin- <dig>  are restricted to invertebrate groups, whilst slipin- <dig>  is present in nematodes and higher metazoa.
since then, a number of stomatin-like proteins have been identified in all three domains of life.
stomatin-like proteins have their origin in an ancient duplication event that occurred early on in the evolution of prokaryotes.
in vertebrates, the stomatin family expanded considerably, with at least two duplication events giving rise to podocin and slipin- <dig> subfamilies , with the retained ancestral sequence giving rise to vertebrate stomatin.
by constructing a phylogeny of this family, we have identified and named a number of orthologous groups: these can now be used to infer function of stomatin subfamilies in a meaningful way.
the other prokaryotic subfamily gave rise to the ancestor of the remaining seven eukaryotic subfamilies.
within prokaryotes there are two distinct subfamilies that account for the two different origins of the eight eukaryotic stomatin subfamilies, one of which gave rise to eukaryotic slp- <dig>  renamed here "paraslipin".
we have constructed a comprehensive phylogeny of all 'stomatin-like' sequences that share a  <dig> amino acid domain.
we show these proteins comprise an ancient family that arose early in prokaryotic evolution, and we propose a new nomenclature that reflects their phylogeny, based on the name "slipin" .
