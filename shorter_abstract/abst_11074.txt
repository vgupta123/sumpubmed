a crucial feature of the algorithm is its ability to simulate both intra- and inter-metabolite correlations, the analysis of which is fundamental to many techniques in the field.
a major technique for capturing metabolite data is 1h-nmr spectroscopy and this yields highly complex profiles that require sophisticated statistical analysis methods.
further, metassimulo is able to simulate shifts in nmr peak positions that result from matrix effects such as ph differences which are often observed in metabolic nmr spectra and pose serious challenges for statistical algorithms.
probing the complex fusion of genetic and environmental interactions, metabolic profiling , the study of small molecules involved in metabolic reactions, is a rapidly expanding 'omics' field.
drawing data from a metabolite standard spectral database in conjunction with concentration information input by the user or constructed automatically from the human metabolome database, metassimulo is able to create realistic metabolic profiles containing large numbers of metabolites with a range of user-defined properties.
current features include the simulation of two groups  specified by means and standard deviations of concentrations for each metabolite.
