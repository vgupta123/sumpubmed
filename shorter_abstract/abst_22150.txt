new computational techniques can be added to the sbrt via process plug-ins, providing a high degree of evolvability and a unifying framework for software development in systems biology.
we introduce a free, easy-to-use, open-source, integrated software platform called the systems biology research tool  to facilitate the computational aspects of systems biology.
the sbrt currently performs  <dig> methods for analyzing stoichiometric networks and  <dig> methods from fields such as graph theory, geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.
this software can be used to make sophisticated computational techniques accessible to everyone , to facilitate cooperation among researchers, and to expedite progress in the field of systems biology.
software must also be used to implement mathematical models and algorithms required for simulation and theoretical predictions on the system-level.
research in the field of systems biology requires software for a variety of purposes.
the systems biology research tool represents a technological advance for systems biology.
