the remaining gene groups involved in biofilm formation were down-regulated, including quorum sensing, secretion systems, and the csu operon.
taken together, the results of the present study provide a foundation for future studies of the network systems associated with carbapenem resistance.
the antibiotic resistance determinants, including rnd efflux transporters and multidrug resistance pumps, were over-expressed in response to ipm-2 m selection, followed by a decrease in response to ipm-8 m selection.
the three gene groups involved in dna recombination were up-regulated, including recombinase, transposase and dna repair, and beta-lactamase oxa- <dig> and homologous recombination.
to identify the genes involved in carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii, the transcriptomic responses of the completely sequenced strain atcc  <dig> selected with  <dig>  mg/l  and 2 mg/l  imipenem were investigated using rna-sequencing to identify differences in the gene expression patterns.
the expression of blaoxa- <dig> in ipm-2 m and ipm-8 m cells was positively correlated with the rate of imipenem hydrolysis, as demonstrated through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, suggesting that blaoxa- <dig> plays a critical role in conferring carbapenem resistance.
in addition, a. baumannii shows an inverse relationship between carbapenem resistance and biofilm production.
gene recombination and blaoxa- <dig> play critical roles in carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii.
