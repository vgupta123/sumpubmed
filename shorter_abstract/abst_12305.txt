in spite of the widely recognized importance of g-quadruplex structures in gene regulation and growing interest around this unusual dna structure, there are at present only few such structures available in the nucleic acid database.
in the present work we generate by molecular modeling feasible g-quadruplex structures which may be useful for interpretation of experimental data.
since all molecular models are generated by fragments coming from observed quadruplex structures, molecular models are in principle reliable and may be used for interpretation of experimental data.
molecular models have been generated for a large number of g3xn1g3xn2g3xn3g <dig> sequences.
we have used all quadruplex dna structures deposited in the nucleic acid database in order to select a list of fragments entailing a strand of three adjacent g's paired with another strand of three adjacent g's separated by a loop of one to four residues.
for a given sequence not all topologies are possible with the available repertoire of fragments due to steric hindrance and low superimposability.
