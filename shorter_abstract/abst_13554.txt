this is the fifth pd locus to be mapped to the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  it is flanked by s1pr <dig> and olfm <dig> genes, and is 200Â kb from a multiple sclerosis susceptibility gene.
this demonstrates that by stratifying on a key variable the power gained due to diminished heterogeneity can sometimes outweigh the power lost to reduced sample size.
in the mapt region, virtually every single nucleotide polymorphism  had a stronger effect-size and lower p-value in familial-pd  than in sporadic-pd .
we used presence/absence of family history to subdivide the cases and performed genome-wide association studies  in sporadic-pd and familial-pd separately.
employing gwas on the neurogenetics research consortium  dataset stratified by family history , we identified a novel locus on chromosome 1p <dig> in sporadic-pd  and replicated the finding  in  <dig> sporadic-pd and  <dig> controls from the national institutes of neurologic disease and stroke  repository.
we also detected distinct patterns of disease associations for previously established pd susceptibility genes, which gives an insight to the genetic architecture of the disease and could aid in the selection of appropriate study population for future studies.
the numerous susceptibility loci that have been identified reaffirm the complexity of pd but do not fully explain it; e.g., it is not known if any given pd susceptibility gene is associated with all pd or a disease subtype.
the aim was to uncover new genes and gain insight into the genetic architecture of pd.
we discovered and replicated a new locus for sporadic-pd which had escaped detection in un-stratified gwas.
