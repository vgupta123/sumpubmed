the validity of the protocol was demonstrated by means of the study of six genes of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.
finally we also used plasmids for the construction of standard curves.

no correlations were found between flower colour and the individual expression profiles.
this allowed us to differentiate between flower colours in a broader genetic background as was done so far in flower colour studies.
currently in plant research, validated and qualitative rt-qpcr protocols are still rare.
flower colour variation is one of the most crucial selection criteria in the breeding of a flowering pot plant, as is also the case for azalea .
in azalea, flower colour can be described by means of a 3-gene model.
the last decade gene expression studies have been implemented widely for studying flower colour.
we aimed to develop an accurate protocol for rt-qpcr and to validate the protocol to study flower colour in an azalea mapping population.
we have been able to correlate flower colour to the combined regulation of structural genes, both in the early and late branch of the pathway.
in spite of the limited sequence information available, we prepared a set of  <dig> reference genes which was validated in flower petals; a combination of three reference genes was most optimal.
rna quality was evaluated in a combined approach by means of different techniques e.g.
the protocol in this study can be implemented on all plant species to assure accurate quantification of gene expression.
however, the combination of early pathway genes  is clearly related to co-pigmentation with flavonols.
the late pathway genes dfr and ans are to a minor extent involved in differentiating between coloured and white flowers.
