the 2% of the probe sets with the highest signals that were normally excluded from sf calculation accounted for 34% to 54% of the total signals .
eliminating 40% of the signal data during sf calculation failed to show any benefit.
in comparison with normalization factors obtained from the median signal or from the mean of the log transformed signal, sf showed the greatest variation.
normalization is an important step for microarray data analysis to minimize biological and technical variations.
among the  <dig> u34a genechip experiments, the total signals on each array showed  <dig> % variations in terms of the coefficient of variation, although all microarrays were hybridized with the same amount of biotin-labeled crna.
the normalization factors obtained from log transformed signals showed least variation.
normalization factors obtained with log transformed signals performed the best.
