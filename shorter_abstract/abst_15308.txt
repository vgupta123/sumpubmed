type b histone acetyltransferases, originally defined as cytoplasmic enzymes that acetylate free histones, have been proposed to play a role in the assembly of chromatin through the acetylation of newly synthesized histones h <dig> and h <dig>  to date, the only type b histone acetyltransferase activities identified are specific for histone h <dig>
histone acetyltransferases can be classified into two distinct groups  on the basis of cellular localization and substrate specificity.
to better understand the role of histone acetylation in the assembly of chromatin structure, we have identified additional type b histone acetyltransferase activities specific for histone h <dig>  one such activity, termed hatb <dig> , acetylated histone h <dig> with a strong preference for free histones relative to chromatin substrates.
yeast extracts contain several histone acetyltransferase activities that show a strong preference for free histone h <dig>  one such activity, termed hatb <dig> , appears to be a novel gcn5p-containing complex which does not depend on the presence of ada2p.
the acetylation of the core histone nh2-terminal tails is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases.
