these conserved regions contain putative binding sites for a large number of known transcription factor families, including several that have been implicated previously in sex determination and early gonadal development.
sry is the pivotal gene initiating male sex determination in most mammals, but how its expression is regulated is still not understood.
our results reveal potentially important sry regulatory elements, mutations in which might underlie cases of idiopathic human xy sex reversal.
