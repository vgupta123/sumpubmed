a new approach to detect homolog clusters of secretome proteins  was designed by integrating protein subcellular location prediction and homology clustering methods.
a comprehensive and user-friendly database lab-secretome was constructed to store, visualize and update the extracellular proteins and lacogs http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/lab_secretome/.
a genome-scale comparative study of these proteins  can provide vast information towards the understanding of the molecular evolution, diversity, function and adaptation of lab to their specific environmental niches.
in lactic acid bacteria , the extracellular and surface-associated proteins can be involved in processes such as cell wall metabolism, degradation and uptake of nutrients, communication and binding to substrates or hosts.
the lab-secretome database could be used to understand the evolution and adaptation of lactic acid bacteria to their environmental niches, to improve protein functional annotation and to serve as basis for targeted experimental studies.
we have performed an extensive prediction and comparison of the secretomes from  <dig> sequenced lab genomes.
this database will be updated regularly when new bacterial genomes become available.
the initial clusters were further adjusted semi-manually based on multiple sequence alignments, domain compositions, pseudogene analysis and biological function of the proteins.
comparative analysis of protein subfamilies has shown that the distribution and functional specificity of lacogs could be used to explain many niche-specific phenotypes.
