hāpuku  is a member of the wreckfish family  and is highly regarded as a food fish.
comparative genomic analyses indicated that many of the linkage groups within the p. oxygeneios map share a relatively high degree of homology with those published for the european seabass .
however, they can take over 5 years to reach sexual maturity in captivity and are not externally sexually dimorphic, complicating many aspects of broodstock management.
although adults grow relatively slowly, juveniles exhibit low feed conversion ratios and can reach market size in 1– <dig> years, making p. oxygeneios a strong candidate for aquaculture.
the high degree of synteny observed with d. labrax should aid further molecular genetic study and exploitation of hāpuku as a food fish.
evaluation of allele-specific pcr assays, based on the two snp markers most closely associated with phenotypic sex, indicates that a simple molecular assay for sexing p. oxygeneios should be readily attainable.
two runs on an illumina miseq platform generated  <dig> , <dig> raw reads, identifying  <dig>  rad loci.
understanding the sex determination system of p. oxygeneios and developing accurate assays to assign genetic sex will contribute significantly towards its full-scale commercialisation.
dna from parents and sexed offspring  from a single family of captive bred p. oxygeneios was used as a template for double digestion restriction-site associated dna  sequencing.
p. oxygeneios has an xx/xy sex determination system.
a single major sex-determining locus, found to be heterogametic in males, was mapped to linkage group  <dig>  several markers were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with the sex-determining locus.
a combined sex linkage map  was constructed based on  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers that resolved into  <dig> linkage groups.
