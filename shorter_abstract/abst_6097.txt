immunoglobulin a  has been implicated in resistance to mucosal infections by pathogens.
the availability of an iga monoclonal antibody  immunoreactive to trichomonads by whole cell -elisa prompted us to characterize the iga-reactive protein of t. vaginalis.
an iga mab called 6b <dig> was isolated from a library of mabs reactive to surface proteins of t. vaginalis.
southern analysis revealed the gene  of t. vaginalis to be single copy.
this is the first report of a t. vaginalis gene  encoding a surface protein  reactive with an iga mab, and both gene and protein were conserved in human and bovine trichomonads.
tv <dig> is another member of t. vaginalis genes that are regulated by at least two independent signaling mechanisms involving iron and contact with vecs.
the tv <dig> gene was down-regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels in iron-depleted trichomonads as well as in parasites after contact with immortalized ms- <dig> vaginal epithelial cells .
immunofluorescence on non-permeabilized organisms confirmed surface localization of tv <dig>  and the intensity of fluorescence was reduced after parasite adherence to vecs.
the 6b <dig> mab recognized a 44-kda protein  by immunoblot analysis, and a full-length cdna clone encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids.
