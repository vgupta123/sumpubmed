we evaluate those pipelines on the basis of both simulation data and real count data.
as a result, the pipelines in the tcc package performed comparably to or better than other pipelines under various simulation scenarios.
however, those evaluations so far have been restricted to two-group comparisons.
we found considerably different numbers of identified degs  among the pipelines for the same real dataset but similar distributions of the classified expression patterns.
a number of methods have been developed for this task, and several evaluation studies have also been reported.
tcc implements a multi-step normalization strategy  that internally uses functions provided by other representative packages .
accumulations of comparative studies for multi-group data are also desired.
we also found that de results can roughly be estimated by the hierarchical dendrogram of sample clustering for the raw count data.
we compare  <dig> pipelines available in nine r packages for detecting differential expressions  from multi-group rna-seq count data, focusing on three-group data with or without replicates.
we confirmed the deges-based pipelines implemented in tcc performed well in a three-group comparison as well as a two-group comparison.
