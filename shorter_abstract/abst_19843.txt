we wished to explore the possibility that a carbocation intermediate is formed during the cleavage reaction of bcmo <dig>  as is seen for many isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes, and to determine which residues in the substrate binding cleft are necessary for catalytic and substrate binding activity.
our data are consistent with the formation of a substrate carbocation intermediate and cation-π stabilization of this intermediate by two aromatic residues in the substrate-binding cleft of bcmo <dig>
enzymatic activity was measured in vitro using his-tag purified proteins and in vivo in a β-carotene-accumulating e. coli system.
our ab initio model of bcmo <dig> with β-carotene mounted supports a mechanism involving cation-π stabilization by y <dig> and y <dig>
to test this hypothesis, we replaced substrate cleft aromatic and acidic residues by site-directed mutagenesis.
our assays show that mutation of either y <dig> or y <dig> to leucine  significantly impairs the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
mutations of two other aromatic residues in the binding cleft of bcmo <dig>  f <dig> and w <dig>  to either another aromatic residue or to leucine do not influence the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
