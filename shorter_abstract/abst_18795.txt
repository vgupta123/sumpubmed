computational simulations of mutation accumulation characterize a tradeoff between fast development and low mutation accumulation, and show that slow-cycling stem cells allow for an advantageous compromise to be reached.
experimental measurements of cell cycle lengths derived using a new, quantitative technique are consistent with these predictions.
stem cells are thought to play a critical role in minimizing the accumulation of mutations, but it is not clear which strategies they follow to fulfill that performance objective.
slow cycling of stem cells provides a simple strategy that can minimize cell pedigree depth and thereby minimize the accumulation of replication-dependent mutations.
this compromise is such that worm germ-line stem cells should cycle more slowly than their differentiating counterparts, but only by a modest amount.
our findings shed light both on design principles that underlie the role of stem cells in delaying aging and on evolutionary forces that shape stem-cell gene regulatory networks.
although the power of this strategy was recognized early on, a quantitative assessment of whether and how it is employed by biological systems is missing.
