we also observed that thalidomide arrests wound healing in presence and absence of nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion.
experiments targeting single tube structure with thalidomide, followed by nitric oxide treatment, show that the tube structures are insensitive to thalidomide and nitric oxide.
thalidomide effects on migration of, and actin polymerization in, ecv  <dig> cells were studied at the single cell level using live cell imaging techniques and probes to detect nitric oxide.
these observations suggest that thalidomide interferes with nitric oxide-induced migration of endothelial cells at the initial phase of angiogenesis before cells co-ordinate themselves to form organized tubes in endothelial cells and thereby inhibits angiogenesis.
thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent, which arrests angiogenesis.
to study the cellular mechanism of thalidomide-mediated blocking of angiogenesis triggered by nitric oxide, we used two endothelial cell based models: 1) wound healing and 2) tube formation using ecv  <dig>  an endothelial cell line.
the aim of present study is to understand the mechanistic aspects of thalidomide-mediated attenuation of angiogenesis induced by nitric oxide at the cellular level.
results demonstrate that thalidomide blocks nitric oxide-mediated angiogenesis in egg yolk model and also reduces the number of tubes formed in endothelial cell monolayers.
additionally, thalidomide promotes actin polymerization and antagonizes the formation of membrane extensions triggered by nitric oxide in endothelial cells.
thalidomide could block the formation of blood vessels both in absence and presence of nitric oxide.
thalidomide exerts inhibitory effects on nitric oxide-mediated angiogenesis by altering sub-cellular actin polymerization pattern, which leads to inhibition of endothelial cell migration.
