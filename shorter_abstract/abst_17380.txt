comparisons based on cyclical interaction distances between reaction pairs suggest that the modular organization of adipocyte metabolism is stable with respect to the inhibition of an enzyme, whereas a major physiological change such as cellular differentiation leads to a more substantial reorganization.
we develop a weighting scheme, based on metabolic flux data, to adjust the interaction distances in a reaction-centric graph model of a metabolic network.
graph-based modularity analysis has emerged as an important tool to study the functional organization of biological networks.
our analysis also identified cyclical interactions between reactions that are robust with respect to metabolic state, suggesting possible co-regulation.
taken together, our results support the notion that network modularity is influenced by both the connectivity of the networkâ€™s components as well as the relative engagements of the connections.
however, few methods are available to study state-dependent changes in network modularity using biological activity data.
the weighting scheme was combined with a hierarchical module assignment algorithm featuring the preservation of metabolic cycles to examine the effects of cellular differentiation and enzyme inhibitions on the functional organization of adipocyte metabolism.
our analysis found that the differences between various metabolic states primarily involved the assignment of two specific reactions in fatty acid synthesis and glycerogenesis.
