collectively, the results of this study provide interesting new insights into the pathology of pv.
our results reveal that dr <dig> and dr <dig> pv may initiate in the ecd and transmembrane region respectively, with implications for immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of this autoimmune disease.
pemphigus vulgaris  is a severe autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is strongly associated with major histocompatibility complex class ii alleles drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig>  the target antigen of pv, desmoglein  <dig> , is crucial for initiating t-cell response in early disease.
this is the first report illustrating high-level of cross-reactivity between both pv-implicated alleles, drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig>  as well as the existence of a potentially large number of t-cell epitopes throughout the entire dsg <dig> extracellular domain  and transmembrane region.
although a number of t-cell specificities within dsg <dig> have been reported, the number is limited and the role of t-cells in the pathogenesis of pv remains poorly understood.
we investigated the binding patterns of dsg <dig> peptides and illustrate the existence of multiple immunodominant epitopes that may be responsible for both disease initiation and propagation in pv.
further analysis reveals that drb1* <dig> and dqb1* <dig> may share similar specificities by binding peptides at different binding registers, thus providing a molecular mechanism for the dual hla association observed in pv.
high predictivity is obtained for both drb1* <dig>  and dqb1* <dig>  models, compared to experimental data.
