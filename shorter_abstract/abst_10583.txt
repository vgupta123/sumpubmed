distantly related proteins adopt and retain similar structural scaffolds despite length variations that could be as much as two-fold in some protein superfamilies.
in this paper, we describe an analysis of indel regions that accommodate length variations amongst related proteins.
such indels of different lengths even within a single protein domain superfamily could have structural and functional consequences that drive their selection, underlying their importance in similarity detection and computational modelling.
60% of additional lengths that occur in indels are short-length structures  while 6% of indels are >  <dig> residues in length.
further, we have used the method to characterize the length, structural type and biochemical features of indels in related protein domains.
structural types in indels also show class-specific trends.
the extent of length variation varies across different superfamilies and indels show class-specific trends for preferred lengths and structural types.
on a non-redundant dataset of  <dig> domain superfamily alignments from pass <dig>  we find that 'length- deviant' protein superfamilies show > 30% length variation from their average domain length.
we have developed an algorithm cusp, to examine multi-membered pass <dig> superfamily alignments to identify indel regions in an automated manner.
