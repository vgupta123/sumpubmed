the jukes-cantor and kimura correction methods were also tested, but were substantially less accurate.
we evaluated scoredist and a number of optimal matrix methods using three evolutionary models for both training and testing dayhoff, jones-taylor-thornton, and m√ºller-vingron, as well as whelan and goldman solely for testing.
a number of methods exist for estimating distances from sequence alignments, which often involves some sort of correction for multiple substitutions.
the evolutionary distance between two aligned sequences is here estimated as the evolutionary distance of the optimal matrix.
another problem is that the result may vary substantially depending on the evolutionary model used for the matrices.
an ideal distance estimator should produce consistent and accurate distances independent of the evolutionary model used.
