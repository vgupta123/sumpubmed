moreover, this computational strategy on the study of regulatory pathways should provide, along with transcriptomics and metabolomics, data to construct cellular metabolic networks.
we developed a computational analysis of promoter nucleotide sequences, to identify co-regulated genes by combining several programs that allowed us to build regulatory models and perform a crossed analysis on several databases.
most of the identified genes encode proteins with a cellular function and specificity in agreement with those of the corresponding ant isoform.
these models were screened using the full human genome and databases of promoter sequences from human and several other mammalian species.
the analysis of gene promoters is essential to understand the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation required under the effects of physiological processes, nutritional intake or pathologies.
in higher eukaryotes, transcriptional regulation implies the recruitment of a set of regulatory proteins that bind on combinations of nucleotide motifs.

each isoform has a specific tissue expression profile linked to its role in cellular bioenergetics.
from their promoter sequence and from the phylogenetic evolution of these ant genes in mammals, we constructed combinations of specific regulatory elements.
