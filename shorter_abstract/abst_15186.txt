microglia are resident mononuclear phagocytes of the brain that become activated in response to insults including neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease and prion disease.
in prion disease, microglial proliferation has been suggested to contribute to overall disease progression, however, in different mouse models of neurodegeneration, loss of cx3cr <dig> has been shown to either worsen or improve the phenotype depending on the paradigm.
to investigate the role of cx3cl1/cx3cr <dig> signalling in prion disease we infected cx3cr <dig> null mice with three different strains of prions.
our data suggest a protective role for cx3cl1/cx3cr <dig> cross-talk in prion disease.
following challenge with chandler/rml, me <dig> and mrc <dig> prion strains, cx3cr <dig> knockout mice showed highly significant reductions in incubation time.
in the central nervous system the chemokine cx3cl <dig>  is expressed by neurons and its exclusive receptor cx3cr <dig> is expressed solely on microglia.
