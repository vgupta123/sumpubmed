the subtle changes in a broad range of metabolites in vivo indicate that cpt1c does not play a significant or required role in fatty acid oxidation; however, it could play an alternative role in neuronal oxidative metabolism.
this constitutes a rate setting step for mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation by facilitating the initial step in acyl transfer to the mitochondrial matrix.
steady-state metabolomic analysis of cpt1c wt and ko mouse brains identified a small number of metabolites that differed between cpt1c wt and ko mice.
consistent with the notion that cpt1c is not involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation, there were no changes in metabolites associated with fatty acid oxidation.
cpt <dig> isoenzymes transfer long chain acyl groups to carnitine.
endocannabinoids were suppressed in the cpt1c ko, which may explain the suppression of food intake seen in cpt1c ko mice.
