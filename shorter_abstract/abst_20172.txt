while homology-based methods are useful, and work well for sequences with sequence identities above 50%, they fail for sequences in the twilight zone  of sequence identity.
our analysis included  <dig>  structures that belong to  <dig> unique families of the protein information resource superfamily system.
results of applying our approach to s-adenosyl-l-methionine  binding proteins are presented.
the ligand level included ligand conformations, ribose sugar puckering, and the identification of conserved ligand-atom interactions.
the protein/domain level included structural classification of proteins, pfam domains, domain architectures, and protein topologies.
this extends the existing structural classification of sam binding proteins.
the residue level included the identification of conserved binding site residues based on structure-guided sequence alignments of representative members of a family, and the identification of conserved structural motifs.
we found that sam bound to a total of  <dig> different fold types .
several site-specific rules were created for the assignment of functional residues to families and proteins that do not have a bound sam or a solved structure.
we identified  <dig> new fold types and  <dig> additional topological arrangements of strands within the well-studied rossmann fold methyltransferases .
a striking correlation between fold type and the conformation of the bound sam  was found across the  <dig> fold types.
our ligand-centric approach was divided into four levels: residue, protein/domain, ligand, and family levels.
the family level included phylogenetic analysis.
