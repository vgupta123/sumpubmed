our data provide strong support for the suggestion that wnt <dig> not only functions as an anti-testis gene during early development, but is also necessary for later ovarian and testicular function.
wnt <dig> is a key regulator of gonadal differentiation in humans and mice, playing a pivotal role in early embryogenesis.
in males, wnt <dig> mrna was down-regulated in testes immediately after birth, coincident with the time that seminiferous cords normally form, and rose gradually after day  <dig>  by day  <dig>  when testicular androgen production normally declines, wnt <dig> protein was restricted to the leydig cells.
using a marsupial, the tammar wallaby, in which most gonadal differentiation occurs after birth whilst the young is in the pouch, we show by quantitative pcr during early testicular and ovarian development that wnt <dig> is differentially expressed ingonads.
after birth, in females wnt <dig> mrna dramatically increased during ovarian differentiation, reaching a peak by day 9â€“ <dig> post partum  when the ovarian cortex and medulla are first distinguishable.
wnt <dig> protein was localised in the ovarian cortex and at the medullary boundary.
