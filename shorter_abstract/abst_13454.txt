we hypothesize that viability of equine msc is not correlated with needle diameter during aspiration and injection.
following injection, needle diameter did not affect immediate or delayed viability of equine msc.

using a 3 ml syringe, manual injection of equine cord blood  or bone marrow-derived  msc with no needle and needles ranging in size from  <dig> to 30 ga did not affect immediate msc viability.
using a 3 ml syringe, aspiration of msc through  <dig>   <dig>  and 30 ga needles resulted in significant decreases in immediate viability with no change in delayed viability when compared to aspiration without a needle.
as a result, an 18 ga or larger needle should be utilized for aspiration of cell suspensions.
msc are commonly administered to the patient through a hypodermic needle.
following aspiration through needles sizes 20 ga and smaller, immediate viability, but not delayed viability, decreased.
in contrast, needle selection for msc injection should be based on clinical preference and experience rather than concerns over decreasing msc viability.
in comparison, the smallest needles,  have an internal diameter of 160 μm.
currently, little information is available on the effect of such injection has on equine msc immediate and delayed viability.
