we therefore explored whether the environmental niche of a prokaryote could be deduced from the sequence of its proteome.
furthermore, we selected  <dig> physico-chemical properties of amino acids and computed their values for each proteome.
to our knowledge, this is the first time that three different classification cases  of proteome adaptation are successfully performed with the same set of  <dig> features.
finally, we aimed at finding the precise differences between proteome sequences of prokaryotes from different environments.
although specific composition and structure of cellular components suitable for the variety of extreme conditions has already been postulated, a systematic study describing such adaptations has not yet been performed.
further, on the same set of features we applied two fundamentally different machine learning methods, support vector machines and random forests, to successfully classify between bacteria and archaea, halophiles and non-halophiles, as well as mesophiles, thermophiles and mesothermophiles.
finally, we performed feature selection by using random forests.
