we use factor analysis coupled with pre-established knowledge as a theoretical base to achieve this goal.
despite the small sample available, we can show that this approach permits identification of meaningful structures, in particular two polycistronic mirna genes related to transcriptional activity and likely to be relevant in the discrimination between gliosarcomas and other brain tumors.
we analyzed one of the  few datasets that provide both transcriptional and post-transcriptional data of the same samples to investigate the possibility to extract more information, using a joint analysis approach.
preserving the emergent properties that appear in the cellular system when all molecular levels are interacting.
