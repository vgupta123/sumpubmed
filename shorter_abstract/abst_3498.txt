the sequence homology concept is based on the similarity comparison between the structural elements, the basic building blocks for conferring the overall fold of a protein.
quantitative criteria are required to suppress events of function annotation transfer as a result of false homology assignments.
sequence similarity core dissection with regard to fold-critical and other contributions systematically suppresses false hits and, additionally, recovers previously obscured homology relationships such as the one between aquaporins and formate/nitrite transporters that, so far, was only supported by structure comparison.
protein sequence similarities to any types of non-globular segments  are pertinent sources for mistaken homologies.
the approach was applied to a large-scale study of smart and pfam domains in the space of seed sequences and in the space of uniprot/swissprot.

to generalize the dissection concept for cases without 3d structural information, we find that a dissection based on alignment quality is an appropriate surrogate.
regretfully, these considerations regularly escape attention in large-scale annotation studies since, often, there is no substitute to manual handling of these cases.
