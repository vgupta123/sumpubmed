the snatch-farrowed porcine-colostrum-deprived  pig model, in which neonates are raised on commercially available bovine colostrum, is an alternative model for porcine infectious disease research.
under the conditions of this experiment, sf-pcd pigs demonstrated superior growth performance and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immunity following vaccination.
it is not known if sf-pcd pigs possess growth performance and immunity comparable to conventional, farm-raised pigs.
the current experiment compared growth performance and immune responses of sf-pcd pigs to their farm-raised siblings following mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  vaccination.
growth performance did not differ between groups before weaning, but sf-pcd pigs had higher adg after weaning.
in response to mhyo stimulation, numbers of ifnγ secreting pbmc and levels of interleukin  <dig>  and il <dig> in pbmc supernatants were significantly higher in sf-pcd pigs, as were mhyo antibody levels in sera, and levels of il1β, il <dig> and il <dig> in supernatants of pma/iono stimulated pbmc.
whether or not this reflects greater resistance or tolerance to infection is unknown but the ability to react positively to the vaccination provides evidence that sf-pcd pigs are a suitable alternative model for swine disease research.
peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were isolated on d <dig>  cytokine secretion from pbmc stimulated with mhyo antigen or phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin  was assessed using a multiplexed fluorescent microsphere immunoassay .
