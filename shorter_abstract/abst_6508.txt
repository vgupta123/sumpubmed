mitochondrial introns intermit coding regions of genes and feature characteristic secondary structures and splicing mechanisms.
based on different insertion sites within the cox <dig> gene and secondary structures, four types of group i and two types of group ii introns are known, which can harbor up to three encoding homing endonuclease genes  of the laglidadg family  and/or reverse transcriptase .
this study validates the subclass spirophorina  as an intron hotspot in sponges.
within demosponges, group i and group ii introns are present in six families.
we analyzed the largest dataset on sponge mitochondrial group i introns to date:  <dig> specimens, from  <dig> different sponge genera which provided novel insights into the evolution of group i introns.
for the first time group i introns were detected in four genera of the sponge family scleritodermidae .
we demonstrated that group i introns in sponges aggregate in the most conserved regions of cox <dig>  we showed that co-occurrence of two introns in cox <dig> is unique among metazoans, but not uncommon in sponges.
our analyses confirm that most sponge group i introns probably originated from fungi.

however, this combination always associates an active intron with a degenerating one.
earlier hypotheses of hgt were confirmed and for the first time vgt and secondary losses of introns conclusively demonstrated.
