here we analyzed the functional impact of mirnas on the osteogenic differentiation in ussc.
gene expression profiling identified  <dig> micrornas that were consistently upregulated during osteogenic differentiation of two different ussc cell lines .
in western blot analyses demonstrated that endogenous levels of cdk <dig> and hdac <dig> were downregulated during osteogenic differentiation of ussc and reduced following ectopic expression of mir-26a/b and mir-29b.
in contrast, endogenous expression of smad <dig>  targeted by mir-26a/b, was unaltered during osteogenic differentiation of ussc or following ectopic expression of mir-26a/b.
functional overexpression analyses using microrna mimics revealed that mir-26a/b, as well as mir-29b strongly accelerated osteogenic differentiation of ussc as assessed by alizarin-red staining and calcium-release assays.
mir-26a/b and mir-29b are upregulated during osteogenic differentiation of ussc and share target genes inhibiting osteogenesis.
furthermore, these micrornas accelerate osteogenic differentiation, likely mediated by osteo-inhibitory proteins such as cdk <dig> and hdac <dig>

unrestricted somatic stem cells  are a rare population in human cord blood that can be induced into cells representative of all three germinal layers.
