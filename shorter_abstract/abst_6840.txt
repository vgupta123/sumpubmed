in this work, we suggest a novel method for simplified representation of protein amino acid sequences named single residue distribution analysis, which is applicable both for homology search and database screening.
the adequacy of motifs for mining toxin-like sequences was confirmed by their ability to identify 100% toxin-like anemone polypeptides in the reference polypeptide database.
the suggested method may be used to retrieve structures of interest from the est databases using simple amino acid sequence motifs as templates.
analysis of  <dig> ests of sea anemone anemonia viridis resulted in identification of five protein precursors of earlier described toxins, discovery of  <dig> novel polypeptide toxins, and prediction of  <dig> putative polypeptide toxin sequences.
the employment of novel motifs for the search of polypeptide toxins in anemonia viridis est dataset allowed us to identify  <dig> putative toxin precursors.
