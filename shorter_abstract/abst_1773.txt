the phylogenies of ribosomal its region of mtdna and the intergenic spacer between atpb and rbcl genes of cpdna were reconstructed.
geographical subdivision is lacking in both species, even though recurrent gene flow by both pollen and seed is severely limited.
in total, the contrasting levels between historical and ongoing gene flow, large population sizes, a long lifespan, and slow mutation rates in both organelle dnas have all likely contributed to the unusually long duration of paraphyly in cycads.
this study addresses the apportionment of genetic diversity between cycas revoluta and c. taitungensis, species that constitute the section asiorientales and represent a unique, basal lineage of the laurasian genus cycas.
the lack of reciprocal monophyly between these long isolated sections is likely due to persistent shared ancestral polymorphisms.
's surfing model where the majority of new mutations do not spread geographically and remain at low frequencies or are eventually lost by genetic drift.
geographically, c. taitungensis is limited to taiwan whereas c. revoluta is found in the ryukyu archipelago and on mainland china.
these mutations exist as dominant cytotypes across populations and species.
phylogenetic analyses revealed paraphyly of both loci in the two species and also in the section asiorientales.
