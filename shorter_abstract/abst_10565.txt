we therefore investigated the frequencies of various t cell subsets  and cd25+ foxp3+ treg cells in aml patients with untreated disease and following intensive chemotherapy.
we conclude that the effect of intensive aml chemotherapy differ between circulating t cell subsets, relative frequencies of th <dig> cells are not affected by chemotherapy and this subset may affect aml cells indirectly through their immunoregulatory effects but probably not through direct effects of il17-a.
increased levels of regulatory cd25+ foxp3+ t cells were detected in aml patients with untreated disease, during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia and during regeneration after treatment.
several observations suggest that immunological events early after chemotherapy, possibly during the period of severe treatment-induced cytopenia, are important for antileukemic immune reactivity in acute myeloid leukemia .
finally, exogenous il17-a usually had no or only minor effects on proliferation of primary human aml cells.
relative levels of circulating tc <dig> and th <dig> cells were decreased in patients with severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia, whereas th <dig> levels did not differ from healthy controls.
th <dig> and th <dig> levels were significantly higher in healthy males than females, but this gender difference was not detected during chemotherapy-induced cytopenia.
