quantitative trait locus/loci  mapping using a high-density genetic map is a powerful approach to detecting loci that are responsible for traits of interest.
combining qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map and bsr-seq may dissect comprehensively the genetic architecture underlying the maize krn.
a total of  <dig>  high-quality polymorphic slaf markers were obtained and used to construct a high-density genetic map with a total length of  <dig>  centimorgan  and an average distance between adjacent markers of  <dig>  cm.
combining the genetic map and krn of f <dig> individuals, four qtl  were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.
in this study, we proved that combining qtl mapping using a high-density genetic map and bsr-seq is a powerful and cost-effective approach to comprehensively revealing genetic architecture underlying traits of interest.
according to the physical positions of these qtl, qkrn8- <dig> was included by bsr_qtl <dig>  in addition, qkrn8- <dig> was validated using qtl mapping with a recombinant inbred lines population that was derived from inbred lines abe <dig> and b <dig>
the physical intervals of these four qtl ranged from  <dig>  mb for qkrn8- <dig> to  <dig>  mb for qkrn <dig> with an average value of  <dig>  mb.
the maize kernel row number  is a key component that contributes to grain yield and has high broad-sense heritability .
based on high-throughput sequencing of two rna pools bulked from leaves of plants with extremely high and low krns, two qtl were detected on chromosome  <dig> in the 10–25 mb  and 60–150 mb  intervals.
