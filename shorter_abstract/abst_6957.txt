the cytokine transforming growth factor beta  can either stimulate or inhibit angiogenesis via its differential surface receptor signaling.
taken together, our results suggest that endothelial cells exposed to tgf-β <dig> lose both tip and stalk cell identity, possibly mediated by loss of vegfr <dig> signaling.
the role of these events in physiological and pathological angiogenesis requires further investigation.
here we evaluate changes in expression of angiogenic signaling receptors when bovine aortic endothelial cells were exposed to tgf-β <dig> under low serum conditions.
the process is regulated by soluble factors, principally vascular endothelial growth factor , and via bidirectional signaling through the jagged/notch system, leading to assignment of tip cell and stalk cell identity.
this vegfr <dig> in conditioned medium was full-length protein and was associated with increased soluble hsp- <dig>  consistent with a possible shedding of microvesicles/exosomes.
tgf-β <dig> induced a dose dependent inhibition of tip cell assignment and subsequent angiogenesis on matrigel, maximal at  <dig>  ng/ml.
