this report addresses this deficiency by characterizing  <dig>  mbp of gene space from a diploid species .
strawberry  is the familiar name of a group of economically important crop plants and wild relatives that also represent an emerging system for the study of gene and genome evolution.
a detailed description of the studied regions reveals  <dig> blastx-supported gene sites and eight additional est-supported gene sites.
this report provides a high-resolution depiction of targeted gene neighborhoods that will aid whole-genome sequence assembly, provide valuable tools for plant breeders and advance the understanding of strawberry genome evolution.
the twenty large genomic tracks  captured as fosmid inserts comprise gene regions with roles in flowering, disease resistance, and metabolism.
the effectiveness of six fgenesh training models was assessed via comparisons among ab initio predictions and homology-based gene and start/stop codon identifications.
only  <dig> genes have complete est coverage, enabling gene modelling, while  <dig> lack est support.
the unexpected gene duplications and their differential patterns of est support suggest possible subfunctionalization or pseudogenization of these sequences.
instances of microcolinearity with arabidopsis thaliana were identified in twelve inserts.
