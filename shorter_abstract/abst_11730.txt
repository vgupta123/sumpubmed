phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this group 1/group  <dig> split is zoologically widespread as it exists across the metazoan sub-kingdom.
chromosomal localisation and pcr analysis, coupled to inspection of the current s. mansoni genomic assembly, revealed that many of the smval genes are spatially linked throughout the genome.
quantitative lifecycle expression profiling demonstrated distinct smval expression patterns, including transcripts specifically associated with lifestages involved in definitive host invasion, transcripts restricted to lifestages involved in the invasion of the intermediate host and transcripts ubiquitously expressed.
our results highlight the existence of two distinct scp/taps protein types within the platyhelminthes and across taxa.
twenty-eight smvals with complete scp/taps domains were identified and comparison of their predicted protein features and gene structures indicated the presence of two distinct sub-families .
proteins containing this domain are implicated in diverse biological activities and may be important for chronic host/parasite interactions.
the extensive lifecycle expression analysis indicates several smval transcripts are upregulated in infective stages of the parasite, suggesting that these particular protein products may be linked to the establishment of chronic host/parasite interactions.
