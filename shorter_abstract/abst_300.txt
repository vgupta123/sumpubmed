a majority of the inaccurate loci involved frameshift errors, correction of which fused adjacent orfs.
building on the genome project of vibrio fischeri es <dig>  we used a comparative approach to identify and investigate genes that had a high likelihood of sequence error.
although insertions/deletions are thought to be rare in microbial genome assemblies, fourteen of the loci contained extraneous sequence of over  <dig> bp, likely due to imperfect contig ends that were misassembled in tandem rather than as overlapping segments.
comparison of the v. fischeri es <dig> genome with that of conspecific strain mj <dig> identified  <dig> target loci in es <dig> as containing likely errors, and thus of high-priority for resequencing.
these updates further advance v. fischeri as an important model for understanding intercellular communication and colonization of animal tissue.
additionally we updated the entire genome annotation with  <dig> new features including previously uncalled protein-coding genes, regulatory rna genes and operon leader peptides, and we analyzed the transcriptional apparatus encoded by es <dig>
