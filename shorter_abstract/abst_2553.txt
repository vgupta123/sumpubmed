a subset of mirna-mrna interactions differed significantly for features in seed regions as well as the total number of matches/mismatches.
nor, these have not been evaluated for their suitability for high-throughput target prediction at genome level.
more importantly, non-conventional features of mirna-mrna interaction may exist in plants indicating alternate mode of mirna target recognition.
although, many plant mirna target prediction tools may be optimized to predict targets with high specificity in arabidopsis, such optimized thresholds may not be suitable for many targets in non-arabidopsis species.
targetfinder was most efficient  in predicting ‘true-positive’ targets in arabidopsis mirna-mrna interactions.
score optimizations increased the ‘recall’ to only 70%  for datasets of true mirna-mrna interactions in species other than arabidopsis.
combining the results of targetfinder and psrnatarget delivers high true positive coverage, whereas the intersection of psrnatarget and tapirhybrid outputs deliver highly ‘precise’ predictions.
in contrast, only 46% of true positive interactions from non-arabidopsis species were detected, indicating low ‘recall’ values.
in plants, several tools have been developed to predict targets, majority of them being trained on arabidopsis datasets.
the large number of ‘false negative’ predictions delivered from non-arabidopsis datasets by all the available tools indicate the diversity in mirnas-mrna interaction features between arabidopsis and other species.
deep-sequencing has enabled the identification of large numbers of mirnas and sirnas, making the high-throughput target identification a main limiting factor in defining their function.
