the results accredited the ability of the model to faithfully describe network dynamics.
to gain an insight into the inner layout of this network a logic model of the tol system was implemented, simulated and experimentally validated.
this analysis revealed that the entire regulatory structure of the tol system enables the action an unprecedented metabolic amplifier motif .
logic modeling of the tol circuit accounted for the intricate regulatory topology of this otherwise simple metabolic device.
