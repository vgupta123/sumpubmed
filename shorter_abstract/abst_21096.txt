well-established methods exist for solving this problem under the assumption that the structures under comparison are considered as rigid bodies.
structural alignment is an important step in protein comparison.
such movements can impede the identification of structural equivalences when rigid aligners are used.
when applied to a set of kinase structures it is able to detect similarities that are missed by other alignment algorithms.
we introduce a new method called rapido  for the three-dimensional alignment of protein structures in the presence of conformational changes.
the flexible aligner is coupled to a genetic algorithm for the identification of structurally conserved regions.
rapido is capable of aligning protein structures in the presence of large conformational changes.
the algorithm is sufficiently fast to be applied to the comparison of large sets of protein structures.
rapido is more sensitive than other flexible aligners when applied to cases of closely homologues proteins undergoing large conformational changes.
