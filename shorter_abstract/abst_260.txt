the goals of this study were to isolate expressed r gene-like sequences  from 454-derived transcriptomic sequences and expressed sequence tags  of common bean, and to develop rgl-tagged molecular markers.
in addition,  <dig> sequence-tagged-site  and  <dig> cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  molecular markers were developed for  <dig> unique pvrgls.

based on the syntenic blocks between common bean and soybean,  <dig>  pvrgls were anchored on the p. vulgaris genetic map and will need to be mapped to determine order.
upon comparison to p. vulgaris genomic sequences,  <dig>  of the  <dig> tentative pvrgls could be integrated into the existing common bean physical map.
most r genes share highly conserved domains which facilitates the identification of new candidate r genes from the same species or other species.
several diseases severely reduce bean production and quality; therefore, it is very important to better understand disease resistance in common bean in order to prevent these losses.
in total,  <dig> pvrgls were successfully identified from 454-derived transcriptomic sequences and ests available in genbank and about 65% of pvrgls were integrated into the common bean genetic map.
common bean  is one of the most important legumes in the world.
a total of  <dig> non-redundant sequences were identified and named as common bean  resistance gene-like sequences .
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  analysis confirmed that pvrgls were actually expressed in the leaves of common bean.
a total of  <dig> rgl-tagged markers were developed for  <dig> unique pvrgls, including  <dig> sts and  <dig> caps markers.
more than  <dig> resistance  genes which confer resistance against various pathogens have been cloned from diverse plant species.
