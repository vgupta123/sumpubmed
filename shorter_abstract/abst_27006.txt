we have created a new open pipeline for developing est-ssr markers and applied it in a comprehensive analysis of est-ssrs and est-ssr markers in c. japonica.
the advent of commercial second generation sequencing machines has lead to new strategies for developing est-ssr markers, necessitating the development of bioinformatic framework that can keep pace with the increasing quality and quantity of sequence data produced.
the results will be useful in genomic analyses of conifers and other non-model species.
<dig>  ssrs were found in  <dig>   contigs, giving an ssr frequency lower than that in seven other plant species with gene indices .
markers resulting from both pipelines showed no differences in pcr success rate and polymorphisms, but pcr success and polymorphism were significantly affected by the expected pcr product size and number of ssr repeats, respectively.
microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  in expressed sequence tags  are useful resources for genome analysis because of their abundance, functionality and polymorphism.
tri-ssrs were the most common ssrs; the most common motif was at, which was found in  <dig>  di-ssrs, followed by the aag motif, found in  <dig>  tri-ssrs.
we describe an open scheme for analyzing ests and developing est-ssr markers from reads collected by sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing of sugi .
est-ssr markers exhibited less polymorphism than genomic ssrs.
fortyâ€“four est-ssr markers were developed from  <dig> primer pairs using two pipelines: read2marker and the newly-developed cmib, which combines several open tools.
