dna barcoding of land plants has relied traditionally on a small number of markers from the plastid genome.
the apparently greater coalescence times of nuclear genes are likely to limit their utility as barcodes, as only a small proportion of their alleles were fixed and unique to individual species.
we found that nuclear genes showed an overall greater variability, but also displayed a high level of heterozygosity, intraspecific variation, and retention of ancient alleles.
from pooled-species  <dig> transcriptome data we identified two variable intron-less nuclear loci for each of two species-rich genera of the hawaiian flora: clermontia  and cyrtandra  and compared their utility as dna barcodes with that of plastid genes.
thus, nuclear genes displayed fewer species-diagnostic haplotypes compared to plastid genes and no interspecies gaps.
for young plant groups, nuclear genes may not be a superior alternative to slowly evolving plastid genes.
in contrast, low-copy nuclear genes have received little attention as dna barcodes because of the absence of universal primers for pcr amplification.
in both groups, species-diagnostic markers from either genome were scarce on the youngest island; a minimum age of ca.
