biofilm development, specifically the fundamentally adaptive switch from acute to chronic infection phenotypes, requires global regulators and small non-coding regulatory rnas .
rna-seq, 5’-race and mfold predictions suggest rsmw has a secondary structure with  <dig> of  <dig> gga motifs located on outer stem loops.
here we report a novel rsmy/rsmz-type srna, termed rsmw, in p. aeruginosa up-transcribed in biofilm versus planktonic growth.
pa <dig> weakly resembles an rsma/rsmn homolog having 49 % and 51 % similarity, and 16 % and 17 % identity to rsma and rsmn amino acid sequences, respectively.
northern blot revealed two rsmw binding bands of  <dig> and  <dig> bases, suggesting rsmw is derived from the 3’-utr of the upstream hypothetical gene, pa <dig>  rsmw expression is elevated in late stationary versus logarithmic growth phase in pb minimal media, at higher temperatures , and in both gaca and rhlr transposon mutants versus wild-type.
collectively, our study reveals an interesting theme regarding another srna regulator of the rsm system and further unravels the complexities regulating adaptive responses for pseudomonas species.
