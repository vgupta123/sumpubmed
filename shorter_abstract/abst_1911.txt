there is therefore a substantial need for alternative forms of infection control in rabbits; we investigated the effect of oral β-glucan on p. multocida infection in this species.
this latter finding has practical relevance to breeders as it extends the window in which heavily infected and symptomatic animals can be salvaged with antibiotics.
and intramuscularly , representing a supra-physiological challenge, and received either ,  β-glucans, antibiotic or placebo.
in our study, ,  β-glucans were highly effective in protecting against a model of naturally acquired p. multocida infection and extended survival times in the supra-physiological model.
pasteurella multocida causes numerous economically relevant diseases in livestock including rabbits.
three groups were inoculated with pasteurella multocida intranasally , a physiologically appropriate challenge which reproduces naturally acquired infection, and received either ,  β-glucans or placebo.
thirthy-five new zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into five groups of seven animals.
