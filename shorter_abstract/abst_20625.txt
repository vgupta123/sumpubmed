the diaphragm has sensory innervation from mechanoreceptors with myelinated axons entering the spinal cord via the phrenic nerve that project to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex.
it was hypothesized that phrenic nerve afferent  projection to the central nervous system is via the spinal dorsal column pathway.
three populations of myelinated pna  enter the cat's cervical spinal segments that supply the phrenic nerve
no cdp was recorded at c <dig> dorsal spinal cord surface in cats.
these results demonstrate pna activation of neurons in the cervical spinal cord.
