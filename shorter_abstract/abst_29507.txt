by using microarray technology we have screened the expression of  <dig> genes in the brains of doberman dogs with a heritable form of narcolepsy , and their unaffected heterozygous siblings.
the difference was particularly pronounced in the amygdala, where mrna levels of penk were  <dig>  fold lower in narcoleptic dogs than in heterozygous siblings, and tac <dig> and socs <dig> showed  <dig>  fold and  <dig>  fold decrease in expression, respectively.
the results obtained from microarray experiments were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr.
these results suggest that tac <dig>  penk and socs <dig> might be intimately connected with the excessive daytime sleepiness not only in dogs, but also in other species, possibly including humans.
however, little is known about molecular alterations downstream of the hypocretin signals.
deficiencies in the hypocretin system are well established as the origin of the condition; both from studies in humans who lack the hypocretin ligand  and in dogs with a mutation in hypocretin receptor  <dig> .
interestingly, it was previously shown that a single dose of amphetamine-like stimulants able to increase wakefulness in the dogs, also produce an increase in the expression of both tac <dig> and penk in mice.
