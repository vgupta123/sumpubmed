pea has a complex genome of  <dig>  gb for which only limited genomic resources are available to date.
the most comprehensive genetic map to date tightly linked to the model species m. truncatula and a large snp resource for both academic research and breeding.
although snp markers are now highly valuable for research and modern breeding, only a few are described and used in pea for genetic diversity and linkage analysis.

10 k pea contigs were found to be polymorphic among the genetic material surveyed, corresponding to 35 k snps.
we validated a subset of  <dig> snps through the goldengate assay, proving their ability to structure a diversity panel of breeding germplasm.
annotated contigs showed an even distribution along m. truncatula pseudochromosomes, suggesting a good representation of the pea genome.
based on blast analysis, we could establish  <dig> bridges between our pea consensus map and the pseudochromosomes of m. truncatula, which provides new insight on synteny between the two species.
