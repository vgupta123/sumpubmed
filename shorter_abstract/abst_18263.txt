discriminating membrane proteins based on their functions is an important task in genome annotation.
in this work, we have analyzed the characteristic features of amino acid residues in membrane proteins that perform major functions, such as channels/pores, electrochemical potential-driven transporters and primary active transporters.
the neural network method discriminated the channels/pores, electrochemical potential-driven transporters and active transporters with the 5-fold cross validation accuracy of 64% in a data set of  <dig> membrane proteins.
in addition, we have discriminated transporters from other α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins with the accuracy of 85% using k-nearest neighbor method.
we suggest that this method could be effectively used to discriminate transporters from all other globular and membrane proteins, and classify them into channels/pores, electrochemical and active transporters.
the application of amino acid occurrence improved the overall accuracy to 68%.
the performance of discrimination with amino acid occurrence is better than that with amino acid composition.
the composition of all the amino acids in primary active transporters lies in between other two classes of proteins.
we observed that most of the algorithms have discriminated them with similar accuracy.
we observed that the residues asp, asn and tyr are dominant in channels/pores whereas the composition of hydrophobic residues, phe, gly, ile, leu and val is high in electrochemical potential-driven transporters.
we have utilized different machine learning algorithms, such as, bayes rule, logistic function, neural network, support vector machine, decision tree etc.
