apart from the validation of predicted genes at the protein level, the additional features of proteogenomic tools include revision of annotation errors and discovery of novel orfs.
thus, the accurate annotation of these genomes has become a bottleneck of knowledge acquisition.
the transcripts of four novel orfs were confirmed by rt-pcr assay.
above all, seven new orfs were discovered, which were not predicted in s. flexneri 2a str.
we exploited a proteogenomic approach to improve conventional genome annotation by integrating proteomic data with genomic information.
additionally, most of these novel orfs were overlapping genes, some even nested within the coding region of other known genes.
