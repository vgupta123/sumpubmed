many microbial phenotypes are the product of cooperative interactions among cells, but their putative fitness benefits are often not well understood.
flies also ingest and excrete spores that still express a red fluorescent protein marker.
in the cellular slime mold dictyostelium discoideum, unicellular amoebae aggregate when starved and form multicellular fruiting bodies in which stress-resistant spores are held aloft by dead stalk cells.
drosophila melanogaster accumulate spores on their surfaces more quickly when exposed to intact fruiting bodies than when exposed to fruiting bodies physically disrupted to dislodge spore masses from stalks.
these results thus support the long-hypothesized dispersal benefits of altruism in a model system for microbial cooperation.
here we experimentally test whether fruiting bodies increase the rate at which spores are acquired by passing invertebrates.
