micrornas  are small endogenous non-coding interfering rna molecules regarded as major regulators in eukaryotic gene expression.
using this approach, we quantified the expression of let-7b in different human cell lines as well as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression in porcine intestinal samples.
there is nearly no cross reaction among closely-related mirna family members, which points to the high specificity of the assays.
here, we present the mir-q assay as a highly sensitive quantitative reverse transcription pcr  for expression analysis of small rnas such as mirna molecules.
different methods are employed for mirna expression profiling.
for a better understanding of their role in essential biological processes, convenient methods for differential mirna expression analysis are required.
