the method for peth analysis includes lipid extraction of whole blood, a one-hour hplc separation of lipids and elsd  detection of peth.
the peth content in blood samples is stable for three weeks in the refrigerator.
it is further demonstrated that equal test results are obtained with blood collected in standard test tubes with edta as with the previously used heparinized test tubes.
methodological improvements are presented which comprise a simpler extraction procedure, the use of phosphatidylbutanol as internal standard and a new algorithm for evaluation of unknown samples.
phosphatidylethanol  is an abnormal phospholipid formed slowly in cell membranes by a transphosphatidylation reaction from phosphatidylcholine in the presence of ethanol and catalyzed by the enzyme phospholipase d. peth in blood is a promising new marker of ethanol abuse depending on the high specificity and sensitivity of this marker.
none of the biological markers used in clinical routine at the present time are sensitive and specific enough for the diagnosis of alcohol abuse.
