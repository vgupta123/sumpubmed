laccases  are multi-copper oxidases that have gained importance in many industries such as biofuels, pulp production, textile dye bleaching, bioremediation, and food production.
classification systems for multi-copper oxidases have been developed using multiple sequence alignments, however, these systems seem to largely follow species taxonomy rather than substrate ranges, enzyme properties, or specific function.
the models showed high performance with an overall accuracy of  <dig> %, error of  <dig> %, mcc of  <dig> , precision of  <dig> %, sensitivity of  <dig> %, and specificity of  <dig> % in a 5-fold cross-validation test.
this is consistent with the observation that fungal laccases usually prefer acidic conditions, whereas plant and bacterial laccases prefer basic conditions.
in this study, we first utilized unsupervised learning approach to develop a novel homology independent laccase classification system.
despite acting on a wide range of compounds as a family, individual laccases often exhibit distinctive and varied substrate ranges.
analysis of the clusters using a t-test revealed that the majority of the physicochemical descriptors had statistically significant differences between the classes.
their usefulness stems from the ability to act on a diverse range of phenolic compounds such as o-/p-quinols, aminophenols, polyphenols, polyamines, aryl diamines, and aromatic thiols.
based on these observations, we hypothesize that a descriptor-based unsupervised learning system could generate homology independent classification system for better describing the functional properties of laccases.
from the descriptors considered, physicochemical properties showed the best performance.
physicochemical properties divided the laccases into twelve subtypes.
this study provides a useful classification system for better understanding of laccases from their physicochemical properties perspective.
in an independent test, our models still provide a high accuracy of  <dig> %, error rate of  <dig> %, mcc of  <dig> , precision of  <dig> %, sensitivity of  <dig> % and specificity of  <dig> %.
