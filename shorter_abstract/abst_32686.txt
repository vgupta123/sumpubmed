the method gave promising results, with the genotyping of drb exon  <dig> sequences for  <dig>  samples from  <dig> different rodent species and the sequencing of  <dig> variants in one half of a  <dig> run.
this is theoretically possible using  <dig> pyrosequencing, which generates billions of base pairs of sequence data.
however several challenges arise: first in the attribution of each read produced to its original sample, and second, in bioinformatic analyses to distinguish true from artifactual sequence variation.
a total of  <dig>  reads were obtained, of which  <dig>  were finally assigned to original samples.
it opens up new perspectives for the study of evolutionary and functional genetics of highly polymorphic genes like major histocompatibility complex genes in vertebrates or loci regulating self-compatibility in plants.
promising progresses now concern the application of these technologies to large-scale studies of genetic variation.
such studies require the genotyping of high numbers of samples.
the  <dig> system is less costly and time consuming and may enhance the reliability of genotypes obtained when high numbers of samples are studied.
rules based on a probabilistic model and a four-step procedure, were developed to validate sequences and provide a confidence level for each genotype.
high-throughput sequencing technologies offer new perspectives for biomedical, agronomical and evolutionary research.
this new approach is a promising alternative to classical methods involving electrophoresis-based techniques for variant separation and cloning-sequencing for sequence determination.
dna amplicons from  <dig>  rodent samples were individually barcoded using a combination of tags located in forward and reverse primers.
a probabilistic model has been developed to demonstrate the reliability of this method.
