in addition, these findings open new perspectives for the study of the physiological role of mir- <dig> and its possible involvement in cell death/survival processes.
in particular, we show that the overexpression of mir- <dig> - a brain enriched mirna - causes morphological changes in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells similar to those observed using an sirna specifically directed against truncated ntrk <dig>  as well as a significant increase in cell number.
our results show that the regulation of ntrk <dig> by micrornas is isoform-specific and suggest that neurotrophin-mediated processes are strongly linked to microrna-dependent mechanisms.
accordingly, transcriptome analysis of cells transfected with mir- <dig> revealed an alteration of the expression of genes implicated in cytoskeletal organization as well as genes involved in apoptosis, cell survival and proliferation, including the anti-apoptotic factor bcl <dig>
we identify one microrna  that represses the full-length isoform of ntrk <dig> and four micrornas  that repress the truncated isoform.
they mediate the survival of neurons during development and adulthood and are implicated in synaptic plasticity.
the human neurotrophin- <dig> receptor gene ntrk <dig> yields two major isoforms, a full-length kinase-active form and a truncated non-catalytic form, which activates a specific pathway affecting membrane remodeling and cytoskeletal reorganization.
here, we provide evidence that the two isoforms of ntrk <dig> are targeted by different sets of micrornas, small non-coding rnas that play an important regulatory role in the nervous system.
