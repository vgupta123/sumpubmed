lactis, and discuss intra- and inter-subspecies genomic diversity in the context of evolutionary adaptation.
bulgaricus appear to represent different points on the same evolutionary track of adaptation to the milk environment through the loss of superfluous functions and the acquisition of functions that allow an optimized utilization of milk resources, where the ssp.
here we examine for the first time if the same conclusions apply to the ssp.
the dairy lactic acid producing bacteria l. delbrueckii ssp.
we further show that one of the most important traits, lactose fermentation, of one of the economically most important dairy bacteria, l. delbruecki ssp.
show the signs of reductive evolution through the elimination of superfluous genes, thereby limiting their carbohydrate metabolic capacities and amino acid biosynthesis potential.
bulgaricus has progressed further away from the common ancestor.
bulgaricus genome revealed the characteristics of a genome in an active phase of rapid evolution, in what appears to be an adaptation to the milk environment.
in this sense this bacterium may thus be regarded as a natural gmo avant la lettre.
bulgaricus are lactic acid producing bacteria that are largely used in dairy industries, notably in cheese-making and yogurt production.
lactis this reductive evolution has gone less far than in the ssp.
bulgaricus, relies on horizontally acquired rather than deep ancestral genes.
