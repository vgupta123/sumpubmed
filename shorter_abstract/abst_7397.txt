together, these results indicate that the influence of basal metabolic rate on mammalian maternal investment durations must be more complicated than the mte envisages, and that other factors must play an important role.
the metabolic theory of ecology  predicts that gestation duration, lactation duration, and their sum, total development time, are constrained by mass-specific basal metabolic rate such that they should scale with body mass with an exponent of  <dig> .
in an effort to resolve this uncertainty, we used phylogenetically-controlled regression to investigate the allometries of gestation duration, lactation duration, and total development time in four well-studied mammalian orders, artiodactyla, carnivora, primates, and rodentia.
the scaling exponent for lactation duration is below  <dig>  in carnivora and rodentia, indistinguishable from  <dig>  in artiodactyls, and steeper than  <dig>  in primates.
future research needs to allow for the possibility that different factors drive gestation duration and lactation duration, and that the drivers of the two durations may differ among orders.
gestation duration scaling exponents are below  <dig>  in all four orders.
however, tests of the mteâ€™s predictions have yielded mixed results.
the results we obtained are not consistent with the predictions of the mte.
total development time scales with body mass as predicted by the mte in primates, but not in artiodactyls, carnivores, and rodents.
