rna amplification is required for incorporating laser-capture microdissection techniques into microarray assays.
we wished to assess the accuracy of a new sense-strand rna amplification method by comparing ratios between two samples using quantitative real-time pcr , mimicking a two-color microarray assay.
we have validated an optimized sense-strand rna amplification method for use in comparative studies such as two-color microarrays.
results were assessed by comparing the liver/brain ratio for  <dig> mrnas before and after amplification.
however, standard oligonucleotide microarrays contain sense-strand probes, so traditional t <dig> amplification schemes producing anti-sense rna are not appropriate for hybridization when combined with conventional reverse transcription labeling methods.
the senseamp kit produced the highest correlation, and was also able to amplify a partially degraded sample accurately.
