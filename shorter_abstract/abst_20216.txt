neither numbers of rewards obtained nor number of lever presses were different between the acbc-lesioned rats and shams over session blocks.
a previous study has shown that the nucleus accumbens core  is involved in the performance of matching behavior in trained animals.
the differential effect of acbc lesions on the matching behavior between the same and different conditions suggests influence of the spontaneous recovery, that is, reversion to a previously reinforced choice at the beginning of the next session, on the development of matching behavior in the acbc-lesioned rats.
given two options with different reinforcement rates, animals match their relative rate of responding to the relative rates of reinforcement .
our results suggest that the acbc plays a regulatory role in the development of matching behavior through switching probabilities rather than perception of reward magnitude.
instrumental responding was measured in rats with excitotoxic lesions of the acbc.
rats were given two options that differed in the relative rate of reinforcement under concurrent variable-interval schedules.
post-reinforcement pausing was not affected by the acbc lesion.
the acbc rats showed smaller probabilities of switching behavior between alternatives than shams.
