increasing the communication speed of brain-computer interfaces  is a major aim of current bci-research.
in our study with eleven participants, an errp detection mechanism was implemented in an electroencephalography  based gaze-independent visual speller.
the spelling speed was increased on average by  <dig> % using errp detection.
the idea to automatically detect error-related potentials  in order to veto erroneous decisions of a bci has been existing for more than one decade, but this approach was so far little investigated in online mode.
the benefit for patients with motor disorders is potentially high since they often have rather low spelling accuracies compared to healthy people.
