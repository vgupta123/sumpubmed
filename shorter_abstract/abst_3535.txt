using this technique we uncovered a clonal population of strains, responsible for infections in burkina faso.
these robust markers were sufficient to discriminate  <dig> genotypes and to aggregate strains on the basis of the serotype and geographical origin, although some exceptions were found.
in streptococcus pneumoniae, the existence of  <dig> different serotypes makes the typing particularly difficult and requires the use of highly informative tools.
eventually a set of  <dig> vntrs was proposed for mlva-typing of s. pneumoniae.
we describe a simple pcr-based mlva genotyping scheme for s. pneumoniae which may prove to be a powerful complement to existing tools for epidemiological studies.
we believe that the proposed mlva typing scheme can become a standard for epidemiological studies of s. pneumoniae.
available methods are relatively expensive and cannot be used for large-scale or routine typing of any new isolate.
