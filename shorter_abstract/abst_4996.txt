although genetic analyses have been performed through conventional selection and breeding efforts, the domestication history of nhcc and the genetics underlying its morphological diversity remain unclear.
the development of a large number of snp and ssr markers was successfully achieved for nhcc.
a total of  <dig>  simple sequence repeats  were detected in nhcc, containing repeat types from mononucleotide to nonanucleotide.
non-heading chinese cabbage , belonging to brassica, is an important leaf vegetable in asia.
in addition, a total of  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified in the nhcc through a comparison with the genome of chinese cabbage, and the average snp density in the whole genome was  <dig> /kb.

the average values of the polymorphism information content, observed heterozygosity, hardy-weinberg equilibrium, and shannon’s information index were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.
thus, the reliable molecular markers representative of the whole genome are required for molecular-assisted selection in nhcc.
in gene regions,  <dig>  ssrs were identified in  <dig>  genes.
the number of polymorphic bands ranged from two to five, with an average of  <dig>  for each primer.
these novel markers are valuable for constructing genetic linkage maps, comparative genome analysis, quantitative trait locus  mapping, genome-wide association studies, and marker-assisted selection in nhcc breeding system research.
