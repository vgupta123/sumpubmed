in order to characterise trpb variants and stages of trpa/trpb cooperation in silico, several approaches were combined.
the four groups of trpb variants were correlated with archeal speciation.
several stages of trpa/trpb cooperation were identified and trpb variants were characterised.
in archeal genomes, several stages of trpb evolution, trpa/trpb cooperation, and operon formation can be observed.
among the trp genes are most frequently trpa and trpb, which code for the alpha and beta subunit of tryptophan synthase.
enzymes catalysing the last seven steps of tryptophan biosynthesis are encoded in the canonical trp operon.
the first group consisted exclusively of trpb <dig> genes most of which belonged to trp operons.
groups three and four pertain to trpb <dig> genes of those genomes containing exclusively one or two trpb <dig> genes, but no trpb <dig>  one group  consisted of trpb <dig> genes located inside, the other  of trpb <dig> genes located outside the trp operon.
in order to study the evolution of trp genes, completely sequenced archeal and bacterial genomes containing trpb were analysed.
phylogenetic trees were constructed for all trp genes; their structure was assessed via bootstrapping.
thus, archeal trp genes may serve as a model system for studying the evolution of protein-protein interactions and operon formation.
the evolutionary history of these trpb genes is under debate.
phylogenetic trees indicated that trpb sequences constitute four distinct groups; their composition is in agreement with the location of respective genes.
alternative models of trpb evolution were evaluated with parsimony arguments.
