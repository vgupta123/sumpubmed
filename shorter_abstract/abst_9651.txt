to investigate the level of sequence changes introduced into the mitochondrial genome under the alloplasmic condition, three mitochondrial genomes of the triticum-aegilops species were sequenced: 1) durum alloplasmic line with the ae.
the newly formed orfs, differences in gene sequences and copy numbers, heteroplasmy, and substoichiometric changes show the potential of the alloplasmic condition to accelerate evolution towards forming new mitochondrial genomes.
several heteroplasmic regions were observed within genes and intergenic regions of the mitochondrial genomes of all three lines.
wheat is an excellent plant species for nuclear mitochondrial interaction studies due to availability of large collection of alloplasmic lines.
the mitochondrial genome structure in the alloplasmic line was genetically distant from both maternal and paternal genomes.
the number of rearrangements and nucleotide changes in the mitochondrial genome of the alloplasmic line that have occurred in less than half a century was significant considering the high sequence conservation between the t. turgidum and the t. aestivum that diverged from each other  <dig>  years ago.

nucleotide search identified a number of open reading frames, of which  <dig> were specific to the  durum line.
evidence of paternal leakage was also observed by analyzing nad <dig> and orf <dig> among all three lines.
we showed that the changes in genes were not limited to paternal leakage but were sufficiently significant to suggest that other mechanisms, such as recombination and mutation, were responsible.

the mitochondrial genome of the t. turgidum was  <dig>  bp in length with high structural and nucleotide identity to the previously characterized t. aestivum genome.
