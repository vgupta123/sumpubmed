these distributions can be directly obtained by single in silico or a suitable set of in vitro experiments and are subsequently fed into a delay stochastic simulation algorithm , achieving a good compromise between computational costs and a much more accurate representation of spatial processes such as molecular diffusion and translocation between cell compartments.
this is of particular importance given that time spans of cellular processes are generally larger  than those achievable by current spatially-resolved stochastic simulators.
in such cases, a spatially-resolved stochastic method can better portray the biological reality, but the corresponding computer simulations can in turn be prohibitively expensive.
our proposed methodologies accurately capture and incorporate certain spatial processes into temporal stochastic and deterministic simulations, increasing their accuracy at low computational costs.
additionally, we present a novel alternative approach based on delay differential equations  that can be used in scenarios of high molecular concentrations and low noise propagation.
in order to provide insights into the complex biochemical processes inside a cell, modelling approaches must find a balance between achieving an adequate representation of the physical phenomena and keeping the associated computational cost within reasonable limits.
this issue is particularly stressed when spatial inhomogeneities have a significant effect on system's behaviour.
