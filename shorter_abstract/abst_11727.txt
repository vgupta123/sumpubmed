these seven biomarkers include three novel genes  with distinct class-specific signatures and important role in cancer biology, including cellular proliferation, transendothelial migration and trafficking of mhc class antigens.
we propose a general scheme for finding a small set of biomarkers to design a diagnostic system for accurate classification of the cancer subgroups.
we use multilayer networks with online gene selection ability and relational fuzzy clustering to identify a small set of biomarkers for accurate classification of the training and blind test cases of a well studied data set.
the four heterogeneous childhood cancers, neuroblastoma, non-hodgkin lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and ewing sarcoma present a similar histology of small round blue cell tumor  and thus often leads to misdiagnosis.
interestingly, nab <dig> is downregulated in other tumors including non-hodgkin lymphoma and neuroblastoma but we observed moderate to high upregulation in a few cases of ewing sarcoma and rabhdomyosarcoma, suggesting that nab <dig> might be mutated in these tumors.
our scheme takes into account the interaction between genes as well as that between genes and the tool and thus is able find a very small set and can discover novel genes.
these genes can discover the subgroups correctly with unsupervised learning, can differentiate non-srbct samples and they perform equally well with other machine learning tools including support vector machines.
although the proposed method is tested on a srbct data set, it is quite general and can be applied to other cancer data sets.
our findings suggest the possibility of developing specialized microarray chips or use of real-time qpcr assays or antibody based methods such as elisa and western blot analysis for an easy and low cost diagnosis of the subgroups.
