despite uncovering evidence for selection, correlations between genetic diversity or differentiation with environmental factors  were weak.
preliminary evidence for selection underlying clade formation indicates that the nadh complex may be useful for examining adaptation and population structuring at a broader geographical scale.
there was evidence for significant positive selection, particularly in the nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes, and amino acids under significant selection in these genes explained some of the clade formation.
the mitochondrial genome is a likely target for selection in this system due to its functional role in metabolism.
we sequenced whole mitochondrial genomes for herring from throughout the baltic region  in order to investigate evidence for geographical structuring, selection, and associations between genetic and environmental variation.
despite strong environmental gradients  in the baltic sea, population genetic studies have shown little genetic differentiation among herring in this area, but some evidence for environmentally-induced selection has been uncovered.
the results indicate that most of the current mtdna diversity in herring predates the formation of the baltic sea, and that little structuring has evolved since.
three well-supported clades that predate the formation of the baltic sea were identified, but geographic structuring of this variation was weak .
marine fish, such as the atlantic herring , often show a low degree of differentiation over large geographical regions.
