furthermore the neuron-specific small gtpase rin is involved in downstream signaling of plexin b <dig>
both plexins mediate ca2+/mg2+-dependent cell aggregation due to homophilic trans-interaction, which is strong in the case of b <dig> and moderate for b <dig>  using different deletion constructs we show that the sema domain of b <dig> is essential for homophilic interaction.
unexpectedly, b <dig> strongly and b <dig> moderately stimulate neurite outgrowth of primary murine cerebellar neurons.
using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified the neuron-specific and calmodulin-binding ras-related gtpase rin as an interaction partner of the intracellular part of b <dig>  but not of b <dig>  rin, also known for its neurite outgrowth-inducing characteristics, co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with b <dig> in co-transfected cos- <dig> cells.
our data suggest an involvement of homophilic interaction of b <dig> in semaphorin-independent signaling mechanisms positively influencing neuronal morphogenesis or function.
plexins, known to date as receptors of semaphorins, are implicated in semaphorin-mediated axon repulsion and growth cone collapse.
