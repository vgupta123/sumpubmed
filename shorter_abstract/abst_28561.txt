the demand for energy due to the colonization of land  and the necessity to tolerate new conditions of abiotic stress may have changed the physiological constraints in the early terrestrial panpulmonates and triggered adaptations at the mitochondrial level.
we obtained three complete mitochondrial genomes of terrestrial panpulmonates, i.e., the ellobiid carychium tridentatum, and the stylommatophorans arion rufus and helicella itala.
the positively selected sites in our data are in agreement with previous results in vertebrates suggesting a general pattern of adaptation to the new metabolic requirements.
this clade comprises several groups that invaded the land realm independently and in different time periods, e.g., ellobioidea, systellomatophora, and stylommatophora.
the branch-site test of positive selection detected significant non-synonymous changes in the terrestrial branches leading to carychium  and stylommatophora.
thus, mitochondrial genomes of panpulmonate gastropods are promising to screen for adaptive molecular signatures related to land invasions.
the convergence of the non-synonymous changes in cob and nad <dig> suggest possible ancient episodes of positive selection related to adaptations to non-marine habitats.

the phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genes supports the monophyly of the clade panpulmonata.
