the obtained perspectives of distribution changes related to the segment lengths using the three key components suggest both the adequacy and the possibility of further progress on the prediction strategies used in the recent de novo structure-prediction methods.
the present results of the analyses of four protein structural classes show the universal role of three major components as segment conformational descriptors.
our statistical analyses of segment conformations and length revealed critical dual transitions in their conformational distribution with segments derived from all four structural classes.
iii) long segments  showed a distribution converging on one huge cluster containing compact conformations with a smaller radius of gyration.
we explored the relationships between the conformational distribution of segments and their lengths, and also protein structural classes using principal component analysis based on the intra-segment cα-cα atomic distances.
this distribution reflects the protein structures' organization and protein domains' origin.
nevertheless, the organization and nature of the conformational space of segments with intermediate length between short segments and domains remain unclear.
conformational spaces of intermediate length segments probably differ from those of short segments.
i) short segments  showed a distribution with a high frequency of secondary structure clusters.
dual transitions were identified with the intermediate phase between the short segments and domains.
many studies have examined rules governing two aspects of protein structures: short segments and proteins' structural domains.
we generated ensembles embedded in globular proteins comprising segments 10– <dig> residues long.
consequently, protein segment universes were categorized.
three major conformational components  well define most of the segment universes.
furthermore, we identified several conformational components that were unique to each structural class.
