the objectives of this study were to characterise the effect of i) abrupt weaning and ii) subsequent housing on the extended physiological and immunological responses of beef cows.
rectal body temperature was recorded and blood samples were obtained on i) d  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and subsequently on ii) d  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for physiological, haematological and immunological measurements.
rectal body temperature, neutrophil number and neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio increased  on d  <dig> compared with pre-weaning baseline.
post-housing, concentrations of cortisol, rectal body temperature, total leukocyte number, and glucose were unchanged .
a transitory increase in neutrophil number and decrease in lymphocyte number, increased neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio coupled with decreased interferon-Î³ production, and increased concentration of acute phase proteins indicate a stress response in cows post-weaning, whereas post-housing, changes were less marked.
lymphocyte and neutrophil number decreased  on d  <dig> to  <dig> and d  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively, compared with pre-weaning baseline.
on d  <dig> post-housing, neutrophil number and neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio increased , whereas lymphocyte number and concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone, fibrinogen and non-esterified fatty acid decreased  compared with pre-housing baseline.
an increase  in acute phase proteins, fibrinogen and haptoglobin was evident on d  <dig> to  <dig> compared with pre-weaning baseline.
concentration of glucose increased on d  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas non-esterified fatty acid decreased on d  <dig> to  <dig> compared with pre-weaning baseline.
