we document circadian rhythms in multiple molecular pathways essential for growth, development, immune response, detoxification/pesticide resistance.
circadian rhythms were also noted in ribosomal protein genes used for normalization in reverse transcribed pcr  to determine transcript abundance.
transcripts were quantified in adult female heads at  <dig> hours and then again at  <dig> hours and eight subsequent time points spaced four hours apart.
these results argue strongly that transcriptional analyses either need to be made over time periods rather than confining analyses to a single time point or development stage or exceptional care needs to be made to synchronize all mosquitoes to be analyzed and compared among treatment groups.
aedes aegypti is arguably the most studied of all mosquito species in the laboratory and is the primary vector of both dengue and yellow fever flaviviruses in the field.
circadian gene expression in mosquito species has been previously reported but for only a few genes directly involved in the function of the molecular clock.
a large number of transcriptional studies have been made in the species and these usually report transcript quantities observed at a certain age or stage of development.
we report pervasive oscillations and intricate synchronization patterns relevant to all known biological pathways.
however, circadian oscillation is an important characteristic of gene expression in many animals and plants, modulating both their physiology and behavior.
