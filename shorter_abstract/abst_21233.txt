to investigate the intra-species diversity of s. flexneri genomes further, we have sequenced the complete genome of s. flexneri 5b strain  <dig>  and compared it with s. flexneri 2a .
shi- <dig> was subsequently deleted from the s. flexneri 5b genome by recombination, but stabilized in the s. flexneri 2a genome.
our data show that the two s. flexneri genomes are very similar, which suggests a high level of structural and functional conservation between the two serotypes.
the ancestor of s. flexneri probably acquired shi- <dig> and shi- <dig> before shi-o was integrated and the serotypes diverged.
these events may have contributed to the differences in pathogenicity and epidemicity between the two serotypes of s. flexneri.
the differences reflect different selection pressures during evolution.
shi- <dig> is involved in one intra-replichore inversion near the origin of replication, which may change the expression of iut/iuc genes.
the bacteriophage sfv segment remaining in shi-o of sf <dig> is clearly larger than the remnants of bacteriophage sfii in sf <dig>  shi- <dig> is absent from sf <dig> but a specific related protein is found next to the phev locus.
five shigella genomes have been sequenced, revealing dynamic and diverse features.
moreover, genes related to the glycine-betaine biosynthesis pathway are present only in sf <dig> among the known shigella genomes.
