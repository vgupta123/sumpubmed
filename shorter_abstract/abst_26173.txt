previously, nucleotide sequence alignments of lscb/c variants in various p. syringae showed that a ~450-bp phage-associated promoter element  including the first  <dig> nucleotides of the orf is absent in lsca.
glycinea pg <dig> is an opportunistic plant pathogen which causes bacterial blight of soybean plants.
a fusion, respectively, showed levan formation while the transformant carrying lsca
we propose that lsca might be an ancestral levansucrase variant upstream of which the pape got inserted by potentially phage-mediated transposition events leading to expression of levansucrase in p. syringae.
it produces the exopolysaccharide levan by the enzyme levansucrase.
herein, we tested whether this upstream region is responsible for the expression of lscb/c and lsca.
a fusion of the pape with the orf of lsca  was generated and introduced to a levan-negative mutant of pg <dig>  additionally, fusions comprising of the non-coding part of the upstream region of lscb with lsca  or the upstream region of lsca with lscb  were generated.
in contrast, the upstream region of lsca does not lead to expression of lscb.
