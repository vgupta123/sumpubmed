in addition we use a comprehensive plasmid library of mhc class iib alleles to determine the nucleotide sequence of alleles represented by rsca allele peaks.
we present a genotyping protocol that uses reference strand-mediated conformation analysis , optimised for recently duplicated mhc class iib genes that are typical for many fish and bird species, including the three-spined stickleback, gasterosteus aculeatus.
it therefore provides a valuable tool to employ this highly polymorphic and adaptive marker in future high-throughput studies of host-parasite co-evolution and ecological speciation in this emerging model organism.
in all jawed vertebrates, highly polymorphic genes of the major histocompatibility complex  encode antigen presenting molecules that play a key role in the adaptive immune response.
analysis of the plasmid library additionally reveals the high resolution and reproducibility of the rsca technique.
experimental evidence is accumulating that mhc polymorphism is a result of balancing selection by parasites and pathogens.
this new rsca genotyping protocol offers a fast, but sensitive and reliable way to determine the mhc allele repertoire of three-spined sticklebacks.
