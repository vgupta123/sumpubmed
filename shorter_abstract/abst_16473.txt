the most widely used visualization tool is the ucsc genome browser that introduced the custom track concept that enabled researchers to simultaneously visualize gene expression at a particular locus from multiple experiments.
this paper introduces a visualization tool  that incorporates and extends the functionality of the ucsc genome browser.
the features of rnaseqbrowser:  rnaseqbrowser integrates ucsc genome browser and ngs visualization tools such as igv.
it extends the functionality of the ucsc genome browser by adding several new types of tracks to show ngs data such as individual raw reads, snps and indels.
this will be helpful for visualizing multiple datasets simultaneously.
for example, rnaseqbrowser simultaneously displays read coverage, snps, indels and raw read tracks with other bed and wiggle tracks -- all being dynamically built from the bam file.
paired reads are also connected in the browser to enable easier identification of novel exon/intron borders and chimaeric transcripts.
strand specific rnaseq data is also supported by rnaseqbrowser that displays reads above  or below  a central line.
strand specific rnaseq data is now more common in rnaseq projects.
visualizing rnaseq data has become an important matter in analysis of sequencing data.
our objective of the software tool is to provide friendly interface for visualization of rnaseq datasets.
overlaying ngs wiggle data is helpful in displaying differential expression and is simple to implement in rnaseqbrowser.
finally, rnaseqbrowser was designed for ease of use for users with few bioinformatic skills, and incorporates the features of many genome browsers into one platform.
