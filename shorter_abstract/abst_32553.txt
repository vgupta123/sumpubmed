taken together, these results suggest a potential role for ampk on the secretion of melatonin probably acting trough the paraventricular nucleus and/or directly in the pineal gland.
metformin and aicar both reduced  the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion.
we conclude that ampk may act as a metabolic cue to modulate the rhythm of melatonin secretion.
considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of ampk in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular  injection of two activators of ampk, metformin and aicar, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness.
injection of aicar only tended  to increase the levels of phosphorylated ampk in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated acc in the paraventricular nucleus  and in the pineal gland .
in seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction.
aicar on the phosphorylation of ampk and acetyl-coa carboxylase , a downstream target of ampk, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.
