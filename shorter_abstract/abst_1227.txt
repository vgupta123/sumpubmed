pearson correlation is quite susceptible to outliers, however, an unfortunate characteristic when dealing with microarray data
when dealing with microarray data, which are known to be quite noisy, robust methods should be used.
we give results which demonstrate that our correlation metric is much more resistant than the pearson correlation while being more efficient than other nonparametric measures of correlation  additionally, our method gives a systematic gene flagging procedure which is useful when dealing with large amounts of noisy data.
the resistant metric is simply the correlation obtained from a resistant covariance matrix of scale.
typically, pearson correlation is used to measure distance  before implementing a clustering algorithm.
specifically, robust distances, including the biweight correlation, should be used in clustering and gene network analysis.
we propose a resistant similarity metric based on tukey's biweight estimate of multivariate scale and location.
