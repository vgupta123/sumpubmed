earthworms  are a diverse group of annelids of substantial ecological and economic importance.
therefore, the near global distribution of earthworms reflects an old and likely complex evolutionary history.
we use a series of differentially filtered data matrices and analyses to examine the effects of data partitioning, missing data, compositional and branch-length heterogeneity, and outgroup inclusion.
divergence time analysis results are concordant with the hypothesis that these north-south splits are the result of the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea.
the topology supports two major earthworm clades, each of which consists of a northern hemisphere subclade and a southern hemisphere subclade.
these results support several recently proposed revisions to the classical understanding of earthworm phylogeny, reveal two major clades that seem to reflect pangaean distributions, and raise new questions about earthworm evolutionary relationships.

despite a long-standing interest in crassiclitellata, relationships among and within major clades remain unresolved.
in this study, we evaluate crassiclitellate phylogenetic relationships using  <dig> new transcriptomes in combination with publicly available transcriptome data.
