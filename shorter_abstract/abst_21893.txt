we studied the association of il- <dig> and il-10rβ gene polymorphisms with the occurrence of gvhd in  <dig> hla-identical sibling donor and recipient pairs.
on the other hand, a combination of same genotypic il- <dig> production with patient il-10rβ a/a genotype protected from chronic gvhd .
our results suggest that il- <dig> and il-10rβ genes have a synergistic effect on the risk of gvhd.
the difference in genotypic il- <dig> production between patient and donor in combination with patient il-10rβ a/a genotype predisposed strongly to acute gvhd .
extensive allelic matching in the human leukocyte antigen  genes is regarded as a prerequisite for good clinical success of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation .
