random forests are generally capable of capturing gene-gene interactions, but current variable importance measures are unable to detect them as interactions.
with the permutation importance, the proportion of captured interactions was lower in all cases.
in extensive simulation studies, we investigate whether random forest variable importance measures capture or detect gene-gene interactions.
of the single importance measures, the gini importance captured interaction effects in most of the simulated scenarios, however, they were masked by marginal effects in other variables.
pairwise importance measures performed about equal, with a slight advantage for the joint variable importance method.
random forests have often been claimed to uncover interaction effects.
consequently, caution is warranted when claiming that random forests uncover interactions.

however, if and how interaction effects can be differentiated from marginal effects remains unclear.
in almost all scenarios the detection fraction in a model with only marginal effects was larger than in a model with an interaction effect only.
in most of the cases, interactions are masked by marginal effects and interactions cannot be differentiated from marginal effects.
with capturing interactions, we define the ability to identify a variable that acts through an interaction with another one, while detection is the ability to identify an interaction effect as such.
