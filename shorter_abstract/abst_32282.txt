nine mutants, with mutations predicted to alter residues that bind the guanine base or coordinate magnesium, did not produce detectable mgla.
to identify residues critical for mgla function or potential protein interactions, and explore the function of thr <dig>  the phenotypes of  <dig> mgla mutants were characterized.
these two mutants were predicted to alter surface residues at asp <dig> and thr <dig>  which suggests that these residues are critical for proper localization and may define a protein interaction site.
proper localization of mgla is critical for both motility and development and likely involves protein interactions mediated by residues asp <dig> and thr <dig>
mgla and its homologs differ from all eukaryotic and other prokaryotic gtpases because they have a threonine  in place of the highly conserved aspartate residue of the consensus pm <dig>  region.
our results suggest that gtp binding is critical for stability of mgla because mgla does not accumulate in mutants that cannot bind gtp.
merodiploid constructs revealed that a subset of alleles, including mglad52a, were dominant and also illustrated that changing the balance of mgla and its co-transcribed partner, mglb, affects a-motility.
the localization pattern of mgla was abolished in two mutants that were mot- spo- and dev-.
the mgla gene from the bacterium myxococcus xanthus encodes a 22kda protein related to the ras superfamily of monomeric gtpases.
