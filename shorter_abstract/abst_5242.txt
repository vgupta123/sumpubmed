considerable uncertainty exists about the efficiency and accuracy of statistical approaches used for rnai hit selection in drug sensitivity studies.
in this study, we carried out a simulation study to evaluate four types of statistical approaches  with different scenarios of rnai screenings for drug sensitivity studies.
we assessed promising methods using real data from a loss-of-function rnai screen to identify hits that modulate paclitaxel sensitivity in breast cancer cells.
based on the results of the simulation study, we then make recommendations of statistical analysis methods for high-throughput rnai screening data in different scenarios.
in this paper, we make recommendations to enable more objective selection of statistical analysis methods for high-throughput rnai screening data.
with the simulated datasets, the linear model resulted in significantly lower false-negative and false-positive rates.
however, applying an inappropriate statistical method or model to the rnai screening data will result in decreased power to detect the true hits and increase false positive and false negative rates, leading researchers to draw incorrect conclusions.
researchers require statistical methods suitable for analyzing high-throughput rnai screening data that will reduce false-positive and false-negative rates.
researchers therefore can further identify drug-sensitive targets and novel drug combinations that sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.
rnai screening can identify druggable targets and novel drug combinations that can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.
