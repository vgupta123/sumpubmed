analyzing predicted mrna targets of mir- <dig> identified  <dig> candidate target genes that regulate processes including cell cycle control, calcium signaling, and neuregulin signaling in hvc.
our results identify potential mir–mrna regulatory networks related to adult neurogenesis and provide opportunities to discover novel genetic control of the diverse biological processes and factors related to the functional incorporation of new neurons to the adult brain.
adult neurogenesis and the incorporation of adult-born neurons into functional circuits requires precise spatiotemporal coordination across molecular networks regulating a wide array of processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, neurotrophin signaling, and electrical activity.
to test the hypothesis that mirs related to adult neurogenesis and related cellular processes are functionally regulated in the nuclei of the avian song control circuit, we used microarray analyses to quantify changes in expression of mirs and predicted target mrnas in the telencephalic nuclei hvc, the robust nucleus of arcopallium , and the basal ganglia homologue area x in breeding and nonbreeding gambel’s white-crowned sparrows .
mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> showed the highest differential expression in hvc and area x, respectively.

micrornas  - short, non-coding rna sequences that alter gene expression by post-transcriptional inhibition or degradation of mrna sequences - may be involved in the global coordination of such diverse biological processes.
we identified  <dig> different mirs that were differentially expressed across seasons in the song nuclei.
likewise, mir- <dig> was predicted to target  <dig> mrnas differentially expressed across seasons that regulate serotonin, gaba, and dopamine receptor signaling and inflammation.
