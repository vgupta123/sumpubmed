hetr is expressed at a basal level in all cells but its expression increases in differentiating cells early after nitrogen deprivation.
the promoter region for asr <dig> was expressed transiently in differentiating heterocysts, alr <dig> was upregulated in heterocysts, asl <dig> was expressed in vegetative cells, and alr <dig> was derepressed in vegetative cells of a hetr mutant strain.
the in vivo chip-seq analysis of hetrâ€™s regulon suggests a possible role for hetr in vegetative cells in addition to its role in heterocyst development.
we identified novel dna binding targets of tagged hetr-6xhis and defined a consensus hetr binding site from these hetr target sequences.
in addition to identifying known hetr target genes hetr and hetp, the chip-seq data were used to identify new potential hetr targets and to define a consensus hetr-binding site.
we employed chromatin pull-down and deep sequencing  to globally identify hetr dna targets in vivo at six hours after fixed-nitrogen deprivation.
hetr binds in vitro to dna fragments upstream of several genes upregulated in heterocysts, including hetz, hetp, hepa, pats, pkne, and hetr itself.
hetr is required for heterocyst development, and therefore nitrogen fixation and diazotrophic growth.
hetr binds an inverted repeat sequence upstream of a few of these genes; however, hetr binds to promoters that do not contain this sequence, such as the promoter regions for pats and pkne.
overexpression of hetr leads to multiple contiguous heterocysts .
heterocyst differentiation is regulated by a homodimeric transcription factor, hetr.
