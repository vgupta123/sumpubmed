our comprehensive analysis enables us to draw broader conclusions about the role of single-repeat r <dig> myb gene family than were possible in the earlier studies, and reveals the genetic basis of organ-specific control of trichome formation.
on the other hand, etc <dig> and etc <dig> participate in controlling trichome formation on inflorescence stems and pedicles.
further, we discovered that single-repeat r <dig> mybs suppress trichome formation on cotyledons and siliques, organs that normally do not bear any trichomes.
however, each of the previous studies of these single-repeat r <dig> mybs has been limited to an analysis of only a subset of these six genes, and furthermore, they have limited their attention to epidermal development in only one or two of the organs.
in addition, the transcriptional regulation of these single-repeat r <dig> myb genes remains largely unknown.
by analyzing multiple mutant lines, we report here that tcl <dig> functions redundantly with other single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors to control both leaf trichome and root hair formation.
our findings imply the presence of multiple mechanisms regulating the transcription of single-repeat r <dig> myb genes, and provide new insight into the lateral inhibition mechanism that mediates epidermal cell patterning.
previous studies indicate that these single-repeat r <dig> mybs regulate epidermal cell patterning.
sequence analysis of the arabidopsis genome using the blast program reveals that there are a total of six genes, including triptychon , caprice , trichomeless <dig> , and enhancer of try and cpc  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  encoding single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors that are approximately 50% identical to one another at the amino acid level.
single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors are critical components of the lateral inhibition machinery that mediates epidermal cell patterning in plants.
