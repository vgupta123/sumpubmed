some of metabolic products such as amino/nitro containing chlorinated aromatic compounds can be determined by gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detector .
a rapid, sensitive and simple hplc based analytical method was developed for the analysis of pcnb, hcb and their possible intermediates.
the extraction of pcnb and hcb from soil and minimal salt medium was carried out with ethyl acetate and hexane respectively with good recoveries .
the validation of the proposed extraction and hplc method was done by analysis of pcnb and hcb biodegradation and their metabolites identification from anaerobic enriched soil samples.
however, it is difficult to identify some of chlorophenolic and chloroquinolic intermediates produced from pcnb and hcb by the above mentioned technique.
