this proposition was inferred by means of statistical methods.
in addition to the examination of individual positions, the investigation of co-variation of amino acid frequencies offers insights into function and evolution of the protein and residues.
we introduce conn, a novel parameter for the characterisation of individual residues.
the algorithms h2r, which analyses msas and computes conn-values, characterises a specific class of residues.
a multiple sequence alignment  generated for a protein can be used to characterise residues by means of a statistical analysis of single columns.
these signals were deduced from a normalised mutual information  value u computed for all pairs of residues k, l. we demonstrate that conn is a more robust indicator than an individual mi-value for the prediction of residues most plausibly important for the evolution of a protein.
for each residue k, conn is the number of most extreme signals of co-evolution.
