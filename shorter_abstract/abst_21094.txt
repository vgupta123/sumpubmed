we ran our algorithm on several large comparative analyses to evaluate its effectiveness; one compared  <dig> vertebrate genomes where we find  <dig> ultraconserved elements longer than  <dig> bps shared by all of the organisms, and another compared the human body louse, pediculus humanus humanus, against itself and select insects to find thousands of non-coding, potentially functional sequences.
studies indicate that these conserved regions are associated with micro rnas, mrna processing, development and transcription regulation.
ultraconserved elements are nucleotide or protein sequences with 100% identity  in the same organism or between two or more organisms.
whole genome comparative analysis for multiple organisms is both feasible and desirable in our search for biological knowledge.
our algorithm shows how a compromise design with a trade-off of disk space versus memory space allows for efficient computation while only requiring modest computer resources, and at the same time providing benefits not available with other software.
the algorithm is significantly faster than blast and is designed to handle very large genomes efficiently.
we describe an algorithm and provide freely available software which can find all of the ultraconserved sequences between genomes of multiple organisms.
we argue that bioinformatic programs should be forward thinking by assuming analysis on multiple  genomes in the design and implementation of algorithms.
