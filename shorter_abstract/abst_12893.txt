here we analyzed the global transcriptome of cultured astroglial cells incubated with activators of camp pathways.
therefore, a positive modulation of camp signaling may promote the normal state of differentiated astrocytes and favor the protection and function of neuronal networks.
camp analogs strongly upregulated genes involved in typical functions of mature astrocytes, such as homeostatic control, metabolic and structural support to neurons, antioxidant defense and communication, whereas they downregulated a considerable number of proliferating and immaturity-related transcripts.

gsea analysis contrasting gene expression profiles with transcriptome signatures of acutely isolated astrocytes and in situ evaluation of protein levels in these cells showed that camp signaling conferred mature and in vivo–like transcriptional features to cultured astrocytes.
these results indicate that camp signaling is a key pathway promoting astrocyte maturation and restricting their developmental and activation features.
moreover, numerous genes typically activated in reactive cells, such as scar components and immunological mediators, were repressed by camp.
