by studying the unfolding process of the protein g and protein l under the property space, we find that the two proteins have the similar unfolding pathways that can be divided into three types and the one which with the umbrella-shape represents the preferred pathway.
moreover, the unfolding simulation time of the two proteins is different and protein l unfolding faster than protein g. additionally, the distributing area of unfolded state ensemble of protein l is larger than that of protein g.
under the physical property space, the protein g and protein l have the similar folding/unfolding behaviors, which agree with the previous results obtained from the studies under cartesian coordinate space.
we construct physical property space with twelve different physical properties.
the folding/unfolding behaviors of proteins which have similar topologies have been studied under cartesian space and the results indicate that some proteins share the similar folding/unfolding characters.
the studies on protein folding/unfolding indicate that the native state topology is an important determinant of protein folding mechanism.
