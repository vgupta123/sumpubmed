the frequencies of major grooming and weeding behaviors co-varied with symbiont/host combinations, showing that ant behavior also was affected when cuticular actinomycete phylotypes were swapped.
these results show that the interactions between leaf-cutting ants and pseudonocardia bear signatures of mutual co-adaptation within a single ant population.
in addition to cultivating fungus gardens, these ants have domesticated actinomycete bacteria to defend gardens against the fungal parasite escovopsis and possibly other pathogens.
we show that pseudonocardia readily colonized ants irrespective of their colony of origin, but that the ps <dig> phylotype, which was previously shown to be better able to maintain its monocultural integrity after workers became foragers than ps <dig>  reached a higher final cover when grown on its native host than on alternative hosts.
