in this study, we compared the ability of these vehicles to induce rat sciatic nerve regeneration with the intent of finding the least active or inert substance.
the right sciatic nerve was exposed, and an incision was made that created a 10â€‰mm gap between the distal and proximal stumps.
after  <dig> days, the sciatic nerve was removed.

experimental models use tubulisation with a silicone tube to research regenerative factors and substances to induce regeneration.
a silicone tube was grafted onto each stump, and the tubes were filled with the respective media.
axonal regeneration depends on many factors, such as the type of injury and repair, age, distance from the cell body and distance of the denervated muscle, loss of surrounding tissue and the type of injured nerve.
we evaluated the formation of a regeneration cable, nerve fibre growth, and the functional viability of the regenerated fibres.
comparison among the three vehicles showed that  <dig> % agarose gels had almost no effect on provoking the regeneration of peripheral nerves and that 4% agarose gels completely prevented fibre growth.
in the appropriate concentration, agarose gel may be an important vehicle for testing factors that induce regeneration without interfering with nerve growth.
the others substances were associated with profuse nerve fibre growth.
