expanding pwms to include sequence context-dependence will increase the information content in pwms and facilitate a more efficient functional identification and dissection of crms.
in this proof-of-principle study, we analyze  <dig> crms and focus on four tfs that control transcription of target genes along the anterio-posterior axis of the embryo early in development.
gene expression in the drosophila embryo is controlled by functional interactions between a large network of protein transcription factors  and specific sequences in dna cis-regulatory modules .
