we found three hundred and six genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis, including one hundred and ninty-two ketoacyl synthase transcripts, which formed five unique phylogenetic clusters.
this work represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the genetic basis of polyketide production in dinoflagellates, in particular, species responsible for ciguatera fish poisoning.
the gene catalogues comprised  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique contigs, with genome sizes of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gbp and 35 ±  <dig>  gbp, respectively, and are amongst the most comprehensive yet reported from a dinoflagellate.
here, we report the toxicity, genome size, gene content and transcriptome of gambierdiscus australes and g. belizeanus.
g. australes produced maitotoxin- <dig> and maitotoxin- <dig>  while g. belizeanus produced maitotoxin- <dig>  for which cell extracts were toxic to mice by ip injection .
genes associated with the biosynthesis of polyether ladder compounds are yet to be elucidated, however, stable isotope feeding studies of such compounds consistently support their polyketide origin indicating that polyketide synthases are involved in their biosynthesis.
species of gambierdiscus produce the polyether ladder compounds ciguatoxins and maitotoxins, which can lead to ciguatera fish poisoning, a serious human illness associated with reef fish consumption.
