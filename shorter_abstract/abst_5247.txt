rt-pcr experiments indicated that the four genes  constitute a transcriptional unit.
the results of this study confirm that mgob, mgoc, mgoa and mgod function as a transcriptional unit and operon.
mangotoxin is an antimetabolite toxin that is produced by strains of pseudomonas syringae pv.
additionally, extract complementation resulted in a recovery of mangotoxin production when the defective mutant was complemented with wild-type extracts.
in the present study, we performed a rt-pcr analysis, insertional inactivation mutagenesis, a promoter expression analysis and terminator localisation to study the gene cluster containing the mgoa gene.
this operon is similar in genetic organisation to those in the three other p. syringae pathovars for which complete genomes are available .
the toxin is an oligopeptide that inhibits ornithine n-acetyl transferase , a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the essential amino acids ornithine and arginine.
a promoter sequence was located upstream of the mgob gene and was found to drive lacz transcription.
syringae; mangotoxin-producing strains are primarily isolated from mango tissues with symptoms of bacterial apical necrosis.
two terminators were located downstream of the mgod gene.
the involvement of a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene  in mangotoxin production and virulence has been reported.
additionally, we evaluated the importance of mgoc, mgoa and mgod in mangotoxin production.
while this operon is composed of four genes, only the last three are directly involved in mangotoxin production.
a sequence analysis revealed an operon-like organisation.
