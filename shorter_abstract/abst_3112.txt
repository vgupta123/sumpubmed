this paper demonstrates how ets- <dig>  a key transcription factor for trophoblast differentiation and function, can control expression of two genes  having similar spatial and temporal expression patterns via very different mechanisms.
as with the ifnt promoter, the tkdp- <dig> promoter is responsive to ets- <dig>  and promoter-driven reporter activity can be increased over 700-fold in response to over-expression of ets- <dig> and a constitutively active form of protein kinase a .
unexpectedly, the promoter element of tkdp- <dig> responsible for this up-regulation, unlike that of the ifnt, does not bind ets- <dig>  however, mutation of a ccaat/enhancer binding element within this control region not only reduced basal transcriptional activity, but prevented ets- <dig> as well as cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate /pka and ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase  responsiveness.
our goal here has been to determine whether the ovine  tkdp- <dig> and ifnt genes possess a similar transcriptional code.
a combination of ets- <dig> and c/ebp-Î² can up-regulate expression of the minimal tkdp- <dig> promoter as much as 930-fold in presence of a camp analog.
tkdp- <dig> shares an almost identical expression pattern with interferon-tau, the "maternal recognition of pregnancy protein" in ruminants.
