we release 4273π, an operating system image for raspberry pi based on raspbian linux.
this includes minor customisations for classroom use and includes our open access bioinformatics course, 4273π bioinformatics for biologists.
we propose that this may be taught by running the course on gnu/linux running on inexpensive raspberry pi computer hardware, for which students may be granted full administrator access.
this is based on the final-year undergraduate module bl <dig>  run on raspberry pi computers at the university of st andrews, semester  <dig>  academic year 2012– <dig>
