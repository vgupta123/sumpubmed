lab isolated from a range of traditional fermented products were screened for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances.
kp <dig>  was found to be catalase-negative, able to produce Î²-galactosidase, resistant to bile salts  and acidic conditions , and susceptible to most antibiotics.
lactic acid bacteria  can be isolated from traditional milk products.

eleven lab isolates that produced antimicrobial substances were identified as lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and pediococcus acidilactici strains by biochemical methods and 16s rdna gene sequencing.
traditionally prepared fermented milk products are good sources of lab with characteristics suitable for industrial applications.
of these, the cell-free supernatant of kp <dig>  most strongly inhibited listeria monocytogenes.
a total of  <dig> lab strains were isolated from fermented milk products in the form of fresh curds, dried curds, and ghara , and fermented cocoa bean.
