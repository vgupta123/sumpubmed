the rapid spread of helitrons among animal lineages by htt is facilitated by shuttling in viral particles or by unknown mechanisms mediated by close organism associations .
the movement of mobile elements among species by horizontal transposon transfer  influences the evolution of genomes through the modification of structure and function.

helitrons are a relatively new lineage of dna-based  transposable elements  that propagate by rolling-circle replication, and are capable of acquiring host dna.
integrated helitrons retained ≥ 65% sequence identity over a 250 bp consensus, and were predicted to retain secondary structures inclusive of a 3′-hairpin and a 5′-subterminal inverted repeat.
a non-autonomous helitron independently annotated as bmhel- <dig> from bombyx mori and the mite <dig> element from ostrinia nubilalis was predicted in the genomes of  <dig> species in the insect order lepidoptera.
