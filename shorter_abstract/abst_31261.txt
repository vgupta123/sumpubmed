lactis had the highest survival rate  attaining approximately  <dig> Ã—  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> compared to the other tested bifidobacteria strains which were reduced by a factor of up to  <dig>  lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> was less resistant than b. animalis subsp.
of the tested bifidobacteria strains, only b. animalis subsp.
similar results were achieved with b. longum subsp.
the advantage of this automated one reactor system was the ability to test the influence of acid, bile salts and pancreatin.
in this study, a single reactor system was used to evaluate the survival of l. gasseri k <dig> and selected bifidobacteria from our collection through the stomach-intestine passage.
these initial results were confirmed in the bioreactor model of the stomach-intestine passage.
in this study, we were able to show that l. gasseri k <dig> had a high survival rate in the stomach-intestine passage.
by comparing the results with a previous study in piglets we could confirm the reliability of our simulation.
initial screening for acid resistance in acidified culture media showed a low tolerance of bifidobacterium dentium for this condition indicating low survival in the passage.
probiotic bacteria are thought to play an important role in the digestive system and therefore have to survive the passage from stomach to intestines.
lactis showed acceptable survival for a successful passage in the simulation system.
