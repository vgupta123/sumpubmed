in this study the recently developed specific length amplified fragment sequencing  technology was employed to construct a high-density genetic linkage map and locate a sex determining locus for u. pinnatifida.
this map will facilitate the further fundamental and applied research such as qtl mapping and map-based gene clone in u. pinnatifida and provide a reference for studies in other kelp species.
a high-density genetic map is a basic tool for fundamental and applied research such as discovery of functional genes and mapping of quantitative trait loci .
after linkage analysis  <dig> slaf markers were mapped onto the genetic map.
after adding the sex linked simple sequence repeat  marker , the final genetic map was  <dig>  cm long, consisting of  <dig> linkage groups with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers.

a major sex associated qtl was mapped to lg <dig> within a window starting at  <dig>  cm and ending at  <dig>  cm with a total of  <dig> slaf markers.
the ssr marker and five slaf markers  were identified as tightly sex-linked markers, as indicated by the absence of recombination between them and the sex phenotype.
undaria pinnatifida is an important economic brown alga in east asian countries.
for the first time, a major sex associated qtl suggesting a sex determining region was mapped to a single lg.
a high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using slaf-seq technique and f <dig> gametophyte population for the first time in the economically important brown alga u. pinnatifida.
