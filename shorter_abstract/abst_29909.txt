intermittent tdcs over lateral prefrontal cortex during a working memory task impairs central nervous processing related to response selection and preparation.
weak transcortical direct current stimulation  applied to the cortex can shift the membrane potential of superficial neurons thereby modulating cortical excitability and activity.
we conclude that this decrease in performance by our protocol of intermittent stimulation results from an interference mainly with the temporal dynamics of cortical processing as indexed by event-related sustained and oscillatory eeg activity such as theta.
however, reaction time was slowed during both anodal and cathodal stimulation as compared to placebo  indicating that real stimulation hampered neuronal processing related to response selection and preparation.
reaction time linearly increased with increasing set size.
the slope of this increase was closely comparable for real and sham stimulation indicating that our real stimulation did not effect time required for memory scanning.
we applied anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current  stimulation  bilaterally at fronto-cortical electrode sites on the scalp over  <dig> min repeatedly  as well as sham-tdcs while subjects performed a modified sternberg task.
