when compared with fully sequenced plant genomes, the flax unigenes resembled poplar and castor bean more than grape, sorghum, rice or arabidopsis.
here, we describe flax embryo and seed development and generation of comprehensive genomic resources for the flax seed.
digital analyses revealed gene expression dynamics for the biosynthesis of a number of important seed constituents during seed development.
these est libraries included transcription factor genes that are typically expressed at low levels, indicating that the depth is adequate for in silico expression analysis.
flax seeds are also well-known for their nutritional attributes, viz., omega- <dig> fatty acids in the oil and lignans and mucilage from the seed coat.
flax, linum usitatissimum l., is an important crop whose seed oil and stem fiber have multiple industrial applications.
this has allowed us to delineate the spatio-temporal aspects of gene expression underlying the biosynthesis of a number of important seed constituents in flax.
we have developed a foundational database of expressed sequences and collection of plasmid clones that comprise even low-expressed genes such as those encoding transcription factors.
collectively, the  <dig> libraries we have used provide a broad representation of genes active in developing embryos  seed coats  and endosperm  and genes expressed in flowers, etiolated seedlings, leaves, and stem tissue.
we describe a large-scale generation and analysis of expressed sequences in various tissues.
