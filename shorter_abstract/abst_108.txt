we showed that the proposed algorithm performs better than other known algorithms on both real and synthetic datasets.
however, these algorithms depend on different input parameters for generating groups.
to study a biological phenomenon such as finding mechanism of disease, common methodology is to generate the microarray data in different relevant conditions and find groups of genes co-expressed across conditions from such data.
we have also shown its application on a temporal microarray dataset by extracting biclusters and biological information hidden in those biclusters.
it can be used to find these groups in different data types such as microarray, proteomics, metabolomics etc.
these groups might enable us to find biological processes involved in a disease condition.
for real datasets, it is difficult to use these algorithms due to unknown values of these parameters.
however, more detailed understanding can be made when information of a biological process associated with a particular condition is obtained from the data.
