neuropeptide research using high-throughput technologies such as microarray and mass spectrometry require accurate annotation of prohormone genes and products.
our bioinformatics approach identified  <dig> cattle prohormone genes, with  <dig> of these supported by expressed sequence tags.
microarray analysis revealed the differential expression of  <dig> prohormone genes in the liver associated with nutritional status and  <dig> prohormone genes in the placentome of embryos generated using different reproductive techniques.
a substantial increase in the number of cattle prohormone genes identified and insights into the expression profiles of neuropeptide genes were obtained from the integration of bioinformatics tools and database resources and gene expression information.
these peptides result from the complex processing of prohormone proteins, making their characterization both challenging and resource demanding.
approximately  <dig> prohormones with no empirical evidence were detected and the prohormone cleavage sites were predicted with high accuracy.
in fact, only  <dig> neuropeptide genes have been empirically confirmed in cattle.
the complete set of cattle prohormone sequences identified and the cleavage prediction approaches are available at .
prohormone cleavage sites were predicted using several complementary cleavage prediction models and validated against known cleavage sites in cattle and other species.
functional neuropeptide characterization was based on gene expression profiles from microarray experiments.
complementary bioinformatic resources were integrated in the first survey of the cattle neuropeptide complement.
however, the annotation and associated prediction efforts, when based solely on sequence homology to species with known neuropeptides, can be problematic.
