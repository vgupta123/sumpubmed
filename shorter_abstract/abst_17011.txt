all  <dig> completely sequenced arthropods, including the twelve sequenced drosophila species, contain a species-specific set of motor proteins.
after this group the rust-red flour beetle tribolium castaneum and the silkworm bombyx mori diverged very closely from the lineage leading to the drosophila species.
motor proteins have extensively been studied in the past and consist of large superfamilies.
the louse pediculus humanus corporis is the closest relative to daphnia followed by the group of the honeybee apis mellifera and the jewel wasp nasonia vitripennis.
except for the dynein light chains and the p <dig> dynactin subunit they contain single gene copies of the other subunits.
the myosins are in almost all cases clear paralogs, and thus the evolution of the arthropod myosin inventory is mainly determined by gene losses.
in contrast to the myosins, the evolution of the arthropod kinesin inventory is not only determined by gene losses but also by many subtaxon-specific and species-specific gene duplications.
here, we present the comparative genomic analysis of the motor protein repertoire of  <dig> completely sequenced arthropod species using the owl limpet lottia gigantea as outgroup.
arthropod species contain up to  <dig> kinesins spread over  <dig> classes.
the phylogenetic analysis of all genes as well as the protein repertoire placed daphnia pulex closest to the root of the arthropoda.
