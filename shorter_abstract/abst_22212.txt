by using a published human tissue dataset, we compared the tissue-specific expression and splicing detected by affymetrix exon arrays with those detected based on expressed sequence databases.
in this study, we showed that plier summarization led to over-estimation of gene-level expression changes, relative to exon-level expression changes, in two-group comparisons.
moreover, we observed abnormal summarization results when using the plier algorithm, indicating that mathematical problems, such as numerical instability, may affect plier performance.
we found the tendency of plier was not supported by the expressed sequence data.
affymetrix exon arrays are a commercialized platform used to detect alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale.
two probe summarization algorithms, plier  and rma , are commonly used to compute gene-level and exon-level expression values.
we showed that the tendency of plier in detection of alternative splicing is likely caused by a technical bias in the approach, rather than a biological bias.
however, a systematic comparison of these two algorithms on their effects on high-level analysis of the arrays has not yet been reported.
