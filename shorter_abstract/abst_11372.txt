expression stability was examined by rt-qpcr across  <dig> biological samples, representing tissues at various developmental stages, varied photoperiodic treatments, and a range of soybean cultivars.
for six different cultivars in long day  and short day , their expression stability did not vary significantly with act <dig>  ukn <dig> and tub <dig> being the most stable genes.
housekeeping genes are routinely employed for this purpose, but their expression level cannot be assumed to remain constant under all possible experimental conditions.
none of the candidate reference genes was uniformly expressed across all experimental conditions, and the most suitable reference genes are conditional-, tissue-specific-, developmental-, and cultivar-dependent.
most of the new reference genes performed better than the conventional housekeeping genes.
the relative gene expression level of gmftl <dig>  an ortholog of arabidopsis ft  was detected to validate the reference genes selected in this study.
these results should guide the selection of reference genes for gene expression studies in soybean.
thus, a systematic validation of reference genes is required to ensure proper normalization.
for soybean, only a small number of validated reference genes are available to date.
a systematic comparison of  <dig> potential reference genes for soybean is presented.
a combination of act <dig>  ukn <dig> and ukn <dig> would be appropriate as a reference panel for normalizing gene expression data among different tissues, whereas the combination skip <dig>  ukn <dig> and mtp was most suitable for developmental stages.
