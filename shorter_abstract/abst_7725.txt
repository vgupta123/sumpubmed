micrornas, post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression, play a pivotal role in gene regulatory networks.
our analysis, based on analytical calculations and simulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene expression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and weberâ€™s law, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network to the host gene.
interestingly, they are all related to gene expression homeostasis, in agreement with the increasing evidence suggesting a role of microrna regulation in conferring robustness to biological processes.
the results presented here suggest a potentially relevant functional role for negative self-regulation via intronic micrornas, in particular as a homeostatic control mechanism of gene expression.
autoregulation via intronic micrornas is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our bioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its simple topology.
in addition to model analysis, we present a list of bioinformatically predicted candidate circuits in human for future experimental tests.
