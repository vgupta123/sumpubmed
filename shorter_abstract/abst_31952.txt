we consider the problem of identifying motifs, recurring or conserved patterns, in the biological sequence data sets.
to solve this task, we present a new deterministic algorithm for finding patterns that are embedded as exact or inexact instances in all or most of the input strings.
our algorithm reduces computational complexity of the current motif finding algorithms and demonstrate strong running time improvements over existing exact algorithms, especially in important and difficult cases of large-alphabet sequences.
improvements are orders of magnitude higher in the same setting with large alphabets.
on a synthetic planted dna motif finding problem our algorithm is over 10Ã— more efficient than mitra, pmsprune, and risotto for long motifs.
