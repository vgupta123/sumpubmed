through a telephone survey, the estimates of canine and feline populations of the catchment area turned out to be of  <dig>   and  <dig>   subjects, respectively.
in dogs, the estimated annual incidence rate  per  <dig>  dogs for all tumours was  <dig> in all the catchment area, whereas in cats the ir was much lower .
this study has provided estimates of incidence of spontaneous neoplasm in companion animals.
veterinary practitioners may also benefit from the tumour registry insofar they may obtain data for specific breeds, age groups or geographical areas.
malignant and benign tumours were equally distributed in male and female dogs, whereas cats had a  <dig> -fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than benign.
further attempts will be made to increase the accuracy in the population size assessment and to ascertain the real gap with the official regional canine demographic registry.
tumour incidence increased with age in both dog and cat populations.
in both dogs and cats, purebreds had an almost 2-fold higher incidence of malignant tumours than mixed breeds.
