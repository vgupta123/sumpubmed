for validation, we compared the performance of our method on known calcium-binding sites for which there are both holo and apo structures.
when loops in the apo structures are rebuilt using modeling methods, feature identifies  <dig> out of  <dig> crystallographically proven calcium-binding sites.
the remaining  <dig> predictions are novel predictions, some with intriguing potential biological significance.
we found indirect experimental evidence for  <dig> other predictions.
methods for recognizing functional sites in these missing loops would be useful for recovering additional functional information.
protein crystal structures are a potentially rich source of functional information.
we applied our method to unstructured loops in proteins from scop families known to bind calcium in order to discover potential cryptic calcium binding sites.
