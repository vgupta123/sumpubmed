the current study demonstrates that, in addition to its role in anthocyanin biosynthesis, the zmf3’h <dig> gene also participates in the biosynthesis of 3-deoxyflavonoids and phlobaphenes that accumulate in maize pericarps, cob glumes, and silks.
our results show that the zmf3’h <dig> gene participates in the biosynthesis of phlobaphenes and agronomically important 3-deoxyflavonoid compounds under the regulatory control of p <dig>
maize lines with functional alleles of pr <dig> and p <dig>  accumulate luteoforol, while null pr <dig> lines with a functional or non-functional p <dig> allele  accumulate apiforol.
using a combination of emsa and chip experiments, we established that the zmf3’h <dig> gene is a direct target of p <dig>  highlighting the significance of the zmf3’h <dig> gene for resistance against biotic stress, we also show here that the p <dig> controlled 3-deoxyanthocyanidin and c-glycosyl flavone  defence compounds accumulate at significantly higher levels in pr <dig> silks as compared to pr <dig> silks.
our biochemical analysis of accumulated compounds in different pr <dig> genotypes showed that the pr <dig> encoded zmf3’h <dig> has a role in the conversion of mono-hydroxylated to bi-hydroxylated compounds in the b-ring.
