we used rat ns/pcs as a model system to study the role of mir-125b in governing the behavior of ns/pcs.
similar results were observed when nestin was knocked down by sirna.
the results provided new insight into the function by which mir-125b modulates ns/pcs proliferation, differentiation and migration.
mir-125b targeted the 3'-utr of nestin and reduced the abundance of nestin at both mrna and protein levels.
mir-125b, one of neuronal mirnas, recently was found to be necessary for neural differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells .
the data also indicated the regulatory role of mir-125b in ns/pcs might through the suppression of nestin expression.
