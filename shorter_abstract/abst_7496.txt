the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between serum concentrations of ß- hydroxybutyrate  and fatty acid  profile of milk with emphasis in conjugated linoleic acid  in a population of early lactation holstein cows.

ketogenesis is a secondary metabolic pathway to provide energy to dairy cows during early lactation; however when the production of ketone bodies  is above certain levels a subclinical disorder may appear.
cows were divided in low  and high  bhba groups considering the median value of the serum concentration of bhba  .
fifty cows between parity  <dig> and  <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to 21 days in milk, were randomly selected from  <dig> farms of the central area of chile for determination of serum bhba concentrations, milk fat content, and milk fa profiles.
it is concluded that early postpartum cows with serum bhba >  <dig>  mmol/l tended to have higher milk fat % and had significantly lower concentrations of cla than early postpartum cows with bhba ≤  <dig>  mmol/l.
