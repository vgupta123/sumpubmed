previously, the mitochondrial genome  of the indigenous new world b. tabaci species was sequenced and major differences of gene order from the postulated whitefly ancestral gene order were found.
however, the sequence and gene order of mitogenomes in other b. tabaci species are unknown.
in addition, the sequence divergences and gene expression profiles of mitogenomes in the b. tabaci species complex remain completely unexplored.
in this study, we obtained the complete mitogenome  of the invasive mediterranean , which has been identified as the type species of the b. tabaci complex.
this work provides novel insights into the mitogenome evolution of b. tabaci species and demonstrates that utilizing rna-seq data to obtain the mitogenome and analyze mitochondrial gene expression characteristics is practical.
furthermore, rt-pcr analyses of the mitochondrial pcgs expression in different developmental stages revealed that the expression level of individual mitochondrial genes varied in each developmental stage of nymph, pupa and adult.
interestingly, mrna levels showed significant differences among genes located in the same transcription unit suggesting that mitochondrial mrna abundance is heavily modulated by post-transcriptional regulation.
based on the illumina sequencing data, the gene expression profile of the med mitogenome was analyzed.
