using a dilution series of prothioconazole, azoxystrobin and prothioconazole + fluoxastrobin, we demonstrated that sub lethal doses of prothioconazole coincide with an increase in don production  <dig> h after fungicide treatment.
these cumulative results suggest that h2o <dig> induced by sub lethal doses of the triazole fungicide prothioconazole acts as a trigger of don biosynthesis.
the effect of sub lethal prothioconazole concentrations on don production completely disappeared when applying catalase together with the fungicide.
in an artificial infection trial using wheat plants, the in vitro results of increased don levels upon sub lethal prothioconazole application were confirmed illustrating the significance of these results from a practical point of view.
little is known about external triggers influencing don production.
in the present work, a combined in vivo/in vitro approach was used to test the effect of sub lethal fungicide treatments on don production.
in a broader framework, this work clearly shows that don production by the plant pathogen f. graminearum is the result of the interaction of fungal genomics and external environmental triggers.
fusarium head blight is a very important disease of small grain cereals with f. graminearum as one of the most important causal agents.
when applying h2o <dig> directly to germinating conidia, a similar induction of don-production by f. graminearum was observed.
