our goal is to identify antimicrobial resistance in spanish gas isolates collected between  <dig> and  <dig> and to determine the molecular epidemiology  and resistance mechanisms of those resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline.
a remarkable correlation between antimicrobial resistance and emm/t type was noticed.
group a streptococcus  causes human diseases ranging in severity from uncomplicated pharyngitis to life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis and shows high rates of macrolide resistance in several countries.
spread of emm4t <dig>  emm75t <dig> and emm28t <dig> resistant clones caused high rates of macrolide resistance.
clonal spread of emm4t <dig>  emm75t <dig> and emm28t <dig> was the main responsable for macrolide resistance where as that emm77t <dig> clones were it to tetraclycline resistance.
a wide variety of macrolide resistance genes were responsible for three macrolide resistance phenotypes.
spanish gas were highly resistant to macrolides meanwhile showed minor resistance rate to tetracycline.
resistance to both antibiotics was detected in  <dig> isolates of  <dig> emm/t types, being emm11t <dig> and the cmlsb phenotype the most frequent ones.
two hundred ninety-five out of  <dig> isolates  were erythromycin resistant, with the predominance of emm4t <dig>  emm75t <dig>  and emm28t <dig>  accounting the  <dig> % of the  <dig> emm/t types.
sixty-one isolates were tetracycline resistant, with the main representation of the emm77t <dig> among  <dig> emm/t types.
