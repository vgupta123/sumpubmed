a mapping population of  <dig> microvines derived from picovine x ugni blanc flb, was genotyped with the illumina® 18 k snp  chip.
a new major qtl explaining up to 44 % of total variance of berry weight was identified on chromosome  <dig> in ugni blanc flb, and co-localized with qtls for seed number , major berry acids at green lag phase , and other yield components .
in contrast, only minor qtls for berry acidity and leaf area could be found as moderately stable in picovine.
plant breeding has the potential to deliver new cultivars with stable yield and quality under warmer climate conditions, but this requires the identification of stable genetic determinants.
forty-three vegetative and reproductive traits were phenotyped outdoors over four cropping cycles, and a subset of  <dig> traits over two cropping cycles in growth rooms with two contrasted temperatures, in order to map stable qtls .
ten stable qtls for berry development and quality or leaf area were identified on the parental maps.
it allowed the identification of  <dig> stable qtls, including the first berry acidity qtls reported so far in a vitis vinifera intra-specific cross.
in addition, a minor qtl for leaf area was found on chromosome  <dig> of the same parent.
none of the transporters recently identified as mutated in low acidity apples or cucurbits were included in the several hundreds of candidate genes underlying the above berry qtls, which could be reduced to a few dozen candidate genes when a priori pertinent biological functions and organ specific expression were considered.
