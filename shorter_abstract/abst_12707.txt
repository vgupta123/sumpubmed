both vasotocin  and dopaminergic neural circuitry have roles in control of social behaviors as well as in the stress response, and may be linked to feather pecking.
we demonstrated an increase in the number of neurons positive for the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase, in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus in the lml hens compared to cl hens.
the effect of foster hen rearing on the two genetic lines and their hypothalamic morphology was also investigated.
no correlations were found between behavior in an open field at 5â€“ <dig> weeks of age, and the histology of the same hens at adulthood.
thus, the hypothalamus of adult laying hens selected for low early mortality , which show low feather pecking, was examined and compared with a control line of adult laying hens selected for production characteristics only .
genetic selection and introduction of  maternal care have been suggested as potential interventions to reduce feather pecking in laying hens.
the hypothalamic dopaminergic and vasotinergic systems are altered in hens following genetic selection or maternal care, indicating a potential role for these systems in feather pecking.
hen-reared chicks showed more vasotocin -positive neurons in the medial pre-optic area compared to the hens raised without a hen.
altered brain development has been proposed to reflect welfare states in animals, and can provide more insight into the underlying processes involved in feather pecking.
