the presence of the proteoglycan versican has been strongly associated with cancer development and progression.
although a direct relationship exists between versican and invasiveness, our results indicate that the isolated evaluation of this proteoglycan does not represent an independent prognostic factor in canine cbmts.
components of the extracellular matrix have been studied in an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the biological behaviour of tumours.
versican immunoreactivity was less intense in the areas adjacent to the in situ carcinomatous regions, compared to invasive regions, which showed extensive and strong staining.
however, relationship between versican expression and clinical pathological factors and overall survival has not been previously studied in veterinary medicine.
the aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of versican in in situ and invasive carcinomatous areas of canine cbmts and to evaluate possible associations of versican expression with other classic prognostic factors and overall survival.
clinical staging; histological grade determination; immunohistochemical staining for versican, e-cadherin and ki-67; and confirmation of invasion areas by staining for p <dig> and smooth muscle α-actin  were performed on  <dig> canine cases of cbmt.
carcinomas in benign mixed tumours  are one of the most common malignant tumours in female canines and can serve as models for studies of tumour progression.
in situ areas, suggesting a role for this molecule in tumour progression.
-stained areas showed a total loss of α-sma and p <dig> immunoreactivity.
our data reveal that in canine cbmts, versican expression differs significantly between invasive and
