we use primary human gingival epithelial cells  and an in vitro grown biofilm, comprising nine frequently studied and representative subgingival plaque bacteria.
challenging the host derived hgec with the biofilm invoked apoptosis in the epithelial cells, triggered release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in parallel induced rapid degradation of the cytokines by biofilm-generated enzymes.
we describe here a new model that permits the examination of interactions between the bacterial biofilm and host cells in general.
it will facilitate easily the introduction of additional host cells such as neutrophils for future biofilm:host cell challenge studies.
our methodology may generate particular interest, as it should be widely applicable to other biofilm-related chronic inflammatory diseases.
we describe the growth of a mature 'subgingival' in vitro biofilm, its composition during development, its ability to adapt to aerobic conditions and how we expose in vitro a hgec monolayer to this biofilm.
