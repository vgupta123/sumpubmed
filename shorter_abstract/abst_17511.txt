over 90% of eukaryotes have globins: the nematode caenorhabditis has the most putative globins, ~ <dig>  no globins occur in the parasitic, unicellular eukaryotes such as encephalitozoon, entamoeba, plasmodium and trypanosoma.
from one to seven globins per genome were found in ~65% of the bacterial genomes: the presence and number of globins are positively correlated with genome size.
the latter comprise the flavohemoglobins with a c-terminal fad-binding domain and the gene-regulating globin coupled sensors, with variable c-terminal domains.
