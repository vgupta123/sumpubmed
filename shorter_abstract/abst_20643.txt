transgenic fish expressing fluorescent proteins in leukocyte populations allow direct, quantitative visualization of an inflammatory response in vivo.
inflammation can be assayed in real time using transgenic fish expressing fluorescent proteins in leukocytes or by histochemical assays in fixed larvae.
here we show that specific, noninvasive damage to lateral line neuromast cells can induce a robust acute inflammatory response.
however, current assays require invasive manipulation of fish individually, thus preventing high-content screening.
exposure of fish larvae to sublethal concentrations of copper sulfate selectively damages the sensory hair cell population inducing infiltration of leukocytes to neuromasts within  <dig> minutes.
it has been proposed that this animal model can be used for high-throughput screens aimed at the identification of novel immunomodulatory lead compounds.
we have called this method the chemically induced inflammation assay, or chin assay.
we demonstrate the usefulness of this method for chemical and genetic screens to detect the effect of immunomodulatory compounds and mutations affecting the leukocyte response.
