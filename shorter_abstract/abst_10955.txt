these hydrolytic enzymes can selectively cleave the internal linkages of starch molecule to produce free glucose which can be utilized to produce bioethanol by microbial fermentation.
in the present study, several filamentous fungi were screened for production of amylases and among them aspergillus fumigatus kibge-ib <dig> was selected based on maximum enzyme yield.
after salt precipitation, fold purification of α-amylase and amyloglucosidase increased up to  <dig>  and  <dig>  times with specific activity of  <dig>  kumg- <dig> and  <dig> kumg- <dig>  respectively.
cassava starch is considered as a potential source for the commercial production of bioethanol because of its availability and low market price.
maximum α-amylase, amyloglucosidase and glucose formation was achieved after 03 days of fermentation using cassava starch.
concentrated amylolytic enzyme mixture was incorporated in cassava starch slurry to give maximum glucose formation , which was further fermented using saccharomyces cerevisiae into bioethanol with  <dig> % yield.
an improved and effective dual enzymatic starch degradation method is designed for the production of bioethanol using cassava starch.
it can be used as a basic source to support large-scale biological production of bioethanol using microbial amylases.
