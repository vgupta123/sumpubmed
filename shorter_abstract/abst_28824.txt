blood samples were collected from ten healthy amateur runners peripheral blood mononuclear cells  were isolated from whole blood and bcl- <dig>  bax, heat shock protein  <dig>  cu-zn superoxide dismutase , mn-sod, inducible nitric oxide synthase , sirt <dig>  sirt <dig> and sirt <dig>  rna levels were determined by northern blot analysis.
in our research, we investigated the effect of physical load on the extent of apoptosis in primary cells derived from blood samples of sixteen healthy amateur runners after marathon .
these data suggest that the physiological load imposed in amateur runners during marathon attenuates the extent of apoptosis and may interfere with sirtuin expression.
strenuous physical load significantly increased hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  mn-sod, cu-zn sod, inos, gadd <dig>  bcl- <dig>  forkhead box o  and sirt <dig> expression after the marathon, while decreasing bax, sirt <dig> and sirt <dig> expression .
