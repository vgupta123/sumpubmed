a simulation experiment shows that while a single channel analysis performs relatively well when the majority of arrays are affected, and excluding affected arrays performs relatively well when few arrays are affected , the combined approach out-performs both.
there are mechanisms, notably ozone degradation, that can damage a single channel of two-channel microarray experiments.
inclusion of ozone-affected data results in poor performance, with a clear spatial effect in the damage being apparent.
two such approaches would be a single channel analysis using some of the data from all of the arrays, and an analysis of all of the data, but only from unaffected arrays.
