vitamin e  induced a statistically significant reduction  in the mutagenicity of norfloxacin, whereas vitamin c  had no such effect.
the aim of this work was to evaluate combination therapy with norfloxacin and vitamins c and e, to reduce the possible genotoxic risk associated with fluoroquinolones.
these results suggest that vitamin e is a potent antimutagen that would be worthwhile being used in conjunction with fluoroquinolone treatment.
the minimal antimutagenic effect of vitamin c observed under these experimental conditions may have been because vitamin c in the ames test induces a fenton reaction, and if divalent cations are present, it can act as a pro-oxidant rather than an antioxidant.
this mutagenic effect is due to free oxygen radicals , because it is inhibited by antioxidants such as Î²-carotene and naturally occurring antioxidants of roheo discolor and other plants.
