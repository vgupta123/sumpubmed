our findings suggest that, if arabidopsis is used as the model plant, we can only learn a limited amount about the functions of a particular gene family.
using the extensin super-gene family as an example, we tracked the differential retention and expansion of ancestral extensin genes in four modern rosids, arabidopsis, populus, vitis and carica, using several analytical methods.
by contrast, no paralogous extensins were detected in vitis and carica, which have only undergone the common Î³-triplication event.
these results also provide an example of how it is essential to learn the origination of a gene when analyzing its function across different plant species.
all modern rosids originated from a common hexapolyploid ancestor, and the genomes of some rosids have undergone one or more cycles of paleopolyploidy.
the majority of extensin genes in each of the modern rosids were found to originate from different ancestral genes.
our analyses show that extensins originating from a common ancestor have been differentially retained and expanded among four modern rosids.
in arabidopsis and populus, almost half of the extensins were paralogous duplicates within the genome of each species.
our analyses also revealed that nearly all of the paralogous and orthologous extensin-pairs have been under strong purifying selection, leading to the strong conservation of the function of extensins duplicated from the same ancestral gene.
however, such extensins were absent from, or rare in, the other three rosids.
