despite greatly improved predictive success, the positive set had similar degrees of sequence and binding site conservation as the negative set.
cis-regulatory modules are bound by transcription factors to regulate gene expression.
we successfully predicted five new cis-regulatory modules by combining binding site identification with sequence conservation and compared these to unsuccessful predictions from a related approach not utilizing sequence conservation.
we explored the reasons for this by mutagenizing putative binding sites in three cis-regulatory modules.
our results raise important questions about interpreting regulatory module predictions obtained by finding clusters of conserved binding sites.
our study underscores the importance of empirical validation of computational results even when these results are in line with expectation.
when such approaches are successful, it is typically assumed that the activity of the modules is mediated by the identified binding sites and their cognate transcription factors.
examination of loss-of-function mutants also showed that some transcription factors supposedly binding to the modules are not required for their function.
attribution of function to these sites and their cognate transcription factors may be incorrect even when modules are successfully identified.
