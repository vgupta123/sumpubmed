among the first steps in interpreting the results is annotation of genomic regions with known features such as genes, promoters, cpg islands etc.
here we present annotategenomicregions, a web application that accepts genomic regions as input and outputs a selection of overlapping and/or neighboring genome annotations.
the increasing spread of genomic technologies generates the need for a simple-to-use annotation tool for genomic regions that can be used by biologists and bioinformaticians alike.
however, using these tools often requires a significant amount of bioinformatics skills and/or downloading and installing dedicated software.
annotategenomicregions is an open-source web application that can be installed on any personal computer or institute server.
