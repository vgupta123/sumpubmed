however, the currently available computational tools are not designed to handle single-cell data and do not provide integral solutions for linking of sequence data to other biological data.
the sequencing of immunoglobulin  transcripts from single b cells yields essential information about ig heavy:light chain pairing, which is lost in conventional bulk sequencing experiments.
the software combines bioinformatics tools for immunoglobulin sequence annotation with a relational database, where raw data and analysis results are stored and linked.

here we introduce scireptor, a flexible toolkit for the processing and analysis of antigen receptor repertoire sequencing data at single-cell level.
scireptor is a flexible framework for standardized sequence analysis of antigen receptor repertoires on single-cell level.
the relational database allows easy data sharing and downstream analyses as well as immediate comparisons between different data sets.
furthermore, it comprises a quality control module as well as basic repertoire visualization tools.
scireptor supports attribution of additional data categories such as cell surface marker expression or immunological metadata.
