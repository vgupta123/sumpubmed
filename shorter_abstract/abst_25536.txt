our meg experiment demonstrated differences in the behavior of p <dig> and n <dig> components during the automatic segregation of sounds when induced by an initial adaptation sequence.
however, neither the neural activity nor the perception of the successive streaming sequences were modulated when the isis were alternated.
these results suggest that p <dig> and n <dig> components represent at least partially-different systems that underlie the neural representation of auditory streaming.
fifteen participants with normal hearing were presented with series’ of two consecutive aba auditory tone-triplet sequences, the initial triplets being the adaptation sequence and the subsequent triplets being the test sequence.
a significant increase in the amplitude of the n <dig> component was only obtained for a test sequence delta-f of  <dig> semitones with a prior adaptation sequence of  <dig> semitones.
the p <dig> component appeared enhanced in all test-conditions and thus demonstrates the preceding context effect, whereas n <dig> was specifically modulated only by large delta-f test sequences induced by a preceding small delta-f adaptation sequence.
meg measurements showed a significant increase in the amplitude of the b-tone related p <dig> component of the aefs as delta-f increased.
participants watched a muted video of their choice and ignored the auditory stimuli.
this effect was more pronounced in the right hemisphere.
in the first experiment, the frequency separation  between a and b tones in the sequences was varied by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> semitones.
the additional behavioral data indicated an increased probability of two-stream perception for delta-f =  <dig> and delta-f =  <dig> semitones with a preceding adaptation sequence of  <dig> semitones.
in a subsequent behavioral study both meg experiments were replicated to provide information about the participants’ perceptual state.
in the second experiment, a constant delta-f of  <dig> semitones was maintained but the inter-stimulus intervals  between a and b tones were varied.
the aim of the present study was to identify a specific neuronal correlate underlying the pre-attentive auditory stream segregation of subsequent sound patterns alternating in spectral or temporal cues.
