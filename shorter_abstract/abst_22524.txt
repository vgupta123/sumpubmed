although mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b and mir- <dig> are well-studied in muscle, there is no information about their expression and function during human development.
the purpose of this study was to determine the profile of these mirnas in muscle cells isolated from different stages of human development.
mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b and mir- <dig> are expressed in muscle tissue and induced during muscle cell differentiation, a process that directs myoblasts to differentiate into mature myotubes, which are organized into myofibers.
these results may shed light on the differentiation of muscle cells and regulation of muscle formation through mirnas, during the development of human foetus.
changes in mirna levels during human foetal development were accompanied by endogenous alterations in their known targets and also in their inducer, myod.
this study provides data about the profile of four mirnas in human muscle cells isolated during different stages of foetal development.
all four mirna levels were found increased during late stages of human foetal muscle development.
we examined the levels of mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b and mir- <dig> during the development of human foetus.
ectopic myod expression caused an induction of muscle cell differentiation in vitro, accompanied by an increase in the levels of mir- <dig>  mir-133a, mir-133b and mir- <dig>
micrornas  are small rna molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and have been shown to play an important role during development.
