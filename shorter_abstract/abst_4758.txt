computational methods based on machine learning, such as support vector machine approaches, have already been widely used in the prediction of protein subcellular localization.
however, a major drawback of these machine learning-based approaches is that a large amount of data should be labeled in order to let the prediction system learn a classifier of good generalization ability.
experimental results show that our methods can effectively reduce the workload for labeling data using the unlabeled data.
our method is shown to enhance the state-of-the-art prediction results of svm classifiers by more than 10%.
accurate predictions of subcellular localizations of protein can aid the prediction of protein function and genome annotation, as well as the identification of drug targets.
protein subcellular localization is concerned with predicting the location of a protein within a cell using computational method.
