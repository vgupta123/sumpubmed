the g-protein-coupled receptors  constitute one of the largest and most ancient superfamilies of membrane proteins.
the human and tetraodon gpcr sequences are analogous in terms of gpcr subfamilies but display disproportionate numbers of receptors at the subfamily level.
direct comparison of gpcrs in tetraodon and human genomes displays a high level of orthology and supports large-scale gene duplications in tetraodon.
we have defined the repertoire of gpcr superfamily of tetraodon complement with the availability of complete sequence of the freshwater puffer fish tetraodon nigroviridis.
almost all  <dig> tetraodon gpcrs  identified had a clear human homologue.
tetraodon gpcrs are classified into five grafs families, by phylogenetic analysis, concurrent with human gpcr classification.
they play a central role in physiological processes affecting almost all aspects of the life cycle of an organism.
the teleost genome with its expanded set of gpcrs provides additional and interesting comparators to study both evolution and function of these receptors.
<dig> putative human and tetraodon gpcr orthologous pairs could be identified.
