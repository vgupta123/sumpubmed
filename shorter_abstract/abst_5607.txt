these detailed genomic analyses revealed a novel pneumocyclicin cassette and a wide variety of blp bacteriocin cassettes, suggesting that competition in the nasopharynx is a complex biological phenomenon.
we analysed a collection of  <dig> diverse pneumococcal genomes dating from  <dig> onwards, identified bacteriocin cassettes, detailed their genetic composition and sequence diversity, and evaluated the data in the context of the pneumococcal population structure.
most surprisingly, one-third of pneumococcal genomes also possessed a cassette encoding a novel circular bacteriocin that we called pneumocyclicin, which shared a similar genetic organisation to well-characterised circular bacteriocin cassettes in other bacterial species.
we found that all genomes maintained a blp bacteriocin cassette and we identified several novel blp cassettes and genes.
the composition of the ‘bacteriocin/immunity region’ of the blp cassette was highly variable: one cassette possessed six bacteriocin genes and eight putative immunity genes, whereas another cassette had only one of each.
both widely-distributed and highly clonal blp cassettes were identified.
pneumococci reside in the paediatric nasopharynx, where they compete for space and resources, and one competition strategy is to produce a bacteriocin  to attack other bacteria and an immunity protein to protect against self-destruction.
pneumocyclicin cassettes were mainly of one genetic cluster and largely found among seven major pneumococcal clonal complexes.
