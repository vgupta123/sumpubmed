importantly for this study, the identification of stable structured region is a crucial first step to generate novel synthetic antibodies.
for reliability evaluation of pat, we applied pat to identify antibody target molecules based on the notion that soluble and well-defined protein secondary and tertiary structures are appropriate target molecules for synthetic antibodies.
pat can therefore help to investigate large-scale structured domains and improve the success rate for synthetic antibody generation.
pat automatically analyzes various structural properties, evaluates the folding stability, and reports possible structural domains in a given protein sequence.
pat also offers the pre-calculated results of  <dig>  human proteins to accelerate common queries.
the identification of structured units in a protein sequence is an important first step for most biochemical studies.
moreover, no integrated tool exists to find and optimize structural domains within protein sequences.

a performance analysis shows that pat can characterize structurally well-defined regions in a given sequence and outperforms other efforts to define reliable boundaries of domains.
specially, pat successfully identifies experimentally confirmed target molecules for antibody generation.
