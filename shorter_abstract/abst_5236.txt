the anti-urease antibody significantly reduced ureolysis and corresponding ammonia formation in rumen fluid in vitro.
the present study investigated immunization of dairy cows against urease in the rumen as an approach to mitigate bacterial ureolytic activity therein.
ureolytic activity of rumen bacteria leads to rapid urea conversion to ammonia in the rumen of dairy cows, resulting possible toxicity, excessive ammonia excretion to the environment, and poor nitrogen utilization.
western blotting revealed that the h. pylori urec had high immunological homology with the urec from rumen bacteria.
most alpha subunit of rumen urease  proteins shared very similar amino acid sequences, which were also highly similar to that of h. pylori.
anti-urease titers in the serum and the saliva of the immunized cows were evaluated following repeated immunization with the urec of h. pylori as the vaccine.
vaccine developed based on urec of h. pylori can be a useful approach to decrease bacterial ureolysis in the rumen.
after the fourth booster, the vaccinated cows had a significantly reduced urease activity  in the rumen than the control cows that were mock immunized cows.
