the informatics and administrative needs of an hts facility may be best managed by a single, integrated, web-accessible application such as screensaver.
shared-usage high throughput screening  facilities are becoming more common in academe as large-scale small molecule and genome-scale rnai screening strategies are adopted for basic research purposes.
we have developed screensaver, a free, open source, web-based lab information management system , to address the informatics needs of our small molecule and rnai screening facility.
to our knowledge, screensaver is one of the first applications to support the storage and analysis of data from both genome-scale rnai screening projects and small molecule screening projects.
screensaver has proven useful in meeting the requirements of the iccb-longwood/nsrb screening facility at harvard medical school, and has provided similar benefits to other hts facilities.
