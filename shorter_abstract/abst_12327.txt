gtxyna <dig> is able to degrade wax and bewx producing mainly xylobiose and xylotriose.

several geobacillus endo-xylanases have been characterized for their optimum temperature, optimum ph and generation of degradation products.
the main difference in the mode of action between gtxyna <dig> and aaxyna on wax is that gtxyna <dig> is less hindered by arabinosyl substituents and can therefore release shorter oligosaccharides.
highest activity was towards wheat arabinoxylan , beechwood xylan  and birchwood xylan .
as part of the hus locus, the xyna gene encoding an extracellular endo-xylanase is one of the few secreted enzymes and considered to be the key enzyme to initiate hemicellulose degradation.
to determine its mode of action, we compared the hydrolysis products generated by gtxyna <dig> with those from the well-characterized gh <dig> endo-xylanase produced from aspergillus awamori .
its thermal stability was high and gtxyna <dig> showed 85% residual activity after 1 h of incubation at 60 °c.
a hus-locus associated gene  from the thermophile geobacillus thermodenitrificans t <dig> encodes an extracellular endo-xylanase that belongs to the family  <dig> glycoside hydrolases .
