inpa may thus contribute significantly to haem acquisition by p. intermedia under conditions of low redox potential and higher ph in the inflamed gingival crevice and diseased periodontal pocket where haem availability is tightly controlled by the host.
however, it is not known whether the enzyme may play a role in degrading other haem-carrying plasma proteins present in the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket from which to derive haem.
under these conditions inpa was able to substantially degrade the albumin component of whole human plasma.
the bacterium expresses a 90-kda cysteine protease termed interpain a  which both oxidizes and subsequently degrades haemoglobin, releasing haem.
albumin breakdown was examined over a range of ph and in the presence of reducing agent; conditions which prevail in sub- and supra-gingival plaque.
