however, it is not clear what is the optimal classification algorithm for analyzing this new type of data.
thus, algorithms that perform well for gene expression data may not be suitable when other technologies with different binding characteristics exist.
‘naïve bayes’ algorithm appears to accommodate the complex patterns hidden within multilayered immunosignaturing microarray data due to its fundamental mathematical properties.
we selected several datasets that range from easy to difficult to classify, from simple monoclonal binding to complex binding patterns in asthma patients.
using a wide variety of assessment criteria, we found ‘naïve bayes’ far more useful than other widely used methods due to its simplicity, robustness, speed and accuracy.
high-throughput technologies such as dna, rna, protein, antibody and peptide microarrays are often used to examine differences across drug treatments, diseases, transgenic animals, and others.
expression microarrays, arguably one of the most prevalent array types, have been used for years to help develop classification algorithms.
we characterized several classification algorithms to analyze immunosignaturing data.
we then classified the biological samples using  <dig> different classification algorithms.
