we present a major extension of mayday, a very versatile open-source framework for efficient micro array data analysis designed for biologists and bioinformaticians.
dna microarrays have become the standard method for large scale analyses of gene expression and epigenomics.
the increasing complexity and inherent noisiness of the generated data makes visual data exploration ever more important.
mayday is an open source platform with emphasis on visual data exploration and analysis.
the large number of available plugins as well as the extension possibilities using compiled plugins and ad-hoc scripting allow for the rapid adaption of mayday also to very specialized data exploration.
numerous interactive visualization tools, including box plots, profile plots, principal component plots and a heatmap are available, can be enhanced with metadata and exported as publication quality vector files.
plugins can easily be written to extend mayday's functionality in a large number of ways.
among the large number of new plugins are an automated processing framework, dynamic filtering, new and efficient clustering methods, a machine learning module and database connectivity.
fast deployment of new methods as well as a combination of predefined, easy to apply methods with programmer's access to the data are important requirements for any analysis framework.
