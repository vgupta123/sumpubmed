the overall mutation frequency was  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb.
targeting induced local lesions in genomes  is a powerful reverse genetics approach for functional genomics studies.
in peanut, lipoxygenase genes were reported to be highly induced in mature seeds infected with aspergillus spp., indicating their importance in plant-fungus interactions.
we used high-throughput sequencing, combined with a two-dimensional pooling strategy, with either minimum read percentage with non-reference nucleotide or minimum variance multiplier as mutation prediction parameters, to detect genes related to abiotic and biotic stress resistances.
recent studies showed that phospholipase d  expression was elevated more quickly in drought sensitive lines than in drought tolerant lines of peanut.
by screening  <dig> m <dig> lines from the tilling population, four missense mutations were identified for ahlox <dig>  three missense mutations were identified for ahpld, one missense and two silent mutations were identified for ara h  <dig> , three silent and five missense mutations were identified for ara h  <dig> , one missense mutation was identified for ahfad2b, and one silent mutation was identified for ara h  <dig> .
the snp detection frequency for single copy genes was  <dig> snp/ <dig> kb and  <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb for multiple copy genes.
our tilling by sequencing approach is efficient to identify mutations in single and multi-copy genes.
the mutations identified in our study can be used to further study gene function and have potential usefulness in breeding programs.
the objectives of this research were to develop a suitable tilling by sequencing method for this allotetraploid, and use this method to identify mutations induced in stress related genes.
