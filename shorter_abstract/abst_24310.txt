expression patterns of paralog subunits and activators in rice could indicate that this duplication, rather than complete redundancy, could reflect initial specialization steps.
here, we describe an in-depth search for apc subunits and activator genes in the arabidopsis, rice and poplar genomes.
phylogenetic analyses indicate that some apc subunits and activator genes have experienced gene duplication events in plants, in contrast to animals.
the absence of subunit apc <dig> from the genome of some green algae species and as well as from early metazoan lineages, could mean that apc <dig> is not required for apc function in unicellular organisms and it may be a result of duplication of another tetratricopeptide  subunit.
analyses of tpr evolution suggest that duplications of subunits started from the central domains.
the increased complexity of the apc gene structure, tied to the diversification of expression paths, suggests that land plants developed sophisticated mechanisms of apc regulation to cope with the sedentary life style and its associated environmental exposures.
