the primary production is therefore enhanced by the presence of c. taxifolia.
in contrast, the length of p. oceanica leaves decreases when in competition with c. taxifolia.
we have accordingly investigated defense metabolite content and growth year-round, on the basis of an interaction gradient.
when in competition with p. oceanica, c. taxifolia exhibits increased frond length and decreased caulerpenyne â€“ cyn content .
c. taxifolia invests in growth rather than in chemical defense, more or less matching the assumptions of the odt and/or pat theories.
however, on the basis of closer scrutiny of our results, the possibility that p. oceanica is successful in finding a compromise between more growth and more defense cannot be ruled out.
in contrast, p. oceanica apparently invests in defense rather than growth, as predicted by the gdb hypothesis.
interference between these two species determines the reaction of both, confirming that they compete for space and/or resources.
while the overall concentration of phenolic compounds does not decline, there is an increase in some phenolic compounds  and the density of tannin cells.
however, the turnover is faster, resulting in a reduction of leaf longevity and an increase on the number of leaves produced per year.
