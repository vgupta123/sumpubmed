two divergent phenotypes were observed: one with prevalent expression of cancer testis antigens, enhanced cyclin activity, wnt signaling, and a th <dig> immune phenotype .
this study suggests that clinically relevant phenotypes of melanoma can be retraced to stable oncogenic properties of cancer cells linked to their genetic back bone, and offers a roadmap for uncovering novel targets for tailored anti-cancer therapy.
the weight that gene copy number plays in transcription remains controversial; although in specific cases gene expression correlates with copy number, the relationship cannot be inferred at the global level.
we hypothesized that genes steadily expressed by  <dig> melanoma cell lines  and their parental tissues  should be critical for oncogenesis and their expression most frequently influenced by their respective copy number.
among them,  <dig> were expressed according to the transcriptional efficiency predicted by copy number analysis .
we named these genes, "genomic delegates" as they represent at the transcriptional level the genetic footprint of individual cancers.
the second class  prevalently expressed genes associated with melanoma signaling including mitf, melanoma differentiation antigens, and displayed a th <dig> immune phenotype associated with better prognosis and likelihood to respond to immunotherapy.
functional interpretation of  <dig>  transcripts concordantly expressed  by cms and tms confirmed an enrichment of functions crucial to oncogenesis.
