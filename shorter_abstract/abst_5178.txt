one surprising finding is that some of these genes have clear counterparts in higher animals but are not present in the closely-related sea anemone nematostella.
genes of likely relevance to the processes of settlement, metamorphosis, calcification and interaction with symbionts were characterised further and their spatial expression patterns investigated using whole-mount in situ hybridization.
to better understand the molecular bases of both cnidarian development in general and coral-specific processes such as skeletogenesis and symbiont acquisition, microarray analysis was carried out through the period of early development â€“ when skeletogenesis is initiated, and symbionts are first acquired.
secondly, coral-specific processes  may be analogous to similar processes in distantly related organisms.
this study is the first large-scale investigation of developmental gene expression for any cnidarian, and has provided candidate genes for key roles in many aspects of coral biology, including calcification, metamorphosis and symbiont uptake.
of  <dig> unique peptide coding genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed  in comparisons between four different stages of coral development, spanning key developmental transitions.
this first large-scale application of microarray analysis demonstrates the potential of this approach for investigating many aspects of coral biology, including the effects of stress and disease.
anthozoan cnidarians are amongst the simplest animals at the tissue level of organization, but are surprisingly complex and vertebrate-like in terms of gene repertoire.
