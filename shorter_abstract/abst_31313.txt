chloroplast genome sequences are extremely informative about species-interrelationships owing to its non-meiotic and often uniparental inheritance over generations.
however, it has some unique structural features distinct from previously reported complete chloroplast genome sequences.
phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> protein-coding gene sequences from  <dig> complete plastid genomes provided strong support for the sister relationships of caryophyllales  to asterids.
the subject of our study, fagopyrum esculentum, is a member of the family polygonaceae belonging to the order caryophyllales.
we report the complete chloroplast genome sequence of a wild ancestor of cultivated buckwheat, fagopyrum esculentum ssp.
the gene content and order in buckwheat chloroplast genome is similar to spinacia oleracea.
the sequence was rapidly determined using a previously described approach that utilized a pcr-based method and employed universal primers, designed on the scaffold of multiple sequence alignment of chloroplast genomes.
comparative genomics analyses revealed that the fagopyrum chloroplast genome harbors the characteristic gene content and organization as has been described for several other chloroplast genomes.
with that background, having access to the complete chloroplast genome sequence for fagopyrum becomes quite pertinent.
phylogenetic analysis of the dataset, including this new sequence from non-core caryophyllales supports the sister relationship between caryophyllales and asterids.
however, some unique structural differences exist: the presence of an intron in the rpl <dig> gene, a frameshift mutation in the rpl <dig> gene and extension of the inverted repeat region to include the ycf <dig> gene.
