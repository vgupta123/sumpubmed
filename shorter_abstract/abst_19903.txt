the most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms  located on ssc <dig> explain between  <dig> and 76% of the genetic variance and between  <dig> and 54% of the phenotypic variance for the de novo synthesized fatty acid traits in norwegian duroc.
fatty acid composition contributes importantly to meat quality and is essential to the nutritional value of the meat.
the aim of this study was to conduct genome-wide association studies  to identify qtl regions affecting fatty acid composition in backfat from the pig breeds duroc and landrace.
this study confirms a major qtl affecting fatty acid composition on ssc <dig> in duroc, which can be used in genetic selection to increase the level of fatty acid desaturation.

using data from the axiom porcine 660 k array, we performed gwas on  <dig> duroc and  <dig> landrace boars for fatty acid phenotypes measured by near-infrared spectroscopy  technology .
whole genome re-sequencing data was used for genotype imputation and to fine map the ssc <dig> qtl region in norwegian duroc.
two qtl regions on ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> were identified in duroc for the de novo synthesized fatty acids traits, whereas one qtl on ssc <dig> was detected in landrace for c16:1n- <dig>  the qtl region on ssc <dig> has been reported in previous studies and a putative causative mutation has been suggested in the promoter region of the scd gene.
identification of genetic factors underlying levels of fatty acids can be used to breed for pigs with healthier meat.
