mining results, a total of  <dig>  quality snps were discovered â€“
it served well as in silico validation of these snps, in addition
distribution and uniqueness and for in silico validation, in
consequentially yielding different numbers of haplotype-based quality snps.
high-quality est-snps from different citrus genotypes were detected, and
snps in  <dig>  out of  <dig>  usable contigs.
a vast majority of snp-containing contigs
<dig>  25-mer snp oligos to the clementine reference genome scaffolds
citrus expressed sequence tags  from different citrus cultivars
haplotype contigs varied widely in these citrus cultivars.
the nucleotide discrepancies in the 24/ <dig> alignments were at the snp sites,
sequences were aligned with the clementine citrus genome to determine their
