our anova analysis of sibling probe sets provides a statistical framework for selecting sibling probe sets for consolidation.
the most appropriate way of consolidating sibling probe sets suitable for analysis is an open problem.
we found that consolidation of sibling probe sets of the former type results in large increase in the number of differentially expressed genes under various statistical criteria.
consolidating sibling probe sets by pooling data from each greatly improves the estimates of a gene expression level and results in identification of more biologically relevant genes.
affymetrix genechip typically contains multiple probe sets per gene, defined as sibling probe sets in this study.
sibling probe sets that do not qualify for consolidation may represent annotation errors or other artifacts, or may correspond to differentially processed transcripts of the same gene that require further analysis.
