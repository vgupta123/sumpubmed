to illustrate the relevance of the search results, we conduct a search with and without added annotation terms for the yeast pho4p binding sites, cacgtg and cacgtt.
we present our hash function as well as our search algorithm to locate small sequences of dna within multiple genomes.
the promoter regions of all but one of them contain at least one of the two core pho4p binding sites, cacgtg and cacgtt.
our experiments show that subsequently searching the annotation data can refine and focus the results for the user.
for instance, whole genomic array analysis in yeast has revealed  <dig> pho-regulated genes.
we present a time-efficient algorithm to locate small segments of dna and concurrently to search the annotation data accompanying the sequence.
however, current search algorithms often generate thousands of matches â€“ most of which are irrelevant to the researcher.
a recent analysis of the complete sequences of the helicobacter pylori strains  <dig> and j <dig> has identified  <dig> putative phase-variable genes among the two genomes through their association with homopolymeric tracts and dinucleotide repeats.
our system applies information retrieval algorithms to discover knowledge of cross-species conservation of repeat sequences.
