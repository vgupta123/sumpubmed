outcome parameters monitored were embryo survival, recovery, subsequent development and signs of dna damage.
the subsequent developmental parameters were unaffected by either the carrier or the cell stage.
this study is one of the first to examine dna integrity after vitrification on different carriers and at different cell stages.
open carriers allow direct contact of embryos with liquid nitrogen  whereas closed carrier systems sequester the embryo within a sealed system during immersion in ln <dig>  the use of closed systems may be preferable to reduce the possibility of cross-contamination.
it also provides insight on relative safety of short term vapor storage of vitrified embryos during transport.
within the limits of this study we could not detect an adverse effect of vapor storage on blastomere dna or other measured outcome parameters.
vitrification of both cl and bl stage embryos in the cryotip resulted in significantly lower recovery rates .
the cryoloop, an open carrier was tested against two closed systems, the cryotip and the hsv straw.

quantitative analysis for dna damage showed that <5% of cells were tunel positive.
interestingly, the overall percent of cells exhibiting dna damage was lower after cl stage vitrification .
carriers were tested for their ability to maintain embryo viability when held in the vapor phase of a dry shipper for a period of  <dig> hours.
we also examine their ability to retain embryo viability during vapor phase transport.
vapor phase storage for  <dig> hours under "transport conditions" did not appear to adversely affect the viability after warming.
frozen one-cell mouse embryos were thawed and randomly allocated to treatment groups.
