in addition to the original algorithm, we newly devised the entropy-plot to control the separation of singletons or small clusters.
however, most existing methods focus on clusters with compact shapes and do not reflect the geometric complexity of the high dimensional microarray clusters, which limits their performance.
the geometric complexity of clusters should be taken into account for accurate classification of microarray data, and ensemble clustering applied to the number of clusters tackles the problem very well.
we present a cluster-number-based ensemble clustering algorithm, called multi-k, for microarray sample classification, which demonstrates remarkable accuracy.
uncovering subtypes of disease from microarray samples has important clinical implications such as survival time and sensitivity of individual patients to specific therapies.
the method amalgamates multiple k-means runs by varying the number of clusters and identifies clusters that manifest the most robust co-memberships of elements.
