the h <dig> construct was generated, the protein was produced in a baculovirus expression system and was then purified by using ion exchange chromatography.
such a construct has two major advantages:  its components are as close as possible to the natural forms of both proteins and  it lacks an artificial linker what should avoid induction of antibody production.
it contains the full length sil-11rÎ± connected with the mature il- <dig> protein using their natural sequences only.
the biologically active h <dig> may be potentially useful for treatment of thrombocytopenia, infertility, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular diseases or inflammatory disorders.
interleukin  <dig>  is a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and hematopoietic potential.
