because genes involved in l-rhamnose biosynthesis are absent in humans, this pathway may represent potential targets for the development of antimicrobial agents.
studying the capsular serotypes of clinical isolates is of great importance for further development of vaccines and/or novel therapeutic agents.
an important virulence factor of klebsiella pneumoniae is the production of capsular polysaccharide , a thick mucus layer that allows for evasion of the host's defense and creates a barrier against antibacterial peptides.
in this study, we report the unique genetic organization of the cps cluster from k. pneumoniae kp <dig>  a clinical isolate recovered during a large outbreak of nosocomial infections that occurred in a brazilian teaching hospital.
we report the first description of a cps cluster from a brazilian clinical isolate of a kpc-producing k. pneumoniae.

a pyrosequencing-based approach showed that the cps region of kp <dig>  is  <dig>  kbp in length and contains genes common, although not universal, to other strains, such as the rmlbadc operon that codes for l-rhamnose synthesis.
furthermore, in vitro serotyping showed only a weak reaction with capsular types k <dig> and k <dig>  we confirm that k <dig> cps shares common genes with cpskp <dig> such as the rmlbadc operon, but lacks features like uge and kp13-specific glycosyltransferases, while k <dig> capsules contain three of the five sugars that potentially form the kp <dig> cps.
cpskp <dig> also presents some unique features, like the inversion of the wzy gene and a unique repertoire of glycosyltransferases.
in silico comparison of cpskp <dig> rflp pattern with  <dig> previously published cps pcr-rflp patterns showed that cpskp <dig> is distinct from the c patterns of all other k serotypes.
