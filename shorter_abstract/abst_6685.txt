balb/c mice were used for cona injection to induce fulminant hepatitis that was confirmed by pathological and biochemical examination.
after a gene chip-based screening, the data of gene expression in the liver, was further dissected by anova analysis, gene expression profiles, gene network construction and real-time rt-pcr.
at the early stages of fulminant hepatitis, expression of twenty-six genes involved in protein transport, transcription regulation and cell metabolism altered significantly.
our study provides several potential targets for the early diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis.
these genes form a network and have shown strong correlation with fulminant hepatitis development.
due to the high morbidity and mortality of fulminant hepatitis, early diagnosis followed by early effective treatment is the key for prognosis improvement.
identification of the genes related to the very early stage of fulminant hepatitis development may provide precise clues for early diagnosis.
at the very early stage of cona-triggered fulminant hepatitis, totally  <dig>  genes with different expression variations were identified.
so far, little is known about the gene expression changes in the early stage of this serious illness.
