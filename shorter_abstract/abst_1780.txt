the interactions between pdz  domains and pdz-binding motifs play central roles in signal transductions within cells.
proteins with pdz domains bind to pdz-binding motifs almost exclusively when the motifs are located at the carboxyl  terminal ends of their binding partners.
an ontological analysis revealed that the refined motifs are functionally relevant since a large fraction of the proteins bearing the motif appear to be involved in signal transduction.
our refined definition of pdz-binding motifs should provide important clues for identifying functional pdz-binding motifs and proteins involved in signal transduction.
in general, hydrophilic aas were favored.
our genomics-based findings confirm and largely extend the results of previous interaction-based studies, allowing us to propose refined consensus sequences for all of the examined pdz-binding motifs.
however, it remains little explored whether pdz-binding motifs show any preferential location at the c-terminal ends of proteins, at genome-level.
we first established that these pdz-binding motifs are indeed preferentially present at their c-terminal ends.
moreover, we found specific amino acid  bias for the 'x' positions in the motifs at the c-terminal ends.
