a further goal was to develop feline reference intervals for rotem at our institution.
further studies are necessary to evaluate the in vivo effects and the clinical significance of these findings.
reference intervals were similar albeit somewhat narrower than those previously published.
however, only a single parameter  was outside of the established reference interval after dilution with hes.
in vitro hemodilution of feline blood with ra and hes causes a small but significant impairment of whole blood coagulation, with hes leading to a significantly greater effect on coagulation than ra.
the artificial colloid, hydroxyethyl starch , is recommended for intravascular volume expansion and colloid-osmotic pressure enhancement in dogs and cats.
the goal of this study was to assess the in vitro effects of 6 % hes 130/ <dig>  on feline whole blood samples using rotational thromboelastometry .
in this in vitro experimental study, blood samples of  <dig> adult healthy cats were collected by atraumatic jugular phlebotomy following intramuscular sedation.
additionally, rotem analyses were performed on blood samples after dilution with either ringer’s acetate  or 6 % hes 130/ <dig>   in a 1: <dig> dilution .
a well-known side effect of hes solutions in humans and dogs is coagulopathy.
dilution with both solutions lead to significantly prolonged ct , cft , and reduced mcf  and alpha .
coefficients of variation of duplicate measures were below 12 % in all ex-tem assays,  <dig> of  <dig> in-tem assays but only  <dig> of  <dig> fib-tem assays.
baseline rotem analyses  were performed in duplicate.
