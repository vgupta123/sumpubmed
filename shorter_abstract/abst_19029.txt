in addition, subtyping of two new isolates and seventeen previously reported ones  by this method gave coincident results with those obtained with the classic bsteii rea assay.
the applicability of multiplex pcr-rea was demonstrated on  <dig> bohv- <dig> reference strains.
multiplex pcr-rea provides a new tool for the fast and simple diagnosis and subtyping of bohv- <dig>
bohv- <dig> subtyping is currently carried out by bsteii restriction enzyme analysis  of the complete virus genome.
the multiplex pcr detected up to  <dig> bohv- <dig> genome copies and  <dig>  Ã—  <dig> bohv- <dig> genome copies when dna was extracted from purified virus or infected tissue homogenates, respectively.
the method consists in the simultaneous amplification of glycoprotein b and ul <dig> gene fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs , respectively, bsteii digestion of amplicons, separation of products in 1% agarose gels, and analysis of fragment length polymorphims.
