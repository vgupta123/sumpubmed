the festuca gene index  has been established.
in silico gene expression studies using these ests were performed to understand stress responses in tall fescue.
in this paper we report the generation of a tall fescue expressed sequence tag  database developed from nine cdna libraries representing tissues from different plant organs, developmental stages, and abiotic stress factors.
a total of  <dig>  ests were generated from nine cdna libraries of tall fescue representing tissues from different plant organs, developmental stages, and abiotic stress conditions.
tall fescue  is a major cool season forage and turf grass species grown in the temperate regions of the world.
fagi provides a useful resource for genomics studies of tall fescue and other closely related forage and turf grass species.
the results of inter-library and library-specific in silico expression analyses of these ests are also reported.
comparative genomic analyses between tall fescue and other grass species, including ryegrasses , meadow fescue  and tetraploid fescue  will benefit from this database.
these ests represent gene homologues of heat-shock and oxidative stress proteins, and various transcription factor protein families.
a large number of ests of known stress response gene were identified from stressed tissue libraries.
to date, this represents the first publicly available tall fescue est database.
highly expressed ests representing genes of unknown functions were also identified in the stressed tissue libraries.
