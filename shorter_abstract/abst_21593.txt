whereas most studies on rhizobial osmoadaptation have focussed on the model species sinorhizobium meliloti, little is known on the osmoadaptive mechanisms used by native rhizobia, which are good sources of inoculants.
osmostress response in bacteria involves the accumulation of small organic compounds called compatible solutes.
in this work, we investigated the synthesis and accumulations of compatible solutes by four rhizobial strains isolated from root nodules of phaseolus vulgaris in tunisia, as well as by the reference strain rhizobium tropici ciat 899t.
collaterally, the Î²- <dig> -cyclic glucan from r. tropici ciat  <dig> was co-extracted with the cytoplasmic compatible solutes and its chemical structure was determined.
the phylogenetic analysis of the otsa gene, encoding the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, suggested the existence of lateral transfer events.
in vivo 13c labeling experiments together with genomic analysis led us to propose the uptake and conversion pathways of different carbon sources into trehalose.
phaseoli 8a <dig>  13c- and 1h-nmr analyses showed that all rhizobium strains synthesized trehalose whereas a. tumefaciens 10c <dig> synthesized mannosucrose.
we could not find a direct correlation between the trehalose content of the rhizobial strains and their osmotolerance, suggesting that additional osmoadaptive mechanism should be operating in the most nacl-tolerant strain r. tropici ciat  <dig>
rhizospheric bacteria are subjected to osmotic stress imposed by drought and/or nacl, two abiotic constraints frequently found in semi-arid lands.
associated with appropriate crop and soil management, inoculation of legumes with microbial biofertilizers can improve food legume yield and soil fertility and reduce pollution by inorganic fertilizers.
phaseoli 31c <dig> and a. tumefaciens 10c <dig>  when added as a carbon source, mannitol was also accumulated by all strains.
phaseoli 31c <dig>  r. etli 12a <dig> and r. gallicum bv.
the most nacl-tolerant strain was a. tumefaciens 10c <dig>  followed  by r. tropici ciat  <dig>  r. leguminosarum bv.
