the aim was to determine if serum thymidine kinase  <dig>  activity and stk <dig> protein levels in dogs with mammary tumors could be useful in veterinary medicine.
serum samples from  <dig> healthy dogs and  <dig> dogs with mammary tumors were analyzed for stk <dig> activity, using an -deoxythymidine  phosphorylation assay, and for stk <dig> protein levels by immune affinity/western blot assay.

the molecular forms of stk <dig> in acute lymphocytic leukemia , canine mammary tumor , and healthy sera were determined by size exclusion chromatography.
size exclusion chromatography demonstrated major differences in the molecular forms of stk <dig> in all, healthy, and cmt dogs, with a large fraction of inactive tk <dig> protein in cmt.
our results showed that the stk <dig> protein assay can differentiate benign tumors  from healthy more efficiently than stk <dig> activity assay.
in analyses of cmt tissue extracts, tk <dig> activity eluted in two peaks, a minor peak with a high mw oligomer and a major tetramer peak.
serum tk <dig> protein and activity levels were significantly higher in cmt than in healthy dogs.
western blot analysis of chromatographic fractions showed that cellular tk <dig> protein in both all and cmt dogs, and to some extent serum tk <dig> from all dogs, correlated with activity profiles, but a large fraction of inactive tk <dig> protein was detected in cmt.
thymidine kinase  <dig>  is a deoxyribonucleic acid  precursor enzyme and a proliferation biomarker used for prognosis and treatment monitoring of breast cancer in humans.
mean stk <dig> activities in cmt were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/min/ml, differing significantly from healthy dogs .
serum tk <dig> protein  levels were also significantly higher in cmts compared to healthy dogs .
