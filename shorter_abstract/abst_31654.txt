interestingly, we could not record direct changes in the protein levels of canonical members of bmp <dig> signaling, but we did observe an upregulation of both the transcription factor stat <dig> and its active isoform phospho-stat <dig> at the protein level.
in contrast, in tsa-treated cultures we first observed an upregulation of genes involved in chromatin modification and transcription.
both bone morphogenetic proteins  and histone deacetylases  have previously been established to play a role in the development of the three major cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.
using neurospheres from the embryonic striatum as an in vitro system to analyze this phenomenon, we have performed microarray expression profiling on bmp2- and tsa-treated cultures, followed by validation of the findings with quantitative rt-pcr and protein analysis.
in bmp-treated cultures we first observed an upregulation of genes involved in cell-cell communication and developmental processes such as members of bmp and canonical wnt signaling pathways.
