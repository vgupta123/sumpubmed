support vector machine  is used as computational method and est-peptides are represented by different features such as amino acid composition and physicochemical properties.
computational localization prediction is possible based on sequence information alone, and has been successfully applied to proteins from virtually all subcellular compartments and all domains of life.
testloc is a localization prediction tool tailored for est data.
when testloc was applied to the most challenging test case , it yielded high accuracy .
knowing the subcellular location of proteins not only indicates how bio-processes are organized in different cellular compartments, but also contributes to unravelling the function of individual proteins.
