we compared genomes of  <dig> h. pylori strains from nottingham, england.
analyses of virulence genes  revealed that h. pylori strains from england are genetically distinct from strains obtained from other countries.
overall, our results demonstrated genetic affinities of h. pylori in england with both european and the asian gene pools and some distinctive genetic features of virulence genes that may have evolved in this important european population.
genomic diversity of h. pylori from many different human populations is largely unknown.
the english h. pylori gene pool revealed several asian/oriental features.
the toxigenic vaca s1m <dig> genotype was found to be less common and the plasticity region cluster was found to be disrupted in all the isolates.
english isolates showed a predominance of icea <dig> alleles and a functional proinflammatory oipa gene.
