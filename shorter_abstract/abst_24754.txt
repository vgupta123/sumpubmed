the hybridization event strongly down-regulated d-subgenome homoeologues, but this effect was in many cases reversed by whole genome doubling.
the implication is that whole genome doubling helps to overcome the phenotypic weakness of the allotriploid, restoring a more favourable gene dosage in genes experiencing transcription level dominance in hexaploid wheat.
here, rna-seq was used to obtain the genome-wide leaf transcriptome of two independent triticum turgidum × aegilops tauschii allotriploids , along with their spontaneous allohexaploids  and their parental lines.
singletons  were frequently transcribed at both the allotriploid and allohexaploid plants.
the formation of an allopolyploid is a two step process, comprising an initial wide hybridization event, which is later followed by a whole genome doubling.
