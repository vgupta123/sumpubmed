this mammalian ancestor therefore possessed the minimal a <dig> gene set, z1-z2-z <dig>  required to evolve through a remarkable series of eight recombination events into the present day eleven z domain human repertoire.
to gain insights into the mechanism and timing of a <dig> gene expansion and into the functional modularity of these genes, we analyzed the genomic sequences, expressed cdnas and activities of the full a <dig> repertoire of three artiodactyl lineages: sheep, cattle and pigs.
these data, together with phylogenetic analyses, indicated that a similar, functionally modular a <dig> repertoire existed in the common ancestor of artiodactyls and primates .
in all three species, read-through transcription and alternative splicing also produced a catalytically active double domain a3z2-z <dig> protein that had a distinct cytoplasmic localization.
