compensatory effects of many of the mutations at these paralogs and their key structural location in or nearby important functional regions support a possible functional shift  in many ang copies.
similarities between 3d-structural models for mang copies suggest that their divergence is mainly functional.
however, previous studies comparing human angiogenin with homologs from other phylogenetically related organisms have led to the conclusion that ang presents a striking variability.
we identify the main evolutionary dynamics shaping the variability of angiogenin in vertebrates and highlight the plasticity of this protein after gene duplication.
we identify many of the amino acid sites involved in signal localization and nucleotide binding by ang to have evolved under diversifying selection.
understanding why many functional ang paralogs have been preserved in mouse and rat and identifying functional divergence mutations at these copies may explain the relationship between mutations and function.
our results suggest functional divergence among mang paralogs.
this analysis shows strong evidence in support of accelerated evolution in some ang murine copies .
the biomedical importance of this protein has come from findings linking mutations in ang to cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases.
this acceleration is not due to non-functionalisation because constraints on amino acid replacements remain strong.
this puts forward mang as a good system candidate for testing functional plasticity of such an important protein while stresses caution when using mouse as a model to infer the consequences of mutations in the single ang copy of humans.
