intriguingly, the multimer resolution sites of all cole1-like plasmids had the same orientation with respect to the origin of replication.
thus, we isolated a number of rahnella strains and investigated their complements of small plasmids.
for the genus rahnella we observed plasmid-containing isolates at a frequency of 19%, which is in the average range for enterobacteriaceae.
regions of striking sequence homology of plasmids and bacterial chromosomes highlight the importance of plasmids for lateral gene transfer  to distinct genera.
although the cole1-like plasmids did not possess any mobilisation system, they shared large parts with high sequence identity in coding and non-coding regions.
most cole1-like plasmids formed a subgroup within the cole <dig> family that seems to be fairly specific for rahnella.
the g+c content of two rolling circle plasmids deviated considerably from that of rahnella, indicating that their usual hosts might belong to other genera.
although rahnella has interesting agro-economical and industrial properties and several strains possess antibiotic resistances and toxin genes which might spread within microbial communities, little is known about plasmids of this genus.
seven belonged to the cole <dig> family; one was cole2-like and three shared homology to rolling circle plasmids.
