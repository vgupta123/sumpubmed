however, the proper insertion of pcr-amplified immunoglobulin genes into expression vectors remains an obstacle to the high-throughput production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies.
we present a one-week protocol for the production of recombinant mouse monoclonal antibodies from large numbers of single plasma cells.
we developed a single-step cloning method, target-selective homologous recombination , in which pcr-amplified immunoglobulin variable genes were selectively inserted into vectors, even in the presence of nonspecifically amplified dna.
using ts-hr, immunoglobulin variable genes were cloned directly into expression vectors by co-transforming unpurified pcr products and the ts-vector into e. coli.
ts-hr utilizes red/et-mediated homologous recombination with a target-selective vector  with unique homology arms on its termini.
molecular cloning of functional immunoglobulin genes from single plasma cells is one of the most promising technologies for the rapid development of monoclonal antibody drugs.
