identification of an intact avian gene for leptin in wild birds might explain in part the evolutionary conservation of its receptor in leptin-less fowls.
nevertheless, in duck, like other domestic fowls the lep gene was not identifiable.

in vertebrates, lep gene symbol is reserved for leptin, the key regulator of energy balance in mammals.
a lep transcript up-regulated in lungs of ducks  infected by avian influenza a virus was recently described in the nature genetics manuscript that reported the duck genome.
launching an extensive search for this gene in the genome data that was submitted to the public databases along with duck genome manuscript and extending this search to all avian genomes in the whole-genome shotgun-sequencing database, we were able to report the first identification of coding sequences capable of encoding the full leptin protein precursor in wild birds.
