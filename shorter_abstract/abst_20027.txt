infection and positive results were confirmed by an a posteriori western blot.
finally, cross-reactions with antibodies directed against other species of sarcocystis might explain the positive reactions against the s. neurona antigens.
equine besnoitiosis, caused by besnoitia bennetti, and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis , caused by sarcocystis neurona and neospora hughesi are relevant equine diseases in the americas that have been scarcely studied in europe.
an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  was employed to identify a besnoitia spp.
the principal risk factors associated with a higher seroprevalence of besnoitia spp.
this study was the first extensive serosurvey of besnoitia spp.
and sarcocystis spp., infections were detected using in-house elisas based on the parasite surface antigens n. hughesi rnhsag <dig> and s. neurona rsnsag2/3/ <dig>  risk factors associated with these protozoan infections were also investigated.
infection in european equids accomplished by two complementary tests and gives evidence of the presence of specific antibodies in these populations.
thus, a serosurvey of these cystogenic coccidia was carried out in southern spain.
a cross-sectional study was performed and serum samples from horses , donkeys  and mules  were included.
further parasite detection and molecular genotyping are needed to identify the causative besnoitia and neospora species.
