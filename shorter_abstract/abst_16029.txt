we next tested the immune competence of eggs under challenge from bacterial infection, and found that eggs lacked endogenous production of antimicrobial peptides, despite well-developed responses in larvae.
using a split-brood design, which controlled for intrinsic differences in eggs produced by different females, we found that eggs washed free of surface-associated bacteria show increased survival compared to unwashed eggs.
eggs in this environment potentially face significant risks from the bacteria that proliferate in the grave-soil environment following nutrient influx from the decomposing carcass.
our results provide strong evidence that grave-soil microbes significantly reduce the survival of nicrophorus eggs.
our results suggest that nicrophorus carrion beetles, and other species developing on ephemeral resources, face a fundamental trade-off between egg immunity and development time.
the dependency on ephemeral resources might strongly select for fast developing animals.
finally, we found that despite lacking immunity, n. vespilloides eggs produce an extraembryonic serosa, indicating that the serosa has lost its immune inducing capacity in this species.

furthermore, we show that egg hatch success is significantly reduced by bacterial exposure.
