however, simulated herbivory caused a significant increase in auxin concentration.
here we describe the identification and characterization of maize cyp79a <dig> which was heterologously expressed in yeast and nicotiana benthamiana and shown to catalyze the formation of -phenylacetaldoxime and -indole-3-acetaldoxime from l-phenylalanine and l-tryptophan, respectively.
recently it has been demonstrated that aldoximes can also accumulate as part of direct plant defense in poplar.
since aldoximes have been described as toxic compounds for insect herbivores and pathogens, the increased accumulation of -phenylacetaldoxime after simulated herbivory indicates that this compound plays a role in plant defense.
simulated herbivory on maize leaves resulted in an increased cyp79a <dig> transcript accumulation and in elevated levels of l-phenylalanine and -phenylacetaldoxime.
plants produce a group of aldoxime metabolites that are well known as volatiles and as intermediates in cyanogenic glycoside and glucosinolate biosynthesis in particular plant families.
