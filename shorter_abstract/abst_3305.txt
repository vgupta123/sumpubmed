in this study, we have reexamined the role of ras proteins in folate chemotaxis and then, having re-established the importance of ras for this process, identified the parts of the rasg protein molecule that are involved.
a direct comparison of folate chemotaxis methodologies revealed that rasg-c- cells grown in association with a bacterial food source were capable of positive chemotaxis, only when their initial position was comparatively close to the folate source.
folate chemotaxis is restored in rasg-c- cells by exogenous expression of protein chimeras containing either n- or c- terminal halves of the rasg protein.
both axenic and bacterially grown cells require rasg for optimal folate chemotaxis, particularly in weak gradients.
both n- and c- terminal portions of the rasg protein are important for folate chemotaxis, suggesting that there are functionally important amino acids outside the well established switch i and switch ii interaction surfaces.
in strong gradients, the requirement for rasg is relaxed, but only in bacterially grown cells.
dictyostelium discoideum has proven to be an excellent model system for studying these networks and a body of evidence has indicated that rasg and rasc, members of the ras gtpase subfamily function as key chemotaxis regulators.
