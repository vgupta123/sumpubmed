promyelocytic leukemia protein  is a tumor suppressor that is highly expressed in endothelial cells nonetheless its role in endothelial cell biology remains elusive.
we found that pml and tnfα regulate common and distinct genes involved in a similar spectrum of biological processes, pathways and human diseases.
more importantly, we found that pml is required for fine-tuning of tnfα-mediated immune and inflammatory responses.
to identify potential pml target genes and investigate the putative crosstalk between pml’s function and tnfα signaling in endothelial cells, we carried out a microarray analysis in human primary umbilical endothelial cells .
furthermore, our data suggest that pml and tnfα synergistically regulate cell adhesion by engaging multiple molecular mechanisms.
tumor necrosis factor alpha  is an important cytokine associated with many inflammation-related diseases.
together, our study identified pml as an essential regulator of tnfα signaling by revealing the crosstalk between pml knockdown-mediated effects and tnfα-elicited signaling, thereby providing novel insights into tnfα signaling in endothelial cells.
