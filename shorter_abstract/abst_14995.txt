rna-seq analysis was validated for a number of selected candidate transcripts by using quantitative real time pcr .
the gene expression profile of luf-r larvae of s. frugiperda differs from luf-s larvae.
our data indicate that enzymes involved with the detoxification process, and mostly the p <dig>  are one of the resistance mechanisms employed by the luf-r s. frugiperda larvae against lufenuron.
of those, four were overexpressed in luf-r larvae.
a comparative analysis of the gene expression between luf-r and luf-s s. frugiperda larvae identified  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts .
thus, we utilized large-scale cdna sequencing  to compare the pattern of gene expression between lufenuron-resistant  and susceptible  s. larvae in an attempt to identify the molecular basis behind the resistance mechanism of s. frugiperda to this insecticide.
the machinery involved with the detoxification process was represented by  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts;  <dig> of them belonging to p <dig> monooxygenases, four to glutathione-s-transferases, six to carboxylases and one to sulfotransferases.
resistance to lufenuron, a chitin biosynthesis inhibitor insecticide, was recently documented in brazilian populations of s. frugiperda.
moreover, 10 % of the alignments were similar to sequences of various species of spodoptera , with 3 % of them being similar to sequences of s. frugiperda.
in general, gene expression is much higher in resistant larvae when compared to the susceptible ones, particularly for those genes involved with pathways for xenobiotic detoxification, mainly represented by p <dig> monooxygenases transcripts.
six of them were associated with cuticle metabolism.
