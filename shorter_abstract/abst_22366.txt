here, we propose and evaluate an approach to find functional associations between large numbers of genes and other biomedical concepts from free-text literature.
for this group of patients the biological background of the cancer cells is largely unknown.
based on the analysis we put forward a hypothesis about the biological processes induced in these studied cells: secretory lysosomes are involved in the production of prostatic fluid and their development and/or secretion are androgen-regulated processes.
after this proved to be successful the datasets from two dna microarray experiments were analyzed in the same way and the results were evaluated by domain experts.
high-throughput experiments, such as with dna microarrays, typically result in hundreds of genes potentially relevant to the process under study, rendering the interpretation of these experiments problematic.
the first dataset was a gene-expression profile that characterizes the cancer cells of a group of acute myeloid leukemia patients.
the second data set consisted of differentially expressed genes following androgen receptor stimulation in a prostate cancer cell line.
