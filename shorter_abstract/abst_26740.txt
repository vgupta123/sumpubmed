here we present a stand-alone utility, simrank, which allows users to rapidly identify database strings the most similar to query strings.
simrank provides molecular ecologists with a high-throughput, open source choice for comparing large sequence sets to find similarity.
software applications for sequence database partitioning, guide tree estimation, molecular classification and alignment acceleration have benefited from embedded k-mer searches as sub-routines.
