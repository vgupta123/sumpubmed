78% of haplotypes occurred at low frequency  within the collection of  <dig> genotypes.
nbs-lrr like gene fragments showed very high non-synonymous mutation rates, leading to altered amino acid sequences.
nbs-lrr like gene fragments showed a high degree of nucleotide diversity, with one snp every  <dig> bp between two randomly sampled sequences.
substantial ld decay was found within a distance of  <dig> bp for most resistance candidate genes in this study.
<dig> expressed disease resistance candidate  genes including  <dig> nucleotide binding site and leucine rich repeat  like genes and  <dig> non-nbs-lrr genes were analyzed for nucleotide diversity.
low intragenic ld was detected for most r genes, and rapid ld decay within  <dig> bp was detected.
particularly lrr regions showed very high diversity with on average one snp every  <dig> bp between two sequences.
so far, knowledge on nucleotide diversity and linkage disequilibrium in ryegrass is lacking, which is essential for the efficiency of association analyses.
in contrast, non-nbs lrr resistance candidate genes showed a lower degree of nucleotide diversity, with one snp every  <dig> bp.
association analysis is an alternative way for qtl mapping in ryegrass.
hence, ld based association analysis is feasible and promising for qtl fine mapping of resistance traits in ryegrass.
