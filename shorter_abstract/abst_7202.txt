hypothalamic expression of fto-linked genes defined with this bioinformatics approach was subsequently studied using quantitative real time-pcr in mouse feeding models known to affect fto expression.
we observed hypothalamic expression of profilin  <dig> , camp-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit beta , brain derived neurotrophic factor , neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type  <dig> , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , and btbd <dig> to be co-regulated in concert with fto.
the fat mass and obesity gene  has been identified through genome wide association studies as an important genetic factor contributing to a higher body mass index .
we investigated the potential molecular network for fto by analyzing co-expression and protein-protein interaction databases, coxpresdb and intact, as well as the functional coupling predicting multi-source database, funcoup.
we identified several candidate genes for functional coupling to fto through database studies and selected nine for further study in animal models.
however, the molecular context in which this effect is mediated has yet to be determined.
we speculate about a wider functional role for fto in the context of current and recent findings, such as in extracellular ligand-induced neuronal plasticity via ntrk2/bdnf, possibly via interaction with the transcription factor ccaat/enhancer binding protein Î² .
