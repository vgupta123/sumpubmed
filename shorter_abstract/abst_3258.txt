therefore we have developed reads2type, a web-based tool for taxonomy identification based on whole bacterial genome sequence data.
using a dataset of  <dig> whole genome sequenced bacteria from various sequencing platforms, reads2type was able to identify the species with  <dig>  % accuracy and on the minutes time scale.
raw sequencing data provided by the user are mapped against a set of marker probes that are derived from currently available bacteria complete genomes.
identification of bacteria may be based on sequencing and molecular analysis of a specific locus such as 16s rrna, or a set of loci such as in multilocus sequence typing.
