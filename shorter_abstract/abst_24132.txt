additionally we show that kh-type splicing regulatory protein  was crucial for maintaining basal lif expression levels in non-stressed müller cells.
important neuroprotective factors in the retina include h2o <dig> generated by injured photoreceptors, and leukemia inhibitory factor  expressed in müller glia cells in response to photoreceptor damage.
this process was independent of active gene transcription and p <dig> mapk, but relied on au-rich elements , which we identified within the highly conserved lif 3′utr.
we present evidence that h2o <dig> connects to the lif response by inducing stabilization of lif transcripts in müller cells.
our results suggest that h2o2-induced redox signaling increases lif transcript levels through ilf <dig> mediated mrna stabilization.
thus, regulation of endogenous neuroprotective factors may be key for cell survival and attenuation of disease progression.
among those, interleukin enhancer binding factor  <dig>  was confirmed to participate in the redox-dependent lif mrna stabilization.
generation of h2o <dig> by injured photoreceptors may thus enhance stability of lif mrna and therefore augment neuroprotective lif signaling during degenerative conditions in vivo.
