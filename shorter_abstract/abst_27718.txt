the total number of Ψs found in the snrnas of c. elegans is significantly higher than the minimal amount found in yeasts but it is lower than that seen in sequenced vertebrate snrnas.
the positions of Ψ in spliceosomal small nuclear rnas  have been determined for a number of species but not for the snrnas from caenorhabditis elegans , a popular experimental model system of development.
when the actual sites of modification on c. elegans snrnas are compared with other sequenced snrnas most of the positions correspond to modifications found in other species.
however, two of the positions modified on c. elegans snrnas are unique, one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna and one at position  <dig> on u <dig> snrna.
as with other species, c. elegans u <dig> snrna has the greatest number of Ψ residues, with nine, located in the 5' half of the u <dig> snrna.
both of these modifications are in regions of these snrnas that interact with u <dig> snrna either in the spliceosome or in the u4/u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle  and the presence of Ψ may be involved in strengthening the intermolecular association of the snrnas.
as a prelude to determining the function of or requirement for this modification in snrnas, we have mapped the positions of Ψ in u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> snrnas from worms using a specific primer extension method.
