the median length of 5' untranslated regions  was 152 nt.
in particular, full-length cdnas with one-base resolution for tsss enabled the identification of consensus motifs in promoter sequences and demonstrated clear distributions of identified motifs.
genomes of pathogens contain promising information that can facilitate the development of methods for controlling infections.
although the genome of b. bovis is publically available, annotated gene models are not highly reliable prior to experimental validation.
therefore, we validated a preproposed gene model of b. bovis and extended the associated annotations on the basis of experimentally obtained full-length expressed sequence tags .
the comparison of the preproposed gene model with our data set identified  <dig> identical genes,  <dig> almost identical genes,  <dig>  genes with potential structural inconsistencies, and  <dig> novel genes.
these observations allowed the illustration of a model promoter composition, which supports the differences in transcriptional regulation frameworks between apicomplexan parasites and mammals.
the observations in this study indicate the utility of integrated bioinformatics and experimental data for improving genome annotations.
subsequently, we identified  <dig>  transcription start sites  and  <dig>  transcriptionally active regions  by examining 5' ests.
from in vitro cultured merozoites,  <dig>  clones harboring full-length cdnas were sequenced from both ends using the sanger method, and  <dig>  full-length cdnas were assembled.
moreover, related periodical distributions were not observed in mammalian promoter regions.
