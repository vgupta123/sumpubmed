expressed sequence tags  are a source of simple sequence repeats  that can be used to develop molecular markers for genetic studies.
we also compared the level of polymorphism between genomic and est-derived ssrs and address the transferability of est-ssrs in castanea sativa .
the usefulness of these loci for establishing a genetic map was assessed using a bin mapping approach.
as a first step toward the construction of a ssr-based linkage map of oak for quantitative trait locus  mapping, we describe the mining and survey of est-ssrs as well as a fast and cost-effective approach  to assign these markers to an approximate map position.
the female and male maps comprised  <dig> and  <dig> bins, with an average bin length of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm, respectively.
overall  <dig> %  were found to amplify a single polymorphic locus in a reference full-sib pedigree of quercus robur.
the bin set consisting of  <dig> highly informative offspring selected based on the number and position of crossover sites.
primer pairs were designed for  <dig> putative unigenes.
the availability of ests for quercus robur and quercus petraea provided a unique opportunity to develop microsatellite markers to accelerate research aimed at studying adaptation of these long-lived species to their environment.
bin maps were constructed for the male and female parental tree for which framework linkage maps based on aflp markers were available.
a total of  <dig> est-ssrs were assigned to bins and their map position was further validated by linkage mapping.
est-ssrs were found to be less polymorphic than genomic ssrs, but their transferability rate to chestnut, a phylogenetically related species to oak, was higher.
a catalogue of  <dig>  sanger ests was assembled into  <dig>  unigenes from which  <dig> % presented one or more ssr motifs.
