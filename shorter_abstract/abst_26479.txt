the work presented in this paper supports research in intercellular communication by enabling knowledge‐based inference on physiologically‐related biomedical data and models.
in this paper, we use: i) formalised anatomical knowledge of connectivity between body structures and ii) a formal theory of physiological transport between fluid compartments in order to define and make explicit the routes followed by proteins to a site of interaction.
these are illustrated through the description of a prototype implementation and the treatment of a simple endocrine scenario whereby a candidate route of communication between anp and its receptors on the external membrane of smooth muscle cells in renal arterioles is elicited.
the underlying processes are the objects of mathematical models of physiology and, therefore, the motivation for the approach can be understood as using knowledge representation and reasoning methods to propose concrete candidate routes corresponding to correlations between variables in mathematical models of physiology.
the paper presents a method based on knowledge representation and reasoning for eliciting physiological communication routes.
in doing so, the paper presents the core knowledge representation and algorithms using it in the application of the method.
