many biological laboratories that deal with genomic samples are facing the problem of sample tracking, both for pure laboratory management and for efficiency.
our analysis identified adempiere erp, an open source enterprise resource planning written in java j2ee, as the best software that also natively implements some highly desirable technological advances, such as the high usability and modularity that grants high use-case flexibility and software scalability for custom solutions.
for example, adlims allows creating sample sheets from stored data using available exporting operations.
this simplicity and process standardization may avoid manual errors and information backtracking, features that are not granted using track recording on files or spreadsheets.
we started collecting end-users' requirements, composed of desired functionalities of the system and graphical user interfaces , and then we evaluated available tools that could address our requirements, spanning from pure lims to content management systems  up to enterprise information systems.
we extended and customized adempiere erp to fulfil lims requirements and we developed adlims.

adlims is natively extensible to cope with laboratory automation through platform-dependent api interfaces, and could be extended to genomic facilities due to the erp functionalities.
moreover, adlims implements automated data entry, exploiting sample data multiplexing and parallel/transactional processing.
it has been validated by our end-users verifying functionalities and guis through test cases for pcrs samples and pre-sequencing data and it is currently in use in our laboratories.
