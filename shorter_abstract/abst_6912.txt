these flies are artificially reared and treated with ionizing radiation to render males sterile for further release en masse into the field to compete with wild males and disrupt establishment of invasive populations.
flies from the vienna- <dig> colony showed a markedly reduced abundance of transcripts related to visual and chemical responses, including light stimuli, neural development and signaling pathways when compared to wild flies.
recent research suggests establishment of c. capitata in california, despite the fact that over  <dig> million sterile flies are released weekly as part of the stateâ€™s preventative program.
temperature sensitive lethal  mutants of the tephritid c. capitata are used extensively in control programs involving sterile insect technique in california.
rna-seq was performed to provide a genome-wide map of the messenger rna populations in c. capitata, and to investigate significant expression changes in vienna- <dig> mass reared flies.
in addition, genes associated with muscle development and locomotion were shown to be reduced.
