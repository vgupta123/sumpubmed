a simple model is a two-layer network with unobserved tf variables in the first layer and observed gene expression variables in the second layer.
in contrast, in the classical fa, matrix rotation methods are used to enforce sparsity and thus to increase the interpretability of the inferred factor loadings matrix.
in this paper, we explore the performance of five factor analysis algorithms, bayesian as well as classical, on problems with biological context using both simulated and real data.
most of the algorithms tested are successful in reconstructing the connectivity structure as well as the tf profiles.
most existing algorithms for the inference of the structure of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data assume that the activity levels of transcription factors  are proportional to their mrna levels.
however, one might be able to reconstruct unobserved activity profiles of tfs from the expression profiles of target genes.
moreover, we demonstrate that if the underlying network is sparse it is still possible to reconstruct hidden activity profiles of tfs to some degree without prior connectivity information.
however, we also show that bayesian fa models that do not impose sparsity through the priors can still be used for the reconstruction of a gene regulatory network if applied in conjunction with matrix rotation methods.
of particular interest are methods that produce sparse networks, networks with few edges, since it is known that most genes are regulated by only a small number of tfs, and most tfs regulate only a small number of genes.
bayesian fa methods allow one to infer sparse networks by enforcing sparsity through priors.
