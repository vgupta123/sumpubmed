in association with demographic, anatomical, behavioral and genetic data, this protocol will serve as the cornerstone to establish a hybrid database of hundreds of subjects suitable to study the range and causes of variation in the cerebral bases of numerous mental processes.
this protocol captures the cerebral bases of auditory and visual perception, motor actions, reading, language comprehension and mental calculation at an individual level.
considering the anatomical variability, we then needed to correctly describe individual functional networks in a voxel-free space.
we applied then non-voxel based methods that automatically extract main features of individual patterns of activation: group analyses performed on these individual data not only converge to those reported with a more conventional voxel-based random effect analysis, but also keep information concerning variance in location and degrees of activation across subjects.
although cognitive processes such as reading and calculation are associated with reproducible cerebral networks, inter-individual variability is considerable.
before describing inter-individual variability, we demonstrated in the present study the reliability of individual functional data obtained with this short protocol.
