supertree methods combine overlapping input trees into a larger supertree.
here, i consider split-based supertree methods that first extract the split information of the input trees and subsequently combine this split information into a phylogeny.
well known split-based supertree methods are matrix representation with parsimony and matrix representation with compatibility.
combining input trees on the same taxon set, as in the consensus setting, is a well-studied task and it is thus desirable to generalize consensus methods to supertree methods.
the search heuristic was successful in combining compatible input trees.
when combining incompatible input trees, especially one variant, mr supertrees, performed well.
the presented framework allows for an efficient score computation of three majority-rule supertree variants and input trees.
these score computations, together with a heuristic tree search minmizing the scores, were implemented in the python program plumist  available from http://www.cibiv.at/software/plumist.
i combined the score computation with a heuristic search over the supertree space.
the implementation was tested by simulation and on real data sets and showed promising results.
the different mr methods were tested by simulation and on real data sets.
