its genome has been sequenced, and several tools are being developed to perform analyses at different levels of cell organization, including transcriptomic expression analyses.
the stability of their expression level was assessed using the ct range, and by applying both the genorm and the normfinder principles of calculation.
our results exclude actin as a good normalisation gene, and, in this, are in agreement with previous studies in other organisms.
the normalisation factor should be calculated with at least two genes, alpha tubulin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme or actin-related proteins being good partners of ef1a.
brown algae are plant multi-cellular organisms occupying most of the world coasts and are essential actors in the constitution of ecological niches at the shoreline.
several topics, including physiological responses to osmotic stress and to exposure to contaminants and solvents are being studied in order to better understand the adaptive capacity of brown algae to pollution and environmental changes.
we monitored the expression of  <dig> genes under  <dig> different culture conditions.
ectocarpus siliculosus is an emerging model for brown algal research.
