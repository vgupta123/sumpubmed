the prostatic dimensions were measured and the ratio between length, height and width and the sixth lumbar vertebra was calculated.
dogs had a homogenous tissue in ultrasonography while the ct scan revealed an inhomogeneous tissue structure.
the ct examination can be a beneficial diagnostic tool for examining the prostatic size and for evaluating the prostatic tissue.
the results were compared to the dogâ€™s age.
furthermore, the ct images were compared with the results of ultrasonography .
in six cases the post-contrast ct scan showed results that differed from the ultrasound examination.
prostatic diseases in intact male dogs are common.
hus within on the post- contrast scans showed statistically significant differences between the groups.
median values of prostatic attenuation measured in hus, using regions of interests  were determined on pre- and post- contrast scans over the whole length of the prostate.
fifty pre- and post-contrast ct scans of the prostate of dogs were evaluated and divided into three groups according to the tissue structure: group <dig> dogs with homogenous prostate tissue ; group  <dig> with prostate cysts  and group  <dig> with inhomogeneous prostate tissue .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate age related-changes in the canine prostate with the help of the ct and to evaluate whether measuring hounsfield units  in different morphological conditions of the prostate is of diagnostic value.
the prostatic size in the first group was smaller than in the other groups, whereas the largest prostates were found in the second group.
