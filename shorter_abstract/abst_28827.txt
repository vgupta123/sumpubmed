we found that sexual activity enhanced male survivorship in a pathogen specific manner.
we observed no change in male survivorship upon experimentally varying the number of sexual interactions.
we subjected this idea to test using two pathogens  and three different populations of drosophila melanogaster.
the trade-off is potentially mediated through complex interactions between the host, pathogen and the environment experienced by the host.
previous studies with drosophila melanogaster show that maleâ€™s ability to clear bacteria decreases with increase in sexual activity.
our results show that the sexual activity-immunity trade-off in males cannot be generalised.
maintenance and deployment cost of immunity is high, therefore, it is expected to trade-off with other high cost traits like sexual activity.
interestingly, the beneficial effects of sexual activity increased with time of co-habitation with females and declined when access to females was restricted.
sexually active males show higher resistance than virgins upon infection with pseudomonas entomophila.
