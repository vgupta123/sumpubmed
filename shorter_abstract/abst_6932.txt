position-specific priors have been shown to be a flexible and elegant way to extend the power of gibbs sampler-based motif discovery algorithms.
we extend the popular em-based meme algorithm to utilize position-specific priors and demonstrate their effectiveness for discovering transcription factor  motifs in yeast and mouse dna sequences.
we conclude that using position-specific priors can substantially increase the power of em-based motif discovery algorithms such as meme algorithm.
on these datasets, meme using the prior has a higher success rate than eight other conservation-based motif discovery approaches.
information of many types–including sequence conservation, nucleosome positioning, and negative examples–can be converted into a prior over the location of motif sites, which then guides the sequence motif discovery algorithm.
utilizing a discriminative, conservation-based prior dramatically improves meme's ability to discover motifs in  <dig> yeast tf chip-chip datasets, more than doubling the number of datasets where it finds the correct motif.
