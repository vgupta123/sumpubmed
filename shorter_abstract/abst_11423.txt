previously published theory - allowing for variable pool sizes - has been applied to four microarray gene expression data sets from different species in order to assess the practical relevance of this type of technical error in terms of significance and size of this variance component.
as a consequence a special kind of technical error occurs, which can be modelled by a respective variance component.
these results correspond to a false discovery rate of  <dig> % in each data set.
simulations clearly indicated overly-optimistic  test results in terms of false discovery rates whenever this source of variability was not represented in the model.
the number of transcripts with a significant variance component due to imperfect blending was found to be  <dig>  in mouse data and  <dig>  in honey bees, but only  <dig> in rats and none whatsoever in human data.
imperfect equality of shares when blending rna from different individuals into joint pools of variable size is a source of technical variation with relevance for experimental design, practice at the laboratory bench and data analysis.
in this method, rna from different individuals sharing the same experimental conditions and explanatory variables is blended and their concentrations are jointly measured.
pooled samples are frequently used in experiments measuring gene expression.
