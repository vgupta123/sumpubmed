in this study, we show that alcam expression is silenced in erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cell lines.
there is a lineage-specific silencing of alcam in bi-potential erythromegakaryocytic progenitor cell lines.
activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule  is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells.
marked apoptosis of alcam-expressing k <dig> clones treated with pma suggests that aberrant alcam expression in erythromegakaryocytic progenitors may contribute to megakaryocytopenia.
induction of megakaryocytic differentiation in k <dig> clones expressing alcam activated pkc-Î´ and triggered apoptosis.
in agreement with this finding, the alcam promoter is occupied by gata- <dig> in vivo, and a cognate motif at - <dig> inhibited promoter activity in k <dig> and meg- <dig> cells.
