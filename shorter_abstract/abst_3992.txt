surprisingly, wnt <dig> knockouts lack maxillary palps.
interestingly, wnt <dig> is absent from the genome of hemipterans, correlating with the absence of maxillary palps in these insects.
wnt <dig> is important for maxillary palp development in drosophila, and phylogenetic analysis indicates that loss of wnt <dig> may also have led to loss of maxillary palps on an evolutionary time scale.
in wing discs, wnt <dig> is expressed at the dorsal/ventral boundary in a pattern similar to that of wingless, an important regulator of wing size.
to test whether wnt <dig> also contributes towards wing size regulation, we generated wnt <dig> knockout flies.
wnt <dig> knockout flies are viable and have no obvious defect in wing size or planar cell polarity.
