the proposed approach constitutes a highly automated tool for the identification of metalloproteins, which provides results of comparable quality with respect to highly manually refined predictions.
the ability to model correlations between pairwise residues allows it to obtain a significant improvement over standard 1d based approaches.
the predictor was trained using chains containing zinc-binding sites and non-metalloproteins in order to provide positive and negative examples.
metalloproteins are proteins capable of binding one or more metal ions, which may be required for their biological function, for regulation of their activities or for structural purposes.
in addition, the method permits the identification of unprecedented metal sites, providing important hints for the work of experimentalists.
the present results were in good agreement with the outcomes of previous, highly manually curated, efforts for the identification of human zinc-binding proteins.
results based on strong non-redundancy tests prove that  zinc-binding residues can be predicted and  modelling the correlation between the binding state of nearby residues significantly improves performance.
the trained predictor was then applied to the human proteome.
