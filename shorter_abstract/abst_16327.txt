to further investigate this question we examined the actions of isoflurane, ttx, extracellular ca2+, cnqx and stimulus voltage  on glutamate-mediated transmission at hippocampal excitatory synapses.
consistent with previous studies, these results indicate a presynaptic site of action that involves reduced excitation-release coupling.
recent studies suggest that isoflurane reduces glutamate release by block of na channels.
isoflurane appears to depress ca <dig> synapses at presynaptic sites downstream from na channels, as evident by the increased facilitation that accompanies epsp depression.
fiber volleys did not exhibit depression by isoflurane, as has been reported for other brain regions.
isoflurane  reversibly depressed epsp amplitudes by ~60% while facilitation increased ~20%.
similarly, partial antagonism of postsynaptic glutamate receptors with cnqx  depressed epsp amplitudes with no change in facilitation.
isoflurane depression of epsp amplitudes could also be partly reversed by high external ca2+  that also decreased facilitation.
however, epsp depression by low external ca2+  was accompanied by an increase in facilitation comparable to isoflurane.
by contrast, ttx didn't alter the fv-epsp curve slope, indicating that epsp depression resulted from fv depression.
anesthetic-induced cns depression is thought to involve reduction of glutamate release from nerve terminals.
the ec <dig> for isoflurane depression of fvs was ~ <dig>  mm .
