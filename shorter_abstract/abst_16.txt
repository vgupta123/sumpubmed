in recent years, several new hypotheses on phylogenetic relations among arthropods have been proposed on the basis of dna sequences.
in total  <dig> ribosomal proteins were obtained for the collembolan folsomia candida.
although ribosomal proteins in general may not evolve independently, they once more appear highly valuable for phylogenetic reconstruction.
here, we re-evaluate the position of collembola using ribosomal protein gene sequences.
each ribosomal protein gene was available for 25% to 86% of the taxa.
this underpins the inconsistency between nuclear and mitochondrial datasets when analyzing pancrustacean relationships.
caution is needed when applying mitochondrial markers in deep phylogeny.
