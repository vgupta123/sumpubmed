here we introduce tcr, a new r package, representing a platform for the advanced analysis of t cell receptor repertoires, which includes diversity measures, shared t cell receptor sequences identification, gene usage statistics computation and other widely used methods.
tcr is an r package for the advanced analysis of t cell receptor repertoires after primary tr sequences extraction from raw sequencing reads.
the immunoglobulins  and the t cell receptors  play the key role in antigen recognition during the adaptive immune response.
