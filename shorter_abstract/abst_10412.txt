technical variability is too high to ignore.
technical variability results in inconsistent detection of exons at low levels of coverage.
we provide practical recommendations for dealing with the technical variability, without dramatic cost increases.
biological variation has been reported to be larger than technical variation.
the size of technical variance, and the role of sampling are examined in this manuscript.
in addition, technical variation has been reported to be in line with expectations due to random sampling.
however, strategies for dealing with technical variation will differ depending on the magnitude.
exon detection between technical replicates is highly variable when the coverage is less than  <dig> reads per nucleotide and estimates of gene expression are more likely to disagree when coverage is low.
in this study three independent solexa/illumina experiments containing technical replicates are analyzed.
when coverage is low, large disagreements between technical replicates are apparent.
this may be due to the low sampling fraction and if so, it will persist as an issue needing to be addressed in experimental design even as the next wave of technology produces larger numbers of reads.
