two types of electric arcs were compared, different with respect to their durations.
these results are promising and warrant developing electric arcing as a novel method for spore inactivation.
in the context of spore contamination involved in bio-terrorism and food preservation, the development of new techniques for spore inactivation is an important challenge.
in particular,  <dig> discharges of  <dig> μs duration induced inactivation in more than 55% of surface treated at an inactivation rate above  <dig>  log <dig>
here, a successful application of electric arc discharges resulting in spore death was reported.

the discharges with  <dig>  μs duration induced a small inactivation area of  <dig>  % of surface treated around their point of entry into the sample, while those with  <dig> μs duration induced a much larger inactivation area from  <dig> to  <dig> % of surface treated roughly proportional to the number of discharges delivered.
