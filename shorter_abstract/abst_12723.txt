bovine tuberculosis  is a contagious, debilitating human and animal disease caused by mycobacterium bovis, a member of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.
nineteen spoligotype patterns were identified among  <dig> samples with five novel patterns.
this study estimates a relatively true proportion of btb in the regions of mali and reveals new spoligotype patterns.
the study objective were to estimate the frequency of btb, examine genetic diversity of the m. bovis population in cattle from five regions in mali and to determine whether m. bovis is involved in active tuberculosis  in humans.
mycobacterium dna from tb patients was spoligotyped to identify m. bovis.
out of  <dig> cattle,  <dig> specimens presented lesions and then examined for the presence of m. bovis.
thus,  <dig>  were identified as m. bovis; eight  were non-tuberculous mycobacterium .
one case of m. bovis  was identified among 67 tb patients.
