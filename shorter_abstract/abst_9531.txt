pmp <dig>  a member of the junction protein family claudin/emp/pmp <dig>  plays an important role in myelin formation.
we successfully confirmed that medaka fish pmp <dig> has the same exon-intron structure as mammals, and identified some known conserved regulatory motifs.
several cmt1a model rodents have been established by overexpressing pmp <dig>  thus, it is thought that pmp <dig> expression must be tightly regulated for correct myelin formation in mammals.
the purpose of this study is to analyze the evolutionary conservation of the association between pmp <dig> transcription level and vertebrate myelin formation, and to find the conserved non-coding sequences for pmp <dig> regulation by comparative genomics analyses between jawed fishes and mammals.
a transgenic pmp <dig> over-expression medaka fish line was established.
medaka fish undergo abnormalities in the pns when pmp <dig> transcription increases.
interestingly, the myelin sheath is also present in other jawed vertebrates.
the transgenic fish had approximately one fifth the peripheral ncv values of controls, and aberrant myelination of transgenic fish in the peripheral nerve system  was observed.
the pathophysiological phenotype of cmt1a is aberrant axonal myelination which induces a reduction in nerve conduction velocity .
