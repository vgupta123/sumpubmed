our experiments, on the contrary, showed an increased adherence of haired shells to wet surfaces.
in the present study, we analysed the correlation between the presence/absence of hairs and habitat conditions in the genus trochulus in a bayesian framework of character evolution.
it had been previously hypothesised that these costly protein structures of the outer shell layer facilitate the locomotion in moist habitats.
the absence of hairs in some trochulus species could thus be explained as a loss of the potential adaptive function linked to habitat shifts.
these losses were correlated with a shift from humid to dry habitats, indicating an adaptive function of hairs in moist environments.
