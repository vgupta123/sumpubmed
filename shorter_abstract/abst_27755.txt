although half of the patients reported a slight attenuation of tinnitus perception, group analysis resulted in no significant difference when comparing the three specific types of tbs.
in addition there was no significant difference when comparing the responder and non-responder groups regarding their anamnestic and audiological data.
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation  over the temporoparietal cortex was recently introduced to modulate tinnitus perception.
changes in subjective tinnitus perception were measured with a numerical rating scale .
patients received  <dig> pulses of continuous tbs , intermittent tbs  and intermediate tbs  over left inferior temporal cortex with an intensity of 80% of the individual active or resting motor threshold.
in the current study, the effect of theta-burst stimulation , a novel rtms paradigm was investigated in chronic tinnitus.
cortical excitability changes as well as imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory circuits play a distinct pathophysiological role in chronic tinnitus.
tbs applied to inferior temporal cortex appeared to be safe.
twenty patients with chronic tinnitus completed the study.
the tq score correlated significantly with the vas, lower loudness indicating less tinnitus distress.
