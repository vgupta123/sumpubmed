phaseolus vulgaris  is the second most important legume crop in the world after soybean.
a biphasic pattern of gene expression was observed for several genes regulated in response to fungal infection.
the enrichment of the public database with over  <dig>  bean ests significantly adds to the genomic resources available for this important crop plant.
regulation of selected bean genes in response to bean rust infection was confirmed by qrt-pcr.
the expression pattern of  <dig> bean genes upon rust infection shares several features with other legumes infected by biotrophic fungi.
plant gene expression was similar for both race  <dig> and  <dig> during the first  <dig> hours of the infection process but varied significantly at the later time points  mainly due to the presence of the avr <dig> gene in the race  <dig> leading to a hypersensitive response in the bean plants.
consequently, yield losses due to fungal infection, like uromyces appendiculatus , have strong consequences.
several resistant genes were identified that confer resistance to bean rust infection.
the analysis of these genes in response to bean rust infection provides a foundation for further studies of the mechanism of fungal disease resistance.
