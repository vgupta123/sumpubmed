electrophoretic gel-shift, chip, and co-transfection assays all support a role for these myb sites in rfx <dig> expression.
turning to upstream regulation of the rfx <dig> promoter, we identified a cluster of three binding sites  for the myb family of transcription factors.
searches of pachytene up-regulated genes identified high affinity rfx binding sites  in promoter regions of several new genes: adam <dig>  pdcl <dig>  and spag <dig>  we confirmed a strong promoter-region x-box for alf, a germ cell-specific variant of general transcription factor tfiia.
because testis is one of the few sites of a-myb expression, and because spermatogenesis arrests in pachytene in a-myb knockout mice, the mbs cluster implicates rfx <dig> as an a-myb target.
immunohistology on testis sections showed that a-myb expression is up-regulated only after pachytene spermatocytes have clearly moved away from the tubule wall, which correlates with onset of rfx <dig> expression, whereas b-myb expression, by contrast, is prevalent only in earlier spermatocytes and spermatogonia.
mammalian spermatogenesis involves formation of haploid cells from the male germline and then a complex morphological transformation to generate motile sperm.
using alf as an example of a target gene, we showed that its promoter is stimulated by rfx <dig> in transfected cells and used chip analysis to show that the promoter is occupied by rfx <dig> in vivo.
focusing on meiotic prophase, some tissue-specific transcription factors are known  or suspected  to play important roles in modulating gene expression in pachytene spermatocytes.
