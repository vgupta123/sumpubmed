the system can be used by bio-medical researchers without specific computation skills to validate potential biomarkers or multi-gene classifiers.
we developed survival online , a web-based system that allows for the analysis of affymetrix genechip microarrays by using a parallel version of dchip.
complex microarray gene expression datasets can be used for many independent analyses and are particularly interesting for the validation of potential biomarkers and multi-gene classifiers.
expression values of selected genes are then correlated with sample annotation data by uni- or multi-variate cox regression and survival analyses.
