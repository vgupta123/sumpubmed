gram-negative bacteria cause most nosocomial respiratory infections.
imipenem was the most active agent, inhibiting 90% of enterobacteriaceae and a. baumanii organisms.
the most common organisms were klebsiella spp , a. baumanii , and escherichia coli .
our results suggest that imipenem resistance in our region is growing.
k. pneumoniae isolates of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype were more resistant to imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline in our study than they are in other regions of the world.
we considered approximately 12% of klebsiella pneumoniae and 21% of e. coli isolates to be possible producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
