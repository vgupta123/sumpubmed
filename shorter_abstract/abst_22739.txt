the four analyses consistently detected two regions on ssc <dig>  and ssc <dig>  with highly significant effects on the porcine blood lipid profile.
analysis of data with mixed-model methods  and plink showed a low positional concordance between trait-associated regions  for serum lipids at  <dig> and 190Â days.
moreover, we have found that snp variation within ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig>  ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> tars is associated with the expression of several genes mapping to other chromosomes and related to lipid metabolism.
the genetic determinism of blood lipid concentrations, the main risk factor for atherosclerosis, is practically unknown in species other than human and mouse.
to gain new insights into this issue, we have carried out a genome-wide association study  for cholesterol , triglyceride  and low  and high  density lipoprotein concentrations measured in duroc pigs at two time points .
besides, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by snps at these two time points was also substantially different.
our data demonstrate that the effects of genomic determinants influencing lipid concentrations in pigs, as well as the amount of phenotypic variance they explain, are influenced by age-related factors.
even in model organisms, little is known about how the genetic determinants of lipid traits are modulated by age-specific factors.
