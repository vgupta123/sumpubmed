we report for the first time negative spoligotype-associated total loss of crispr region spacers and repeats, with accompanying clonally specific loss of flanking genes, including at least crispr-associated genes cas <dig> and cas <dig>  since cas <dig> deleted e.coli shows increased sensitivity to dna damage and impaired chromosomal segregation, we discussed the possibility of a similar phenotype in the deleted-dr strains and beijing family strains as both lack the cas <dig> gene.
two isolates of each of three negative spoligotype mtbc  were subjected to next generation sequencing .
ngs reads from negative spoligotype mtbc mapped to reference h37rv nc_ <dig>  suggested that the dr/crispr regions were completely deleted except for retention of the middle is <dig> mobile element.
genomic rd deletions defined lineages corresponding to the major spoligotype families beijing, eai, and haarlem, consistent with  <dig> loci miru-vntr profiles.
other controls consisted of ngs reads and complete whole genome sequences from genbank for  <dig> intact-dr mtbc and for  <dig> deleted-dr mtbc strain recognized as cas by its defining rd deletion.
although many negative spoligotype strains are recorded as spoligotype-international-type   <dig> in the sitvit international database, this is the first time to our knowledge that it has been shown that negative spoligotype strains are found in at least  <dig> different  <dig> loci miru-vntr and rd deletion families.

as positive controls, ngs was performed for three intact-dr isolates belonging to t3_eth, the largest multiple-drug-resistant -containing african-origin cluster in israel.
crispr and crispr-flanking genomic regions are important for molecular epidemiology of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex  strains, and potentially for adaptive immunity to phage and plasmid dna, and endogenous roles in the bacterium.
analysis of ngs reads, and analysis of contigs obtained by manual pcr confirmed that all  <dig> gold standard dr/crispr spacers were missing in the deleted-dr genomes.
clonally specific deletion of crispr-flanking genes also was observed, including deletion of at least cas <dig> and cas <dig> genes.
