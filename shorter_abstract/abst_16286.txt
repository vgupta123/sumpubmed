in so doing, we bridged confounding gap regions that limited our initial attempts to close this  <dig>  mb genome, through integration of data from illumina nextera paired-end, pacbio rs, and lucigen nxseq mate-pair libraries.
staphylococcus aureus  infections range in severity due to expression of certain virulence factors encoded on mobile genetic elements .
we also demonstrate a procedure to construct and validate the assembly of s. aureus genomes, using tager  <dig> as a proof-of-concept.
genomic analysis of tager  <dig> revealed limited mge, and a νsaβ island configuration that is reminiscent of other hospital acquired s. aureus genomes.
furthermore, we provide independent confirmation of our segmental arrangement of the tager  <dig> genome by the sole use of lucigen nxseq libraries filled by paired-end miseq reads and alignment with spades software.
to understand the evolution of these dangerous pathogens, it is paramount to define reference strains that may predate mge acquisition.
