the cd4+/cd8+ t cell ratio in non-vaccinated animals increased during acute infection, driven by an absolute decrease of cd8+ cells.
after challenge, circulating lymphocytes decreased in non-vaccinated animals, coincident with viremia, ifn activity, and clinical disease, whereas lymphocyte and monocyte counts in vaccinated animals were unaffected by vaccination but transiently increased after challenge.
overall, the systemic factors examined were not associated with the fmdv carrier/non-carrier divergence; however, significant differences were identified between responses of non-vaccinated and vaccinated cattle.
eighteen steers that had received a recombinant fmdv a vaccine  <dig> weeks earlier and  <dig> non-vaccinated steers were challenged by intra-nasopharyngeal deposition of fmdv a <dig>  for up to 35 days after challenge, host factors including complete blood counts with t lymphocyte subsets, type i/iii interferon  activity, neutralizing and total fmdv-specific antibody titers in serum, as well as antibody-secreting cells  were characterized in the context of viral infection dynamics.

the incidence of fmdv persistence was  <dig>  % in non-vaccinated and  <dig>  % in vaccinated animals.
in order to investigate host factors associated with the establishment of persistent foot-and-mouth disease virus  infection, the systemic response to vaccination and challenge was studied in  <dig> steers.
both groups had a lasting increase of specific igg and neutralizing antibody after challenge.
