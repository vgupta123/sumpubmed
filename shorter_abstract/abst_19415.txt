in this paper we propose a new graphical tool which not only identifies genes with up and down regulations, but also genes with differential expression in different subclasses, that are usually missed if current statistical methods are used.
we compared our results with the ones obtained using some of the standard methods for detecting differentially expressed genes, namely welch t-statistic, fold change , rank products , average difference , weighted average difference , moderated t-statistic , intensity-based moderated t-statistic , significance analysis of microarrays  and area under the roc curve .
we also compared our results with  area between roc curve and rising area  and  the test for not proper roc curves .
we found our methodology more comprehensive, because it detects both bimodal and multimodal distributions and different variances can be considered on both samples.
our results indicate that the arrow plot represents a new flexible and useful tool for the analysis of gene expression profiles from microarrays.
it is well known that biological samples are heterogeneous because of factors such as molecular subtypes or genetic background that are often unknown to the experimenter.
bimodal or multimodal distributions often reflect the presence of subsamples mixtures.
on both datasets all differentially expressed genes with bimodal or multimodal distributions were not selected by all standard selection procedures.
another advantage of our method is that we can analyze graphically the behavior of different kinds of differentially expressed genes.
