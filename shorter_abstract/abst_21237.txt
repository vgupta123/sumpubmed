pet dogs naturally develop osteosarcoma providing a novel opportunity to model metastasis development and progression.
collectively, these data support the strong similarities between human and canine osteosarcoma and underline the opportunities provided by a comparative oncology approach as a means to improve our understanding of cancer biology and therapies.
expression of these genes in an independent population of pediatric osteosarcoma patients was associated with poor outcome .
further understanding of the mechanisms of metastasis and resistance for this aggressive pediatric cancer is necessary.
given the accelerated biology of canine osteosarcoma, we hypothesized that a direct comparison of canine and pediatric osteosarcoma expression profiles may help identify novel metastasis-associated tumor targets that have been missed through the study of the human cancer alone.
