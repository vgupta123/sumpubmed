using a realistic set of genes identified by genome-wide association studies , we achieve 90% coverage of all exonic regions using stringent design criteria.
mpd can successfully design multiplex pcr experiments suitable for next-generation sequencing, and simplifies retooling targeted resequencing pipelines to focus on new targets as new genetic evidence emerges.
we present mpd, a software package that automates the design of multiplex pcr primers for next-generation sequencing.
there are a number of approaches to targeted resequencing, including microfluidic pcr amplification, which may be enhanced by multiplex pcr.
currently, there is no open-source software that can design next-generation multiplex pcr experiments that ensures primers are unique at a genome-level and efficiently pools compatible primers.
the number and nature of variants we observe are consistent with high quality sequencing.
