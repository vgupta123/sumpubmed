due to its low infectious dose, ease of dissemination and high case fatality rate, f. tularensis was the subject in diverse biological weapons programs and is among the top six agents with high potential if misused in bioterrorism.
single nucleotide polymorphisms on species and subspecies level were confirmed by partial amplification and sequencing of  <dig> additional strains.
fish was also successfully applied to detect different f. tularensis strains in infected cells or tissue samples.
we could show that fish targeting the 23s rrna gene is a rapid and versatile method for the identification and differentiation of f. tularensis isolates from both laboratory cultures and clinical samples.
in blood culture systems spiked with f. tularensis, bacterial cells of different subspecies could be separated within single samples.
the complete 23s rrna genes of representative strains of f. philomiragia and all subspecies of f. tularensis were sequenced.
no cross reactivity with strains of  <dig> clinically relevant bacterial species was observed.
francisella  tularensis is the causative agent of tularemia.
by combination of different probes, it was possible to differentiate the f. tularensis subspecies holarctica, tularensis, mediasiatica and novicida.
methods for the direct detection of the pathogen  have been developed but are restricted to reference laboratories.
different fish protocols allowed the positive identification of all  <dig> f. philomiragia strains, and more than  <dig> f. tularensis strains tested.
