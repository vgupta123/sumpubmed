analyses also revealed that differential use of habitat might have played an important role in the speciation dynamics of this group of fishes, in particular among new world species where extensive sample coverage was available.
previous studies proposed different relationships that were not recovered in this analysis.
we also developed a phylogenetic hypothesis of the new world species based on five molecular markers  as a framework to evaluate the evolutionary history, the ecological diversification and speciation patterns of this group.
in the present work we have examined the phylogenetic relationships of the family using selected representatives of additional percomorpha based on bayesian and maximum likelihood methods by means of three mitochondrial genes.
mitochondrial genes and different reconstruction methods consistently recovered a monophyletic haemulidae with the sillaginidae as its sister clade .
we also present a robust molecular phylogeny of haemulinae based on the combined data of two nuclear and three mitochondrial genes.
the genus pomadasys was shown to be polyphyletic and haemulon, anisotremus, and plectorhinchus were found to be paraphyletic.
four of seven presumed geminate pairs were indeed found to be sister species, however our data did not support a contemporaneous divergence.
