genes encoding extended spectrum beta lactamases are usually located on transferable plasmids.
moreover, the use of crude lysates and sybr-green saves a considerable amount of hands-on time without decreasing the sensitivity or specificity.
we successfully integrated the post-pcr analysis of the replicon typing into a closed system, which leads to a 10-fold increase in sensitivity compared to agarose gel visualization.
based on this method, we designed a rapid approach with amplicon detection by real-time melting curve analysis.
