our data demonstrate that the developed rt-qpcr infectivity assay is a rapid high throughput approach to quantify the infectious titer or potency of live attenuated or defective viral-based vaccines, an attribute which is associated with product quality.
the data were analyzed using the parallel-line analysis as described in the european pharmacopoeia 8th edition.
the coefficient of variation from the six independent assays was less than 10%.
a suitable correlation was determined between both assays using an identical sample set in both assays.
the relative infectious titre of hsv <dig> candidate vaccine was determined by a rt-qpcr method targeting hsv- <dig> gd <dig> gene.
the rt-qpcr infectivity assay was further characterized by evaluating the intermediate precision and accuracy.
in this study, a high throughput rt-qpcr based approach was developed to evaluate the infectious titre in a replication-defective hsv- <dig> candidate vaccine, called hsv <dig>  this assay is a combination of viral propagation and quantitative rt-pcr which measures the amount of rna in infected cells after incubation with test samples.
the stability of hsv <dig> test samples were also investigated in a concordance study between rt-qpcr infectivity assay and a classical plaque assays.
