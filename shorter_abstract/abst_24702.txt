the evolution of host-plant conservatism and ecological specialisation is discussed.
repeated colonisation of novel host-plants is believed to be an essential component of the evolutionary success of phytophagous insects.
results indicated very strong support for a model describing the origin of the common ancestor of acacia thrips subsequent to that of acacia.
a current estimate puts the origin of acacia at approximately  <dig> million years before the common ancestor of acacia thrips, and  <dig> million years before the origin of a gall-inducing clade.
path and stepping-stone sampling are used in a bayesian approach to test divergence timing between the origin of acacia and colonisation by thrips.
this results in a cumulation of lineages that each evolve host conservatism on different and potentially transient host-related traits, and facilitates both ecological and resource specialisation.
the evolution of host conservatism and resource specialisation resulted in a phylogenetically under-dispersed pattern of host-use by several thrips lineages.
the relative timing between the origin of an insect lineage and the plant clade they eat or reproduce on is important for understanding how host-range expansion can lead to resource specialisation and speciation.
ecological specialisation resulted from habitat selection and selection on thrips behavior that promoted primary and secondary host associations.
host conservatism evolved on phenotypically and environmentally suitable host lineages.
