we found evidence for slight isolation by distance in modern populations, as well as differentiation associated with time, both of which can likely be attributed to random genetic drift.
despite high sequence diversity , no evidence for spatial structure  is found either in modern samples or ancient samples for either gene, and bayesian skyline plots suggested little change in the effective population size over the past  <dig>  years.
in this study we briefly review these studies, and present a new phylogeographical study of the red fox  throughout europe, using a combination of ancient dna sequences obtained from museum specimens, and modern sequences collated from genbank.
it is probable that the high dispersal ability and adaptability of the red fox has contributed to the lack of observable differentiation, which appears to have remained consistent over tens of thousands of years.
we used cytochrome b  and the mitochondrial control region  to elucidate both current and historical phylogeographical patterning.
generalised patterns of how animals are thought to have responded to historical climatic change are not necessarily valid for all species, and so understanding the differences between species will be critical for predicting how species will be affected by future climatic change.
