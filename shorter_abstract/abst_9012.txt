dynamic flux balance analysis  is a dynamic simulation framework for biochemical processes.
the extended system obtained through the lp feasibility problem in dfbalab provides a penalty function that can be used in optimization algorithms.
in addition, dfbalab’s running time scales linearly with the number of species models.
dfbalab, a matlab-based simulator that uses the lp feasibility problem to obtain an extended system and lexicographic optimization to yield unique exchange fluxes, is presented.
few existing simulators address the theoretical and practical challenges of nonunique exchange fluxes or infeasible linear programs .
dfbalab does not fail during numerical integration due to infeasible lps.
