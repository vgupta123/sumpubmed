stronger phenotypes have been connected to stress tolerance and epigenetic changes, and in arabidopsis t-dna mutants, two generations of homozygosity with the msh <dig> insertion are required before severe phenotypes begin to emerge.
using rna-seq, we analyze pathways that are associated with msh <dig> loss, including abiotic stresses such as cold response, pathogen defense and immune response, salicylic acid, mapk signaling, and circadian rhythm.
in all cases, the magnitude of changes among protein-coding genes, transposable elements, and small rnas increases according to generation and phenotypic severity.
this study enforces the recognition of organelles as critical integrators of both internal and external cues, and highlights the relationship between organelle and nuclear regulation in fundamental aspects of plant development and stress signaling.
using small rna-seq we further identify mirna changes, and uncover sirna trends that indicate modifications at the chromatin organization level.
among these genes, muts homolog  <dig>  is notable for generating an assortment of mutant phenotypes with varying degrees of penetrance and pleiotropy.
subtle redox and environment-responsive changes also begin in the first generation, in the absence of strong phenotypes.
loss of msh <dig> is sufficient to cause large-scale regulatory changes in pathways that have been individually linked to one another, but rarely described all together within a single mutant background.
these observations prompted us to examine how msh <dig> mutants contrast according to generation and phenotype by profiling their respective transcriptomes and small rna populations.
