in cancer cells we observed shorter pathways, larger extension of the networks, a lower signaling frequency of central proteins and links and a higher information content of the network.
our global analysis revealed a distinct formation of signaling-regulation in cancer cells when compared to cells of normal samples.
these proteins showed motifs of regulatory integration in normal cells which was disrupted in tumor cells.
formation of cellular malignancy results from the disruption of fine tuned signaling homeostasis for proliferation, accompanied by mal-functional signals for differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis.
we wanted to observe central signaling characteristics on a global view of malignant cells which have evolved to selfishness and independence in comparison to their non-malignant counterparts that fulfill well defined tasks in their sample.
proteins of high signaling frequency were enriched with cancer mutations.
