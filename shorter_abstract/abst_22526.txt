mixture model analysis was applied to tm data.
mixture model analysis correctly identified categories in tm data obtained for known plasmid targets.
mixture model analysis of tm data allows the minimum number of different sequences in a set of amplicons and their relative frequencies to be determined.
however, there is currently no convention on how to statistically analyze such high-resolution tm data.
this approach allows tm data to be analyzed, classified, and compared in an unbiased manner.
