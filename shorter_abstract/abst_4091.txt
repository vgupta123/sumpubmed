group  <dig> was comprised of herds with sows, suckling pigs and nursery pigs, whereas herds in group  <dig> in all cases kept fattening pigs.
the methodology and statistical approach used in this study were feasible to scientifically assess “satisfaction”, and to determine factors influencing farmers’ and vets’ opinion about the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine.
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a telephone survey in gaining an understanding of the possible herd and management factors influencing the performance  of a vaccine against porcine circovirus type  <dig>  in a large number of herds and to estimate customers’ satisfaction.
since 1-, 2- and 3-site production systems were surveyed, the herds were allocated in one of two subsets, where only applicable variables out of  <dig> were analysed.
in the final model for group  <dig>  the diagnosis of diseases other than pcv <dig>  the reason for vaccine administration being other than pcv2-associated diseases and using a single injection of iron had significant influence on allocating into the green cluster .
in group  <dig>  herds using the vaccine due to recognised pcv <dig> related health problems  had a  <dig> -fold increased chance  of belonging to the green cluster.
overall  <dig> variables evaluating the subjective satisfaction with one particular pcv <dig> vaccine were comingled to an abstract dependent variable for further models, which was characterized by a binary outcome from a cluster analysis: good/excellent satisfaction  and moderate satisfaction .
the other  <dig> variables comprised information about diagnostics, vaccination, housing, management, were considered as independent variables.
