patulin is a mycotoxin produced by penicillium expansum, the causal agent of blue mold of stored pome fruits, and several other species of filamentous fungi.
also, genes encoding proteins involved in transport of ions, cell division and cell cycle were downregulated.
upregulated sporobolomyces genes were those involved in oxidation-reduction and transport processes, suggesting the activation of defense mechanisms to resist patulin toxicity and expel the mycotoxin out of the cells.
conversely, patulin treatment decreased the expression of genes involved in the processes of protein synthesis and modification, such as transcription, rna processing, translation, protein phosphorylation and biosynthesis of amino acids.
biocontrol agents in the pucciniomycotina, such as the yeasts sporobolomyces sp.
in this investigation we applied a transcriptomic approach based on rnaseq to annotate the genome of sporobolomyces sp.
iam  <dig> and then study the changes of gene expression in sporobolomyces sp.
this mycotoxin has genotoxic, teratogenic and immunotoxic effects in mammals, and its presence in pome fruits and derived products represents a serious health hazard.
patulin treatment leads to ros production and oxidative stress that result in the activation of stress response mechanisms controlled by transcription factors.
this indicates a reduction of metabolic activity, probably due to the high energy requirement by the cells or metabolic arrest while recovering from the insult caused by patulin toxicity.
