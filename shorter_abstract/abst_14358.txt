we hypothesized that acute sbs alone has significant effects on gene expression beyond epithelial proliferation, and tested this in a zebrafish sbs model.
the upregulated genes were involved in cell proliferation, acute phase response signaling, innate and adaptive immunity, bile acid regulation, production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, cellular barrier and coagulation.
rt-qpcr confirmed gene expression differences from rna-sequencing.
much of the morbidity associated with short bowel syndrome  is attributed to effects of decreased enteral nutrition and administration of total parenteral nutrition .

rna-seq analysis identified  <dig> significantly upregulated genes and  <dig> significantly downregulated genes in sbs zebrafish intestine compared to sham with ingenuity analysis.
the three samples from each group with the highest amount of rna were spiked with external rna controls consortium  controls, sequenced and aligned to reference genome with gene ontology  enrichment analysis performed.
the downregulated genes were involved in folate synthesis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, fatty-acid oxidation and activation and drug and steroid metabolism.

changes of gene expression after 2 weeks of sbs indicate complex and extensive alterations of multiple pathways, some previously implicated as effects of tpn.
the proximal intestine was harvested and rna isolated.
