computer simulations of the tetracycline operon afford augmented insight into the interplay between its molecular components.
our model consists of biochemical reactions that capture the biomolecular interactions of this intriguing system.
the results of the simulations agree well with experimental observations such as tight repression, fast gene expression, induction with tetracycline, and small intracellular tetr <dig> amounts.
a sensitivity analysis of two critical parameters embodied this system is also performed providing a useful understanding of the function of this system.
sensitivity analysis with respect to the binding strength of tetracycline to repressor and of repressor to operators suggests that these two parameters play a predominant role in the behavior of the system.
because of the performance of the molecular elements of the tetracycline operon, these elements are widely used as parts of synthetic gene networks where the protein production can be efficiently turned on and off in response to the presence or the absence of tetracycline.
the tetracycline operon is a self-regulated system.
in this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the tetracycline operon.
having in mind that small biological systems are subjects to stochasticity, we use a stochastic algorithm to simulate the tetracycline operon behavior.
we find that lack of one of the promoters of the tetracycline operon has no influence on the total behavior of this system inferring that this promoter is not essential for escherichia coli.
therefore, simulations may assist in designing novel gene network architectures consisting of tetracycline operon components.
it is found naturally in bacteria where it confers resistance to antibiotic tetracycline.
to this end, we develop a mathematical model guided by experimental findings.
