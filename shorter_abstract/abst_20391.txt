n-linked protein glycosylation plays an important role in various biological processes, including protein folding and trafficking, and cell adhesion and signaling.
molecular evolutionary analysis suggested that these sites were under positive selection during human evolution.
we analyzed the human glycoproteome data set  and identified  <dig> novel n-glycosylation sites in  <dig> proteins that arose in the human lineage since the last common ancestor of euarchonta .
we propose that the novel n-glycosylation sites described in this study may be useful candidates for functional analyses to identify innovative genetic modifications for beneficial phenotypes acquired in the human lineage.
three of them, asn- <dig> in adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein , asn- <dig> in cluster of differentiation  <dig> , and asn- <dig> in thyroglobulin, are human-specific.
the acquisition of a novel n-glycosylation site may have significant effect on protein structure and function, and therefore, on the phenotype.
