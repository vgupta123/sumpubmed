we thoroughly analyzed native peptide pools of physcomitrella patens moss in two developmental stages as well as in protoplasts.
potential functions of peptides in different developmental stages are discussed.
protein degradation is a basic cell process that operates in general protein turnover or to produce bioactive peptides.
we suggest that peptide pools in plant cells are not merely a product of waste protein degradation, but may serve as important functional components for plant metabolism.
degradation of plastid proteins in protoplasts was accompanied by suppression of photosynthetic activity.
however, in general, the composition of peptide pools was very different between these cell types.
we assume that the peptide “burst” is a form of biotic stress response that might produce peptides with antimicrobial activity from originally functional proteins.
peptidomic analysis was supplemented by transcriptional profiling and quantitative analysis of precursor proteins.
in this study we comprehensively analyzed a plant cell peptidome and systematically analyzed the peptide generation process.
