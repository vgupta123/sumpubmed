this leads to a remarkable variety of applications, allowing us to achieve optimizations under multiple objective functions, alternative solutions and backtracing, holistic search space analysis, ambiguity checking, and more, without additional programming effort.
we demonstrate the method on several applications for rna secondary structure prediction.
based on this programming style, we introduce a generic product operation of scoring schemes.
the product operation as introduced here adds a significant amount of flexibility to dynamic programming.
it provides a versatile testbed for the development of new algorithmic ideas, which can immediately be put to practice.
