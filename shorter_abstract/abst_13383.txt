through utilizing the information from the structure of the gene ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods have better potential than the conventional flat multi-label classification approach to facilitate protein annotation based on the literature.
in this research, we investigated the methods of enhancing automatic multi-label classification of biomedical literature by utilizing the structure of the gene ontology graph.
we systematically evaluated and compared these graph-based classification algorithms to a conventional flat multi-label algorithm.
the results indicate that, through utilizing the information from the structure of the gene ontology graph, the graph-based multi-label classification methods can significantly improve predictions of the gene ontology terms implied by the analyzed text.
we have studied three graph-based multi-label classification algorithms, including a novel stochastic algorithm and two top-down hierarchical classification methods for multi-label literature classification.
the task is usually cast as a text classification problem, and contemporary methods are confronted with unbalanced training data and the difficulties associated with multi-label classification.
furthermore, the graph-based multi-label classifiers are capable of suggesting gene ontology annotations  that are closely related to the true annotations even if they fail to predict the true ones directly.
