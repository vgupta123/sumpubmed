immunization of a rabbit with a 20-mer peptide, corresponding to the n-terminus of the human 5-ht3b receptor subunit, generated serum with polyclonal antibodies from which an igg fraction was purified, yielding pab <dig>  the antibodies were shown to label 5-ht3b receptor subunits in transfected human embryonic kidney cells and rodent tissues using western blots.
we have demonstrated that pab <dig> antibodies specifically label native and recombinant 5-ht3b receptor subunits with high affinity and specificity.
while antibodies specific for the 5-ht3a receptor subunit are plentiful, and have revealed a wealth of structural and functional information, few antisera exist for the detection of 5-ht3b receptor subunits.
here we describe the generation and characterisation of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum that specifically recognises 5-ht3b receptor subunits
immunocytochemistry using pab <dig> on these cells showed that 5-ht3b receptor subunits do not reach the plasma membrane in the absence of 5-ht3a receptor subunits.
