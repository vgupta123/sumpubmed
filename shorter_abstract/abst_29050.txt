the isolation of these rock outcrops is reflected in the high number of recorded endemic species and the strong floristic differences between individual inselbergs and adjacent habitats.
based on plastid markers, high genetic differentiation was found for e. cinnabarinum  and e. secundum .
because of their fragmented nature, inselberg species are interesting biological models for studying the genetic consequences of disjoint populations.
both species showed similar patterns of genetic diversity and structure, highlighting the importance of seed-restricted gene flow and genetic drift as drivers of plant diversification in terrestrial islands such as inselbergs.
our results confirm the ancient and highly isolated nature of inselberg populations.
haplotypes were not geographically structured in either taxon, suggesting that restricted gene flow and genetic drift may be significant factors influencing the diversification of these inselberg populations.

for e. secundum, nuclear markers indicated higher gene flow by pollen than by seeds.
moreover, strong differentiation was found between populations over short spatial scales, indicating substantial periods of isolation among populations.
inselbergs are commonly compared with oceanic islands, as most of them display a marked ecological isolation from the surrounding area.
we examined the genetic connectivity of orchids epidendrum cinnabarinum and e. secundum adapted to neotropical inselbergs of northeastern brazil.
