the proposed strategy was used to solve a set of single-objective case studies related to unbranched and branched metabolic networks of different levels of complexity.
first, we consider a set of single-objective examples of increasing complexity taken from the recent literature.
this new methodology can be applied to metabolic networks with arbitrary topologies, non-linear dynamics and constraints.
second, we consider generalized multi-objective formulations for several examples, and we show how this framework results in more biologically meaningful results.
further, we considered, for the first time, multi-objective formulations, illustrating how activation in metabolic pathways can be explained in terms of the best trade-offs between conflicting objectives.
optimal control theory has been succesfully used to compute optimal enzyme profiles considering simple metabolic pathways.
during the last decade, a number of authors have shown that the genetic regulation of metabolic networks may follow optimality principles.
in this work we consider a more general multi-objective formulation and we present solutions based on recent developments in global dynamic optimization techniques.
