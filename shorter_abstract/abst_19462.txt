single gene phylogenetic analyses indicated some reticulation or incomplete lineage sorting.
carthamus – c. oxyacanthus and c. palaestinus – as the most likely progenitors, although some attention has been paid to a third species  as a possible candidate.
in contrast, c. oxyacanthus and c. persicus appear to be more distantly related to safflower.
however, the analysis of the combined dataset revealed a close relationship between safflower and c. palaestinus.
here, we describe the results of a phylogenetic analysis of the entire section using data from seven nuclear genes.
based on our results, we conclude that safflower is most likely derived from the wild species carthamus palaestinus.
the results of this research set the stage for an investigation of the genetics of safflower domestication.
as expected, safflower exhibits somewhat reduced nucleotide diversity as compared to its progenitor, consistent with the occurrence of a population genetic bottleneck during domestication.
