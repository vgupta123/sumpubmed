our results also indicate that in some situations different models are selected by different criteria for the same dataset.
appropriate selection of nucleotide substitution models is important because the use of incorrect models can mislead phylogenetic inference.
together with model-adequacy tests, accurate model selection will serve to improve the reliability of phylogenetic inference and related analyses.
our results indicate that the bayesian information criterion and decision theory should be preferred for model selection.
explicit evolutionary models are required in maximum-likelihood and bayesian inference, the two methods that are overwhelmingly used in phylogenetic studies of dna sequence data.
the hierarchical likelihood-ratio test performed poorly when the true model included a proportion of invariable sites, while the bayesian information criterion and decision theory generally exhibited similar performance to each other.
we demonstrate that the bayesian information criterion and decision theory are the most appropriate model-selection criteria because of their high accuracy and precision.
