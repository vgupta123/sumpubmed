we provide here a comprehensive homology-based annotation of non-coding rnas in the recently sequenced genome of d. vexillum.
the resulting candidate set was curated extensively to produce a high-quality ncrna annotation of the first draft of the d. vexillum genome.
the comprehensive annotation of the d. vexillum non-coding rnas provides a starting point towards a better understanding of the restructuring of the small rna system in ascidians.
it comprises  <dig> mirna families,  <dig> families of ribosomal rnas,  <dig> isoacceptor classes of trnas ,  <dig> snrnas,  <dig> snornas, and  <dig> other rna family.
furthermore it provides a valuable research for efforts to establish detailed non-coding rna annotations for other recently published and recently sequences in tunicate genomes.
additionally,  <dig> families of mitochondrial trnas and  <dig> of mitochondrial ribosomal rnas and  <dig> long non-coding rna.
beyond mirnas, not much in known about tunicate ncrnas.
