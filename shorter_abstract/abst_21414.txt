comparison with previous dart mapping studies in perennial and italian ryegrass  identified  <dig> and  <dig> dart markers in common, respectively, of which 94% and 87% mapped to homoeologous linkage groups.
dart markers are likely to be a useful common marker resource for ryegrasses and fescues, though the success in aligning different populations through the mapping of common markers will be influenced by degrees of population interrelatedness.
in l. perenne, the genetic distance spanned by the dart markers encompassed the majority of the regions that could be described in terms of comparative genomic relationships with rice, brachypodium distachyon, and sorghum bicolor.
the detailed mapping of dart and gene-based markers in this study potentially allows comparative relationships to be derived in future mapping populations characterised using solely dart markers.
they are classified within the sub-family pooideae and so are closely related to brachypodium distachyon, wheat, barley, rye and oats.
a similar comparison with meadow fescue  identified only  <dig> dart markers in common, of which c. 50% mapped to non-homoelogous linkage groups.
