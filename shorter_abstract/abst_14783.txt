this study demonstrates the need for continuous surveillance of rv strains in various animal populations, which will facilitate the identification of rotavirus hosts not previously reported.
rotaviruses have a wide host range infecting a broad range of animal species, however little is known about rotavirus infection in exotic animals.
rotavirus , is a member of the reoviridae family and an important etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in the young.
in this paper we report the first characterisation of a rv strain from a giraffe calf.
detailed sequence analysis of vp <dig> and vp <dig> revealed significant identity at the amino acid sequence level to bovine rv .
this report describes the identification and detailed molecular characterisation of a rotavirus strain detected from a 14-day-old giraffe , presenting with acute diarrhea.
furthermore, extending typical epidemiology studies to a broader host range will contribute to the timely identification of new emerging strain types.
the rv strain detected from the giraffe was characterized molecularly as g10p <cit> .
