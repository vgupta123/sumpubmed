recently, we identified a series of kinase inhibitors that preferentially inhibit hck in the presence of nef.
this modification stabilized nef:hck interaction in solution-based kinase assays, as a way to mimic the more stable association that likely occurs at cellular membranes.
to test this hypothesis, we engineered a "gatekeeper" mutant of hck with enhanced sensitivity to the pyrazolopyrimidine tyrosine kinase inhibitor, napp <dig>  we also modified the rt loop of the hck sh <dig> domain to enhance interaction of the kinase with nef.
introduction of the modified rt loop rendered hck remarkably more sensitive to activation by nef, and led to a significant decrease in the km for atp as well as enhanced inhibitor potency.
nef interacts with a multitude of host cell signaling partners, including members of the src kinase family.
these observations suggest that stable interaction with nef may induce src-family kinase active site conformations amenable to selective inhibitor targeting.
our findings also suggested that by binding to the hck sh <dig> domain, nef indirectly affects the conformation of the kinase active site to favor inhibitor association.
nef preferentially activates hck, a src-family kinase  strongly expressed in macrophages and other hiv target cells, by binding to its regulatory sh <dig> domain.
