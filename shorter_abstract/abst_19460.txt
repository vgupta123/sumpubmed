based on these results we argue that the anterior archenteron represents a bona fide lro and propose that cilia-based symmetry breakage is a synapomorphy of the deuterostomes.

in most vertebrates, asymmetric nodal induction results from a cilia-driven leftward fluid flow at the left-right organizer , a ciliated epithelium present during gastrula/neurula stages.
high-speed videography revealed rotating cilia in the archenteron slightly before asymmetric nodal induction.
our data demonstrate that cilia - like in vertebrates - are required for asymmetric nodal induction in sea urchin embryos.
here we study sea urchin embryos, which use nodal to establish larval lr asymmetry as well.
expression of foxj <dig> and dnah <dig> suggested that archenteron cilia were motile.
cilia were polarized to the posterior pole of cells, a prerequisite of directed flow.
left-right  organ asymmetries are a common feature of metazoan animals.
removal of cilia through brief high salt treatments resulted in aberrant patterns of nodal expression.
