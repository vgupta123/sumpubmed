without knowing the chimeric boundaries of an integration, its genetic content cannot be determined.
these methods identify individual viral-host junctions but do not associate chimeric pairs as an integration event.
summonchimera is a perl program that associates chimera pairs to infer the complete viral genomic integration event to the nucleotide level within single or paired-end ngs data.
further, summonchimera integration inference precisely predicted bacteriophage integration.
viral integration into a host genome is defined by two chimeric junctions that join viral and host dna.
recently, computational tools have been developed that utilize ngs data to detect chimeric junctions.
furthermore, summonchimera predicted integrations from experimentally verified hepatitis b virus chimeras within a paired-end whole genome sequencing hepatocellular carcinoma tumor database.
