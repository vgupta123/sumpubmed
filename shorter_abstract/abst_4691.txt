this study shows that gtriv consists of  <dig> transmembrane helices,  <dig> large periplasmic loops,  <dig> small cytoplasmic n- and c- terminal ends and a re-entrant loop that occurs between transmembrane helices iii and iv.
both gtra and gtrb have been demonstrated to be highly conserved and interchangeable among serotypes while gtr was found to be specific to each serotype, leading to the hypothesis that the gtr proteins are responsible for attaching glucosyl groups to the o-antigen in a site- and serotype- specific manner.
the three bacteriophage genes gtra, gtrb and gtr are responsible for o-antigen glucosylation in shigella flexneri.
furthermore, both the n-terminal periplasmic and the c-terminal periplasmic loops are important for gtriv function as shown via a series of loop deletion experiments and the creation of chimeric proteins between gtriv and its closest structural homologue, gtric.
