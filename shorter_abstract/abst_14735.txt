here, we report the identification of a candidate gene of gr in peach.
peach leaf color is controlled by a single gr gene on linkage group  <dig>  with a red allele dominant over the green allele.
based on transcriptome comparison between red- and green-colored leaves, an myb transcription regulator ppmyb <dig>  in the gr interval was identified to regulate anthocyanin pigmentation in peach leaf.
this suggests a complex mechanism underlying anthocyanin accumulation in peach leaf.
the red coloration of peach leaves is due to accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which is regulated at the transcriptional level.
however, ppmyb <dig>  has diverged from these anthocyanin-activating mybs to generate a new gene family, which regulates anthocyanin accumulation in vegetative organs such as leaves.
leaf red coloration is an important characteristic in many plant species, including cultivars of ornamental peach .
in addition, ppmyb <dig>  and other anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae responsible for anthocyanin accumulation in fruit are dated to a common ancestor about  <dig> million years ago .
activation of an ancient duplicated myb gene ppmyb <dig>  in the gr interval on lg  <dig>  which represents a novel branch of anthocyanin-activating myb genes in rosaceae, is able to activate leaf red coloration in peach.
transient expression of ppmyb <dig>  in tobacco and peach leaves can induce anthocyain accumulation.
moreover, a functional myb gene ppmyb <dig>  on linkage group  <dig>  which is homologous to ppmyb <dig> , is also expressed in both red- and green-colored leaves, but plays no role in leaf red coloration.
