using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  data for ctcf, ago <dig>  hp1α, h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  rnapii, total h <dig> and 5metc and alternative splicing arrays from two cell lines, we have analyzed the combinatorial code of their binding to chromatin in relation to the alternative splicing patterns between two cell lines, mcf <dig> and mcf <dig>  using machine learning techniques, we identified the changes in chromatin signals that are most significantly associated with splicing regulation between these two cell lines.
additionally, we found a significant association of hp1α and ctcf activities around the regulated exons and a putative dna binding site for hp1α.
moreover, we have built a map of the chromatin signals on the pre-mrna, that is, a chromatin-based rna-map, which can explain  <dig>  of the regulated events between mcf <dig> and mcf <dig>  this chromatin code involves the presence of hp1α, ctcf, ago <dig>  rnapii and histone marks around regulated exons and can differentiate patterns of skipping and inclusion.
these results raise the question of whether these proteins may associate at the chromatin level to modulate alternative splicing.
our results show that a considerable number of alternative splicing events could have a chromatin-dependent regulation involving the association of hp1α and ctcf near regulated exons.
alternative splicing is primarily controlled by the activity of splicing factors and by the elongation of the rna polymerase ii .
in particular, the ccctc-binding factor , the argonaute protein ago <dig>  and members of the heterochromatin protein  <dig>  family have been implicated in the regulation of splicing associated with chromatin and the elongation of rnapii.
