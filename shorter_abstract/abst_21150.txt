ribotagger permits fast recovery of ssu-rna sequences from shotgun nucleic acid surveys of complex microbial communities.
taxonomic profiling of microbial communities is often performed using small subunit ribosomal rna  amplicon sequencing , while environmental shotgun sequencing is often focused on functional analysis.
large shotgun datasets contain a significant number of ssu sequences and these can be exploited to perform an unbiased ssu--based taxonomic analysis.
