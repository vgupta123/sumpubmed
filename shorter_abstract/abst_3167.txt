the lack of an explicit formalization of these constraints can lead to errors and inconsistencies in automated and manual annotation.
the gene ontology project supports categorization of gene products according to their location of action, the molecular functions that they carry out, and the processes that they are involved in.
we have formalized the taxonomic constraints implicit in some go classes, and specified these at various levels in the ontology.
