we test the ability of our enrichment method in finding annotation terms disregarded by other enrichment methods available.
considering a set of proteins in the context of their interaction network can help in better defining their functions.
here we describe a novel procedure based on the extraction from the string interactome of sub-networks connecting proteins that share the same gene ontology terms for biological process .
enrichment analysis is performed by mapping the protein set to be analyzed on the sub-networks, and then by collecting the corresponding annotations.

enrichment analysis is a widely applied procedure for shedding light on the molecular mechanisms and functions at the basis of phenotypes, for enlarging the dataset of possibly related genes/proteins and for helping interpretation and prioritization of newly determined variations.
in  <dig> cases , the network-based procedure extracts go terms neglected by the standard method, and in  <dig> cases , some of the newly enriched go terms are not included in the set of annotations characterizing the input proteins.
we benchmarked  <dig> sets of proteins associated to different mendelian diseases, according to the omim web resource.
our procedure is effective even when the size of the input protein set is small, requiring at least two input proteins.
