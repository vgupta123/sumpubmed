we also show a large number of diverse correlations between demographic factors and the perception of individual odours that may reflect genetic differences as well as different prior experiences with these odours between demographic groups.
beyond these factors we also show that, surprisingly, there are many odour-specific influences of race, age, and gender on olfactory perception.
these data provide a comprehensive snapshot of the olfactory sense of a diverse population.
people vary both in their general olfactory acuity as well as in if and how they perceive specific odours.
in recent years, it has been shown that genetic differences contribute to variability in both general olfactory acuity and the perception of specific odours.
here we investigate the influence of these factors on both general olfactory acuity and on the perception of  <dig> structurally and perceptually different odours in a diverse subject population.
we show that general olfactory acuity correlates with gender, age, race, smoking habits, and body type.
young, female, non-smoking subjects had the highest average olfactory acuity.
deviations from normal body type in either direction were associated with decreased olfactory acuity.
olfactory acuity in the population is most strongly influenced by age, followed by gender.
odour perception also depends on other factors such as age and gender.
we show over  <dig> instances in which the intensity or pleasantness perception of an odour is significantly different between two demographic groups.
