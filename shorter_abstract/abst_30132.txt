the neck shaft angle , the femoral antetorsion angle , the acetabulum anteversion angle  and the acetabulum slope angle  were measured.
the changes, observed during the developmental period, were not statistically significant.
hip development ratios were plotted for all cadaveric species and revealed: flat fsl/nsa slope pattern, upward fsl/faa slope pattern and downward slope pattern for fsl/asa and fsl/aaa ratios.
the purpose of the study was an evaluation of fetal hip joint morphology during the second and the third trimester of pregnancy.
femoral shaft length  and width of the proximal and distal epiphysis were x-rayed to determine fetal age.
despite an increasing depth and growing dimensions of the acetabulum in the uterus, its orientation does not change in any significant way.
the mean lunar age was  <dig>  months.
serial sections were performed on  <dig> cadaver infants.
