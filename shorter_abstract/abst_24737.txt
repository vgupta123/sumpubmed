the cys2-his <dig> zinc finger motif is the ideal structural scaffold on which to construct a sequence-specific protein.
the target sequences in the a <dig> promoter were submitted to the on-line zf tools server of the barbas laboratory, scripps research institute , to obtain a specific  <dig> bp target sequence and also the amino acid sequence of a zfp that would bind to it.
a <dig> has been shown to prevent tnf-induced cytotoxicity in a variety of cell types including fibroblasts, b lymphocytes, wehi  <dig> cells, nih 3t <dig> cells and endothelial cells.
a <dig> is a cytoplasmic zinc finger protein that inhibits nuclear factor kappa-b activity and tumor necrosis factor -mediated programmed cell death.
the optimized dna sequence of this artificial zfp was recombined into the eukaryotic expression vector pires2-egfp to construct pires2-egfp/zfp-flag recombinants, and the expression and biological activity of the zfp were analyzed by rt-pcr, western blotting and emsa, respectively.
artificial transcription factors  are composed of dna-binding and functional domains.
in order to design a zinc finger protein  structural domain that binds specific target sequences in the a <dig> gene promoter region, the structure and sequence composition of this promoter were analyzed by bioinformatics methods.
sequence characterization and structural modeling of the predicted zfp were performed by bioinformatics methods.
it is feasible to design specific zinc finger proteins by bioinformatics methods.
these domains can be fused together to create proteins that can bind a chosen dna sequence.
