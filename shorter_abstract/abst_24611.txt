undoubtedly, some of the mirnas identified will have roles not only in mosquito development, but also in mediating viral infection in the mosquito host.
west nile virus  and dengue virus, members of the flaviviridae family, are primarily transmitted by aedes and culex mosquitoes.
here, we provide evidence for over  <dig> conserved and seven novel mosquito mirnas, expanding upon our current understanding of insect mirnas.
using high-throughput deep sequencing, we examined the mirna repertoire in ae.
quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, the majority of which are conserved in other insects such as drosophila melanogaster and anopheles gambiae.
to determine whether flavivirus infection affects mirna expression, we infected female culex mosquitoes with wnv.
aedes and culex mosquitoes are important flavivirus vectors.
recent advances in both mosquito genomics and high-throughput sequencing technologies enabled us to interrogate the mirna profile in these two species.
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in a variety of organisms, including insects, vertebrates, and plants.
quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, two of which have predicted orthologs in an.
two mirnas, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  showed significant changes in expression levels following wnv infection.
the most highly expressed mirna in both mosquito species was mir- <dig>  a mirna conserved from insects to vertebrates.
mirna expression was confirmed by primer extension analysis.
we identified seven novel mirnas, arising from nine different precursors, in c7/ <dig> cells and cx.
several of these novel mirnas reside within a ~ <dig> nt long cluster present in both aedes and culex.
