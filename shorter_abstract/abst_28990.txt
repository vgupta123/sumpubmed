aquatic vascular plants are a distinctive group, differing from terrestrial plants in their growth forms and habitats.
among the various aquatic plant life forms, the evolutionary processes of freshwater submerged species are most likely distinct due to their exclusive occurrence in the discrete and patchy aquatic habitats.
we sequenced  <dig> individuals from  <dig> sampling locations throughout china and identified a significant phylogeographic structure , in which four distinct lineages occurred in different areas.
the worldwide distribution of hydrilla is due to recent vicariance and dispersal events that occurred in different clades during the pleistocene.
a high level of genetic differentiation among populations  was detected.
the divergence of hydrilla was estimated to have occurred in the late miocene, and the diversification of various clades was dated to the pleistocene epoch.
using the chloroplast trnl-f region sequence data, we investigated the phylogeographic structure of a submerged macrophyte, hydrilla verticillata, the single species in the genus hydrilla, throughout china, in addition to combined sample data from other countries to reveal the colonisation and diversification processes of this species throughout the world.

biogeographic analyses suggested an east asian origin of hydrilla and its subsequent dispersal throughout the world.
