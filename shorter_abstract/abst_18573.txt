these data represent the broad range of strains that are used in rat research including commonly used substrains.
since the completion of the rat reference genome in  <dig>  whole-genome sequencing data from more than  <dig> rat strains have become available.
in addition, we find that the degree of substrain variation is highly variable between strains, which is of importance for the correct interpretation of experimental data from different labs.
substrain snvs may have a larger predicted functional impact compared to older shared snvs.
in summary we present a comprehensive catalog of uniformly analyzed genetic variants among  <dig> widely used rat inbred strains based on the rgsc <dig>  assembly.
in addition, all rat whole genome sequencing studies to date used an outdated reference genome for analysis .
we reanalyzed all primary data using a recent version of the rat reference assembly  and identified over  <dig> million genomic variants  among the  <dig> strains.
<dig>  snvs are specific to individual substrains, which may be explained by introgression from other unsequenced strains and ongoing evolution by genetic drift.
