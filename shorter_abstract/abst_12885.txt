ectopic expression of mir-k12- <dig> differentially affected gene expression in bjab cells of lymphoid origin and tive cells of endothelial origin.
direct mirna targeting accounted for a small fraction of the observed transcriptome changes: only  <dig> genes were identified as putative direct targets of mir-k12- <dig> in both cell types.
these effector genes, including cancer associated transcription factors and signaling proteins, amplified the regulatory potential of a single mirna, from a small set of putative direct targets to a larger set of genes.
however, a number of commonly affected biological pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism and interferon response related signaling, were revealed by gene ontology analysis.
this is the first comparative analysis of mirna-k12-11’s effects in endothelial and b cells, from tissues infected with kshv in vivo.
advances in target identification technologies and molecular interaction databases have allowed a systems biology approach to unravel the gene regulatory networks  triggered by mir-k12- <dig> in endothelial and lymphoid cells.
mir-k12- <dig> was able to broadly modulate gene expression in both cell types.
during latent infection, kshv expresses mir-k12- <dig>  an ortholog of the human tumor gene hsa-mir- <dig>  both gene products are micrornas , which are important post-transcriptional regulators that contribute to tissue specific gene expression.
kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpes virus  is associated with tumors of endothelial and lymphoid origin.
understanding the tissue specific function of mir-k12- <dig> will help to elucidate underlying mechanisms of kshv pathogenesis.
integration of transcriptome profiling, bioinformatic algorithms, and databases of protein-protein interactome from the encode project identified different nodes of grns utilized by mir-k12- <dig> in a tissue-specific fashion.
