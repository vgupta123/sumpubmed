in an effort to better understand the molecular networks that underpin macrophage activation we have been assembling a map of relevant pathways.
it is also a valuable resource for computational modelling and aid in the interpretation of functional genomics data.
the pathway diagram is a navigable visual aid for displaying a consensus view of the pathway information available for these systems.
the integrated pathway includes a total of  <dig> unique proteins, the complexes formed between them and the processes in which they are involved.
we envisage that this work will be of value to those interested in macrophage biology and also contribute to the ongoing systems biology community effort to develop a standard notation scheme for the graphical representation of biological pathways.
the diagram includes detailed views of the toll-like receptor  pathways, other pathogen recognition systems, nf-kappa-b, apoptosis, interferon signalling, map-kinase cascades, mhc antigen presentation and proteasome assembly, as well as selected views of the transcriptional networks they regulate.
