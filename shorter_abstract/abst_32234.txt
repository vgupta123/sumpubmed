although free of many limitations imposed by microarray design, its potential to estimate absolute transcript levels is unknown.
our result shows that in terms of overall technical performance, rna-seq is the technique of choice for studies that require accurate estimation of absolute transcript levels.
at present, high throughput sequencing is emerging as an alternative methodology for transcriptome studies.
microarrays revolutionized biological research by enabling gene expression comparisons on a transcriptome-wide scale.
we find that rna-seq provides a better estimate of absolute expression levels.
in this study, we evaluate relative accuracy of microarrays and transcriptome sequencing  using third methodology: proteomics.
