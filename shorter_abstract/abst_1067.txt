the arabidopsis maps gpt <dig> and gpt <dig> bind mts directly through their basic regions.
we report here that two homologous maps from arabidopsis thaliana, growing plus-end tracking  <dig>  and gpt <dig> , contain basic mt-binding regions at their central and c-terminal regions, and bind directly to mts in vitro.
interestingly, gpt1/ <dig> preferentially accumulated at the growing plus ends of cortical mts in interphase arabidopsis cells.
this tip tracking behavior of gpt proteins does not depend on the two established plant + tips, end-binding protein  <dig>  and spiral <dig> .
in eukaryotic cells, a plethora of mt-associated proteins  regulate the dynamics and higher-order organization of mts to mediate distinct cellular functions.
