roku ranks genes according to their overall tissue specificity using shannon entropy and detects tissues specific to each gene if any exist using an outlier detection method.
we observed that roku was superior to a conventional entropy-based method in its ability to rank genes according to overall tissue specificity and to detect genes whose expression pattern are specific only to objective tissues.
we evaluated the capacity for the detection of various specific expression patterns using synthetic and real data.
roku is useful for the detection of various tissue-specific expression patterns.
we would like to have ways of identifying such tissue-specific genes.
