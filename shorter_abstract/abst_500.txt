we also employ a new metric, the signal-to-noise ratio of protein complexes embedded in each network, to assess the power of the different methods.
seven confidence assignment schemes, including those of bader et al., deane et al., deng et al., sharan et al., and qi et al., are compared in this work.
importantly, we also find that utilizing any of the probability assignment schemes is always more beneficial than assuming all observed interactions to be true or equally likely.
recent technological advances have enabled high-throughput measurements of protein-protein interactions in the cell, producing large protein interaction networks for various species at an ever-growing pace.
to combat false positive discoveries, a number of different methods have been recently developed that associate confidence scores with protein interactions.
