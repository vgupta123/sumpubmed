at  <dig> days post infection , b lymphocyte and t lymphocyte numbers decreased in the dual infected, but not in the single infected piglets.
therefore, the t and b cell responses following pcv <dig> infection in 3-week old spf piglets infected with pcv <dig> or pcv <dig> plus porcine parvovirus  were studied.
pcv2-specific ifn-γ sc were observed in the pcv2/ppv infected group at  <dig> d p.i.
a reduction in the numbers of ifn-γ sc was observed following anti-cd <dig> and anti-cd <dig> antibody treatment, suggesting roles for both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in the response against pcv <dig> infection.
at this time point a transient pcv <dig> viraemia was noted in the pcv <dig> infected groups.
interestingly, this response was absent in the pcv2/ppv dual infected animals.
infection of weaned spf piglets with pcv <dig> alone or combined with ppv does not induce disease and in both cases a relatively slow anti-pcv <dig> antibody response and weak t lymphocyte responses were found.
in the animals infected with ppv alone, ifn-γ secreting cells  that were not specific for pcv <dig> were detected by elispot assay at day  <dig> p.i.
this was supported by an observed increase in the percentage of ifn-γ positive cd8hi cytotoxic t cells as well as ifn-γ positive cd8-/low helper t cells after pcv <dig> in vitro re-stimulation.
for anti-ppv antibodies, with no apparent influence of pcv <dig> on the early ppv antibody development.
