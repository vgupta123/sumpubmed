streptococcus pneumoniae is a widely distributed commensal gram-positive bacteria of the upper respiratory tract.
we designed a medium throughput approach to systematically test for interactions between these pneumococcal surface proteins and host proteins .
we conclude that whether peptidoglycan binding proteins do not appear to be major adhesins, most of the choline-binding proteins interact with host proteins .
as a consequence, pneumococcus has developed efficient antibiotic resistance, and the use of vaccines covering a limited number of serotypes such as pneumovax® and prevnar® results in the expansion of non-covered serotypes.
despite the number of described virulence factors, we believe that the majority of them remain to be characterized.
pneumococcal surface proteins represent challenging candidates for the development of new therapeutic targets against the bacteria.
availability of genome sequences facilitated the identification of pneumococcal surface proteins bearing characteristic motifs such as choline-binding proteins  and peptidoglycan binding  proteins.
we cloned, expressed and purified  <dig> pneumococcal surface proteins.
pneumococcal colonization can progress to invasive disease, and thus become lethal, reason why antibiotics and vaccines are designed to limit the dramatic effects of the bacteria in such cases.
