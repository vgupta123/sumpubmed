many go terms refer to chemical entities that participate in biological processes.
we describe a collaborative effort between the go and the chemical entities of biological interest  ontology developers to ensure that the representation of chemicals in the go is both internally consistent and in alignment with the chemical expertise captured in chebi.
our work has resulted in the creation of computable definitions of go terms that contain fully defined semantic relationships to corresponding chemical terms in chebi.
the gene ontology  facilitates the description of the action of gene products in a biological context.
the set of logical definitions using both the go and chebi has already been used to automate aspects of go development and has the potential to allow the integration of data across the domains of biology and chemistry.
these logical definitions are available as an extended version of the ontology from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/extensions/go-plus.owl.
