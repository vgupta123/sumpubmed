third and lastly, a curated disease biomarker network was created by relating the proteins/genes in specific disease contexts, such analysis showed  <dig> markers for  <dig> diseases.
systems biological approach of molecular connectivity map has reached to a great interest to understand the gene functional similarities between the diseases.
second, disease-disease network includes  <dig> positively scored disease-disease relationships.
in this study, we developed a computational framework to build molecular connectivity maps by integrating mutated and differentially expressed genes of neurological and psychiatric diseases to determine its relationship with aging.
inclusion of aging genes set showed  <dig> neurological and  <dig> psychiatric diseases have the strong association with aging.
this study improves the understanding of the complex interactions that occur between neurological and psychiatric diseases with aging, which lead to determine the diagnostic markers.
also, the disease-disease association results could be helpful to determine the symptom relationships between neurological and psychiatric diseases.
further, the overall quality of the results was achieved by a series of statistical methods, to avoid insignificant data in biological networks.
