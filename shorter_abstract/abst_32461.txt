interestingly, this enzyme is 6-fold hyperactivated by incubation at high temperatures  under limiting concentrations of flavin cofactor, a change that remains stable even at low temperatures .
the high stability along with its capability to be reactivated makes this biocatalyst highly re-useable for cofactor recycling in redox biotransformations.
the hyperactivated form presented a high specific activity  at low temperatures despite isolation from a thermophile source.
one promising approach to regenerate nad+ pools is the use of nadh-oxidases that reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide while oxidizing nadh to nad+.
for this reason one of the current challenges in biocatalysis is to develop and optimize more simple and efficient cofactor recycling systems.
this immobilized catalyst is presented as a recycling partner for a thermophile alcohol dehydrogenase in order to perform the kinetic resolution secondary alcohols.
we have designed, developed and characterized a heterogeneous and robust biocatalyst which has been used as recycling partner in the kinetic resolution of rac-1-phenylethanol.
immobilization of nox onto agarose activated with glyoxyl groups yielded the most stable enzyme preparation .
