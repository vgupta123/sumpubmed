a family of kinases that preferentially occur in pathogenic species of the fungal clade leotiomyceta is unusually expanded in bgh and its close relative, blumeria graminis f.sp.
the predicted bgh proteome lacks a number of proteins that are otherwise conserved in filamentous fungi, including two proteins that are required for the formation of anastomoses .
we provide a comparative analysis of the conceptual bgh proteome, with an emphasis on proteins with known roles in fungal development and pathogenicity, for example heterotrimeric g proteins and g protein coupled receptors; components of calcium and camp signaling; small monomeric gtpases; mitogen-activated protein cascades and transcription factors.

compared to other ascomycetes, the barley powdery mildew pathogen blumeria graminis f.sp.
hordei  has a large genome  that harbors a relatively small number of protein-coding genes .
