the genetic contribution to human t2d and related metabolic disorders is evident, and mostly follows polygenic inheritance.
we also applied a genetical genomic approach using a subset of the f <dig> mice to seek candidate genes underlying the qtls.
sequencing analysis revealed polymorphisms of apoa <dig> in th mice, suggesting apoa <dig> as the candidate gene for the hyperlipidemia qtl.
further, genetical genomic analysis led to potential candidate genes for the qtls.
the parental, f <dig>  and f <dig> mice were phenotyped at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> weeks of age for 4-hour fasting plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin, and glucose levels and body, fat pad and carcass weights.
major qtls were detected on chromosomes   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for hypertriglyceridemia,  <dig> and  <dig> for hypercholesterolemia,  <dig> for hyperglycemia,  <dig> and  <dig> for body weight,  <dig> for fat pad weight, and  <dig> and  <dig> for carcass weight.
in order to determine the genetic factors that contribute to these t2d related characteristics in th mice, we interbred th mice with c57bl/6j  mice.
most alleles, except for chr  <dig> and  <dig> qtls, increased phenotypic values when contributed by the th strain.
the tallyho/jngj  mice are a polygenic model for t2d characterized by obesity, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose uptake and tolerance, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia.
gene expression analysis added novel information and aided in selection of candidates underlying the qtls.
type  <dig> diabetes  is the most common form of diabetes in humans and is closely associated with dyslipidemia and obesity that magnifies the mortality and morbidity related to t2d.
