since data characteristics of peptide microarrays differ from dna oligonucleotide microarrays, computational methods need to be tailored to these specifications to allow a robust and automated data analysis.
providing sensitivity is thus a primary goal of data analysis procedures.
peptide microarrays offer an enormous potential as a screening tool for peptidomics experiments and have recently seen an increased field of application ranging from immunological studies to systems biology.
we evaluated rapmad in antibody reactivity experiments for several thousand peptide spots and compared it to two existing algorithms for the analysis of peptide microarrays.
while follow-up experiments can ensure the specificity of results, sensitivity cannot be recovered in later steps.
particularly, it shows substantially improved sensitivity for low intensity settings without sacrificing specificity.
