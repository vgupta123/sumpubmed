bacterial dna is well-known for its potent immunostimulatory properties which have been attributed to the abundance of cpg dinucleotides within the genomes of prokaryotes.
research has found that mammalian tlr <dig> is a receptor which mediates the immune response to cpg dna; however, its functional properties in non-mammalian vertebrates are still poorly characterized.
leukocytes isolated from lower vertebrates, including teleosts, respond to cpg dna and tlr <dig> has been identified in many fish species; however, the ligand-binding properties of fish tlr <dig> have, so far, not been studied.
in the current study, tlr <dig> from atlantic salmon  has been found to interact with synthetic oligonucleotides via a cpg-independent but a ph-dependent mechanism.
the current study also identifies additional molecules which may function as mediators of the immunostimulatory properties of foreign dna.
in addition, through co-precipitation and mass spectrometry, two salmon proteins - hnrnpa <dig> and ncoa <dig>  which both contain rna-binding domains , were found to bind cpg odns, suggesting they may be involved in the cpg response in salmon leukocytes.
when overexpressed in salmonid cell lines, sstlr <dig> spontaneously activates isre-containing promoters of genes involved in the ifn response; however, the transgenic receptor fails to translocate to cpg-containing endosomes.
