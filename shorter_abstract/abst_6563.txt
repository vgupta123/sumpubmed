through comprehensive transcriptome analysis, we not only identified  <dig> novel gene families potentially involved in the biosynthesis of cardiac glycosides but also characterized a large number of mlncrnas.
the majority of d. purpurea mlncrnas were species-specific and many of them showed tissue-specific expression and responded to cold and dehydration stresses.
our results suggest the importance of mlncrnas in secondary metabolism and stress response in d. purpurea.
a positive correlation was found in gene expression between protein-coding genes and the homologous mlncrnas in response to cold and dehydration stresses, while the correlation was negative when protein-coding genes and mlncrnas were complementary to each other.
we identified  <dig> mrna-like npcrna  candidates, an emerging class of regulators, using a computational mlncrna identification pipeline and  <dig> microrna-producing unigenes based on sequence conservation and hairpin structure-forming capability.
it includes five genes involved in secondary metabolism.
it could be grouped into  <dig> families, of which  <dig> were identified for the first time in d. purpurea.
we determined  <dig> unigenes to be candidates involved in cardiac glycoside biosynthesis.
among the mlncrna candidates, only  <dig> could be grouped into  <dig> families with at least two members in a family.
through high-throughput  <dig> sequencing and subsequent assembly, we obtained  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> encode conserved proteins.
