the analyses of the mutant transcriptomes revealed that colour change during peel ripening was strongly associated with a major mobilization of mineral elements and with other previously known metabolic and photosynthetic changes.
a defective synthesis of the apocarotenoid β-citraurin has been proposed to cause the yellowish colour of fully ripe 39e <dig> flavedo.
flavedo from 39b <dig> fruits showed an overall delay in carotenoid accumulation and chlorophyll degradation, while the flavedo of 39e <dig> was devoid of the apocarotenoid β-citraurin among other carotenoid alterations.
the results highlighted  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were respectively up- and down-regulated in both mutants.
