prior to cluster analysis or genetic network analysis it is customary to filter, or remove genes considered to be irrelevant from the set of genes to be analyzed.
filtering methods intended specifically for cluster and network analysis are introduced and compared by simulating modular networks with known statistical properties.
we show that cluster analysis and principal components are strongly affected by filtering.
to study more realistic situations, we analyze simulated "real" data based on well-characterized e. coli and s. cerevisiae regulatory networks.
the methods introduced apply very generally, to any similarity matrix describing gene expression.
this paper introduces modular models for representing network structure in order to study the relative effects of different filtering methods.
