the recent draft mac genome assembly revealed low sequence repetitiveness, a result of the epigenetic removal of invasive dna elements found only in the mic genome.
such low repetitiveness makes complete closure of the mac genome a feasible goal, which to achieve would require standard closure methods as well as removal of minor mic contamination of the mac genome assembly.
we also employed standard genome closure methods to essentially finish over 60% of the mac genome.
our experience to date suggests that complete closure of the mac genome is attainable.
we report here significant progress in genome closure and reannotation of tetrahymena thermophila.
we addressed the problem of mic contamination using comparative genomic hybridization with purified mic and mac dna probes against a whole genome oligonucleotide microarray, allowing the identification of  <dig> genome scaffolds likely to contain mic-limited dna sequences.
using this est evidence, a combination of automated and manual reannotation efforts led to updates that affect 16% of the current protein-coding gene models.
using the new est evidence, automated and manual curation has resulted in substantial improvements to the over  <dig>  gene models, which will be valuable to researchers studying this model organism as well as for comparative genomics purposes.
tetrahymena thermophila, a widely studied model for cellular and molecular biology, is a binucleated single-celled organism with a germline micronucleus  and somatic macronucleus .
