transcriptional activity of several transposable elements is specially high in shoot apical meristem and sperm cells.
in maize, 85% of genome is composed by transposable elements of several families.
this allowed us to analyze the transcriptional activity of the maize transposable elements based on est databases.
we have investigated the transcriptional activity of  <dig> families of transposable elements in different maize organs based on the systematic search of more than two million expressed sequence tags.
at least  <dig> % maize ests show sequence similarity with transposable elements.
the finding that some families of transposable elements have a considerable transcriptional activity in some tissues suggests that, either transposition is more frequent than previously expected, or cells can control transposition at a post-transcriptional level.
the use of powerful high-throughput sequencing methodologies allowed us to elucidate the extent and character of repetitive element transcription in maize cells.
in general, transcriptional activity of the gypsy-like retrotransposons is higher compared to other classes.
