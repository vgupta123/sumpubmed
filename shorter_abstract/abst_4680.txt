by real-time pcr, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the highest expression level of stra8/stra <dig> was detected in  <dig> and  <dig> dah , the premeiotic stage of germ cells in xx and xy gonads, respectively.
ra  signal pathway has been proved to be required for germ cell meiotic initiation in mammals, aves and amphibians.
however, the role of ra and stra <dig> in germ cell meiotic initiation in teleosts is poorly characterized.
our results suggest that stra <dig> might be involved in germ cell meiotic initiation in s. meridionalis as it did in tetrapods.
tissue distribution analysis by rt-pcr showed that stra <dig> is specifically expressed in gonads.
phylogenetic analysis revealed its existence in some primitive teleosts, such as siluriformes and salmoniformes.
in this study, the full length cdna of stra <dig> was cloned from southern catfish , and its spatio-temporal expression profiles were analyzed.
stra <dig>  is an important factor in ra signal pathway.
