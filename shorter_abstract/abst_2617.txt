the degree of sugar insensitivity of different sis10/abi <dig> mutant seedlings shows a strong positive correlation with their level of aba insensitivity during seed germination.
mutations in the sis7/nced3/sto <dig> gene, which is primarily required for aba biosynthesis under drought conditions, confer a sugar-insensitive phenotype, indicating that a constitutive role in aba biosynthesis is not necessary to confer sugar insensitivity.
findings presented here clearly demonstrate that mutations in abi <dig> can confer a sugar-insensitive phenotype and help explain previous, mixed reports on this topic by showing that aba and sugar insensitivity exhibit a strong positive correlation in different abi <dig> mutants.
quantitative rt-pcr analyses indicate transcriptional upregulation of aba biosynthesis genes by high concentrations of glc in wild-type germinating seeds.
expression profiling revealed a potentially novel regulation of auxin metabolism and transport in an aba deficient mutant, sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig>
the levels of soluble sugars, such as glucose and sucrose, help regulate many plant metabolic, physiological and developmental processes.
gene expression profiling revealed that a significant number of genes that are expressed at lower levels in germinating sis7-1/nced3-4/sto1- <dig> seeds than in wild-type seeds are implicated in auxin biosynthesis or transport, suggesting cross-talk between aba and auxin response pathways.
genetic screens are helping identify some of the loci involved in plant sugar response and reveal extensive cross-talk between sugar and phytohormone response pathways.
plants carrying mutations in sis7/nced3/sto <dig> or sis10/abi <dig> are resistant to the inhibitory effects of high levels of exogenous glc and suc.
a forward genetic screen was performed to identify mutants with increased resistance to the inhibitory effects of high levels of exogenous sugars on early arabidopsis seedling development.
