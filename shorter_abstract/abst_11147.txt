a major drawback of this method is that it ignores information about the edges in the network being analyzed, i.e., it treats the network simply as a set of genes.

in this paper, we introduce a novel method for functional enrichment that explicitly takes network interactions into account.
we presented a novel approach to functional enrichment that takes into account the pairwise relationships among genes annotated by a particular function.
our results demonstrate the wide applicability of our methods.
additionally, all our input data and results are available at http://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/~murali/supplements/2011-incob-nbe/.
we estimate the statistical significance of the connectivity empirically by a permutation test.
a very common approach is to use gene function enrichment analysis for this task.
each of the three applications discovers highly relevant functions.
we used our methods to study biological data from three different organisms.
many methods have been developed to infer and reason about molecular interaction networks.
our approach naturally generalizes fisher’s exact test, a gene set-based technique.
it is often desirable to summarize the biological information in such networks.
we present three applications of our method: i) determine which functions are enriched in a given network, ii) given a network and an interesting sub-network of genes within that network, determine which functions are enriched in the sub-network, and iii) given two networks, determine the functions for which the connectivity improves when we merge the second network into the first.
