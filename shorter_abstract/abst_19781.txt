glass bead milling and french press lead to degraded mrnas even in the presence of rnase inhibitors.
we suggest a novel protocol, grinding deep-frozen cells, for the preparation of protein extracts that contain intact rnas, as lysis method for the purification of mrna-protein complexes from yeast cells.
thus, they are not suitable to purify intact mrnp complexes or to identify specific mrnas bound to proteins.
we report dramatic differences in rna stability depending on the method used for yeast cell lysis.
we compared the effect of different lysis protocols on rna integrity.
in yeast, several protocols for the identification of protein-protein interactions in high-throughput analyses have been developed during the last years leading to an increased understanding of cellular proteomics.
