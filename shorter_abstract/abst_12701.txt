the integration of the results revealed that the  <dig> bp-pcr product has one open reading frame  of  <dig> bp long, including both start codon  and stop codon .
our results highlight an important immune role of the defensin gene in spodoptera littoralis by cooperating with other amps to control bacterial infection.
based on sequence analyses of the data, specific primers for full length and mature peptide of defensin were designed and successfully amplified  <dig> and  <dig> bp amplicons.
all insect defensins belonging to the invertebrate class have a consensus motif, c-x5-16-c-x3-c-x9-10-c-x4-7-cx1-c. only seven amps have already been found in different lepidopteran species.
the deduced peptide consists of a 23-residues signal peptide, a 27-residues propeptide and a 50-residues mature peptide with the conserved six-cysteine motif of insect defensins.
an anionic defensin, termed splidef, was isolated from the haemolymph of the cotton leafworm, s. littoralis, after bacterial challenge using differential display technique.
no report was published on the isolation of defensin from the egyptian cotton leafworm, spodoptera littoralis.
defensins are a well known family of cationic antibacterial peptides  isolated from fungi, plants, insects, mussels, birds, and various mammals.
