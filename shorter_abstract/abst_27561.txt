peripheral blood biomarkers might improve diagnostic accuracy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis .
by using bayesian probit regression to develop a model, we show that it is entirely possible to make a diagnosis of ipf from the peripheral blood with gene signatures.
using the optimal threshold  accurate class predictions were made for 77% of the test cases with sensitivity =  <dig> , specificity =  <dig> .
bayesian probit regression was used on the training set to develop a gene expression model for ipf versus normal.
a gene signature model was developed from the training set.

samples were stratified according to severity of disease based on pulmonary function.
gene expression profiles were obtained from  <dig> patients with ipf and  <dig> normal controls.
the gene expression model was tested by using it on the validation set to perform class prediction.
