attributable to their size, bio-aerosols may be suspended in the air for long periods placing patients at risk of infection and possibly settling on surfaces resulting in food contamination.
furthermore, fungal genera identified  in this study are also known to cause food spoilage and fungal infections in patients.
microbial counts were found to be higher in the fourth  sampling rounds when compared to the first , second  and third  sampling rounds.
results from this study indicate the importance of air quality monitoring in health-care settings to prevent possible hospital-acquired infections and contamination of hospital surfaces including food contact surfaces by airborne contaminants.
air samples were collected using the settle plates and an sas super  <dig> air sampler by impaction on agar.
these microbial samples were quantified and identified using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry  and analytic profile index .
the role of bio-aerosols in the spread of disease and spoilage of food has been described in numerous studies; nevertheless this information at south african hospitals is limited.
