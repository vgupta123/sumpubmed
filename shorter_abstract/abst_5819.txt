phylogenetic analyses position a subset of charophyte algae as the sister group to land plants, and distinguish two land plant groups that diverged around  <dig> million years ago – the bryophytes and the vascular plants.
methods and resources have been developed to enable a. agrestis to be used as a model species for developmental, molecular, genomic, and genetic studies.
relationships between liverworts, mosses hornworts and vascular plants have proven difficult to resolve, and as such it is not clear which bryophyte lineage is the sister group to all other land plants and which is the sister to vascular plants.
such comparisons can be made between mosses and liverworts because representative model organisms are well established in these two bryophyte lineages.
plants colonized terrestrial environments approximately  <dig> million years ago and have contributed significantly to the diversification of life on earth.

axenic culture conditions for maintenance and vegetative propagation have been determined, and treatments for the induction of sexual reproduction and sporophyte development have been established.
this advance provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the biology of hornworts.
