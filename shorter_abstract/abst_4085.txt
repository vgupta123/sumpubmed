both gal4Î” and gal4vp <dig> driven by the endogenous heat shock inducible promoter of the tribolium hsp <dig> gene are efficient in activating reporter gene expression under the control of the upstream activating sequence .
the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum has developed into an insect model system second only to drosophila.
here we report the establishment of the gal4/uas binary expression system in tribolium castaneum.
the response is quick in relation to the duration of embryonic development in tribolium -  <dig> hours with segmentation being completed after  <dig> hours - which makes the study of early embryonic processes possible using this system.
by comparing the efficiency of constructs based on tribolium, drosophila, and artificial core promoters, respectively, we find that the use of endogenous core promoters is essential for high-level expression of transgenic constructs.
our results support the contention that high-level transgene expression usually requires endogenous regulatory sequences, including endogenous core promoters in tribolium and probably also other model systems.
uas driven ubiquitous tgfp fluorescence was observed in embryos within four hours after activation while in-situ hybridization against tgfp revealed expression already after two hours.
