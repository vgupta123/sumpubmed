joint consideration of ancestry together with interclass heterozygosity  captures all of the information in the discrete classification without the unrealistic assumption that only two generations of admixture have transpired.
i present two worked examples illustrating the value of the approach for describing variation among hybrid populations and evaluating the validity of the assumption underlying discrete classification.
my analysis underscores previous work showing that many  ancestry informative markers are needed to avoid erroneous classification.
naively classifying natural hybrids into the standard six line cross categories can be misleading, and false classification can be a serious problem for datasets with few molecular markers.
estimating and visualizing the joint distribution of ancestry and interclass heterozygosity is an effective way to compare the genetic structure of hybrid populations and these estimates can be used in classic quantitative genetic methods for assessing additive, dominant, and epistatic genetic effects on hybrid phenotypes and fitness.
hybrid genomes are often summarized either by an estimate of the proportion of alleles coming from each ancestral population or classification into discrete categories like f <dig>  f <dig>  backcross, or merely “hybrid” vs. “pure”.
i describe a maximum likelihood method for joint estimation of ancestry and interclass heterozygosity.
