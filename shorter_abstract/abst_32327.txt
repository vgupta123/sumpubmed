bgfit allows users to easily manage their data and models in an integrated way, even if they are not familiar with databases or existing computational tools for parameter estimation.
bgfit provides a web-based unified platform, where a rich set of dynamic models can be fitted to experimental time-series data, further allowing to efficiently manage the results in a structured and hierarchical way.
due to the increase of experimental time-series from microbiology and oncology, the need for a software that allows researchers to easily organize experimental data and simultaneously extract relevant parameters in an efficient way is crucial.
several dynamic and algebraic models are already implemented, such as polynomial regression, gompertz, baranyi, logistic and live cell fraction models and the user can add easily new models thus expanding current ones.
the application is described in the context of bacterial and tumor cells growth data fitting, but it is also applicable to any type of two-dimensional data, e.g.
physical chemistry and macroeconomic time series, being fully scalable to high number of projects, data and model complexity.
