automated segmentation and tracking of over  <dig> million cell images during this period revealed that cells display substantial heterogeneity in their responses to the applied treatment, including a large proportion of transfected cells that do not respond at all.
we tested this platform with synthetic drug-inducible promoters that showed robust induction over  <dig> hours.
the results from our single-cell analysis suggest that methods that measure average cellular responses, such as dna microarrays, rt-pcr and chromatin immunoprecipitation, characterize a response skewed by a subset of cells in the population.
however, endpoint measurements obtained from methods that pool populations of cells are not amenable to studying time-dependent processes that show cell heterogeneity.
here we describe a high-throughput platform for measuring transcriptional changes in real time in single mammalian cells.
by using reverse transfection microarrays we are able to transfect fluorescent reporter plasmids into  <dig> independent clusters of cells plated on a single microscope slide and image these clusters every  <dig> minutes.
