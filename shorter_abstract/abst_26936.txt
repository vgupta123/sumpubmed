we hypothesize that differences in krtap gene repertoire and gene expression, together with distinct rates of gene conversion/recombination, pseudogenization and positive selection, are likely responsible for micro and macro-phenotypic hair diversification among mammals in response to adaptations to ecological pressures.
within the two major classes of krtaps, the high cysteine  subfamily experienced strong concerted evolution, high rates of gene conversion/recombination and high gc content.
in contrast, high glycine-tyrosine  krtaps showed evidence of positive selection and low rates of gene conversion/recombination.
gene expression variation probably also influences hair diversification patterns, for example human have an identical krtap repertoire as apes, but much less hair.
adaptation of mammals to terrestrial life was facilitated by the unique vertebrate trait of body hair, which occurs in a range of morphological patterns.
the sloth, with long and coarse hair, had the most krtap genes .
we exhaustively characterized the krtap gene family in  <dig> mammalian genomes, confirming the existence of  <dig> krtap subfamilies evolving at different rates with varying degrees of diversification and homogenization.
