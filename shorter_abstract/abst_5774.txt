honey bee transcripts identified in this study are involved in critical functions related to transcriptional regulation, apoptotic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, nutritional regulation, and rna processing.
we present here the experimental identification of honey bee genes that are differentially expressed in response to infection of honey bee larvae with the chalkbrood fungus, ascosphaera apis.
we used cdna-aflp ®technology to profile transcripts in infected and uninfected bee larvae.
one of the most interesting differentially-regulated transcripts is for a chitinase-like enzyme that may be linked to anti-fungal activities in the honey bee larvae, similarly to gut and fat-body specific chitinases found in mosquitoes and the red flour beetle.
using a combination of cdna-aflp and qrt-pcr analyses, we were able to determine several key transcriptional events that constitute the overall effort in the honey bee larvae to fight natural fungal infection.
significantly, activation of immune responses in the infected bee larvae was associated with down-regulation of major storage proteins, leading to depletion of nutritional resources.
we have identified a number of differentially-regulated transcripts that are implicated in general mechanisms of stress adaptation, including energy metabolism and protein transport.
surprisingly, we did not find many components of the well-characterized nf-κb intracellular signaling pathways to be differentially-regulated using the cdna-aflp approach.
therefore, utilizing qrt-pcr, we probed some of the immune related genes to determine whether the lack of up-regulation of their transcripts in our analysis can be attributed to lack of immune activation or to limitations of the cdna-aflp approach.
among a large number of bee diseases, chalkbrood has been on the rise.
