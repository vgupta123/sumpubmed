the length of the helical structure and the impala method further supported the determination of the tmd limits.
modeling of transmembrane domains  requires correct prediction of interfacial residues for in-silico modeling and membrane insertion studies.
this implies the defining of a target sequence long enough to contain interfacial residues.
we succeeded in reducing the variation in the tmd limits to only  <dig> residues and in gaining structural information.
this method was applied to the il-2rβ and il-2rγ tmd sequences of homo sapiens, rattus norvegicus, mus musculus and bos taurus.
moreover, delimitation of these tmds can produce variable results with sequence based two-dimensional prediction methods, especially for sequences showing polymorphism.
to solve this problem, we developed a new modeling procedure using the peplook method.
however, too long sequences induce artifactual polymorphism: within tested modeling methods, the longer the target sequence, the more variable the secondary structure, as though the procedure were stopped before the end of the calculation .
we scanned the sequences by modeling peptides from the target sequence with a window of  <dig> residues.
