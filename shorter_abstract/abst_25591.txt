we propose a functional overlap of cyp96b <dig> in the execution of penetration resistance during basal and nonhost resistance of barley against different magnaporthe species.
taken together our results suggest a cross-talk between barley and magnaporthe isolates across the plant surface.
usage of a fungicidal treatment and a magnaporthe mutant confirmed that penetration was not necessary for this early activation of cyp96b <dig>  transcriptional silencing of cyp96b <dig> using barley stripe mosaic virus led to a decrease in penetration resistance of barley plants to magnaporthe host and nonhost isolates.
array experiments identified a barley gene encoding a putative cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase whose transcripts accumulate to a higher concentration in the nonhost as compared to the host interaction.
head blast caused by the fungal plant pathogen magnaporthe oryzae is an upcoming threat for wheat and barley cultivation.
as a potential source for novel resistance traits.
we investigated the nonhost response of barley to an isolate of the magnaporthe species complex which is pathogenic on pennisetum spp.
since members of the plant cyp <dig> family are known to be involved in synthesis of epicuticular waxes, these substances or their derivatives might act as signal components.
the gene clusters within the cyp <dig> clade of the p <dig> plant gene family and is designated as cyp96b <dig>  expression of cyp96b <dig> was triggered during the ectoparasitic growth of the pathogen on the outside of the leaf.
