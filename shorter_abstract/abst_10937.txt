we successfully developed a computational method for discovering new uses of existing drugs based on casual inference in a layered drug-target-pathway-gene- disease network.
moreover, our top scored prediction results are highly enriched in literature and clinical trials.
unlike the traditional 'one drug-one target-one disease' causal model, we simultaneously consider all possible causal chains connecting drugs to diseases via target- and gene-involved pathways based on rich information in several expert-curated knowledge-bases.
the results showed that our proposed method enables hypothesis generation from public accessible biological data for drug repositioning.

with statistical learning, our method estimates transition likelihood of each causal chain in the network based on known drug-disease treatment associations .
