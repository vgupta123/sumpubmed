these genes might serve as a basis for research into coral-specific adaptations to stress responses and global climate change.
embryos responded differently depending on exposure time and temperature level.
coral reefs are expected to be severely impacted by rising seawater temperatures associated with climate change.
metabolic processes were downregulated, and the action of histones and zinc finger-containing proteins may have played a role in the long-term regulation upon heat stress.
this study used cdna microarrays to investigate transcriptional effects of thermal stress in embryos of the coral montastraea faveolata.
analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that increased temperatures may lead to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and a structural reconfiguration of the cytoskeletal network.
differences in gene expression were measured after  <dig> and  <dig> hours.
