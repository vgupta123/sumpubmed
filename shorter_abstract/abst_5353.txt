we also used dsrna feeding as a method to induce rna interference in larval chemosensory tissues.
further, we demonstrate that systemic rna interference can be used in larval olfactory neurons to reduce expression of chemosensory receptor transcripts.
here, we sequenced transcriptomes from adult and larval chemosensory tissues and identified chemosensory genes based on sequence homology.
the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta, has long been an important model for insect chemosensation, particularly from ecological, behavioral, and physiological standpoints.
together, our results further the development of m. sexta as a model for functional analysis of insect chemosensation.
the ability to connect molecular genetic mechanisms, including potential lineage-specific changes in chemosensory genes, to ecologically relevant behaviors and specializations in m. sexta would be greatly beneficial.
we report identification of new chemosensory receptor genes including  <dig> novel odorant receptors and one novel gustatory receptor.
it is also a major agricultural pest on solanaceous crops.
