a transcriptome analysis of the summer-flowering cultivar ‘yuuka’ has been described, along with a global analysis of floral transition under various daylengths.
the large number of differentially transcribed genes identified confirmed the complexity of the regulatory machinery underlying floral transition.
here, the genome-wide transcriptome of ‘yuuka’ was acquired using rna-seq technology, with a view to shedding light on the molecular basis of the shift to reproductive growth as induced by variation in the photoperiod.
the differential transcription of eight of the differentially transcribed genes was successfully validated using quantitative real time pcr.
little is known about molecular basis of flowering time in the summer-flowering chrysanthemum.
a number of transcription factors and genes involved in flowering pathways were found to be differentially transcribed.
