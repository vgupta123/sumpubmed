widespread in the environment, staphylococcus spp.
furthermore, predominant se genes of nine enterotoxin genes sea through sej along with antimicrobial resistance and genetic variations were determined.
eleven mrsa isolates were identified and belonged to sccmec type iii  as the major type and sccmec type ii .
the most prevalent species was s. lentus, followed by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. xylosus.
in compared to the isolates from  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> s. aureus isolates from  <dig> were found to be more resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, oxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, and tetracycline.
a total of  <dig> samples were collected from six goat parts and three environmental sources among four dairy goat farms in southern taiwan.
these mrsa isolates revealed pulse-field gel electrophoresis  pattern a , c , and d  of human isolates.
enterotoxin genes were not identified in any cns isolates, however sec and see were identified only in s. aureus associated with mastitis in goat.
in total,  <dig> staphylococcal strains were identified and found predominantly in milk, and in the vagina, anus, and nasal cavity.
by extending our recent report of multi-drug resistant  s. aureus in dairy goats, this study investigated the staphylococcal infection and characterized the mdr-s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates collected from goats in  <dig> to elucidate the appearance of mrsa in goats and the mastitis associated staphylococcus enterotoxin  types.
genetic analyses indicated that genetic divergence, possible zoonotic transfer of mrsa, and the involvement of sec as important virulence factors for of s. aureus that lead to mastitis in goats.
