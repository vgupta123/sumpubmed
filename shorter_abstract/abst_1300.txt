recently it was discovered that a frataxin homologue is a structural component of the respiratory nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase  in thermus thermophilus.
it is not a structural component but may transiently interact with the complex.
frataxin is discussed as involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters.
we report that complex i is completely assembled to a stable and active enzyme complex equipped with all known iron-sulfur clusters in a cyay mutant of e. coli.
cyay plays a non-essential role in the assembly of complex i in e. coli.
it was not clear whether frataxin is in general a component of complex i from bacteria.
however, the amount of complex i is reduced by one third compared to the parental strain.
western blot analysis and live cell imaging of cyay engineered with a gfp demonstrated that cyay is located in the cytoplasm and not attached to the membrane as to be expected if it were a component of complex i.
