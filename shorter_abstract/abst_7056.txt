fruit weight was strongly selected in slc in the andean region of ecuador and northern peru prior to the domestication of tomato in mesoamerica.
the distribution of fruit weight and shape alleles supports that domestication of slc occurred in the andean region.
cerasiforme , and s. pimpinellifolium  that were genotyped using  <dig>  snps.
we described and analyzed the genetic diversity of  <dig>  tomato accessions including solanum lycopersicum var.
we detect ecuadorian and peruvian accessions that may represent a pool of unexplored variation that could be of interest for crop improvement.
our results revealed a pattern of variation that strongly supported a two-step domestication process, occasional hybridization in the wild, and differentiation through human selection.
our results also clarified the biological status of slc.
our results also clarify the biological status of slc as true phylogenetic group within tomato.
these interpretations were consistent with the observed allele frequencies for the six loci affecting fruit weight and shape.
additionally, we explored the allelic frequency of six loci affecting fruit weight and shape to infer patterns of selection.
quantifying this variation provides insights into the domestication process, facilitates the management of resources used by breeders and germplasm centers, and enables the design of experiments to associate traits with genes.
alleles affecting fruit shape were differentially selected among sll genetic subgroups.
tomato domestication seems to have followed a two step-process; a first domestication in south america and a second step in mesoamerica.
domestication modifies the genomic variation of species.
this study presents a broad and detailed representation of the genomic variation in tomato.
