it could also serve as a valuable resource for relevant research on cold-tolerance and help to explore the cold-related genes in improving the understanding of low-temperature tolerance and plant-environment interactions.
dge and quantitative rt-pcr analysis further confirmed the results from rna-seq analysis.
these include a group of cold sensor or signal transduction genes, cold-responsive transcription factor genes, plasma membrane stabilization related genes, osmosensing-responsive genes, and detoxification enzyme genes.
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation, we employed rna-seq and digital gene expression  technologies to the study of genome-wide expression profiles during cold acclimation in tea plants.
our study presents a global survey of transcriptome profiles of tea plants in response to low, non-freezing temperatures and yields insights into the molecular mechanisms of tea plants during the cold acclimation process.
the tea plant  o. kuntze) needs to undergo a cold acclimation process to enhance its freezing tolerance in winter.

pathway analysis indicated that the “carbohydrate metabolism pathway” and the “calcium signaling pathway” might play a vital role in tea plants’ responses to cold stress.
changes that occur at the molecular level in response to low temperatures are poorly understood in tea plants.
tea is the most popular non-alcoholic health beverage in the world.
