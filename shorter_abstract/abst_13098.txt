while the changes in plant traits did not affect the overall performance of the root-knot nematodes  in terms of total number of galls, we found that the consequences of aboveground herbivory for the plants can be altered by the subsequent nematode herbivory.
here, we tested whether the effects of transient aboveground herbivory for seven days by herbivores of different feeding guilds on tomato plants  alters their interaction with spatially as well as temporally separated belowground herbivores.
the transient aboveground herbivory by both chewing caterpillars  and sucking aphids  had significant impacts on plant traits such as plant growth, resource allocation and phytohormone contents.
the results suggest that the earlier aboveground herbivory can modify plant responses to subsequent herbivores, and such modifications may depend upon identity and/or feeding modes of the aboveground herbivores.
for example, plants that had hosted aphids showed compensatory growth when they were later challenged by nematodes, which was not apparent in plants that had hosted only aphids.
in contrast, plants that had been fed by s. exigua larvae did not show such compensatory growth even when challenged by nematodes.
herbivore-induced changes in plant traits can cause indirect interactions between spatially and/or temporally separated herbivores that share the same host plant.
