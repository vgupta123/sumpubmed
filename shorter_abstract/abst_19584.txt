while cellulose and lignin levels in the cell walls were not significantly altered, the syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio was significantly reduced.
metabolomic analyses showed that manipulation of pdugpase <dig> results in perturbations in primary, as well as secondary metabolism, resulting in reduced sugar and starch levels and increased phenolics, such as caffeoyl and feruloyl conjugates.

we characterized the functional role of a ugpase gene in populus deltoides, pdugpase <dig>  overexpression of the native gene resulted in increased leaf area and leaf-to-shoot biomass ratio but decreased shoot and root growth.
these results demonstrate that pdugpase <dig> plays a key role in the tightly coupled primary and secondary metabolic pathways and perturbation in its function results in pronounced effects on growth and metabolism beyond cell wall biosynthesis of populus.
the functional role of ugpase in perennial woody plants is poorly understood.
