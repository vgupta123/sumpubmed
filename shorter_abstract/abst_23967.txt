in the first case local infusion of basolateral complexes  with nmdar antagonist caused very great  drinking rhythms while moderately increased feeding  responses during arousal with respect to moderately increased drinking levels in euthermics.
these same antagonists accounted for altered glutamatergic transcription activities as displayed by greatly reduced glur <dig>  nr <dig> and glur <dig> levels in hippocampus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus  and amygdala, respectively, plus a great  up-regulation of glur <dig> in vmn of hibernators.
for this study the two major glutamatergic antagonists and namely that of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor , 3--2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl-propyl-1-phosphonate  plus that of the acid Î±-amine-3-hydroxy-5-metil-4-isoxazol-propionic receptor  site, cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline- <dig> -dione  were infused into the basolateral amygdala nucleus.
in the present study the role of amygdalar glutamatergic circuits on non-hibernating  and hibernating  hamsters were assessed on drinking stimuli and subsequently compared to expression variations of some glutamatergic subtype mrna levels in limbic areas.
excitatory transmitting mechanisms are proving to play a critical role on neuronal homeostasis conditions of facultative hibernators such as the syrian golden hamster.
from the behavioral results it appears that the two glutamatergic compounds exerted distinct effects.
we conclude that predominant drinking events evoked by glutamatergic mechanisms, in the presence of prevalently down regulated levels of nr1/2a of some telencephalic and hypothalamic areas appear to constitute an important neuronal switch at least during arousal stage of hibernation.
