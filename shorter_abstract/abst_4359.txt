we identified in silico the putative full complement of bhlh genes in the sequenced genomes of  <dig> different species representative of the main metazoan lineages, including three non-bilaterian metazoans, the cnidarians nematostella vectensis and hydra magnipapillata and the demosponge amphimedon queenslandica.
we suggest that these features may be extended to other developmental gene families and reflect a general trend in the evolution of the developmental gene repertoires of metazoans.
three main features in the history of the bhlh gene superfamily can be inferred from these analyses:  an initial diversification of the bhlhs has occurred in the pre-cambrian, prior to metazoan cladogenesis;  a second expansion of the bhlh superfamily occurred early in metazoan evolution before bilaterians and cnidarians diverged; and  the bhlh complement during the evolution of the bilaterians has been remarkably stable.
molecular and genetic analyses conducted in model organisms such as drosophila and vertebrates, have provided a wealth of information about how networks of transcription factors control the proper development of these species.
here we report the first evolutionary analysis of a whole superfamily of transcription factors, the basic helix-loop-helix  proteins, at the scale of the whole metazoan kingdom.
