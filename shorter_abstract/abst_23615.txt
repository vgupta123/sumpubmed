we also report that the destruction of the canonical b <dig> elements in two silencer ars  has no effect on their silencer and replicator activity.
autonomously replicating sequences  in s. cerevisiae serve as origins of dna replication or as components of cis-acting silencers, which impose positional repression at the mating type loci and at the telomeres.

in addition, the lack of b <dig> suggests that the acs-b <dig> module could be different in silencer and replicator ars.
