this integrated approach facilitates the rapid identification of mutations conferring selectable phenotypes, without prior knowledge of biological and molecular mechanisms.
here, we combine in vivo experimental evolution, a rapid genetic strategy and whole genome re-sequencing to identify the precise genetic basis of artemisinin resistance in a lineage of the rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium chabaudi.
for malaria, this model can identify candidate genes before resistant parasites are commonly observed in natural human malaria populations.
such genetic markers will further the investigation of resistance and its control in natural infections of the human malaria, p. falciparum.
classical and quantitative linkage analyses of genetic crosses have traditionally been used to map genes of interest, such as those conferring chloroquine or quinine resistance in malaria parasites.
by measuring the artemisinin responses of these clones, the appearance of an in vivo artemisinin resistance phenotype within the lineage was defined.
whole-genome deep coverage short-read re-sequencing  defined the point mutations, insertions, deletions and copy-number variations arising in the lineage.
eight point mutations arise within the mutant lineage, only one of which appears on chromosome  <dig>  this missense mutation arises contemporaneously with artemisinin resistance and maps to a gene encoding a de-ubiquitinating enzyme.
the underlying genetic locus was mapped to a region of chromosome  <dig> by linkage group selection in two different genetic crosses.
