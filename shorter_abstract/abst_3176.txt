micro-morphological analyses of the sciatic nerve from cisplatin-exposed mice showed damaged myelin sheaths and mitochondria.
co-administered rhepo inhibited myelin sheaths from structural injuries and resulted in an increased number of intact mitochondria.
we investigated in a mouse model by which mechanism recombinant erythropoietin  protects the peripheral nervous system from structural and functional damage caused by cisplatin treatment with special emphasis on dna damage burden.
the protective effect of recombinant erythropoietin is not mediated by reducing the burden of dna platination in the target cells, but it is likely to be due to a higher resistance of the target cells to the adverse effect of dna damage.
the clinical efficacy and desirable dose escalations of cisplatin are restricted by the accumulation of dna lesions in dorsal root ganglion  cells leading to sensory polyneuropathy .
the co-application of rhepo, however, did not alter the level of unrepaired cisplatin-dna lesions accumulating in drg target cells.
a cumulative dose of  <dig> mg cisplatin/kg resulted in clear electrophysiological signs of neuropathy, which were significantly attenuated by concomitant erythropoietin .
the increased frequency of intact mitochondria might also contribute to this protective role.
