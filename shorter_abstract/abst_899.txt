we also show that hif1α carrying long ubiquitin-chains can recruit alternative ubiquitin-receptors, lacking p97's atp-dependent segregase activity.
the proteins from the uba-ubx family interact with ubiquitylated proteins via their uba domain and with p <dig> via their ubx domain, thereby acting as substrate-binding adaptors for the p <dig> atpase.
we therefore set out to determine whether ubxn <dig> interaction with cullins was direct or mediated by its ubiquitylated targets bound to the uba domain.
we propose that by sequestering cul <dig> in its neddylated form, ubxn <dig> negatively regulates the ubiquitin-ligase activity of crl <dig> and this might prevent recruitment of ubiquitin-receptors other than p <dig> to nuclear hif1α.
in particular, human ubxn <dig>  mediates p <dig> interaction with the transcription factor hif1α that is actively ubiquitylated in normoxic cells by a cul2-based e <dig> ligase, crl <dig>  mass spectrometry analysis of uba-ubx protein immunoprecipitates showed that they interact with a multitude of e <dig> ubiquitin-ligases.
instead, it relies on the uim motif in ubxn <dig> that directly engages the nedd <dig> modification on cullins.
both of these effects are strictly uim-dependent and occur only when ubxn <dig> contains an intact uim motif.
