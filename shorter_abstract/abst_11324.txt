as a robust approach, we used a combination normalisation factor , calculated using the genorm application, based on the geometric mean of three selected reference genes: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and actin.
we evaluated  <dig> candidate reference genes for qpcr in daphnia magna following a  <dig> h exposure to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug  ibuprofen  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mg ib l- <dig>  six of the  <dig> candidates appeared suitable for use as reference genes.
microarray technology in particular offers the potential to measure thousands of gene responses simultaneously.
the accurate measurement of target gene expression requires normalisation to an invariant internal control e.g., total rna or reference genes.
reference genes are preferable, as they control for variation inherent in the cdna synthesis and pcr.
however, reference gene expression can vary between tissues and experimental conditions, which makes it crucial to validate them prior to application.
