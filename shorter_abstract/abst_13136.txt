the hypothesis that influenza infection has procoagulant effects on humans has been investigated by experimental animal models.
however, these studies often made use of animal models only susceptible to adapted influenza viruses  or remained inconclusive.
this study showed hemostatic alterations both at the circulatory and at the tissue level upon infection with different influenza viruses in an animal model closely mimicking human influenza virus infection.
at tissue level, fibrin staining showed intracapillary fibrin deposition especially in hpai-h5n <dig> virus infected ferrets.
epidemiological studies relate influenza infection with vascular diseases like myocardial infarction.
