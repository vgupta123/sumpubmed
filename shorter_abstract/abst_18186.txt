we evaluate the method in several datasets against other widely used dye-bias correction methods.
results on data quality improvement showed that relic correction statistically significantly outperforms alternative dye-bias correction methods.
however, performance difference between dyes can result in biased estimates of methylation levels.
here we describe a novel method, called regression on logarithm of internal control probes  to correct for dye bias on whole array by utilizing the intensity values of paired internal control probes that monitor the two color channels.
both arrays use two fluorescent dyes  to measure methylation level at cpg sites.
relic is an efficient and robust method to correct for dye-bias in illumina methylation beadchip data.
it outperforms other alternative methods and conveniently implemented in r package enmix to facilitate dna methylation studies.
