we then applied our method to high-throughput genomic data from marburgvirus-infected non-human primates and inferred the time of infection and the intra-host evolutionary rate, and identified purifying selection in viral populations.
clonal expansion is a process in which a single organism reproduces asexually, giving rise to a diversifying population.
we introduce two measures of diversity to study the evolution of clonal populations using unphased genomic data, which eliminate the need to construct full-length genomes.
our method follows a maximum likelihood approach to estimate evolutionary rates and times to the most recent common ancestor, based on a relaxed molecular clock model; independent of a growth model.

standard phylogenetic tools rely on full-length genomes of individual pathogens or population consensus sequences .
this obstacle severely limits the application of phylogenetic methods and investigation of within-host dynamics of acute infections using this rich data source.
deviations from neutral evolution indicate the presence of selection and bottleneck events.
our method has the power to make use of minor variants present in less than 1% of the population and capture genomic diversification within days of infection, making it an ideal tool for the study of acute rna viral infection dynamics.
