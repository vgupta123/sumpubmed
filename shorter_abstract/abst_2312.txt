sleep upregulates a few select genes, like cirp and uba <dig>  whereas wake upregulates many genes related to metabolism, the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, including trio, synj <dig> and gem, which are involved in the elongation of peripheral astrocytic processes.
using serial block face scanning electron microscopy , we find that a few hours of wake are sufficient to bring astrocytic processes closer to the synaptic cleft, while chronic sleep restriction also extends the overall astrocytic coverage of the synapse, including at the axon–spine interface, and increases the available astrocytic surface in the neuropil.
all these functions are likely to be modulated by the sleep/wake cycle, because brain metabolism, neuronal activity and synaptic turnover change as a function of behavioral state.
the reduced astrocytic coverage during sleep, instead, may favor glutamate spillover, thus promoting neuronal synchronization during non-rapid eye movement sleep.
using translating ribosome affinity purification technology and microarrays, we find that  <dig>  % of all astrocytic transcripts in the forebrain are dependent on state .
astrocytes can mediate neurovascular coupling, modulate neuronal excitability, and promote synaptic maturation and remodeling.
wake-related changes likely reflect an increased need for glutamate clearance, and are consistent with an overall increase in synaptic strength when sleep is prevented.
here we show that sleep and wake strongly affect both astrocytic gene expression and ultrastructure in the mouse brain.
