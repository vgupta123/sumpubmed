all people aged  <dig> years or over whom received pet for non-occupation related potential ablv exposure in the hunter new england local health district of australia between july  <dig> and july  <dig> were considered eligible for the study.
despite ongoing public health messaging about the risks associated with bat contact, surveillance data have revealed a four-fold increase in the number of people receiving pet for bat exposure in nsw between  <dig> and  <dig>  our study aimed to better understand these human – bat interactions in order to identify additional risk communication messages that could lower the risk of potential ablv exposure.
eligible participants were invited to a telephone interview to explore the circumstances of their bat contact.
participants reported a change in risk perception after the exposure event and provided suggestions for public health messages that could be used to raise awareness about ablv.
participants who attempted to ‘rescue’ bats did so because of a deep concern for the bat’s welfare.
participants reported bats as being widespread in their environment but reported a general lack of awareness about ablv, particularly the risk of disease from bat scratches.
the potential risk of ablv from bat scratches merits greater emphasis.
the potential risk to the person and possible harm to the bat from an attempted ‘rescue’ should be promoted, along with contact details for animal rescue groups.
of  <dig> eligible participants that were able to be contacted,  <dig> consented and participated in a telephone interview.
interviews were then transcribed and thematically analysed by two independent investigators.
