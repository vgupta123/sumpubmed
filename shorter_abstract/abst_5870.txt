these data provide insight into the kinetics of the immunosuppressive state associated with tumor growth in a murine model of human gliomas.
immunosuppression by gliomas contributes to tumor progression and treatment resistance.
we have performed a kinetic study of this immunomodulation, assessing the dynamics of immune infiltration and function, within the central nervous system  and peripherally.
it is not known when immunosuppression occurs during tumor development but it likely involves cross-talk among tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophages and microglia , and peripheral as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes .
an increase in til frequency was also observed at these final time points.
peripheral changes associated with tumor development were noted prior to effects within the cns.
at the final time points examined , there was an increase in the frequency of tams with decreased capacity to secrete tnf-Î±.
functional impairment of tams occurs relatively late in the course of gbm tumor growth, potentially providing a window of opportunity for therapeutic strategies directed towards preventing their functional impairment.
