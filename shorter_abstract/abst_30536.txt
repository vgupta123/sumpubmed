peripheral blood cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were induced to either mk differentiation or, as a negative control without observable apoptosis, granulocytic differentiation.
we used a gene-ontology-driven microarray-based transcriptional analysis coupled with protein-level and activity assays to identify genes and pathways involved in mk apoptosis.
this led to novel insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating apoptosis in mk cells.
up-regulation was noted among several pro-apoptotic genes not previously associated with mk apoptosis such as components of the p <dig> regulon and tnf signaling.
our comparative approach to analyzing dynamic large-scale transcriptional data, which was validated using a known set of mk genes, robustly identified candidate mk apoptosis genes.
understanding mk apoptosis could lead to advances in the treatment of mk and platelet disorders.
constitutive apoptosis is an integral, yet poorly understood, facet of megakaryocytic  differentiation.
down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes, including several of the bcl- <dig> family, was also detected.
