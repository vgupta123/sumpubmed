however, these approximation methods do not reflect properties of origin firing and may lead to inappropriate estimations.
the estimated firing efficiency is correlated well with the previous studies in fission and budding yeasts.
dna replication is a fundamental biological process during s phase of cell division.
the proposed model reflects current understandings about dna replication.
recent genome-wide study of dna replication approximated origin firing efficiency by indirectly measuring other quantities related to replication.
in this paper, we develop a probabilistic model - spanned firing time model  to characterize dna replication process.
the new probabilistic model enables sensitive identification of origins as well as genome-wide estimation of origin firing efficiency.
origins in an individual cell may initiate replication randomly within a time window, but the population average exhibits a temporal program with some origins replicated early and the others late.
