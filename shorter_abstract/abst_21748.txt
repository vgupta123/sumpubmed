detecting conserved noncoding sequences  across species highlights the functional elements.
alignment procedures combined with computational prediction of transcription factor binding sites  can narrow down key regulatory elements.
we constructed a web server 'realignerv' for complex alignment of genomic sequences.
therefore, an alignment approach that is robust to te insertions is meaningful for finding novel conserved tfbss in tes.
it also provides pair-wise alignments in which the predicted tfbs sites and their names are shown alongside each sequence.
