genome coverage was confirmed by pcr screening of the library with  <dig> unique genetic loci sampled from the genetic linkage map.
we report herein the construction of a bac library for quercus robur, its characterization and an analysis of bac end sequences.
in total, about  <dig>  high-quality bac end sequences  were generated by sequencing  <dig>  clones.
collectively, characterized and novel repeats account for roughly  <dig> % of the genome.
bess were aligned with the genome sequences of arabidopsis thaliana, vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa.
one putative collinear microsyntenic region encoding an alcohol acyl transferase protein was observed between oak and chromosome  <dig> of v. vinifera.
further analysis of the bess revealed  <dig>  putative genes suggesting at least  <dig>  genes in the oak genome.
bes analysis provided insight into the structure of the oak genome.
this bac library provides a new resource for genomic studies, including ssr marker development, physical mapping, comparative genomics and genome sequencing.
