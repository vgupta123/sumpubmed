species of the family vibrionaceae are ubiquitous in marine environments.
the core proteome consists of  <dig>  orthologous groups, which is 28% of the  <dig>  orthologous groups in this family.
there were  <dig>  accessory orthologous groups  and  <dig>  unique proteins .
we deduced the complete set of orthologs for eleven strains from this family.
proteins that have been associated with virulence in v. cholerae were widely distributed across the eleven genomes, but the majority was found only on the genomes of the two v. cholerae strains examined.
evidence indicates that genetic exchange plays an important role in the emergence of new pathogenic strains within this family.
the composition of the proteomes supports the notion that genetic exchange among species of the vibrionaceae is widespread and that this exchange aids these species in adapting to their environments.
