the advantages of nlr are that the individual sample efficiency is simulated by the model and that absolute quantitation is possible without a standard curve, releasing reaction wells for unknown samples.
fluorescence data were analysed by the regular ct method with a standard curve, and by nlr with a positive control for conversion of fluorescence intensity to copy number, and for this purpose an automated algorithm was written in spss syntax.
the altman-bland analysis showed that the best regression model yielded quantitative data with an intra-assay variation of 58% vs. 24% for the ct derived copy numbers, and with a mean inter-method deviation of Ã—  <dig> .
eleven separate regression models were tested, and the output data was subjected to altman-bland analysis.
nlr can be automated for batch production analysis, but the ct method is more precise for absolute quantitation in the present setting.
nonlinear regression analysis  or curve fitting has therefore been suggested as an alternative to the cycle threshold method for absolute quantitation.
