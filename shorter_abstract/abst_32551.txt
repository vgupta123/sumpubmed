sequence comparisons of functionally related enhancers that activate overlapping expression patterns revealed that they share conserved elements that can be predictive of enhancer behavior.
phylogenetic footprinting analysis of a 125Â kb genomic region that spans the pdm locus identified  <dig> conserved sequence clusters.
these studies reveal a diversity of modular enhancers that most likely regulate pdm gene expression during embryonic and adult development, highlighting a high level of temporal and spatial expression specificity.
to determine which of these regions function as cis-regulatory enhancers that regulate the dynamics of pdm gene expression, we tested each for in vivo enhancer activity during embryonic development and postembryonic neurogenesis.
a subset of these enhancers share conserved elements including sequences that correspond to known tf dna binding sites.
to facilitate data accessibility, the results of our analysis are catalogued in cispatterns, an online database of the structure and function of these and other drosophila enhancers.
although comparative analysis of the nubbin and pdm- <dig> encoding sequences indicate that these two genes most likely arose from a duplication event, we found only partial evidence of sequence duplication between their enhancers, suggesting that after the putative duplication their cis-regulatory dna diverged at a higher rate than their coding sequences.
our screen revealed  <dig> unique enhancers positioned throughout the noncoding region of the pdm locus.
in addition, we discovered clusters of functionally related enhancers throughout the pdm locus.
