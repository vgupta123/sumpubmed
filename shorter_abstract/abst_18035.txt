ligand-based quantitative pharmacophore modeling methodology was used in identifying the important molecular chemical features present in the set of already known active compounds and the missing features from the set of inactive compounds.
a training set containing  <dig> compounds including active and inactive compounds with a substantial degree of diversity was used in developing the pharmacophore models.
molecular docking and density functional theory calculations were used to select the hit compounds with strong molecular interactions and favorable electronic features.
a quantitative pharmacophore model of predictive ability was developed with essential molecular features of a potent renin inhibitor.
molecular docking and density functional theory studies have confirmed that the identified hits possess the essential binding characteristics and electronic properties of potent inhibitors.
the best quantitative pharmacophore model selected was made of one hydrophobic, one hydrogen bond donor, and two hydrogen bond acceptor features with high a correlation value of  <dig> .
a test set containing  <dig> compounds, fischer randomization, and leave-one-out methods were used in the validation of the pharmacophore model.
database screening was performed using the best pharmacophore model as a 3d structural query.
using this pharmacophore model, two potential inhibitory leads were identified to be used in designing novel and future renin inhibitors as antihypertensive drugs.
upon validation using an external test set of  <dig> compounds, fischer randomization, and leave-one-out methods, this model was used in database screening to identify chemical compounds containing the identified pharmacophoric features.
