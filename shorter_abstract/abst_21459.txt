however, a simple k-correction, using the relative allele signal  of heterozygous individuals, performed only slightly worse and provided results for more snps.
using four replicates of the  <dig> k array and the k-correction using heterozygous ras values, we obtained results for  <dig>  snps.
the correlation between estimated and real allele frequency was  <dig>  and the average error was  <dig> , which was comparable to the results obtained with the  <dig> k array.
furthermore, we could show how the estimation accuracy depended on the snp type .
recent studies have shown that genechip human mapping  <dig> k and  <dig> k arrays are suitable for the estimation of the allele frequency in pooled dna.
we could confirm that the polynomial based probe specific correction  was the most accurate method for allele frequency estimation.
genotyping technologies for whole genome association studies are now available.
the combination of dna pooling and analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms  on high density microarrays is a promising tool for whole genome association studies.
