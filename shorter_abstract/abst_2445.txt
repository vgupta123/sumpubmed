hrpb may be involved in alterations to the structure of fima mrna that promote the stability of fima rna.
citri by investigating the roles of hrpb in biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces and host leaves, cell motility, host virulence of the citrus canker bacterium and growth in planta.
dead/deah families participate in many different aspects of rna metabolism, including rna synthesis, rna folding, rna-rna interactions, rna localization and rna degradation.
mutation of the hrpb gene  resulted in a significant reduction in biofilms on abiotic surfaces and host leaves.
∆hrpb showed reduced adhesion on biotic and abiotic surfaces and delayed development in disease symptoms when sprayed on susceptible citrus leaves.
based on the results of fima mrna structure predictions, the fima 5′ utr may contain three different loops.
we provide insights into the function of the hrpb gene in xanthomonas citri subsp.
the hrpb gene is highly conserved in the sequenced strains of xanthomonas.
quantitative reverse transcription-pcr assays indicated that deletion of hrpb reduced the expression of four type iv pili genes.
rna helicases are enzymes that catalyze the separation of double-stranded rna  using the free energy of atp binding and hydrolysis.
several important bacterial dead/deah-box rna helicases have been extensively studied.
in this study, we characterize the atp-dependent rna helicase encoded by the hrpb  gene using deletion and genetic complementation assays.
∆hrpb also exhibited increased cell dispersion on solid medium plates.
the transcriptional start site of fima  was determined using rapid amplification of 5′-cdna ends .
our data show that hrpb is involved in adherence of xanthomonas citri subsp.
