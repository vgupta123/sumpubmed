large-panicle rice varieties often fail to achieve their yield potential due to poor grain filling of late-flowering inferior spikelets .
these results collectively demonstrate that carbohydrate supply is the main cause of poor is grain filling.

a field experiment was performed with two spikelet removal treatments at anthesis in the large-panicle japonica rice line w <dig>  including removal of the top 1/ <dig> of spikelets  and removal of the top 2/ <dig> of spikelets , with no spikelet removal as a control .
the biological functions of the differentially expressed proteins  between superior and inferior spikelets as well as the response of is to the removal of superior spikelets  were investigated by using itraq at 10 days post anthesis.

in addition, improvements in energy metabolism  might be played a vital role in inducing the initiation of grain filling.
reduced endosperm cell division and decreased activities of key enzymes associated with sucrose-starch metabolism and nitrogen metabolism are mainly attributed to the poor sink strength of is.
the physiological and molecular mechanisms of poor is grain filling, and whether an increase in assimilate supply could regulate protein abundance and consequently improve is grain filling for japonica rice with large panicles is still partially understood.
the removal of ss contributed to transfer of assimilates to is and enhanced enzymatic activities of carbon metabolism  and nitrogen metabolism , promoting starch and protein synthesis in is.
the size, weight, setting rate, and grain filling rate of is were significantly increased after spikelet removing.
approximately half of these deps were involved in carbohydrate metabolism  and protein metabolism .
finally, an increased abundance of 14–3- <dig> protein in is could be involved in the inhibition of starch synthesis.
