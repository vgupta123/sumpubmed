in this study we have analyzed the genetic relatedness and the antifungal susceptibility of several candida albicans strains isolated from a patient who from suffered recurrent candiduria for a period of five years.
although hrm analysis method presented a lower discriminatory power compared to methods based on capillary electrophoresis, it provided a more cost-effective and suitable alternative for genotyping c. albicans in a clinical laboratory.
hrm analysis method developed was able to accurately establish strain relatedness and presented a discriminatory power of  <dig> .
strains were genotyped using microsatellite length polymorphism  with three microsatellite markers , and a new method based on high resolution melting  was developed to analyze the microsatellite region.
an inter-colony test using single concentration  of fluconazole revealed the coexistence of both fluconazole susceptible and resistant strains.
this method was compared with the conventional technique that uses capillary electrophoresis.
