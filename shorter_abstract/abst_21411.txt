to identify possible genetic determinants of ps <dig> virulence, we examined the transcriptomes of  <dig> plasmidic orfs corresponding to known and putative virulence genes, and  <dig> orfs of unknown function.
we also analyzed the transcriptome of a ps88-like plasmid recovered from a neonate with urinary tract infection.
the transcriptome obtained after ex vivo growth in serum and urine was very similar to those obtained in iron-depleted lb broth.
transcriptome analysis of the ps88-like plasmid recovered in vivo showed a similar pattern of induction but at much higher levels.
genes encoding iron acquisition systems were strongly upregulated.
the transcriptome of e. coli strain s <dig> grown in human serum and urine ex vivo were compared to that obtained during growth in luria bertani broth, with and without iron depletion.
we identify new ps <dig> genes potentially involved in the growth of e. coli meningitis strain s <dig> in human serum and urine.
four orfs were induced ex vivo, independently of the iron concentration.
other putative virulence genes such as iss, etsc, omptp and hlyf were not upregulated in any of the conditions studied.
