in simulated scenarios of population admixture, panels containing few aims also show important deficiencies to measure genome ancestry.
for three of the main continental groups  ancestry was first estimated using the whole hapmap snp database as a proxy for global genome ancestry; these estimates were subsequently compared to those obtained from pre-designed aim panels.
there is a growing interest among geneticists in developing panels of ancestry informative markers  aimed at measuring the biogeographical ancestry of individual genomes.
using snp data from hapmap we carried out a simulation-based study aimed at measuring the effect of snp coverage on the estimation of genome ancestry.
panels that consider > <dig> aims capture genome ancestry reasonably well, while those containing a few dozen aims show a large variability in ancestry estimates.
curiously, 500- <dig>  snps selected at random from the genome provide an unbiased estimate of genome ancestry and perform as well as any aim panel of similar size.
the results indicate that the ability to estimate genome ancestry is strongly dependent on the number of aims used, and not primarily on their individual informativeness.
