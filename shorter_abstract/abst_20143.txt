in present study, a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography  was optimized and validated to evaluate mcm activity in bovine liver.
in humans, a deficit in activity of mcm, due to an impairment of intracellular formation of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin results in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from moderate to fatal.
the improved method provides a way for studying the effects of stages of lactation, diet composition, and physiology in cattle on mcm activity over long periods of time, such as a complete lactation period.
in lactating dairy cows, propionate is the major substrate for glucose formation.
the major aim of the study was to describe the conditions to optimize reproducibility of the method and to determine stability of the enzyme and its product during storage and processing of samples.
specificity of the method was good, as there was no interfering peak from liver extract at the retention times corresponding to methylmalonyl-coa or succinyl-coa.
this metabolic pathway is highly solicited in ruminants because it is essential for the utilization of propionate formed during ruminal fermentation.
storage and processing conditions  did not alter the enzyme activity.
using 66 μg of protein, intra-assay coefficient of variation  of specific activities, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and the cv inter-day was  <dig> %.
the analyte was also stable in liver crude extract for three frozen/thawed cycles when stored at -20°c and thawed to room temperature.
methylmalonyl-coa mutase  is an adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme that catalyses the interconversion of -methylmalonyl-coa to succinyl-coa.
