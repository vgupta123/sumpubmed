in contrast, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice recover due to effective regeneration of affected muscle tissue.
to characterize the molecular processes associated with regeneration, we compared gene expression levels in hindlimb muscle tissue of mdx and control mice at  <dig> timepoints, ranging from 1â€“ <dig> weeks of age.
the following pathways are activated, as shown by upregulation of multiple members per signalling pathway: the notch-delta pathway that plays a role in the activation of satellite cells, and the bmp <dig> and neuregulin  <dig> signalling pathways that may regulate proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells.
we found that genes coding for components of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex are generally downregulated in the mdx mouse.
out of  <dig> genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed between mdx and control muscle at at least one timepoint .
based on the observed expression profiles, we describe a model for muscle regeneration in mdx mice, which may provide new leads for development of dmd therapies based on the improvement of muscle regeneration efficacy.
duchenne muscular dystrophy , caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, is lethal.
in dmd patients, only few of the identified regeneration-associated genes were found activated, indicating less efficient regeneration processes in humans.
