in view of the lack of data on stec isolated from food in spain, the objectives of this study were to determine the level of microbiological contamination and the prevalence of stec o157:h <dig> and non-o <dig> in a large sampling of minced beef collected from  <dig> local stores in lugo city between  <dig> and  <dig>  also to establish if those stec isolated from food possessed the same virulence profiles as stec strains causing human infections.
the results of this study do not differ greatly from those reported in other countries with regard to prevalence of o <dig> and non-o <dig> stec in minced beef.
typing of the eae variants detected four types: γ <dig> , β <dig> , ε <dig> , and θ .
this requires that control measures to be introduced and implemented to increase the safety of minced beef.
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  have emerged as pathogens that can cause food-borne infections and severe and potentially fatal illnesses in humans, such as haemorrhagic colitis  and haemolytic uraemic syndrome .
ten new serotypes not previously described in raw beef products were also detected.
stec were detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> minced beef samples tested.
in spain, like in many other countries, stec strains have been frequently isolated from ruminants, and represent a significant cause of sporadic cases of human infection.
stec o157:h <dig> was isolated from eight  samples and non-o <dig> stec from  <dig>  samples.
furthermore, phage typing of stec o157:h <dig> isolates showed that the majority  belonged to the main phage types previously detected in stec o157:h <dig> strains associated with severe human illnesses.
ninety-six stec isolates were further characterized by pcr and serotyping.
the majority  of stec isolates belonged to serotypes previously detected in human stec and 38% to serotypes associated with stec isolated from patients with hus.
the highly virulent seropathotypes o26:h <dig> stx <dig> eae-β <dig>  o157:h <dig> stx1stx <dig> eae-γ <dig> and o157:h <dig> stx2eae-γ <dig>  which are the most frequently observed among stec causing human infections in spain, were detected in  <dig> of the  <dig> stec isolates.
