recent studies in a growing number of organisms have yielded accumulating evidence that a significant portion of the non-coding region in the genome is transcribed.
we address this issue in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.
taking into account the absence of a significantly large yeast est database, we use microarray expression data collected for genomic regions erroneously believed to be coding to study the expression pattern of non-coding regions in the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.
in particular, looking at the probes that are located opposing other known genes at the same genomic locus, we find that  <dig> out of  <dig>  of these genes support antisense transcription.
we validate these results using rt-pcr on a sample of  <dig> non-coding transcripts.
the expression patterns of these antisense genes are positively correlated.
<dig>  correlated transcription of antisense genes is abundant in the yeast genome.
<dig>  antisense genes in yeast are non-coding.
<dig>  the yeast genome is transcribed on a scale larger than previously assumed.
we find that at least  <dig> out of  <dig>  such regions are expressed under specific biological conditions.
