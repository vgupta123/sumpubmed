lstryp <dig> protein is deposited in the oocytes and all embryonic cells.
the function of lstryp <dig> produced by the embryonic cells remains unknown.
trypsin-like serine proteases are involved in a large number of processes including digestive degradation, regulation of developmental processes, yolk degradation and yolk degradome activation.
the results furthermore indicate that lstryp <dig> protein of maternal origin has a distribution pattern different to that of embryonic origin.
an intronless trypsin-like serine peptidase  from l., salmonis was identified and characterized.
