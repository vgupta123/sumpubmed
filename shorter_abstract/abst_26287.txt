the composition and expression of vertebrate gene families is shaped by species specific gene loss in combination with a number of gene and genome duplication events  and depends on the ecological and evolutionary context.
phylogenetic comparison and microsynteny analyses of the slc <dig> genes indicate, that theria genomes evidently lost several slc <dig> genes still present in the other lineage.
in this study we analyzed the evolutionary history of the solute carrier  <dig>  gene family.
in a genomic survey where we manually annotated and analyzing sequences from more than  <dig> slc <dig> genes , we found evidence for an interesting evolutionary history of this gene family.
the genes lost in theria group into two new subfamilies of the slc <dig> gene family which we named slc1a8/eaat <dig> and slc1a9/eaat <dig>
the phylogeny of the slc1/eaat gene family demonstrates how multiple genome reorganization and duplication events can influence the number of active genes.
while some of the additional slc <dig> genes in ray-finned fishes originated from r <dig>  the increased number of slc <dig> genes in prototheria, sauropsida, and amphibia genomes originates from specific genes retained in these lineages.
