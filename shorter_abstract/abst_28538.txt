comparison of transcript profiles of these two populations, with verification by rt-pcr, reveals in nrbcs an expression signature indicative of hematopoietic stem cells  and progenitor cells of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, as well as a number of previously undescribed genes possibly involved in progenitor and stem cell maintenance.
using chicken as a model system, we have isolated an enriched pool of circulating non red blood cells  from e <dig> and e <dig> embryos; a transition period when definitive hematopoietic lineages are being specified in the peri-aortic region.
future studies on their heterogeneity and differentiation potentials may provide a useful alternative to es cells and perinatal blood.
