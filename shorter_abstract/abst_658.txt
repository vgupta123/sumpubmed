this study identified and characterized the molecular determinants that help in defining the phylum nematoda, and therefore improved our understanding of nematode protein evolution and provided novel insights for the development of next generation parasite control strategies.
features of these protein families were revealed through extrapolation of essential functions from observed rnai phenotypes in c. elegans, bioinformatics-based functional annotations, identification of distant homology based on protein folds, and prediction of expression at accessible nematode surfaces.
in addition, we identified a group of nematode-restricted sequence features in energy-generating electron transfer complexes as potential targets for new chemicals with minimal or no toxicity to the host.
nearly  <dig>  of the multi-species families did not share homology to pfam domains, including a total of  <dig> restricted to nematoda.
over  <dig>  nematode protein families were identified based on primary sequence, including ~10% with members from at least three different species.
