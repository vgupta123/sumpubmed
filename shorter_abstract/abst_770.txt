a ubiquitous transcription factor nf-y binds to and activates expression of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene and tissue-specific expression of the gene is associated with cpg methylation of the promoter.
however, the effect of pu-box binding protein on transcriptional activation is minimal as compared to nf-y, suggesting that nf-y is a more critical transcription factor for mouse scgb3a <dig> gene transcription.
despite that nf-y is a ubiquitous factor, scgb3a <dig> is highly expressed only in mouse lung and mtcc cells that are derived from sv <dig> transformed mouse clara cells, but not in ten other mouse tissues/cells examined.
by reporter gene transfection and gel mobility shift analyses, we demonstrated that expression of the mouse scgb3a <dig> gene is regulated by a pu-box binding protein and a ubiquitous transcription factor nf-y that respectively binds to the pu-boxes located at - <dig> to - <dig> bp and - <dig> to - <dig> bp, and the "ccaat" binding sites located at - <dig> to - <dig> bp and - <dig> to - <dig> bp from the transcription start site of the gene.
gene methylation analysis revealed that within  <dig> bp of the scgb3a <dig> gene promoter region, there are nine cpg methylation sites present, of which two cpgs closest to the transcription start site of the gene are unmethylated in the tissues/cells expressing scgb3a <dig>
