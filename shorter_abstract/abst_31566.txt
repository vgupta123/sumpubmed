improved detection of livestock colonised with s. typhimurium is necessary to prevent foodborne diseases.
five immunogenic proteins were validated using a panel of positive and negative sera for prospective applications in diagnostics of salmonela typhimurium.
currently, commercially available elisa assays are based on a mixture of o-antigens  or total cell lysate of salmonella and are hampered by cross-reaction.
solely in europoe, salmonella typhimurium causes more than  <dig>  infections per year.
a phage display library of the entire salmonella typhimurium genome was constructed and  <dig> immunogenic oligopeptides were identified using a pool of convalescent sera from pigs infected with salmonella typhimurium.
in this work, we identified novel immunogenic proteins of salmonella typhimurium and generated antibody fragments against these antigens completely based on phage display.
finally, human antibody fragments  against these five antigens were selected using antibody phage display and characterised.
the identification of novel immunogenic proteins would be useful to develop elisa based diagnostic assays with a higher specificity.
five of them were produced in e. coli.
