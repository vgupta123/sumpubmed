control genes, which are often referred to as housekeeping genes, are frequently used to normalise mrna levels between different samples.
however, the expression level of these genes may vary among tissues or cells and may change under certain circumstances.
for this, a simple Î”ct approach was employed by comparing relative expression of 'pairs of genes' within each sample.
the range of expression stability of the other  <dig> genes was : gapdh , sdha , hprt <dig> , hbs1l  and ahsp , followed by b2m .
thus, the selection of housekeeping genes is critical for gene expression studies.
