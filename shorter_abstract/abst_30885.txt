we use te-tracker to provide a comprehensive view of transposition events induced by loss of dna methylation in arabidopsis.

furthermore, te-tracker produces significantly fewer false positives than common sv detection programs, thus greatly facilitating the detection and analysis of te mobilization events.
with the dramatic reduction in cost of dna sequencing, it is now possible to resequence whole genomes in order to systematically characterize novel te mobilization in a particular individual.
however, this task is made difficult by the inherently repetitive nature of te sequences, which in some eukaryotes compose over half of the genome sequence.
we show that te-tracker accurately detects both the source and destination of novel transposition events in re-sequenced genomes.
currently, only a few software tools dedicated to the detection of te mobilization using next-generation-sequencing are described in the literature.
we present te-tracker, a general and accurate computational method for the de-novo detection of germ line te mobilization from re-sequenced genomes, as well as the identification of both their source and destination sequences.
te-tracker demonstrates the benefit of adopting an annotation-independent, de novo approach for the detection of te mobilization events.
moreover, te-tracker is able to detect all potential donor sequences for a given insertion, and can identify the correct one among them.
