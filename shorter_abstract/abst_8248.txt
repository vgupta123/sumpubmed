to investigate ttx-s na+ channels, whole-currents were measured under k+-free conditions and blocked by  <dig> nm ttx.
the modulation of voltage-dependent na+ channels by lipid metabolites such as arachidonic acid or eicosanoids plays a role in physiological functions as well as in degenerative diseases.
since activation of cyclooxygenase is also involved in pathways leading to apoptotic cells death this could play a role in degenerative diseases of the cns and highlights a possible protective effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition.
so far ttx-resistant channels were found mainly to be regulated by lipid metabolites.
analysis of lipid metabolites which accumulate by treatment with β-butx using maldi-tof ms showed an increase of cyclooxygenase reaction products in relation to arachidonic acid.
in contrast β-butx increased the maximal current amplitude and shifted the voltage-dependent activation towards more negative potentials.
application of indomethacin mainly changed the current kinetics but has only minor effects on voltage-dependence.
in summary, we conclude that ttx-sensitive na+ channels can be directly modulated by cyclooxygenase reaction products leading to higher activity at less depolarized potentials and subsequent higher excitability of neurons.
