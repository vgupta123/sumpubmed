here, high-speed imaging of free-swimming mouse sperm simultaneously reports flagellar waveform, orientation of sperm head, and swimming paths.
for non-rolling sperm, flagellar waveform asymmetry dictated circular path trajectories.
sparse rolling produced abrupt changes in swimming trajectories that occurred spontaneously, unaffected by blockade or engagement of camp- or ca2+-mediated flagellar responses.
frequency and asymmetry of the flagellar waveform of sperm are controlled by camp-mediated and ca2+-dependent signaling pathways, but additional mechanisms modulate sperm swimming behavior.
