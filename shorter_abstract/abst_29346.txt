it enables scientists to automatically process the raw data in a standardized way before analyzing a plate with the proprietary genemapper software from applied biosystems.
the high level of automation and the large amount of data produced in a high-throughput laboratory require advanced software tools for quality control and workflow management.
we have developed two programs, which address two main aspects of quality control in a snplex™ genotyping environment: gmfilter improves the analysis of snplex™ plates by removing wells with a low overall signal intensity.
this program allows for regular quality control checks of a snplex™ genotyping platform.
gmfilter and sxtestplate provide a valuable tool set for laboratories engaged in genotyping based on the snplex™ system.
genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  is a fundamental technology in modern genetics.
the programs enhance the analysis of snplex™ plates with the genemapper software and enable scientists to evaluate the performance of their genotyping platform.
