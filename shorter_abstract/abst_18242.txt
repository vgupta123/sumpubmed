studies on the development of mesenchymal progenitors into smcs have proven useful in identifying molecular mechanisms involved in digestive musculature plasticity in physiological and pathological conditions.
however, as stomach development proceeds, sustained lix <dig> expression has a negative impact on further smc differentiation and this is associated with a decrease in yap <dig> activity.
using in vivo functional approaches in the chick embryo, we demonstrate that lix <dig> is a key regulator of stomach smc development.
smooth muscle cell  plasticity maintains the balance between differentiated smcs and proliferative mesenchymal progenitors, crucial for muscular tissue homeostasis.
we show that lix <dig> is required for stomach smc determination to regulate the expression of the pro-proliferative gene yap <dig> and mesenchymal cell proliferation.
we demonstrate that expression of lix <dig> must be tightly regulated to allow fine-tuning of the transcript levels and state of activation of the pro-proliferative transcriptional coactivator yap <dig> to regulate proliferation rates of stomach mesenchymal progenitors and their differentiation.
here, we show that limb expression  <dig>  molecularly defines the population of mesenchymal progenitors in the developing stomach.
