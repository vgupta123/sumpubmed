crp treated with detoxi-gel columns retained such effects.
furthermore, using taqman low-density arrays we identified key pro-angiogenic genes induced by crp among them were vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor- <dig> , platelet-derived growth factor , notch family transcription factors , cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer  <dig>  and inhibitor of dna binding/differentiation- <dig> .
c-reactive protein  is an acute phase reactant whose expression in the vascular wall, in particular, in reactive plaque regions, and circulating levels increase in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events.
formation of haemorrhagic neovessels in the intima of developing atherosclerotic plaques is thought to significantly contribute to plaque instability resulting in thrombosis.
crp, at concentrations corresponding to moderate/high risk , induced a significant increase in proliferation, migration and tube-like structure formation in vitro and stimulated blood vessel formation in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay .
although crp is known to induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells  a direct role on modulation of angiogenesis has not been established.
