<dig>  neutral and  <dig>  it was observed that t7l structure at ph  <dig> exhibited less stable nature with more residue level fluctuations, decrease of secondary structural elements and less compactness as compared to its counterparts: neutral ph and ph  <dig> .
it involves two functions: it can cut amide bonds in the bacterial cell wall and interacts with t <dig> rna polymerase  as a part of transcription inhibition.

the t-pad analysis of the md trajectories identified local fluctuations in few residues that influenced the conformational differences in three ph strengths.

from the combined in silico studies, it was observed that there are conformational changes in n-terminal and near helix  <dig> of t7l at different ph strengths, which are involved in the t7rnap interaction, thereby varying the interaction pattern.
from the md studies of the t7l at three different ph strengths viz.
from the docking of the minimum energy representative structures of t7l at different ph strengths  with t7rnap structures at same ph strengths, we saw strong interaction patterns at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  the md analysis of these complexes also confirmed the observations of docking study.
since t7l has been used for developing novel therapeutics and t7rnap one of the most biologically useful protein in both in-vitro and in vivo experiments, this in silico study of ph dependent conformational differences in t7l and the differential interaction with t7rnap at different ph can provide a significant insight into the structural investigations on t7l and t7rnap in varying ph environments.
t <dig> lysozyme , also known as n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, is a t <dig> bacteriophage gene product.
