however, for genetic studies, xenopus tropicalis has been the experimental model of choice because it shorter life cycle and due to a more tractable genome that does not result from genome duplication as in the case of x. laevis.
taken together, our results make possible to establish the correspondence between  <dig> and  <dig>  % of both genomes, percentage of identity, synteny and automatic annotation of transcripts of both species, providing a new and more comprehensive tool for comparative analysis of these two species, by allowing to bridge molecular genetics data among them.
there is expectation for a comparative physical map that can be used as a rosetta stone between x. laevis genetic studies and x. tropicalis genomic research.
today, although still organized in a large number of scaffolds, nearly 85 % of x. tropicalis and 89 % of x. laevis genomes have been sequenced.
in this work, we have mapped using coarse-grained alignment the  <dig> chromosomes of x. laevis, release  <dig> , on the  <dig> reference scaffolds representing the haploid genome of x. tropicalis, release  <dig> .
after validating the mapping with theoretical data, and estimating reference averages of genome sequence identity,  <dig> to 44 % between the two species, we have carried out a synteny analysis for  <dig>  orthologous genes.
