the gotcha method is a useful tool for genome annotators.
the function of a novel gene product is typically predicted by transitive assignment of annotation from similar sequences.
gotcha was compared quantitatively for retrieval of assigned go terms against direct transitive assignment from the highest scoring annotated blast search hit .
the gotcha method was applied to the recently sequenced genome for plasmodium falciparum and six other genomes.
at a p-score cutoff of 50%, gotcha provided 60% better recovery of annotation terms and 20% higher selectivity than annotation with topblast at an e-value cutoff of 10- <dig>
gotcha predicts go term associations with term-specific probability  measures of confidence.
we describe a novel method, gotcha, for predicting gene product function by annotation with gene ontology  terms.
