this approach provides computationally efficient algorithms that allow fast database searching and multiple structure alignment.
in this approach, the writhing number, a quantity originating from integral formulas of vassiliev knot invariants, is used as a local geometric measure.
this encoding transforms the structure alignment problem into a sequence alignment problem and allows the well-established algorithms of sequence alignment to be employed.
the performance of programs for pairwise local alignment  and multiple alignment  are readily adapted from existing code for smith-waterman pairwise alignment and for multiple sequence alignment using clustalw.
these results show that the encoding of the writhing number as a geometric measure allow high quality structure alignments to be generated using standard algorithms of sequence alignment.
tclustalw was tested on a family of protein kinases and reveal conserved regions similar to those previously identified by a hand alignment.
a structure alignment method based on a local geometric property is presented and its performance is tested in pairwise and multiple structure alignments.
the alignment algorithms employed a blocked scoring matrix  generated using the frequency of changes in the geometric alphabet of a block of protein structures.
because the geometric measure can employ different window sizes, the method allows the exploration of alignments on different, well-defined length scales.
by encoding the distribution of writhing numbers across all the structures in the protein databank , protein geometries are represented in a 20-letter alphabet.
a set of protein comparison involving hinged structures was also analyzed and tlocal was seen to compare favorably to other alignment methods.
this measure is used in a sliding window to calculate the local writhe down the length of the protein chain.
