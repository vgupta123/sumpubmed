in addition, the transporter property prediction results suggest that nutrients in the gut might play an important role in changing the gut microbiota composition with age.
more positive correlations between the relative abundances of genera were observed in the elderly-associated cags compared with the infant- and adult-associated cags.
it has been reported that the composition of human gut microbiota changes with age; however, few studies have used molecular techniques to investigate the long-term, sequential changes in gut microbiota composition.
notably, all the drug transporters based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  orthology groups were found in the infant/elderly-enriched cluster.
our results indicate some patterns and transition points in the compositional changes in gut microbiota with age.
in this study, we investigated the sequential changes in gut microbiota composition in newborn to centenarian japanese subjects.
analysis based on bacterial co-abundance groups  defined by kendall correlations between genera revealed that certain transition types of microbiota were enriched in infants, adults, elderly individuals and both infant and elderly subjects.

subjects were predominantly clustered with their matched age; however, some of them fell into mismatched age clusters.
