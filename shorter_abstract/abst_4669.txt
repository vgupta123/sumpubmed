moreover, an exact algorithm for inferring an optimal network is proposed and a discretization method specialized for time series data from perturbation experiments is introduced.
to our knowledge the dbn technique has not been applied in the context of perturbation experiments.
because of their solid basis in statistics, allowing to deal with the stochastic aspects of gene expressions and noisy measurements in a natural way, bayesian networks appear attractive in the field of inferring gene interactions structure from microarray experiments data.
for example, dynamic bayesian networks  apply to time series microarray data.
we extend the framework of dynamic bayesian networks in order to incorporate perturbations.
moreover, the advantages of using exact learning algorithm instead of heuristic methods are analyzed.
we also conclude that the exact algorithm should be used when it is possible, i.e.
we apply our procedure to realistic simulations data.
the results are compared with those obtained by standard dbn learning techniques.
two kinds of microarray experiments yield data particularly rich in information regarding the direction of interactions: time series and perturbation experiments.
we show that the quality of inferred networks dramatically improves when using data from perturbation experiments.
