in studies of androgen receptor binding and active chromatin in specific cell types.
in most cancers, including breast and ovarian, we found enrichment of protein binding and open chromatin in the vicinity of sm breakpoints at distances up to 200 kb.
protein binding and open chromatin state are associated with nearby sm breakpoints in many cancer datasets.
these observations suggest a consistent mechanism underlying sm locations across different cancers.

that correlation between protein-dna binding  and breakpoint locations is common across divergent cancers.
we investigated this hypothesis by comprehensively analyzing the relationship among  <dig> encode protein binding chip-seq experiments,  <dig> dnasei and  <dig> faire experiments, and  <dig>  sms from  <dig> diverse cancer datasets covering  <dig> samples.
in some cancers, such as breast and ovarian, dna double-strand breaks  occur more frequently in transcribed regions, while in other cancer types such as prostate, there is a consistent depletion of breakpoints in transcribed regions.
