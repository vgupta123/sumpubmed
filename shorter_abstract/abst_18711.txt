additionally, from the same fecal sample, complete genomic microbial dna was extracted and shotgun sequenced using solid sequencing to study the composition of the intestinal microbiota and the existing microbial metabolism.
all sequences were obtained from the bacterial 16s rrna gene, which was amplified from microbial dna extracted from a human fecal sample.
to investigate the performance of solid sequencing in a metagenomic context, we compared taxonomic profiles of solid mate-pair sequencing reads with sanger paired reads and  <dig> single reads.
this study shows that solid mate-pair sequencing is a viable and cost-efficient option for analyzing a complex microbiome.
in addition, the shotgun data allowed us to determine a functional profile using the databases seed and kegg.

we found that the microbiota composition of 16s rrna gene sequences obtained using sanger,  <dig> and solid sequencing provide results comparable to the result based on shotgun sequencing.
moreover, with solid sequences we obtained more resolution down to the species level.
