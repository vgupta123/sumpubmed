as a first illustration, we propose a translation into the r. thomas' multivalued logical formalism which provides a possible semantics; a methodology for constructing such models is presented on a classical benchmark: the Î» phage genetic switch.
an appropriate choice of the modeling formalism from the broad range of existing ones may be crucial for efficiently describing and analyzing biological systems.
we propose a new unifying and incremental formalism for the representation and modeling of biological interaction networks.
this formalism allows automated translations into other formalisms, thus enabling a thorough study of the dynamic properties of a biological system.
