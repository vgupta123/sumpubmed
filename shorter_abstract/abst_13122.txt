this study characterizes the structures of the soluble domains of two conserved core esx- <dig> components â€“ eccb <dig> and eccd <dig>  the periplasmic domain of eccb <dig> consists of  <dig> repeat domains and a central domain, which together form a quasi 2-fold symmetrical structure.
the repeat domains of eccb <dig> are structurally similar to a known peptidoglycan binding protein suggesting a role in anchoring the esx- <dig> system within the periplasmic space.
the cytoplasmic domain of eccd1has a ubiquitin-like fold and forms a dimer with a negatively charged groove.
