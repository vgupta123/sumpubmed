sequencing the quinolone-resistance determining regions of gyra and parc, which encode quinolone targets, revealed that  <dig> quinolone-resistant e. coli harboured a substitution at position  <dig> of the gyra gene product and  <dig> of these isolates had other gyra and/or parc substitutions.
in spite of considerable overall diversity among e. coli from ghana, as evaluated by multilocus sequence typing,  <dig> quinolone-resistant e. coli belonged to sequence type complex  <dig>  five of these isolates carried qnrs <dig> alleles.
quinolone-resistant e. coli are commonly present in the faecal flora of accra residents.
containment strategies to limit the spread of quinolone-resistant e. coli need to be deployed to conserve quinolone effectiveness and promote alternatives to their use.
forty  of  <dig> e. coli isolates evaluated were nalidixic acid-resistant.
the isolates have evolved resistance through multiple mechanisms and belong to very few lineages, suggesting clonal expansion.
all but one of the quinolone-resistant isolates were resistant to three or more other antimicrobial classes.
