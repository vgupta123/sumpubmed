the simulation study comparing the non-parametric meta-analysis approach to a commonly used t-statistic based approach shows that the non-parametric approach has better sensitivity and specificity.
with the popularity of dna microarray technology, multiple groups of researchers have studied the gene expression of similar biological conditions.
however, often the sample size for each individual microarray experiment is small.
therefore, in this paper we present a non-parametric meta-analysis approach for combining data from independent microarray studies, and illustrate its application on two independent affymetrix genechip studies that compared the gene expression of biopsies from kidney transplant recipients with chronic allograft nephropathy  to those with normal functioning allograft.
different methods have been developed to integrate the results from various microarray studies, though most of them rely on distributional assumptions, such as the t-statistic based, mixed-effects model, or bayesian model methods.
this approach is non-parametric and does not rely on any distributional assumptions.
we used the expression measurements of the identified genes as predictors to predict the class labels for  <dig> additional biopsy samples, and the predicted results all conformed to their pathologist diagnosed class labels.
by applying fisher's exact test to identify enriched kegg pathways among those genes called differentially expressed, we found  <dig> kegg pathways to be over-represented among the identified genes.
we present a new approach for combining data from multiple independent microarray studies.
further study on the identified genes and pathways may lead to better understanding of can at the molecular level.
