our results provide insights into the challenges that exist in identifying polymorphisms regulating gene expression using bioinformatic sequence analysis approaches.
this present study provides the first genome-wide investigation of the putative cis-regulatory variations in a large set of genes whose levels of expression give rise to cis-linkage in segregating mammalian populations.
in this study we investigate the pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in genes for which the mrna levels show cis-genetic linkage  in segregating mouse populations.
such genes are expected to have polymorphisms near their physical location  that affect their mrna levels by altering one or more of the cis-regulatory elements.
this led us to characterize the snps in promoter  and non-coding gene regions   and the effects they may have on putative transcription factor binding sites.
a higher fraction of cegs are also seen to harbor cis-snp that affect predicted transcription factor binding sites, a likely consequence of the higher cis-snps density in these genes.
changes in gene expression are known to be responsible for phenotypic variation and susceptibility to diseases.
identification and annotation of the genomic sequence variants that cause gene expression changes is therefore likely to lead to a better understanding of the cause of disease at the molecular level.
