web-based resources have recently been developed to facilitate the identification of nucleotide changes that could alter splicing.
the variations observed in the splicing proficiency in three different cell lines suggest that nucleotide changes may dictate alternative splice site selection in a tissue-specific manner contributing to the widely observed phenotypic variability in inherited cancers.
the issue of unclassified variants in cancer predisposing genes is very important both for the correct ascertainment of cancer risk and for the understanding of the basic mechanisms of cancer gene function and regulation.
thus, nucleotide substitutions in these sequences can induce aberrant splicing.
therefore we aimed to verify how predictions that can be drawn from in silico analysis correlate with results obtained in an in vivo splicing assay.
our results suggest that the available algorithms, while potentially helpful in identifying splicing modulators especially when they are located in weakly defined exons, do not always correspond to an obvious modification of the splicing pattern.
moreover, we observed that some exons and some mutations show cell-specific differences in the frequency of exon inclusion.
transfection of three different cell lines with  <dig> missense mutations, showed that a minority of them lead to defective splicing.
however, apart from the mutations in the donor and acceptor sites, the effects on splicing of other sequence variations are difficult to predict.
