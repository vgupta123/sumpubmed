recent in vivo dietary studies have demonstrated that the species composition of the human faecal microbiota is influenced by dietary intake.
we supplied two alternative non-digestible polysaccharides as energy sources to three different human gut microbial communities in anaerobic, ph-controlled continuous-flow fermentors.
of the eight most abundant bacteroides otus detected, two were promoted specifically by inulin and six by pectin.
among the firmicutes, eubacterium eligens in particular was strongly promoted by pectin, while several species were stimulated by inulin.
community diversity was greater in the pectin-fed than in the inulin-fed fermentors, presumably reflecting the differing complexity of the two substrates.
nevertheless, surprisingly little is known about the global response of the microbial community to particular carbohydrates.
in particular, several experiments involving downshifts to ph  <dig>  resulted in faecalibacterium prausnitzii replacing bacteroides spp.
community analysis showed that supply of apple pectin or inulin resulted in the highly specific enrichment of particular bacterial operational taxonomic units .
furthermore, the gut environment, especially ph, plays a key role in determining the outcome of interspecies competition.
both for reasons of efficacy and of safety, the development of prebiotics intended to benefit human health has to take account of the highly individual species profiles that may result.
dietary intake of specific non-digestible carbohydrates  is increasingly seen as a highly effective approach for manipulating the composition and activities of the human gut microbiota to benefit health.
we have shown that particular non-digestible dietary carbohydrates have enormous potential for modifying the gut microbiota, but these modifications occur at the level of individual strains and species and are not easily predicted a priori.
