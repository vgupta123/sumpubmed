this study compared global gene expression in laying hen uterus in the presence or absence of shell calcification in order to characterize gene products involved in the supply of minerals and / or the shell biomineralization process.
our analysis identified  <dig> gene products encoding proteins involved in mineral supply, and allowed updating of the general model describing uterine ion transporters during eggshell calcification.
a list of  <dig> proteins potentially secreted into the uterine fluid to be active in the mineralization process was also established.
the chicken eggshell is a natural mechanical barrier to protect egg components from physical damage and microbial penetration.
they were classified according to their potential functions .
microarrays were used to identify a repertoire of  <dig> over-expressed genes during shell calcification.
