in this paper we introduce itd assembler, a novel approach that rapidly evaluates all unmapped and partially mapped reads from whole exome ngs data using a de bruijn graphs approach to select reads that harbor cycles of appropriate length, followed by assembly using overlap-layout-consensus.
we tested itd assembler on the cancer genome atlas aml dataset as a truth set.
itd assembler identified the highest percentage of reported flt3-itds when compared to other itd detection algorithms, and discovered additional itds in flt <dig>  kit, cebpa, wt <dig> and other genes.
itd assembler is a very sensitive tool which can detect partial, large and complex tandem duplications.
novel itds were validated by analyzing the corresponding rna sequencing data.
detection of tandem duplication within coding exons, referred to as internal tandem duplication , remains challenging due to inefficiencies in alignment of itd-containing reads to the reference genome.
