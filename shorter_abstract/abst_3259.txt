the transcriptomic and proteomic effects of this phytoextract on mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells  were analyzed using primary cultures.
in this study, a phytocompound mixture extracted from the butanol fraction  of a stem and leaf  extract of e. purpurea  containing stringently defined bioactive phytocompounds was obtained using standardized and published procedures.
treatment of bmdcs with  did not significantly influence the phenotypic maturation activity of dendritic cells .
several echinacea species have been used as nutraceuticals or botanical drugs for "immunostimulation", but scientific evidence supporting their therapeutic use is still controversial.
results from this study suggest that  modulates dc mobility and related cellular physiology in the mouse immune system.
affymetrix dna microarray and bioinformatics analyses of genes differentially expressed in dcs treated with  for  <dig> or  <dig> h revealed that the majority of responsive genes were related to cell adhesion or motility , or were chemokines  or signaling molecules .
in parallel, proteomic analysis showed that the expressions of metabolic-, cytoskeleton- or nf-κb signaling-related proteins were regulated by treatment with .
transpath database analyses of gene expression and related signaling pathways in treated-dcs predicted the jnk, pp2c-α, akt, erk1/ <dig> or mapkapk pathways as the putative targets of .
