sequences of sixty-eight zifl genes, from nine plant species, were comparatively analyzed.
monocots harbor a larger number of zifl genes in their genomes than dicots, probably a result of a lineage-specific expansion.
the genomic organization of the rice zifl genes seems to be highly influenced by segmental and tandem duplications and concerted evolution, as rice genome contains five highly similar zifl gene pairs.
we suggest that zifl genes have different evolutionary histories in monocot and dicot lineages.
here, we describe the zinc-induced facilitator-like  gene family in plants, and characterize the genomic structure and expression of rice paralogs, which are highly affected by segmental duplication.
most rice zifl promoters are enriched for the core sequence of the fe-deficiency-related box ide <dig>  gene expression analyses of different plant organs, growth stages and treatments, both from our qpcr data and from microarray databases, revealed that the duplicated zifl gene pairs are mostly co-expressed.
moreover, this is the first description of the zifl gene family in plants and the basis for functional studies on this family, which may play important roles in zn and fe homeostasis in plants.
duplications are very common in the evolution of plant genomes, explaining the high number of members in plant gene families.
in rice, concerted evolution affected zifl duplicated genes, possibly maintaining similar expression patterns between pairs.
new genes born after duplication can undergo pseudogenization, neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization.
