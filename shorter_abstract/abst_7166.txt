genome-wide screening in human and mouse cells using rna interference and open reading frame over-expression libraries is rapidly becoming a viable experimental approach for many research labs.
herein, we demonstrate four major applications for the gmap resource, including deconvolution of pooled rnai screens in cells with at least  <dig>  distinct shrnas.
as a solution, we designed a comprehensive platform for highly multiplexed functional genetic screens in human, mouse and yeast cells using popular, commercially available gene modulation libraries.
further experiments with a larger, ~ <dig>  shrna pool demonstrate that equivalent results are obtained from plasmid pools and from genomic dna derived from lentivirus infected cells.
parallel testing of large shrna pools using gmap and next-generation sequencing methods revealed that the two methods provide valid and complementary approaches to deconvolution of genome-wide shrna screens.
the gene modulation array platform  is a single microarray-based detection solution for deconvolution of loss and gain-of-function pooled screens.
