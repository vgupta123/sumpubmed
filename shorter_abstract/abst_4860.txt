these, in turn, increase the performance of analysis tools that depend strictly on good input alignments such as methods for detecting conserved rna secondary structure elements.
it is desirable, therefore, to make use of the amino acid sequence when aligning coding nucleic acid sequences.
here we present a multiple alignment tool, codaln, that implements a combined nucleic acid plus amino acid scoring model for pairwise and progressive multiple alignments that allows arbitrary weighting for almost all scoring parameters.
we demonstrate the applicability of codaln to various biologically relevant types of sequences  and show that the combination of nucleic acid and amino acid sequence information leads to improved alignments.
on the other hand, overlapping reading frames may encode multiple alternative proteins, possibly with intermittent non-coding parts.
the standard scoring scheme for nucleic acid alignments can be extended to incorporate simultaneously information on translation products in one or more reading frames.
high quality sequence alignments of rna and dna sequences are an important prerequisite for the comparative analysis of genomic sequence data.
nucleic acid sequences, however, exhibit a much larger sequence heterogeneity compared to their encoded protein sequences due to the redundancy of the genetic code.
