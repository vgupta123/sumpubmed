here we introduce the protein sequence annotation tool , a web-based, sequence annotation meta-server for performing integrated, high-throughput, genome-wide sequence analyses.
our goals in building psat were to  create an extensible platform for integration of multiple sequence-based bioinformatics tools,  enable functional annotations and enzyme predictions over large input protein fasta data sets, and  provide a web interface for convenient execution of the tools.
strain rv <dig>  importing the results of psat into ec2kegg, and using the resulting functional comparisons to identify a putative catabolic pathway, thereby distinguishing rv <dig> from a well annotated herbaspirillum species.
psat is a meta server that combines the results from several sequence-based annotation and function prediction codes, and is available at http://psat.llnl.gov/psat/.
this analysis demonstrates that high-throughput enzyme predictions, provided by psat processing, can be used to identify metabolic potential in an otherwise poorly annotated genome.
psat stands apart from other sequence-based genome annotation systems in providing a high-throughput platform for rapid de novo enzyme predictions and sequence annotations over large input protein sequence data sets in fasta.
in this paper, we demonstrate the utility of psat by annotating the predicted peptide gene products of herbaspirillum sp.
