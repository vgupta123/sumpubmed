we isolated dna fragments from the foxp <dig> genomic region that function as enhancers to drive gfp expression in the cns during development, including in the telencephalon, diencephalon, eye, tectum, and hindbrain.
<dig>  foxp2-enhancerb, and foxp2-enhancerd, contain putative lef <dig> binding sites, and are regulated by lef <dig>  however, two other genomic fragments containing lef <dig> sites failed to function in vivo as enhancers.
this work shows that lef <dig> is necessary for expression of foxp <dig> in the tectum, mid-hindbrain boundary, and hindbrain during cns development, and is the first insight into the upstream regulation of foxp <dig> during development.
the foxp <dig> enhancers we identified will allow dissection of foxp2's role during cns development.
we also demonstrate that in silico prediction of potential lef <dig> binding sites poorly predicts their ability to function in vivo as enhancers.
chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that lef <dig> binds to sites in foxp2-enhancera.
