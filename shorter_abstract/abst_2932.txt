the lode procedure will be helpful in refining genome sequence assemblies, especially those being created from next-generation sequencing where high-throughput snp discovery and genotyping platforms are integrated components of genome analysis.
the lode procedure described in this study is an efficient and accurate method for positioning snps , for validating and checking the quality of a genome assembly, and offers a means for positioning of unordered scaffolds containing snps.
we have developed a locus ordering procedure based on linkage disequilibrium  which provides estimation of the chromosomal positions of unaligned snps and scaffolds.
the utility of the lode procedure was demonstrated using data from  <dig>  bulls genotyped for  <dig>  snps across three different snp chips.
secondly,  <dig>  of  <dig>  snps unpositioned in the btau <dig>  assembly were positioned using the lode procedure.
finally, the accuracy of the lode procedure was independently validated by comparative mapping on the hg <dig> human assembly.
based on these results, the positions of  <dig> unordered scaffolds were determined.
recent developments of high-density snp chips across a number of species require accurate genetic maps.
despite rapid advances in genome sequence assembly and availability of a number of tools for creating genetic maps, the exact genome location for a number of snps from these snp chips still remains unknown.
it also provides an alternative means for verification of genetic maps.
