it allows the discovery of relationships between changes in transcripts and metabolites of crop plants harboring introgressed exotic alleles and furthermore, its use can be extended to other type of omics data.
the *omesom software provides easy-to-visualize interfaces for the identification of coordinated variations in the co-expressed genes and co-accumulated metabolites.
modern biology uses experimental systems that involve the exploration of phenotypic variation as a result of the recombination of several genomes.
it provides a user-friendly interface and offers several visualization features, easy to understand by non-expert users.
the software is focused on the easy identification of groups including different molecular entities, independently of the number of clusters formed.
one such approach is the analysis of transcript and metabolite profiles.
this paper presents a novel software named *omesom  that implements a neural model for biological data clustering and visualization.
therefore, *omesom provides support for data mining tasks and it is applicable to basic research as well as applied breeding programs.
