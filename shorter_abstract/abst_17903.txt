the success of a heterokaryon during in vitro cultivation was mainly determined by spore production and to a lesser extent by mycelial growth rate.
we test this hypothesis using in vitro tests with five nuclear haplotypes of a termitomyces species.
fourth, in contrast to most studied basidiomycete fungi, in termitomyces sp.
no nuclear migration occurs during mating, limiting the scope for nuclear competition within the mycelium.
we hypothesised that natural selection on these fungi not only occurs between mycelia, but also at the level of nuclei within the mycelium.
we investigate the scope for selection at the level of nuclei within fungal individuals  of the mutualistic termitomyces cultivated by fungus-growing termites.
whereas in most basidiomycete fungi the number and kind of nuclei is strictly regulated to be two per cell, in termitomyces mycelia the number of nuclei per cell is highly variable.
