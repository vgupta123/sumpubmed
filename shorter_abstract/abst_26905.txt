the definition therein explored was based on the r√©nyi entropy of probability density estimation  using the parzen's window method and applied to chaos game representation/universal sequence maps .
this report extends the concepts of continuous entropy by defining dna sequence entropic profiles using the new pdf estimations to refine the density estimation of motifs.
in a recent report the authors presented a new measure of continuous entropy for dna sequences, which allows the estimation of their randomness level.
on the other hand, by spanning the parameters of the kernel function it is possible to extract important information about the scale of each conserved dna region.
the new methodology enables two results.
on the one hand it shows that the entropic profiles are directly related with the statistical significance of motifs, allowing the study of under and over-representation of segments.
