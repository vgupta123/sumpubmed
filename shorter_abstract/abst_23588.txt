antimicrobial peptides  are an ancient group of defense molecules.
the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of a combination of two amps  against staphylococcus epidermidis.
the temporin b  and the royal jelleins i, ii, iii chemically modified at the c terminal , were tested for their activity against  <dig> different staphylococcus epidermidis strains, alone and in combination.
in vivo, the mix sterilized mice infected with staphylococcus epidermidis in eleven days and inhibited the expression of genes encoding the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase  <dig>  and cd <dig>  two important parameters of inflammation.
in vitro, the mix displayed low hemolytic activity, no no2- production and the ability to curb the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-α and ifn-γ to the same extent as acetylsalicylic acid.
of the three royal jelleins, rji-c showed the highest activity.
the study shows that the mix – a combination of two naturally occurring peptides - displays both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.
