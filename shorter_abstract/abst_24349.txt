efficient cross-referencing of metabolite identifiers is a key technology for metabolomics data analysis.
the created database can be used to map in-house identifiers and synonyms to external resources such as the kegg database.
connecting identifiers of analytes found in experimental data with the identifiers of their parent metabolites in public databases can therefore be very laborious.
here we present a strategy and a software tool for integrating metabolite identifiers from local reference libraries and public databases that do not depend on a single common primary identifier.
analysis of data from high-throughput experiments depends on the availability of well-structured data that describe the assayed biomolecules.
online chemical databases use multiple types of identifiers in parallel but lack a common primary key for reliable database consolidation.
