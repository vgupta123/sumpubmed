during chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells , a complex transcriptional network is active and regulates the temporal differentiation progress.
genome-wide exploration of mirna-mrna regulatory relationships is a reasonable approach to identify mirnas which have so far not been associated with the investigated differentiation process.
it predicts the influence of mirnas on the expression of chondrogenic marker genes and therefore proposes novel regulatory relations in differentiation control.
by analysing the inferred network, we identified a previously unknown regulatory effect of mir-524-5p on the expression of the transcription factor sox <dig> and the chondrogenic marker genes col2a <dig>  acan and col10a <dig>
the netgenerator tool is able to identify valid gene regulatory networks on the basis of mirna and mrna time series data.
network inference from gene expression data is a typical approach to reconstruct gene regulatory networks.
integrated network inference aimes at determining interrelations between mirnas and mrnas on the basis of expression data as well as mirna target predictions.
network inference was performed using netgenerator to reconstruct a dynamical regulatory model based on the measured data and prior knowledge.

as modulators of transcriptional regulation, micrornas  play a critical role in stem cell differentiation.
network nodes were identified by analysing temporal expression changes, mirna target gene predictions, time series correlation and literature knowledge.
we applied the netgenerator tool in order to infer an integrated gene regulatory network.
