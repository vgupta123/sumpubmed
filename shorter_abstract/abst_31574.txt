this provides an insight into the composition and function of srnas in chinese fir and sheds new light on land plant srna evolution.
small non-coding rnas  play key roles in plant development, growth and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.
with blastn and mireap we identified a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas comprising  <dig> mirna families and one novel mirna with precursor sequence.
to obtain srnas in chinese fir, we sequenced a srna library generated from seeds, seedlings, leaves, stems and calli, using illumina high throughput sequencing technology.
utilizing real time rt-pcr, we revealed that four conserved and one novel mirnas displayed developmental stage-specific expression patterns in chinese fir.
at least four classes of srnas have been well characterized in plants, including repeat-associated sirnas , micrornas , trans-acting sirnas  and natural antisense transcript-derived sirnas.
a comprehensive set of srnas were acquired, including conserved and novel mirnas, rasirnas and tasirnas.
the expressions of  <dig> conserved and one novel mirnas and one tasirna were detected by rt-pcr.
chinese fir  is one of the most important coniferous evergreen tree species in china.
we also demonstrated that the dcl3-dependent rasirna biogenesis pathway, which had been considered absent in conifers, existed in chinese fir.
we unveiled a complex population of srnas in chinese fir through high throughput sequencing.
furthermore, the mir390-tas3-arf regulatory pathway was elucidated.
no srna from chinese fir has been described to date.
in addition,  <dig> unigenes were predicted to be targets of  <dig> chinese fir mirna families, of which five target genes were experimentally verified by 5' race, including a squamosa promoter-binding protein gene, a pentatricopeptide  repeat-containing protein gene, a bola-like family protein gene, ago <dig> and a gene of unknown function.
