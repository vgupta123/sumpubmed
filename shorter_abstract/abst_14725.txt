our results will increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the low rate of embryonic loss in chinese taihu pigs, facilitate the identification of major genes that affect litter size, and be valuable for porcine transcriptomic studies.
cross-breeding experiments have demonstrated that taihu sows exhibit a strong maternal effect and that their large litter sizes are mainly caused by maternal genes.
a lower prenatal death rate is the major contributing factor to the prolificacy of taihu pigs.
embryonic loss of taihu pigs on gd <dig> is lower than that of western pigs.
here, endometrial samples were collected from pregnant erhualian sows  and landrace Ã— large white  sows  on gd <dig>  digital gene expression profiling  was used to measure the gene expression in the endometrium of the two breeds.
pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes significantly enriched in  <dig> kegg pathways.
the dge expression profiles of erhualian and ll endometrium demonstrated differential expression of genes.
erhualian pigs, one of chinese taihu pig breeds, are known to have the largest recorded litter size in the world.
gene ontology  analysis showed that the differential genes involved in reproduction and growth.
we also suggest that the differences in the uterine environment lead to higher uterine capacity in erhualian pigs.
the growth and development of porcine embryos on gestation day   <dig> are dependent on histotroph secreted by endometrium.
