analysis of gene structures showed that most of the pmes genes had 2– <dig> exons, with a few having a variable number of exons from  <dig> to  <dig>  there are nearly no differences in the gene structure of pmes among the three  cotton species.
selective pressure analysis showed that the ka/ks value for each of the three cotton species pme families was less than one.
this study provided an important basis for further research on the functions of cotton pmes.
results from qrt-pcr indicated that the expression level of different pmes at various fiber developmental stages was different.
we further analyzed their gene structure, conserved domain, gene expression, and systematic evolution to lay the foundation for deeper research on the function of pmes.

pectin is one of the important components of the plant cell wall, which forms the main structural material of cotton fiber.
moreover, some of the pmes showed fiber predominant expression in secondary wall thickening indicating tissue-specific expression patterns.
conserved domain analysis showed that pmes members had a relatively conserved c-terminal pectinesterase domain  while the n-terminus was less conserved.
we identified  <dig>  pme genes from diploid g. arboreum ,  <dig>  pme genes from g. raimondii , and  <dig>  pme genes from tetraploid cotton g. hirsutum .
moreover, some of the family members contained a pectin methylesterase inhibitor  domain.
pectin methylesterase  is a hydrolytic enzyme that utilizes pectin as substrates, and plays a significant role in regulating pectin reconstruction thereby regulating plant growth.
