this requires increasing sequence quality and reliability in order to avoid database contamination with artefactual sequences.
already-published and newly-designed algorithms have been included to identify sequence inserts, to remove low quality, vector, adaptor, low complexity and contaminant sequences, and to detect chimeric reads.
the recommended pipeline reveals more information about each sequence than previously described pre-processors and can discard more sequencing or experimental artefacts.
high-throughput automated sequencing has enabled an exponential growth rate of sequencing data.
due to its specific algorithms, seqtrim outperforms other pre-processors implemented as web services or standalone applications.
the availability of several input and output formats allows its inclusion in sequence processing workflows.
