in the present work, a lateral flow assay  for antigen detection has been developed and evaluated.

the continued spread poses a serious threat to the swine industry worldwide.
the test is based on the use of a mab against vp <dig> protein of asfv, the major viral capsid protein and highly immunogenic.
african swine fever  is a viral infectious disease of domestic and wild suids of all breeds and ages, causing a wide range of hemorrhagic syndromes and frequently characterized by high mortality.
first experiments using vp <dig> viral and recombinant protein or inactivated culture virus showed promising results with a sensitivity similar to that of a commercially available antigen-elisa.
moreover, these strips were tested with blood from experimentally infected pigs and field animals and the results compared with those of pcr and antigen-elisa.
with the field samples, once again, the pcr detected more positives than either the antigen-elisa or lfa, although here the number of positive samples scored by the lfa exceeded the values obtained with the antigen-elisa, showing 60 % positivity vs 48 % for the elisa.
for the two groups of sera, the specificity was close to 100 % indicating that hardly any false positive samples were found.
since  <dig>  it has also been present in different countries of eastern europe, where control measures have not been effective so far.
