this suggests that in this model, adipocyte phenotype does not seem to increase at the expense of the osteoblast lineage.
overall, our data showed that in this co-differentiation medium both differentiation lineages were enhanced compared to classical adipogenic or osteogenic culture medium.
in this aim, mouse bone marrow stromal cells were cultured in a standard osteogenic medium added with different concentrations of dexamethasone, known to be an important regulator of mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation.
however, some data from mouse models showed the existence of an independent relationship between bone mineral content and bone marrow adiposity.
therefore, the combination of adipogenesis and osteogenesis in primary culture would be helpful to determine if this competition would be observed on a whole bone marrow stromal cell population in a culture medium allowing both lineages.

gene expression of osteoblast and adipocyte markers, biochemical and physical analyses demonstrated the presence of both cell types when dexamethasone was used at  <dig> nm.
