we choose urine as body-fluid of interest and ce-ms, a thoroughly validated platform technology, allowing for routine analysis of a large number of samples.
as tractable example we define the measurable proteomic differences between apparently healthy adult males and females.
sample size estimation can be performed based on a small number of observations via resampling from pilot data.
in particular, a justification of the sample size should be part of the study design.
machine learning algorithms appear ideally suited to generate classifiers.
assessment of any results in an independent test-set is essential.
we found that the wilcoxon-test is best suited for the definition of potential biomarkers.
