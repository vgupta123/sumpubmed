we found that lab <dig> presented higher adhesion to canine colonic mucus as compared to mucus isolated from porcine colon.
for a good probiotic candidate, the abilities to adhere to intestinal epithelium and to fortify barrier function are considered to be crucial for colonization and functionality of the strain.
lab <dig> showed adhesion to ht- <dig> and caco- <dig> cell lines, and importantly also to canine iecs isolated from canine intestinal biopsies.
in conclusion, canine indigenous strain lab <dig> is a potential probiotic candidate for dogs adhering to the host epithelium and showing intestinal barrier fortifying and anti-inflammatory effects.
in this study, the adhesion ability of lab <dig> to intestinal epithelial cell  lines, iecs isolated from canine intestinal biopsies, and to canine, porcine and human intestinal mucus was investigated.
the strain lactobacillus acidophilus lab <dig> was isolated from the jejunum of a healthy dog, where it was found to be the most pre-dominant lactobacilli.
