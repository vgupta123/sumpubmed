the impact of md-pg <dig> in the fruit cell wall disassembly was further confirmed by the cortex structure electron microscope scanning in two apple varieties characterized by opposite texture performance, such as ‘golden delicious’ and ‘granny smith’.
the results here presented step forward into the genetic dissection of fruit texture in apple.
in apple, md-pg <dig>  a key gene belonging to the polygalacturonase gene family, was mapped on chromosome  <dig> and co-localized within the statistical interval of a major hot spot qtl associated to several fruit texture sub-phenotypes.
in this work, a qtl corresponding to the position of md-pg <dig> was validated and new functional alleles associated to the fruit texture properties in  <dig> apple cultivars were discovered.
anatomically these variations depend on degradation events occurring in both fruit primary cell wall and middle lamella.
<dig> snps genotyped by gene full length resequencing and  <dig> ssr markers ad hoc targeted in the gene metacontig were employed.
this new set of haplotypes, and microsatellite alleles, can represent a valuable toolbox for a more efficient parental selection as well as the identification of new apple accessions distinguished by superior fruit quality features.
out of this snp set, eleven were used to define three significant haplotypes statistically associated to several texture components.
