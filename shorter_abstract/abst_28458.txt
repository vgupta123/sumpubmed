ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor , stimulates growth hormone  secretion, and has both orexigenic and adipogenic effects.
we applied various concentrations of ghrelin to cultured rbmsc and observed the growth rate of the cells by mtt, changes in the phosphorylation state of erk1/ <dig>  jnk and p <dig>  and the expression levels of alp, runx <dig>  and osterix by wetern blot.
mesenchymal stem cells  can differentiate into chondroblasts, adipocytes, or osteoblasts under appropriate stimulation.
this study sought to understand the potential involvement of members of mapk serine/threonine kinases in the ghrelin-induced growth of rabbit mscs .
