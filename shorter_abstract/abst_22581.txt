the results suggest the presence of mirnas in two cell models, providing insights into wnt pathway-specific mirnas that can be further characterized for their potential roles in adipogenesis.
to our knowledge, present study represents the first attempt to unveil the profile of mirnas involed in adipogenesis by modulating wnt signaling pathway, which contributed to deeper investigation of the mechanism of adipogenesis.
to validate the predicted targets and the potential functions of these identified mirnas, the mimics of mir- <dig> were transfected into 3t3-l <dig> cells and enlarged cells with distinct lipid droplets were observed; meanwhile, transfection with the inhibitor of mir- <dig> could markedly decrease differentiation-specific factors at the transcription level, which suggested the specific role of mir- <dig> in promoting adipogenesis.
as a molecular switch, the canonical wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway should be suppressed during the adipogenesis; however, activation of this pathway leads to the inhibition of lipid depots formation.
furthermore, the activity of luciferase reporter bearing tcf7l <dig> mrna 3' utr was decreased after co-transfection with mir- <dig> in hek-293ft cells.
here we established two types of cell model, activation and repression of wnt signaling, and investigated the expression profile of micrornas using microarray assay.
tcf7l <dig>  the predicted target of mir- <dig>  is a transcription factor triggering the downstream responsive genes of wnt signaling, was blocked at transcription level.
micrornas  are a large class of tiny non-coding rnas  that regulate diverse biological processes at the posttranscriptional level by controlling mrna stability or translation.
