here we have looked at the genomic distribution of the retrotransposable short interspersed nuclear elements ehsine <dig> and ehsine <dig>  due to their mobile nature, some ehsine copies may occupy different genomic locations among isolates of e. histolytica possibly affecting adjacent gene expression; this variability in location can be exploited to differentiate strains.
the results obtained by our method correlated with the data from other typing methods.
our results reveal several loci with extensive polymorphism of sine occupancy among different strains of e. histolytica and prove the principle that the genomic distribution of sines is a valid method for typing of e. histolytica strains.
earlier reports have shown that some e. histolytica isolates are more virulent than others, suggesting that virulence may be linked to genotype.
sine occupancy was also checked at these three loci in  <dig> other axenically cultivated e. histolytica strains and  <dig> clinical isolates.
some of the loci were analyzed experimentally for sine occupancy using dna from strain rahman.
we have looked for ehsine1- and ehsine2-occupied loci in the genome sequence of entamoeba histolytica hm-1:imss and searched for homologous loci in other strains to determine the insertion status of these elements.
each locus gave a single, specific amplicon with the primer sets used, making this a suitable method for strain typing.
a total of  <dig> ehsine <dig> and  <dig> ehsine <dig> loci were analyzed in the available sequenced strains  were identified where a ehsine1/ehsine <dig> sequence was missing from the corresponding locus of other strains.
we also report a bioinformatic analysis of ehsine <dig> copies.
based on presence/absence of sine and amplification with locus-specific primers, the  <dig> strains could be divided into eleven genotypes.
