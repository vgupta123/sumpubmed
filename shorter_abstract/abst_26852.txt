frequently observed false positive results are troublesome for veterinary authorities and cause financial losses to animal owners.
the cft should be amended by the newly validated western blot to increase the positive likelihood ratio of glanders serodiagnosis in non endemic areas or areas with low glanders prevalence.
hence, a western blot assay making use of a partly purified lipopolysaccaride  containing antigen of three burkholderia mallei strains was developed.
the developed western blot assay showed a markedly higher diagnostic specificity when compared to the prescribed cft and therefore can be used as a confirmatory test.
its use for international trade of horses and mules should be implemented by the oie.
however, the cft remains the test of choice for routine testing of glanders due to its high sensitivity, its feasibility using standard laboratory equipment and its worldwide distribution in diagnostic laboratories.
