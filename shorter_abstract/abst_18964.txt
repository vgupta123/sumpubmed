mammalian collagens xiii, xxiii and xxv form a unique subgroup of type ii transmembrane proteins, each comprising a short n-terminal cytosolic domain, a transmembrane domain and a largely collagenous ectodomain.
the encoded col- <dig> polypeptide is 85Â kda in size and forms a trimeric protein.
a col- <dig> cdna was cloned and expressed as protein in mammalian cho cells, two antibodies against col- <dig> protein were generated, and a col-99-bearing fosmid gene construct col-99::egfp::flag was used to generate transgenic c. elegans lines.
the experimental data demonstrate conservation of macit molecular and cellular properties and tissue localisations in the invertebrate, c. elegans.
col- <dig> is detected in mouth, pharynx, body wall and the tail, mostly in motor neurons and muscle systems and is enriched at neuromuscular junctions.
collagens provide structural support and guidance cues within the extracellular matrix of metazoans.
macits have conserved domain architecture in which a juxta-membrane furin-cleavage site and the c-terminal  <dig> residues are especially highly conserved, whereas the cytoplasmic domains are weakly conserved.
knowledge of the representation of macits in other extant metazoans is lacking.
whereas invertebrates encode a single macit, collagens xiii/xxiii/xxv of jawed vertebrates are paralogues that originated from the two rounds of en-bloc genome duplication occurring early in vertebrate evolution.
to study protein expression and function in a metazoan with a single macit gene, we focused on caenorhabditis elegans and its col- <dig> gene.
this question is of interest for understanding structural/functional relationships in the macit family and also for insight into the evolution of macits in relation to the secreted, fibrillar collagens that are present throughout the metazoa.
