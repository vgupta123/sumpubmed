it has recently emerged as an excellent model system with which to address a number of important questions, including the evolution of traits under sexual selection and traits involved in climatic adaptation along latitudinal gradients.
the est collection will provide much needed genomic resources for this model species and facilitate comparative evolutionary studies within the montium subgroup of the d. melanogaster lineage.
at least  <dig> est-associated microsatellite markers, representing  <dig> different contigs, were also found, providing an additional set of genetic markers.
we have provided the first gene collection and largest set of polymorphic genetic markers, to date, for the fly d. serrata.
here, we present the first expressed sequence tag  collection for d. serrata that will enable the identification of genes underlying sexually-selected phenotypes and physiological responses to environmental change and may help resolve controversial phylogenetic relationships within the montium subgroup.
by incorporating into the cdna library multiple individuals from populations spanning a large portion of the geographical range of d. serrata, we were able to identify  <dig>  putative single nucleotide polymorphisms , with  <dig> different contigs having at least one "double hit" snp that is highly likely to be a real polymorphism.
the native australian fly drosophila serrata belongs to the highly speciose montium subgroup of the melanogaster species group.
understanding the molecular genetic basis of such traits has been limited by a lack of genomic resources for this species.
the assembled est library is available online at .
a normalized cdna library was constructed from whole fly bodies at several developmental stages, including larvae and adults.
partial transcripts were discovered from a variety of genes of evolutionary interest by blasting contigs against the  <dig> drosophila genomes currently sequenced.
