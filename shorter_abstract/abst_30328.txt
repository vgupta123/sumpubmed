although it is known that triptolide inhibits nfκb activation and other signaling pathways downstream of tlrs, involvement of tlr cascade in triptolide activity was not reported.
also, the suppressive effect of triptolide on tlr-induced nfκb activation was observed when either myd <dig> or trif was knocked out, confirming that both myd <dig> and trif mediated nfκb activation may be inhibited by triptolide.
this study reveals involvement of tlr signaling in triptolide activity and further increases understanding of how triptolide activity may downregulate nfκb activation during inflammatory conditions.
here we report the expression profile of immune signaling genes modulated by triptolide in lps induced mouse macrophages.
in an array study triptolide treatment modulated expression of  <dig> % of one hundred and ninety five immune signaling genes that included toll-like receptors .
