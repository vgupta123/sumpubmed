a novel method for sex identification in primates is described using a triple primer pcr reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis of the sex-chromosomal isoforms of the ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat protein gene .
this simple pcr amplification of x and y fragments is useful for sexing dna samples from all species of primates.
one of the key tools for determining the social structure of wild and endangered primates is the ability to sex dna from small amounts of non-invasive samples that are likely to include highly degraded dna.
furthermore, since the amplified fragments are very short the method can be applied to fragmented dna extracted from non-invasive samples.
traditional markers for molecular sex determination of primates are developed on the basis of the human sequence and are often non-functional in distantly related primate species.
this enabled the design of a triple primer pcr setup that amplifies x and y products of different length in a single pcr reaction.
