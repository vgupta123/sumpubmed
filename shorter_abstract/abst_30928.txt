in addition, we found instances of length heterogeneity between chromosome homologues.
the mechanisms of chromosome segregation in these diploid protozoan parasites are poorly understood.
this information provides a firmer framework for investigating aspects of chromosome segregation and will allow epigenetic features associated with the process to be more accurately mapped.
the results indicate that the sizes of the arrays on different chromosomes vary from  <dig> to  <dig> kb.
our results show that centromeric repeat arrays on t. brucei chromosomes are more similar in size to those of higher eukaryotes than previously suspected.
african trypanosomes belong to a eukaryotic lineage which displays many unusual genetic features.
we used a long-range restriction endonuclease mapping approach to more accurately define the sizes of the centromeric repeat arrays on the  <dig> t. brucei chromosomes where unambiguous assembly data were available.
