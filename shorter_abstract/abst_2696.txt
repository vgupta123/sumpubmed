for this purpose, ten candidate reference genes were investigated in bovine muscular tissue.
the three methods tend to agree on the most stably expressed genes and the least in muscular tissue.
real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction  is a technique used to measure mrna species copy number as a way to determine key genes involved in different biological processes.
however, the expression level of these key genes may vary among tissues or cells not only as a consequence of differential expression but also due to different factors, including choice of reference genes to normalize the expression levels of the target genes; thus the selection of reference genes is critical for expression studies.
the value of stability of ten candidate reference genes included in three groups was estimated: the so called 'classical housekeeping' genes , a second set of genes used in expression studies conducted on other tissues  and a third set of novel genes .
based on genorm algorithm, we propose the use of three genes sf3a <dig>  eef1a <dig> and hmbs as references for normalization of real-time rtqpcr in muscle expression studies.
although the rrna-18s stability measure seems to be within the range of acceptance, its use is not recommended because its synthesis regulation is not representative of mrna levels.
eef1a <dig> and hmbs followed by sf3a <dig>  actb, and casc <dig> can be considered as stable reference genes, and b2m, rpii, ubc and gapdh would not be appropriate.
