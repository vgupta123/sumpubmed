the benchmark calculations reveal  that these preprocessing steps can lead to an enormous speed-up under both algorithms, and  that the adapted berge algorithm outperforms the binary integer approach.
we then benchmark the numerical performance of the algorithms in several realistic medium-scale metabolic models.
two different algorithmic schemes  have been proposed to compute cmcss from elementary modes.
