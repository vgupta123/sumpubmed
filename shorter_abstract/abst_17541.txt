ascidians are tunicates, the taxon recently proposed as sister group to the vertebrates.
moreover, phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for the close relationship between tunicate and vertebrate muscle genes.
during their life cycle, ascidians present three muscle types: striated in larval tail, striated in the heart, and unstriated in the adult body-wall.
we characterised transcripts for troponin t , adult muscle-type  and cytoplasmic-type  actins, followed by in situ hybridisation  on sections to establish the spatio-temporal expression of bstnt-c and bsma <dig> during asexual reproduction and in the larva.
integration of data from ish, phalloidin staining and tem allowed us to follow the phases of differentiation of the three muscle kinds, which differ in expression pattern of the two transcripts.
in the colonial ascidian botryllus schlosseri, we investigated organisation, differentiation and gene expression of muscle beginning from early buds to adults and during zooid regression.
they possess a chordate-like swimming larva, which metamorphoses into a sessile adult.
several ascidian species form colonies of clonal individuals by asexual reproduction.
