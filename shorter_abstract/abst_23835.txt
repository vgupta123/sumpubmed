senegalese sole  is a commercially important flatfish in which no keratin gene has been described yet.
the development of large-scale genomics of senegalese sole has facilitated the identification of two different type i keratin genes referred to as sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  main characteristics and sequence identities with other fish and mammal keratins are described.
in contrast, sseker <dig> mrna levels did not change during early metamorphosis although a significant drop at metamorphosis climax and late metamorphosis was also detected.
the co-regulation by ths could explain the reduction of both keratin transcripts after the metamorphosis climax, suggesting their role in the tissue remodelling processes that occur during metamorphosis.
keratins make up the largest subgroup of intermediate filaments, and, in chordates, represent the most abundant proteins in epithelial cells.
the expression profile of both genes was studied during larval development and in tissues using a real-time approach.
although they exhibit different expression patterns during larval development, both of them are negatively regulated by ths.
to study the possible regulation of sseker gene expressions by thyroid hormones , larvae were exposed to the goitrogen thiourea .
we have identified two keratin genes, referred to as sseker <dig> and sseker <dig>  in senegalese sole.
phylogenetic analyses grouped sseker <dig> and sseker <dig> in a significant clade with other teleost epidermal type i keratins, and have allowed for the identification of sseker <dig> as a novel keratin.
phylogenetic analyses revealed sseker <dig> as a novel keratin.
they have been associated with a wide range of functions in the cell, but little information is still available about their expression profile and regulation during flatfish metamorphosis.
