subcellular localization uncovered the nuclear and cytosol localization of ctf3h in onion epidermal cells.
bioinformation analysis showed that ctf3h shared high conserved residues and confidence with f3h from other plants.
our results showed that the high expression of ctf3h in quinochalcone-type safflower line was associated with the accumulation of both quinochalcones and flavonols, whereas its low expression did not affect the increased accumulation of glycosylated derivatives  in flavonols-typed safflower line but affect the upstream precursors , which partly revealed the function of ctf3h in different phenotypes and chemotypes of safflower lines.
furthermore, the transcriptome expression of ctf3h showed a diametrically opposed expression pattern in a quinochalcone-type safflower line  and a flavonol-type safflower line  under external stimulation by methyl jasmonate , which has been identified as an elicitor of flavonoid metabolites.
further metabolite analysis showed the increasing tendency of quinochalcones and flavonols, such as hydroxysafflor yellow a, kaempferol-3-o-β-d-glucoside, kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside, rutin, carthamin, and luteolin, in the quinochalcone-type safflower line.
also, the accumulation of kaempferol-3-o-β-rutinoside and kaempferol-3-o-β-d-glucoside in flavonols-typed safflower line showed enhanced accumulation pattern after meja treatment.
however, other flavonols, such as kaempferol, dihydrokaempferol and quercetin-3-o-β-d-glucoside, in flavonols-typed safflower line presented down accumulation respond to meja stimulus.
in this study, we first cloned and investigated the participation of a presumed flavanone 3-hydroxylase gene  from safflower  in a flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.
