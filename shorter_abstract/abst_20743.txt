using high stringent cutoffs, we find that figla functions as a key regulatory molecule in coordinating expression of the nalp family of genes, genes of known oocyte-specific expression and a set of functionally un-annotated genes.
taking advantage of figla null mouse lines, we have used a combined approach of microarray and serial analysis of gene expression  to identify potential downstream target genes.
we have identified a germ-cell specific, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, figla  and demonstrated its involvement in two independent developmental processes: formation of the primordial follicle and coordinate expression of zona pellucida genes.
figla also inhibits expression of male germ cell specific genes that might otherwise disrupt normal oogenesis.
carefully orchestrated expression of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules and growth factors are required for success.
