results also show that swap-assembler can generate high quality contigs with good n <dig> size and low error rate, especially it generated the longest n <dig> contig sizes for fish and yanhuang datasets.
in the paper, a mathematical description of multi-step bi-directed graph  is provided to resolve the computational interdependence on merging edges, and a highly scalable computational framework for swap is developed to automatically preform the parallel computation of all operations.
experimental results show that swap-assembler scales up to  <dig> cores on yanhuang dataset using only  <dig> minutes, which is better than several other parallel assemblers, such as abyss, ray, and pasha.
traditional assembly methods requiring long execution time and large amount of memory on a single workstation limit their use on these massive data.
