with higher per-atom asa, the chemical shift values also tend towards random coil values.
the per-atom asa, although not the determinant of the chemical shift, thus provides a way to directly correlate chemical shift information to the atomic coordinates.
atoms with zero per-atom asa have a significantly larger chemical shift dispersion and often have a different chemical shift distribution compared to those that are solvent accessible.
chemical shifts obtained from nmr experiments are an important tool in determining secondary, even tertiary, protein structure.
we here describe the analysis of a consistent set of chemical shift and coordinate data, in which we focus on the relationship between the per-atom solvent accessible surface area  in the reported coordinates and their reported chemical shift value.
the data is available online on .
