post-operative peritoneal adhesions are common and serious complications for modern medicine.
in addition, the pece hydrogel could be easily adhered to the damaged peritoneal surfaces, and be gradually degraded and absorbed by the body within  <dig> days along with the healing of peritoneal wounds.
in this work, we investigated the effect of pece hydrogel on preventing post-surgical abdominal adhesions in mouse and rat models.
our results suggested that the thermosensitive pece hydrogel was an effective, safe, and convenient agent on preventing post-surgical intro-abdominal adhesions.
a notable efficacy of the pece hydrogel in preventing peritoneal adhesions was demonstrated in the animal models.
the pece hydrogel in sol state could be transformed into gel in less than  <dig> s at 37Â°c.
