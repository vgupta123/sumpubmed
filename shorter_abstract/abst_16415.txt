we speculate that the absence of the exosporium in the b. subtilis spore coat effectively lifted a structural constraint that has led to relaxed negative selection pressure on the outer coat.
coat proteins comprising the b. subtilis inner coat are significantly more conserved than those comprising the outer coat.
we then performed genome-wide comparisons of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio, dn/ds, and found contrasting patterns: coat proteins have significantly higher dn/ds in the b. subtilis-group genomes, but not in the b. cereus-group genomes.
coat proteins in the b. subtilis- and b. cereus-group species are under contrasting selective pressures.
we further corroborated this contrast by examining changes of dn/ds within gene trees, and found that some coat protein gene trees have significantly different dn/ds between the b subtilis-clade and the b. cereus-clade.
phylogenetic profiles of these coat proteins show that they can be divided into conserved and labile ones.
spores in the b. cereus-group contain an additional outer layer, the exosporium, which encircles the coat.
the coat in b. subtilis spores possesses inner and outer layers.
we curated a list of b. subtilis coat proteins and identified their orthologs in  <dig> bacillus species based on phylogenetic congruence.
the aim of this study is to investigate whether differences in the spore structures influenced the divergence of the coat protein genes during the evolution of these two bacillus species groups.
we designed and implemented a computational framework to compare the evolutionary histories of coat proteins.
