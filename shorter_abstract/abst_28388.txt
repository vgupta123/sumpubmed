in c. elegans we have identified a subset of large satellites that have strong affinity for the centromere protein cenp-a.
other satellite families in c. elegans are either related to helitron transposons or to meiotic pairing centers.
finally we compare the consensus sequence of satellite families in different species.
we have also identified satellite families with a related sequence and compare them in different species.
we take advantage of the previously developed satfind program to study the satellites in four caenorhabditis species and investigate these questions.
first we find all the satellites present in each species with the satfind program.
satellite families are defined by a consensus sequence and the number of satellites in the family.
most satellite families found in caenorhabditis are species-specific; in particular those with long repeats.
we have also compared our results with those obtained from other species, including one nematode and three mammals.
the high density of tandem repeat sequences  in nematode genomes and the availability of genome sequences from several species in the group offer a unique opportunity to better understand the evolutionary dynamics and the functional role of these sequences.

it appears that in many cases they have undergone an explosive expansion.
we give a catalog of individual satellites in each species.
in the second step we build satellite families with a newly developed alignment program.
each satellite is defined by its length, number of repeats, and repeat sequence.
