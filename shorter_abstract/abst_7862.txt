in addition, rt-qpcr experiments with the other main clock genes showed that pdp <dig>  antagonist of vrille in the modulatory feedback loop of the circadian clock, showed higher expression levels in the rice-strain than in the corn-strain.
very little is known on how changes in circadian rhythms evolve.
we investigated the genetic basis of the strain-specific timing differences to identify the molecular mechanisms of differentiation in circadian rhythms.
the noctuid moth spodoptera frugiperda  consists of two strains that exhibit allochronic differentiation in their mating time, which acts as a premating isolation barrier between the strains.
together, our results indicate that the allochronic differentiation in the two strains of s. frugiperda is associated with differential transcription of vrille or a cis-acting gene close to vrille, which contributes to the evolution of prezygotic isolation in s. frugiperda.
in s. frugiperda, vrille showed strain-specific polymorphisms.
through qtl analyses we identified one major quantitative trait chromosome  underlying differentiation in circadian timing of mating activity.
using radtags, we identified this qtc to be homologous to bombyx mori c <dig>  on which the clock gene vrille is located, which thus became the major candidate gene.
also, vrille expression differed significantly between the strains, with the rice-strain showing higher expression levels than the corn-strain.
