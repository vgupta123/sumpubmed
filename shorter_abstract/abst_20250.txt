these results provide fundamental data to analyze cirk <dig> transcriptional mechanisms.
the chick inward rectifier k+ channel cirk1/kir <dig>  is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, but not in liver; a distribution similar but not identical to that of mouse kir <dig> .
the control elements identified here may provide clues to the tissue-specific expression of this k+ channel.
inward rectifier potassium channels  contribute to the normal function of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.
however, while the chicken and mouse promoter regions share many regulatory motifs, cirk <dig> possesses a gc-richer promoter and a putative tata box, which appears to positively regulate gene expression.
while multiple transcription initiation sites and the combinatorial function of several domains in activating cirk <dig> expression are similar to those seen in mkir <dig> , the cirk <dig> promoter differs by the presence of a putative tata box.
cirk <dig> has multiple transcription initiation sites, a feature also seen in mouse.
we report here the identification of several candidate cell/tissue specific cirk <dig> regulatory domains by comparing promoter activities in expressing  and non-expressing  cells using in vitro transcription assays.
