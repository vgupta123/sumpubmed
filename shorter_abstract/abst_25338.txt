the results highlight differences in nuclear organization between the two parental inherited genomes at the 1-cell stage, i.e.
we used computational imaging to quantify various nuclear parameters in the 3d-fish images, to analyze the organization of compartments of interest, and to measure physical distances between these compartments.
early embryonic development thus offers a particularly interesting system in which to analyze functional nuclear organization.
however, most existing analyses have been conducted by visual observation of fluorescent images, in two dimensions or on z-stack sections/projections, but only rarely in three dimensions .
embryonic development proceeds through finely tuned reprogramming of the parental genomes to form a totipotent embryo.
when the organization of higher-order chromatin structures, such as pericentromeric heterochromatin, was first analyzed in mouse embryos, specific nuclear rearrangements were observed that correlated with embryonic genome activation at the 2-cell stage.
in the present study, we used dna fluorescent in situ hybridization  to localize centromeric , pericentromeric , and telomeric genomic sequences throughout the preimplantation period in naturally fertilized mouse embryos .
we also found that the reprogramming of the embryonic genome, which starts at the 2-cell stage, undergoes other remarkable changes during preimplantation development, particularly at the 4-cell stage.
their distribution was then analyzed in 3d on confocal image stacks, focusing on the nucleolar precursor bodies and nucleoli known to evolve rapidly throughout the first developmental stages.
