we then conducted target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis with these mirs to investigate potential associated gene and pathway targets.
in the current study, we applied analytical and bioinformatics approaches to identify a set of micrornas  from several different human glioblastoma cell lines that exhibit significant differential expression between migratory  and migration-restricted  cell populations.
the verification of these mirs and their associated targeted proteins provides new insights for further investigation into therapeutic interventions.
the methodological approaches employed here could be applied to the study of other diseases to provide biomedical researchers and clinicians with increased opportunities for therapeutic interventions.
the results of this study identify a set of mirs with potential for decreased expression in invasive glioblastoma cells.
we identified  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated mirs that exhibit significant differential expression in the migratory  cell population compared to matched migration-restricted  cells.
invasion precludes effective treatment and virtually assures tumor recurrence.
the hypothesis of the study is that differential expression of mirs provides an epigenetic mechanism to drive cell migration and invasion.
several mirs in the list appear to directly target apoptosis related genes.
