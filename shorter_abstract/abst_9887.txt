here, we described the structure, the complete genome sequence, and the phylogenetic relationships of the first sphingid-infecting betabaculovirus.
cassava  is the basic source for dietary energy of  <dig> million people in the world.
we did not find typical homologous regions and cathepsin and chitinase homologous genes are lacked.
importantly, recombination events between insect viruses from unrelated families and genera might drive baculovirus genomic evolution.
the erelgv represents a new virus species from the genus betabaculovirus and is the closest relative of chocgv.
it contains a dutpase-like, a he65-like, p43-like genes, which are also found in several other alpha- and betabaculovirus genomes, and two densovirus-related genes.
erelgv is closely related to chocgv and piragv isolates.
