furthermore, many markers have been mapped in different populations such that their genetic positions are inconsistent.
development of molecular markers such as ssr , dart  and snp  is fundamental for linkage map construction and qtl mapping.
high-density indel markers with specific genome locations were developed, with  <dig> molecular markers  integrated into single barley genetic map.
high-resolution melting  technology was used to genotype  <dig> indel markers; those pcr amplicons with melting temperature differences > <dig>  °c were ideal for hrm genotyping.
aligning genomic dna sequences in two barley cultivars  identified  <dig>  indels.
recently, indel  markers have become popular in genetic map construction and map-based cloning.
we designed  <dig> indel markers across the barley genome with an average genetic distance of 1 cm, each having a unique location in the barley genome.
the  <dig> indel markers together with  <dig> ssrs,  <dig> gene-based snps and  <dig> dart markers were integrated into single barley genetic map according to their physical map positions.
hrm genotyping of the indel markers each with single pcr band will facilitate quick map construction and gene fine-mapping.
