this requires flexible, modular toolkits that can represent, manipulate and persist phylogenetic data and metadata as objects with programmable interfaces.
it supports commonly used file formats for phylogenetic data including the novel nexml standard, which allows rich annotations of phylogenetic data to be stored and shared.
it implements classes and methods that are compatible with the well-known bioperl toolkit, but is independent from it  and features a richer api and a data model that is better able to manage the complex relationships between different fundamental data and metadata objects in phylogenetics.
this paper presents bio::phylo, a perl <dig> toolkit for phyloinformatic analysis.
bio::phylo can interact with bioperl, thereby giving access to the file formats that bioperl supports.
