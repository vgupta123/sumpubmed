clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is responsible for c. difficile associated disease in humans and is currently the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in the western world.
our array was comprehensive with  <dig>  oligonucleotides covering the c. difficile  <dig> genome and revealed a core genome for all the strains of 32%.
the array also covered genes unique to two pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, relative to c. difficile  <dig> which were represented by  <dig> probes.
further to this we have defined a list of genes absent from non-toxinogenic strains and defined the nature of the specific toxin deletion in the strain cd <dig>
we have also extended this study and have defined a more stringent core gene set compared to those previously published due to the comprehensive array coverage.
the aim of this work was to identify regions of sequence divergence that may be used as genetic markers of hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains and markers of the sequenced strain, cd <dig> by array comparative hybridisation.
we have fulfilled the aims of this study by identifying markers for cd <dig> and markers associated with hypervirulence, albeit genes that are not just indicative of pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains.
