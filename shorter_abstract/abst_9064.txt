the present study compared the ability to select for resistance of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin at concentrations observed in vivo in twenty strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp.
e. coli resistant strains selected after multi-step selection were characterized for dna mutations by sequencing gyra, gyrb, parc and pare genes.
both ciprofloxacin- and prulifloxacin-resistant mutants presented mutations in gyra and parc, while levofloxacin resistance was found associated only to mutations in gyra.
frequencies of mutations for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were less than 10- <dig> at peak concentration, while for prulifloxacin they ranged from <10- <dig> to 10- <dig>  the lowest number of resistant mutants after multistep selection was selected by levofloxacin followed by ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin.
fluoroquinolones are potent antimicrobial agents used for the treatment of a wide variety of community- and nosocomial- infections.
studies assessing the ability of fluoroquinolones to select for resistance have often used antimicrobial concentrations quite different from those actually acquired at the site of infection.
multi-step selection of resistance was evaluated by performing  <dig> serial cultures on agar plates containing a linear gradient from trough to peak antimicrobial concentrations, followed by  <dig> subcultures on antibiotic-free agar.
