it is also capable of batch processing and can be easily integrated in high throughput environments.
we present wiff2dta, a tool created to convert ms/ms data obtained using applied biosystem's qstar and qtrap  <dig> and  <dig> series.
wiff2dta offers the possibility to run as stand-alone application or within a batch process as command-line tool integrated in automation and high-throughput environments.
mass spectrometry based proteomics result in huge amounts of data that has to be processed in real time in order to efficiently feed identification algorithms and to easily integrate in automated environments.
