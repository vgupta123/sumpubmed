the positive clones could be easily screened under uv light.
rna interference  has become a powerful means for silencing target gene expression in mammalian cells and is envisioned to be useful in therapeutic approaches to human disease.
current methods for constructing sirna/mirna expression vectors require the synthesis of long oligonucleotides, which is costly and suffers from mutation problems.
here we report an ingenious method to solve traditional problems associated with construction of sirna/mirna expression vectors.
using this method we successfully constructed over  <dig> functional sirna/mirna expression vectors.
the pcr products were directly transformed into chemically competent e. coli and converted to functional vectors in vivo via homologous recombination.
this novel, convenient, low-cost and highly efficient approach may be useful for high-throughput assays of rnai libraries.
in recent years, high-throughput, genome-wide screening of sirna/mirna libraries has emerged as a desirable approach.
