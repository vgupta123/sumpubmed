within the optimal thresholds for each program, plink outperformed germline and beagle in detecting autozygosity from distant common ancestors.
our results provide both general and specific recommendations for maximizing autozygosity detection in genome-wide snp data, and should apply equally well to research on whole-genome autozygosity burden or to research on whether specific autozygous regions are predictive using association mapping methods.
we simulated  <dig> mb of sequence data in order to know the true state of autozygosity.
we then extracted common variants from this sequence to mimic the properties of snp platforms and performed roh analyses using three popular roh detection programs, plink, germline, and beagle.
a central aim for studying runs of homozygosity  in genome-wide snp data is to detect the effects of autozygosity  on phenotypes.
plink's sliding window algorithm worked best when using snp data pruned for linkage disequilibrium .
