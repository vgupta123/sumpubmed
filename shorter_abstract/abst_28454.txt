nevertheless, the t. vaginalis genome contains some  <dig> putative sucrose transporters and a putative β-fructofuranosidase .
therefore, the inability of the organism to utilize sucrose as a carbon source cannot be explained by an inability to degrade sucrose.
the enzyme exhibited maximum activity at ph close to  <dig> , with activity falling off rapidly at increased or decreased ph.
trichomonas vaginalis, a flagellated protozoan, is the agent responsible for trichomoniasis, the most common nonviral sexually transmitted infection worldwide.
t. vaginalis has the coding capacity to produce an active β-fructofuranosidase capable of hydrolyzing di- and trisaccharides containing a terminal, non-reducing fructose residue.
however, t. vaginalis is disproportionality under studied, especially considering its basic metabolism.
it has been reported that t. vaginalis does not grow on sucrose.
we amplified the β-fructofuranosidase from t. vaginalis cdna and cloned it into an escherichia coli expression system.
furthermore, we could detect β-fructofuranosidase activity in t. vaginalis cell lysates.
it had a similar km and vmax to previously characterized enzymes using sucrose as a substrate, was also active towards raffinose, but had no detectable activity towards inulin.
