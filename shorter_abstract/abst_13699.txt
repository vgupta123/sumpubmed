a similar phylogeographic distribution pattern was also observed for haplogroup f1c, thus substantiating our proposition.
this inland post-glacial dispersal was in agreement with the spread of the mesolithic culture originating in south china and northern vietnam.
it was this dispersal that expanded not only to western china but also to northeast india and the south himalaya region.
our results indicated that southern china and/or southeast asia likely served as the source of some post-last glacial maximum dispersal.
the detailed dissection of haplogroup m9a'b revealed the existence of an inland dispersal in mainland east asia during the post-glacial period.
archaeological studies have revealed a series of cultural changes around the last glacial maximum in east asia; whether these changes left any signatures in the gene pool of east asians remains poorly indicated.
to achieve deeper insights into the demographic history of modern humans in east asia around the last glacial maximum, we extensively analyzed mitochondrial dna haplogroup m9a'b, a specific haplogroup that was suggested to have some potential for tracing the migration around the last glacial maximum in east eurasia.
based on the updated phylogeny, an extensive phylogeographic analysis was carried out to reveal the differentiation of haplogroup m9a'b and to reconstruct the dispersal histories.
