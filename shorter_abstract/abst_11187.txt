differentially expressed mouse genes were related to humoral immune response, complement activation, or cell-cell interactions.
in comparisons of susceptible versus resistant animals, both host and parasite display distinct, organ-specific transcriptional profiles.
analysis of expression data from brain, lung, liver, and spleen of pba infected mice showed that both host and parasite gene expression can be examined using a single microarray, and parasite transcripts can be detected within whole organs at a time when peripheral blood parasitemia is low.
the development and outcome of cerebral malaria  reflects a complex interplay between parasite-expressed virulence factors and host response to infection.
parasites display a unique transcriptional signature in each tissue, and lung appears to be a large reservoir for metabolically active parasites.
pba displayed differential expression of genes related to biosynthetic activities.
