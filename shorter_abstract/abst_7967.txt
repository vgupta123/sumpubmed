several cases of legionellosis have been diagnosed in the same french thermal spa in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  l. pneumophila serogroup  <dig>  strains have been isolated from several patients, but the source of contamination was not identified despite the presence of different lp <dig> in water samples of the three natural springs feeding the spa at this period.
surprisingly, lp <dig> and lp <dig> were not reported in the previous described studies from water samples.
besides, the new seven lp <dig> we isolated exhibit a high molecular diversity and have been differentiated in five classes according to their dna genome patterns obtained by pfge and mip sequences.
our strategy was to investigate l. pneumophila  strains from natural biofilms developed in a sulphur-rich warm spring of this contaminated site.
interestingly, the  <dig> lp environmental strains we isolated display a higher cytotoxicity and virulence towards the amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii than those of known lp <dig> epidemic strains.
