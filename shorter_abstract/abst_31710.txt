for both the oral and iv route of administration two groups of dogs to be identified namely poor metabolizers  and extensive metabolizers .the terminal half-life after oral administration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h for the pm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h for the em groups, with the corresponding values after the iv route being  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h .
cimicoxib was an efficacious anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic drug and a dosage regimen of  <dig> mg/kg daily was determined for confirmatory clinical trials.
thus pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from the em beagle dogs were selected to simulate the dose-effect relationship of cimicoxib after an oral administration allowing a dosage regimen to be selected for confirmation by a clinical trial.
the cimicoxib half-lives in these  <dig> dogs were of same order of the magnitude as those of the em beagle dogs.
the plasma concentration corresponding to half the maximum of the indirect effect were  <dig> μg/l for creeping speed,  <dig> μg/l for the lameness score,  <dig> μg/l for the ground reaction vertical force and  <dig> μg/l for the body temperature.
to determine a preclinical dosage regimen for cimicoxib in dog, a reversible model of kaolin–induced paw inflammation was used.
dosage regimens were established using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  modeling approach .
to document possible polymorphism of the cimicoxib disposition in the target dog population, cimicoxib was administered by the intravenous route to  <dig> dogs .
