upon inactivation of atpht1; <dig>  changes in the transcript profiles of several genes that respond to plant phosphorus  status indicated a possible role in the regulation of systemic signaling of p status within the plant.
pi uptake and tissue accumulation studies in atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> knock-out mutants compared to wild-type plants showed that both transporters are involved in the translocation of pi from the root to the shoot.
while atpht1; <dig> to atpht1; <dig> are involved in pi acquisition from the rhizosphere, the role of the remaining transporters is less clear.
atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> are likely to act sequentially in the interior of the plant during the root-to-shoot translocation of pi, and play a more complex role in the acclimation of a. thaliana to changes in pi supply than was previously thought.
these results indicate that atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> translocate pi from the root to the shoot, but not from the soil solution into the root.
potential genetic interactions were found among pht <dig> transporters, as the transcript profile of atpht1; <dig> and atpht1; <dig> was altered in the absence of atpht1; <dig>  and the transcript profile of atpht1; <dig> was altered in the atpht1; <dig> mutant.
