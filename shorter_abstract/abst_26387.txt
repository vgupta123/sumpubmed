gp <dig> was enriched from tissue culture cells by subcellular fractionation and immunoaffinity chromatography.
our approach exemplifies how membrane proteins can be identified from species with unsequenced genomes by homology based proteomics.
mdck cells derived from canine kidney are an important experimental model system for investigating epithelial polarity in mammalian cells.
monoclonal antibodies against apical gp <dig> and basolateral p <dig> have served as important tools in these studies.
the identification was based on tandem mass spectrometry and homology based proteomics.
the identification as a member of the canine ceacam family will enable synergy between the fields of epithelial cell biology and other research areas.
however, the molecular identity of these membrane glycoproteins has not been known.
