previously, we identified the msa gene as a regulator of several virulence genes, biofilm development, and antibiotic resistance.
these findings allow us to define a new operon that regulates fundamental phenotypes in s. aureus such as biofilm development and virulence.
s. aureus possesses a wide variety of virulence factors, the expression of which is carefully coordinated by a variety of regulators.
we showed that msac is part of a newly defined four-gene operon , in which msac is a non-protein-coding rna that is essential for the function of the operon.
to investigate the mechanism of regulation of the msa gene , we examined the upstream genes whose expression was affected by its deletion.
furthermore, we found that an antisense rna  is complementary to the 5â€² end of the msab gene and is expressed in a growth phase-dependent manner suggesting that it is involved in regulation of the operon.
characterization of the msaabcr operon will allow us to investigate the mechanism of function of this operon and the role of the individual genes in regulation and interaction with its targets.
this study identifies a new element in the complex regulatory circuits in s. aureus, and our findings may be therapeutically relevant.
we also found evidence of the involvement of upstream genes in msa function.
