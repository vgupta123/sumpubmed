should bse infection have been introduced into the uk deer population, the cwd precedent could suggest that there is a danger for spread and maintenance of the disease in both free living and captive uk deer populations.
the cause of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy  epidemic in the united kingdom  was the inclusion of contaminated meat and bone meal in the protein rations fed to cattle.
after intracerebral or alimentary challenge, bse in red deer more closely resembled natural infection in cattle rather than experimental bse in small ruminants, due to the lack of accumulation of abnormal prp in lymphoid tissues.
this study compares the immunohistochemical and biochemical characteristics of bse and cwd in experimentally-infected european red deer .
red deer are susceptible to both bse and cwd infection, but the resulting disease phenotypes are distinct and clearly distinguishable.
