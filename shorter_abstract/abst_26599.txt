compare with other splice alignment tools like soapsplice and tophat <dig>  hsa has a better performance in call rate and efficiency, but its results do not as accurate as the other software to some extent.
with the high throughput sequencing of rna-seq, we can acquire much more information like differential expression and novel splice variants from deep sequence analysis and data mining.
