using nicotiana benthamiana as a heterologous expression system, we have demonstrated that this enzyme adds a 3-oh to p-coumaroyl ester derivatives but is more efficient to convert p-coumaroyl quinate into chlorogenic acid than to metabolize p-coumaroyl shikimate.
plants exposed to uv-b stress showed an enhanced expression level of the corresponding gene.
the r. graveolens cyp98a <dig> open reading frame and the orthologous arabidopsis thaliana cyp98a <dig> open reading frame were overexpressed in stable transgenic ruta plants.
in this work, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of the first cyp98a encoding gene isolated from r. graveolens.
the overexpression of cyp98a <dig> positively impacts the concentration of furanocoumarins in r. graveolens.
furanocoumarins are members of the phenylpropanoids family, and their biosynthetic pathway is initiated from p-coumaroyl coa.
in furanocoumarin-producing plants, these enzymes catalyze the step directly downstream of the junction with the furanocoumarin biosynthetic pathway and might indirectly impact their synthesis.
furanocoumarins are molecules with proven therapeutic properties and are produced in only a small number of medicinal plant species such as ruta graveolens.
