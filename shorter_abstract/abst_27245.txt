a dual approach was taken to examine the molecular and biochemical processes occurring during the development of appressoria, specialized infection structures by which p. pachyrhizi invades a host plant.
understanding the role that these genes and proteins play in the molecular and biochemical processes in the infection process may provide insight for developing targeted control measures and novel methods of disease management.
genes and proteins identified fell into functional categories of metabolism, cell cycle and dna processing, protein fate, cellular transport, cellular communication and signal transduction, and cell rescue.
suppression subtractive hybridization  was utilized to generate a cdna library enriched for transcripts expressed during appressoria formation.
twenty-nine of the non-redundant ests were found to be specific to the appressoria-enriched cdna library, and did not occur in a previously constructed germinated urediniospore cdna library.
three novel phakopsora genes were identified from the cdna library along with six potentially rust-specific genes.
fifty-nine of these proteins were not previously identified in a partial proteome of p. pachyrhizi germinated urediniospores.
several genes and proteins were identified that are expressed in p. pachyrhizi during appressoria formation.
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy analysis were used to generate a partial proteome of proteins present during appressoria formation.
however, 38% of ests and 24% of proteins matched only to hypothetical proteins of unknown function, or showed no similarity to sequences in the current ncbi database.
protein analysis revealed eight proteins of unknown function, which possessed classic secretion signals.
sequence analysis of  <dig> expressed sequence tags  revealed  <dig> non-redundant ests, of which 53% had putative identities assigned.
phakopsora pachyrhizi is an obligate fungal pathogen causing asian soybean rust .
