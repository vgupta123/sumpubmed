the correlation between adjacent main chain pseudodihedrals has been converted in an additional energetic term which is able to account for cooperative effects in secondary structure elements.
the model and the energy definition proposed have been tested on all the multiple decoys' sets in the decoys'r'us database.
the aim of the present work is to provide a discrete empirical potential for a reduced protein model termed here pc2ca, because it employs a pseudocovalent structure with only  <dig> centers of interactions per amino acid, suitable for protein model quality assessment.
although the usefulness of many such models for structural bioinformatics applications has been demonstrated in recent years, there are few intermediate resolution models endowed with an energy model capable, for instance, of detecting native or native-like structures among decoy sets.
the energetic model is able to recognize, for almost all sets, native-like structures .
these results and those obtained in the blind casp <dig> quality assessment experiment suggest that the model compares well with scoring potentials with finer granularity and could be useful for fast exploration of conformational space.
all protein structures in the set top500h have been converted in reduced form.
local energy surface exploration is performed in order to increase the robustness of the energy function.
