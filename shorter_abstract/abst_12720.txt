also, the presence of p2x <dig> receptor and the transient receptor potential channel, trpv <dig>  another ca2+ permeable channels, was detected in the myotubes expressing mutated dysferlin, and an elevated resting intracellular ca2+ level was found in the latter myotubes, which was in turn reduced to control levels in the presence of the molecule d <dig>  a selective cx hcs inhibitor.
these mutations induce several alterations in skeletal muscles, including, inflammation, increased membrane permeability and cell death.
the data suggests that dysferlin deficiency, caused by mutation or downregulation of dysferlin, promotes the expression of cx hcs.
this response was reproduced in a knock-down model of dysferlin, by treating rcmh cell line with small hairpin rna specific for dysferlin .
the presence of these connexins was also observed in human myotubes derived from immortalized myoblasts derived from other patients with mutated forms of dysferlin.

mutations in the gene encoding for dysferlin cause recessive autosomal muscular dystrophies called dysferlinopathies.
in addition to the aforementioned connexins, these myotubes expressed functional connexin based hemichannels, evaluated by ethidium uptake assays, as opposed to myotubes obtained from a normal human muscle cell line, rcmh.
then, the de novo expression cx hc causes a dysregulation of intracellular free ca2+ levels, which could underlie muscular damage associated to dysferlin mutations.
