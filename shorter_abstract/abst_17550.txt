all known variants in positions covered with at least 30Ã— depth were correctly recognized.
from a large collection of human pcr samples we selected  <dig> pcr products belonging to  <dig> disease genes and including a large spectrum of sequence variations previously identified by sanger sequencing.
blind searching for sequence variations with a specifically designed bioinformatics procedure identified  <dig> putative sequence variants, including  <dig> true variants,  <dig> false positives , no false negatives.
we assessed the ability of massively parallel pyrosequencing to identify sequence variants in pools.
the sequence variants included snps and small deletions and insertions , in homozygous or heterozygous state.
our results encourage further studies to evaluate molecular diagnostics applications.
pyrosequencing generated over  <dig> million base pairs of data.
a new priority in genome research is large-scale resequencing of genes to understand the molecular basis of hereditary disease and cancer.
