we defined absent calls using arabidopsis thaliana negative control probes, with the aim to distinguish between aberrations due to mutations and gene gain/loss.
capsular polysaccharide  of p. gingivalis has been shown to be an important virulence determinant.
a conserved core p. gingivalis genome was described, which consists of 80% of the analyzed genes from the sequenced w <dig> strain.
analyses of the genetic content of the p. gingivalis capsular serotypes allowed the description of a p. gingivalis core genome.
the high resolution data from three types of analysis of triplicate hybridization experiments may explain the higher divergence between p. gingivalis strains than previously recognized.
our analyses allowed us to call aberrant genes, absent genes and divergent regions in each of the test strains.
the percentage of aberrant genes between the test strains and control strain w <dig> was  <dig> % to  <dig> %.
among the aberrant genes many cps biosynthesis genes were found.
here, we used micro-array based comparative genomic hybridization analysis  to analyze a representative of each of the capsular serotypes and a non-encapsulated strain against the highly virulent and sequenced w <dig> strain.
seven capsular serotypes have been described.
most other virulence related genes could be found in the conserved core genome.
comparing highly virulent strains with less virulent strains indicates that hmus, a putative cobn/mg chelatase involved in heme uptake, may be a more relevant virulence determinant than previously expected.
