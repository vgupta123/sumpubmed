recent studies revealed that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine  is dynamically regulated during neurodevelopment and aging.
genome-wide profiling identified differential hydroxymethylation regions  in dtg mice, which are highly enriched in introns, exons and intergenic regions.
in ad, aggregates of amyloid β peptide precede the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, both of which are hallmarks of the disease.
we show that amyloid peptide 1– <dig>  could significantly reduce the overall level of 5hmc in vitro.
we observed a significant decrease of overall 5hmc in hippocampus, but not in cortex and cerebellum, as the dtg mice aged.
strong evidences have indicated the implication of epigenetic modifications, including histone modification and dna methylation, in ad.
5hmc-mediated epigenetic regulation could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of ad.
alzheimer’s disease  is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorder that leads to a decline in cognitive function.
