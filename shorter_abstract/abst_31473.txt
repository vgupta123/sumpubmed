the occurrence of very similar structural motifs brought about by different parts of non homologous proteins is often indicative of a common function.
users can submit a set of protein structures deemed or not to share a common function .
we show here examples of its usefulness by searching for the largest common structural motifs in test sets of non homologous proteins and showing that the identified motifs correspond to a known common functional feature.
here we describe a publicly available tool, able to identify common structural motifs shared by different non homologous proteins in an unsupervised mode.
the output consists of a list of aligned structural matches displayed in both tabular and graphical form.
