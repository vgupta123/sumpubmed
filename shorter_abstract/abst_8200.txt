the ability to rapidly generate such data sets would facilitate the development and comparison of computational methods that predict gene expression patterns from promoter sequence.
we developed a gene expression simulator which generates expression data using user-defined interactions between cis-regulatory sites.
we present several data sets that may be useful for testing new methodologies for predicting gene expression from promoter sequence.
we developed a flexible gene expression simulator that rapidly generates large numbers of simulated promoters and their corresponding transcriptional output based on specified interactions between cis-regulatory sites.
we anticipate that using simulated gene expression data sets will facilitate the direct comparison of computational strategies to predict gene expression from promoter sequence.
the development of computational methods to decode the interactions among cis-regulatory elements has been slow, in part, because it is difficult to know, without extensive experimental validation, whether a particular method identifies the correct cis-regulatory interactions that underlie a given set of expression data.
constraints on the spacing, distance, and orientation of regulatory elements and their interactions may also be defined and gaussian noise can be added to the expression values.
we found good agreement between sets of simulated promoters and predicted regulatory modules from real expression data.
there is an urgent need for test expression data in which the interactions among cis-regulatory sites that produce the data are known.
the simulator can incorporate additive, cooperative, competitive, and synergistic interactions between regulatory elements.
