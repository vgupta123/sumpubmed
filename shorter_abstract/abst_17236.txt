the surface concentration of the binding domains adsorbed on cellulose fibres was determined by fluorescence image analysis.
for a saturating cbd concentration, using whatman cf <dig> fibres, a surface concentration of  <dig>  Ã— 10- <dig> mol/mm <dig> was estimated, the equivalent to  <dig> protein monolayers.
the surface concentration of adsorbed cbds was greater on amorphous fibres  than on more crystalline ones .
cellulose binding domains  were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate .
for a cbd-fitc concentration of  <dig> mg/l, a coating fraction of 78% and 110% was estimated for portucel and whatman fibres, respectively.
it was verified that cbds were able to penetrate the fibres, according to confocal microscopy and tem-immunolabelling analysis.
