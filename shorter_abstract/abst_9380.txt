we expressed the globins in a bacterial system, characterized the purified proteins by optical and resonance raman spectroscopy, measured the kinetics and equilibria of o <dig> binding and determined the crystal structure of glb-1* .
within the heme pocket the dioxygen molecule is stabilized by a hydrogen bonded network including tyrb <dig> and glne <dig> glb- <dig> exhibits high ligand affinity, which is, however, lower than in other globins with the same distal tyrb10-glne <dig> amino-acid pair.
although their translated amino acid sequences fit the globin fold, a variety of amino-acid substitutions and extensions generate a wide structural diversity among the putative globins.
furthermore, we studied the expression patterns of glb- <dig>  and glb- <dig>  in the worms using green fluorescent protein technology and measured alterations of their transcript abundances under hypoxic conditions.glb-1* displays the classical three-over-three Î±-helical sandwich of vertebrate globins, assembled in a homodimer associated through facing e- and f-helices.
