with  <dig> texture features alone and a neural network classifier, we obtained an increase in accuracy on the 2d hela data set to  <dig> %.
we demonstrate that the space-frequency localized information in the multiresolution subspaces adds significantly to the discriminative power of the system.
fluorescence microscopy is widely used to determine the subcellular location of proteins.
moreover, we show that a vastly reduced set of features is sufficient, consisting of our novel modified haralick texture features.
over the past ten years, the feasibility of using machine learning methods to recognize all major subcellular location patterns has been convincingly demonstrated, using diverse feature sets and classifiers.
we report here a novel approach for the classification of subcellular location patterns by classifying in multiresolution subspaces.
