the software is currently in use on at least five public databases for the typing of neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni and streptococcus equi and can be set up to query internal isolate tables or suitably-configured external isolate databases, such as those used for multilocus sequence typing.
here we describe agdbnet, widely applicable web database software that facilitates simultaneous blast querying of multiple loci using either nucleotide or peptide sequences.
each database can have any number of loci, which may be defined by nucleotide and/or peptide sequences.
