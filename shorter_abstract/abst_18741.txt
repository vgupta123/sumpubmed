the genomic taxonomy analysis, including multilocus sequence analysis, average amino acid identity, and genome-to-genome distance revealed that the three novel strains belong to a new salinivibrio species.
we obtained three novel conspecific salinivibrio strains closely related to s. costicola, from socompa lake, a high altitude hypersaline andean lake .
arsenic resistance genes, genes involved in dna repair, resistance to extreme environmental conditions and the possible light-based energy production, may represent important attributes of the novel salinivibrios, allowing these microbes to thrive in the socompa lake.
were extremely resistant to arsenic , nacl , and uv-b radiation  by means of phenotypic tests.
salinivibrios are moderately halophilic bacteria found in salted meats, brines and hypersaline environments.
