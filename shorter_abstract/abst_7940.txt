these results are accessible via web for the community of researchers.
taking advantage of digital gene expression  sequencing technology we compare all the available transcriptomes for s. mediterranea and improve their annotation.
the application of dge in s. mediterranea confirms the planarian stem cells or neoblasts as a complex population of pluripotent and multipotent cells regulated by a mixture of transcription factors and cancer-related genes.
using the quantitative nature of dge, we describe the transcriptional profile of neoblasts and present  <dig> new neoblast genes, including several cancer-related genes and transcription factors.
the freshwater planarian schmidtea mediterranea is recognised as a valuable model for research into adult stem cells and regeneration.
