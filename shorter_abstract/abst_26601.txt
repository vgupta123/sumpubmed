using both simulation data and soybean nutritional seed composition studies on oil content and protein content, bhit effectively detected some high-order interactions associated with phenotypes, and it outperformed a number of other available tools.
bhit first builds a bayesian model on both continuous data and discrete data, which is capable of detecting high-order interactions in snps related to caseâ€”control or quantitative phenotypes.
epistasis , including high-order interaction among more than two genes, often plays important roles in complex traits and diseases, but current gwas analysis usually just focuses on additive effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms .
we have developed a novel bayesian computational method with a markov chain monte carlo  search, and implemented the method as a bayesian high-order interaction toolkit  for detecting epistatic interactions among snps.
genome wide association study  provides a powerful tool for characterizing the genotype-phenotype relationships in complex traits and diseases.
