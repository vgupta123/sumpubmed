aggressive animals have advantages, such as better access to food or territories, and they produce more offspring than low ranking animals.
the social hierarchy in chickens is measured using the 'pecking order' concept, which counts the number of aggressive pecks given and received.
following confirmation, the identification of differentially expressed genes may elucidate how the pecking order forms in laying hens at a molecular level.
in comparing the r and p groups, we observed that there were  <dig> differentially expressed genes .
these genes code for synaptosomes , and proteins involved in the regulation of the excitatory postsynaptic membrane potential , the regulation of the membrane potential , and glutamate receptor binding .
in conclusion, our study provides new insights into which genes are involved in aggressive behaviours in chickens.
aggressive behaviour is an important aspect in the daily lives of animals living in groups.
it was not fully clear how the  <dig> genes regulated aggressive behaviour; however, gene set analysis detected a number of go identifiers, which were potentially involved in aggressive behavioural processes.
