the comparison of the g. lamblia cyst and trophozoite transcriptome showed that transcripts of most genes are present at a lower level in cysts.
this global view of the cyst and trophozoite transcriptome complements studies focused on the expression of selected genes during trophozoite multiplication, encystation and excystation.
genes encoding proteins related to ribosomal functions are highly over-represented.
to investigate the magnitude of the transcriptional changes occurring during the g. lamblia life cycle we compared the transcriptome of g. lamblia trophozoites and cysts using single-color oligonucleotide microarrays.
the striking morphological differences between the dormant cyst and the rapidly dividing and motile trophozoite implies profound changes in the metabolism as the parasite encysts in the host's intestine and excysts upon ingestion by a new host.
compared with many protists, giardia lamblia has a simple life cycle alternating between cyst and trophozoite.
