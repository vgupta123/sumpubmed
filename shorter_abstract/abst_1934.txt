the combined  phylogenetic analysis provides a modified view of annelid evolution, with several higher-level taxa, i.e.
the position of the remaining annelid groups is uncertain â€“ the most problematic taxa are the opheliidae-scalibregmatidae clade, the amphinomida-aberranta clade, apistobranchus, chaetopteridae, myzostomida, the sipunculida-dinophilidae clade, and the "core archiannelida" .
two unorthodox clades, the "core archiannelida" and sipunculida-dinophilidae, are proposed.
the analysis of the combined dataset yields the following scheme of relationships: phyllodocida and eunicida are monophyletic groups, together probably forming monophyletic aciculata .
the clitellata and "clitellate-like polychaetes"  form a monophyletic group.
phyllodocida, eunicida, orbinioid-parergodrilid clade , cirratuliformia, sabelloid-spionoid clade , terebelloid-capitelloid clade , and "clitellatomorpha".
although the deep-level evolutionary relationships of annelida remain poorly understood, we propose the monophyly of the aciculata, sister-group relationships between the eunicida and opc, between the cirratuliformia and ssc, and possibly also between the "clitellatomorpha" and oweniidae-pogonophora clades.
the traditional "scolecida" and "canalipalpata" are both polyphyletic, forming instead two clades: one including cirratuliformia and the "sabelloid-spionoid clade" , the other  including terebelliformia, arenicolidae-maldanidae, and capitellidae-echiurida.
no attempt has yet been made to analyse simultaneously morphological and molecular information concerning the annelida as a whole.
sthe "total-evidence" analyses combining morphological and molecular characters have been published for a few annelid taxa.
