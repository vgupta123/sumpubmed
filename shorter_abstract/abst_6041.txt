to determine the regions of the mammalian genome responsible for natural variations in cortical volume, we conducted a complex trait analysis using  <dig> strains of recombinant inbred  strains of mice , as well as their two parental strains .
we located genomic regions in which a linkage disequilibrium was present using webqtl as both a mapping engine and genomic database.
an analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in these regions indicated that ciliary neurotrophic factor  is quite possibly the gene underlying the noncortical qtl.
for neocortex, we found a genome-wide significant quantitative trait locus  on chromosome  <dig> , as well as a suggestive qtl on chromosome  <dig> .
marker regression and interval mapping were computed using webqtl.
we measured both neocortical volume and total brain volume in  <dig> coronally sectioned mouse brains that were nissl stained and embedded in celloidin.
evidence for a candidate gene modulating neocortical volume was much weaker, but otx <dig> deserves further consideration.
after correction for shrinkage, the measured cortical and noncortical brain volumes were entered into a multiple regression analysis, which removed the effects of body size and age from the measurements.
this classic pattern of double dissociation argues strongly for different genetic factors regulating relative cortical size, as opposed to brain volume more generally.
