to gain further insight into the underlying mechanism subcellular trafficking of s100a <dig> in response to dna damage was analyzed.
we show that dna damage induces a nucleolin-mediated translocation of s100a <dig> from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.
these observations suggest that regulation of the subcellular distribution of s100a <dig> plays an important role in the dna damage response and p21-mediated cell cycle control.
previously, we have shown that s100a <dig> is directly involved in dna repair processes at damaged chromatin in the nucleus.
