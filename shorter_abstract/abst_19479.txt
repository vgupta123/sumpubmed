herein, we comprehensively evaluate twenty-one commercially available antibodies to the lrrk <dig> protein using mouse lrrk <dig> and human lrrk <dig> expression vectors, wild-type and lrrk2-null mouse brain lysates and human brain lysates.
despite previously published results, commercially available antibodies generally fail to recognize endogenous mouse lrrk <dig> protein; however, several antibodies retain the ability to detect over-expressed mouse lrrk <dig> protein.
over half of the commercially available antibodies tested detect over-expressed human lrrk <dig> protein and some have sufficient specificity to detect endogenous lrrk <dig> in human brain.
the expression profiles of the murine lrrk proteins have not been fully described and insufficiently characterized antibodies have produced conflicting results in the literature.
in mammals, lrrk <dig> and lrrk <dig> protein comprise a unique family encoding a gtpase domain that controls intrinsic kinase activity.
