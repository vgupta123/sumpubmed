both energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy  and eds elemental mapping showed no element se and senps were produced inside cells whereas se was reduced to red-colored selenium in the cytoplasmic fraction in presence of nadph.
tungstate inhibited se but not se reduction, indicating the se-reducing determinant does not contain molybdenum as co-factor.
iscr appears to be an activator to regulate genes involved in resistance to heavy or transition metals but not for genes responsible for se reduction.

disruption of iscr encoding a transcriptional regulator negatively impacted cellular growth and subsequent resistance to multiple heavy metals.
c. testosteroni s <dig> could be very useful for bioremediation in heavy metal polluted soils due to the ability to both reduce toxic se and se to non-toxic se  under aerobic conditions and to tolerate multiple heavy and transition metals.
strain s <dig> was resistant to multiple heavy and transition metals such as se, as, cu, and cd with minimal inhibitory concentrations  of 100 mm, 20 mm, 4 mm, and  <dig>  mm, respectively.
