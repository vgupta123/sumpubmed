our results indicate that some probe sets should not be considered as unique measures of transcription, because the individual probes map to more than one transcript dependent upon the biological condition.
our results highlight the need for care when assessing whether groups of probe sets all measure the same transcript.
we have also investigated groups of probe sets on the rae230a array that are assigned to the same locusid, but which show large variances in differential expression in any one of three different experiments on rat.
it is important that the probe set annotations are reliable so that biological inferences can be made about genes which undergo differential expression.
