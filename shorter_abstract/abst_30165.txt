because caenorhabditis elegans is relatively resistant to op lethality—particularly through the inhibition of ache—studies in this nematode provide an opportunity to observe alterations in global gene expression following op exposure that cannot be readily observed in less resistant organisms.
the worms showed a time-dependent increase in the expression of genes involved in stress responses.
we then analyzed gene expression using whole genome microarrays from rna obtained from worms sampled at multiple time points throughout the exposure.
however, other mechanisms leading to persistent effects and neurodegeneration remain controversial and difficult to detect.
the changes in gene expression observed in the worms following exposure to dichlorvos point towards two potential mechanisms of toxicity: inhibition of ache and mitochondrial disruption.
early in the exposure, the predominant effect was on metabolic processes, while at later times, an immune-like response and cellular repair mechanisms dominated the expression pattern.

following removal of dichlorvos, the gene expression in the worms appeared to relatively rapidly return to steady-state levels.
