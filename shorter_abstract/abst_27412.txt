several uses for the tool are demonstrated, including quality control for high-throughput sequencing projects, plasmid mlst and analysis of genomic data during outbreak investigation.
over the last decade, researchers and population health specialists have invested substantial effort in building up public mlst databases for nearly  <dig> different bacterial species, and these databases contain a wealth of important information linked to mlst sequence types such as time and place of isolation, host or niche, serotype and even clinical or drug resistance profiles.
however given the wealth of data currently available in mlst databases, it is crucial to maintain backwards compatibility with mlst schemes so that new genome analyses can be understood in their proper historical context.
we present a software tool, srst, for quick and accurate retrieval of sequence types from short read sets, using inputs easily downloaded from public databases.
alignment, fastq and pileup files can also be generated for novel alleles.
this method focuses on the sequences of a small number of loci  to divide the population and is simple, robust and facilitates comparison of results between laboratories and over time.
multi-locus sequence typing  has become the gold standard for population analyses of bacterial pathogens.
srst is a novel software tool for accurate assignment of sequence types using short read data.
srst uses read mapping and an allele assignment score incorporating sequence coverage and variability, to determine the most likely allele at each mlst locus.
analysis of over  <dig>  loci in more than  <dig> publicly accessible illumina read sets showed srst to be highly accurate at allele assignment.
