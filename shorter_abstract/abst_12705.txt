the sustained intracerebro-ventricular administration of a tgf-β <dig> aso via an osmotic mini pump increased apoptosis levels in ca and dg regions  <dig> days after adx as well as sham-operated control animals.
sustained intracerebral administration of tgf-β <dig> aso increased the apoptosis promoted by adx, suggesting that tgf-β <dig> plays an anti-apoptotic role in vivo in hippocampus.
however, the effect of adx on the number of apoptotic positive cells in dg was decreased  <dig> days after the lesion.
the changes in both the pattern and the magnitude of apoptotic-cell morphology observed  <dig> and  <dig> days after adx suggest that, as a consequence of the reduction of corticosteroids, some trophic mechanisms restricting cell death to a particular time window are elicited.
thus, we have investigated whether tgf-β <dig> levels are induced by adx, and whether apoptosis is increased by blocking the expression of tgf-β <dig> with an antisense oligonucleotide  administered intracerebrally in corticosterone depleted rats.
corticosterone reduction produced by adrenalectomy  induces apoptosis in dentate gyrus  of the hippocampus, an effect related to an increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene bax.
it was observed an increase of apoptosis in dg,  <dig> and  <dig> days after adx, in agreement with a reduction of corticosterone levels.
