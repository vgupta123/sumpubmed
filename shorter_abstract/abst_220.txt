understanding how qualitative or quantitative changes in expression of the set of actin cytoskeleton genes are integrated to control actin dynamics and organisation is currently a challenge and should provide insights in identifying potential targets for drug discovery.
actichip performance was analysed by hybridisation with rnas extracted from epithelial mcf- <dig> cells and human skeletal muscle.
mutations or alterations in the expression levels affecting the actin cytoskeleton system or related regulatory mechanisms are often associated with complex diseases such as cancer.
the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in supporting and regulating numerous cellular processes.
here we report the development of a dedicated microarray, the actichip, containing 60-mer oligonucleotide probes for  <dig> genes selected for transcriptome analysis of the human actin cytoskeleton.
genomic data and sequence analysis features were retrieved from genbank and stored in an integrative database called actinome.
from these data, probes were designed using a home-made program  allowing sequence refinement and improved probe specificity by combining the complementary information recovered from the unigene and refseq databases.
the array allowed accurate detection of small changes in gene expression and reliable classification of samples based on the expression profiles of tissue-specific genes.
