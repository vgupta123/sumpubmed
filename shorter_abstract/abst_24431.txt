pulse field gel electrophoresis  showed that regardless of the year of isolation, all the strains bearing the sxt element were clonally related.
this study demonstrates that the v. cholerae o <dig> strains carrying an sxt/r391-like element implicated in recent cholera outbreaks in kenya has not changed significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> and are clonally related.
all the strains were negative for integron class  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and for transposase gene of transposon tn <dig> but were positive for integron class  <dig> and the trpm gene of transposon tn <dig>  no plasmids were isolated from any of the  <dig> strains.
a total of  <dig> vibrio cholerae o <dig> el tor serotype inaba isolated between  <dig> and  <dig> from various outbreaks in kenya were investigated for mobile genetic elements including integrons, transposons, the integrating conjugative elements , conjugative plasmids and for their genotypic relatedness.
although a number of recent studies describe the epidemiology of cholera in kenya, there is paucity of information concerning the diversity and occurrence of mobile genetic elements in vibrio cholerae strains implicated in these outbreaks.
none of the strains were positive for virulence genes associated with the v. cholerae classical biotype.
over the last decade, cholera outbreaks in parts of kenya have become common.
