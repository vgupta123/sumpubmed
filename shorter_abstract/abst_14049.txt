we demonstrate physical linkage between msx and other metahox genes  in a cnidarian.
seven conserved domains, including two groucho repression domains , were present in the ancestral msx.
to reconstruct the functional evolution of msx and inform the study of human mutations, we analyzed the phylogeny and synteny of  <dig> metazoan msx proteins and tracked the duplication, diversification and loss of conserved motifs.
duplication, divergence or loss of domains played a central role in the functional evolution of msx.
msx originated early in animal evolution and is implicated in human genetic disorders.
the sister-group relationship between msx <dig> and msx <dig> reflects their derivation from the 4p/5q chromosomal paralogon, a derivative of the original "metahox" cluster.
in vertebrate msx <dig>  the n-terminal groucho domain is conserved, while the c-terminal domain diverged substantially, implying a novel function.
msx originated from a metahox ancestor that also gave rise to tlx, demox, nk, and possibly ehgbox, hox and parahox genes.
in cnidarians, the groucho domains are highly similar.
this phylogenomic evaluation of candidate disease markers will inform clinical and functional studies.
msx <dig> mutations associated with ectodermal dysplasia or orofacial clefting disorders map to conserved domains in a non-random fashion.
