changing taxonomy, shared habitats, natural competence and evidence for horizontal gene transfer pose difficulties for determining their phylogeny, epidemiology and virulence mechanisms.
commensal and pathogenic sbsec strains  of human, animal and food origin from europe, asia, america and africa were used in the mlst scheme yielding  <dig> sequence types and  <dig> clonal complexes differentiated into distinct habitat-associated and mixed lineages.
the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex  comprises seven species classified as human and animal commensals, emerging opportunistic pathogens and food fermentative organisms.
an sbsec overarching multi locus sequence type  scheme targeting  <dig> housekeeping genes was developed, validated and combined with host-related properties of adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins , activation of the immune responses via nf-kb and survival in simulated gastric juice .
they highlighted the health risk among shared lineages and establish the basis to elucidate  transmission, host specificity, virulence mechanisms and enhanced risk assessment as pathobionts in an overarching one health approach.
nf-kb activation was observed for a limited number of dairy and blood isolates suggesting the potential of some pathogenic strains for reduced immune activation.
adhesion to ecms collagen i and mucin type ii was a common characteristic  followed by adhesion to fibronectin and fibrinogen .
high adhesion values shared between certain dairy and blood strains as well as the behavior of nf-kb activation are concerning for specific lineages.
combining phylogenetic and functional analyses via sbsec mlst enabled the clear delineation of strain clades to unravel the complexity of this bacterial group.
strains from dairy mlst clades displayed the highest relative survival to sgj independently of dairy adaptation markers lacs/lacz.
