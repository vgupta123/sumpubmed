further, we report to our knowledge, the simplest and fastest protocol for the recovery and assembly of complete mitochondrial genomes using the miseq benchtop sequencer.
the complete mitochondrial genome of the parastacid freshwater crayfish, engaeus lengana, was recovered by modest shotgun sequencing  using the illumina miseq benchtop sequencing platform.
genome assembly using the mitobim mitogenome assembler recovered the mitochondrial genome as a single contig with a 97-fold mean coverage .

we infer that the gene order arrangement found in cherax destructor is common to australian crayfish and may be a derived feature of the southern hemisphere family parastacidae.
