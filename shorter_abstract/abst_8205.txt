the hrm analysis was also successfully tested on environmental samples.
using hrm analysis, the discrimination of the  <dig> aspergillus species could be made.
despite the good performance observed for that qpcr method, no discrimination could previously be made between a. versicolor, aspergillus creber and aspergillus sydowii.
in this study, we developed and evaluated an hrm assay for the discrimination between a. versicolor, aspergillus creber and aspergillus sydowii.
the limit of detection was determined for each species i.e.,  <dig>  pg of gdna for a. creber and a. sydowii, and  <dig>  pg of gdna for a. versicolor.
we reported the development of hrm tools for the discrimination of a. versicolor, a. creber and a. sydowii.
indoor air pollution caused by fungal contamination is suspected to have a public health impact.
monitoring of the composition of the indoor airborne fungal contaminants is therefore important.
in this study, we provide a proof-of-concept for this approach, using a dye adapted version of our previously developed qpcr sybr®green method to detect aspergillus versicolor in indoor air, an important airborne fungus in terms of occurrence and cause of health problems.
however, this study could be considered as a study case demonstrating that hrm based on existing qpcr assays, allows a more accurate identification of indoor air contaminants.
this contributes to an improved insight in the diversity of indoor airborne fungi and hence, eventually in the causal link with health problems.

no false positive, nor false negatives were observed during the performance assessment including  <dig> strains of aspergillus.
among these molecular methods, the polymerase chain reaction  and the real-time pcr are the most frequently used tools for indoor fungal detection.
