as a proof of principle, we inserted the luciferase amino acid sequence into the third intracellular loop of the m <dig> muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.
controlling enzyme activity by ligand binding to a regulatory domain of choice may have many applications e.g.
however, until now only a small number of ligand-binding domains have been successfully linked to enzyme activity.
receptor blockers slightly but significantly reduced enzyme activity.
by successive deletion mutagenesis the enzyme activity was optimally coupled to ligand-induced conformational helix movements.
our results demonstrate that in engineered gpcr-enzyme chimeras, intracellular enzyme activity can be directly controlled by a gpcr serving as the extracellular ligand-binding domain.
ligand binding to gpcr results in conformational changes involving the transmembrane helices.
this fusion protein retained both receptor and enzyme function.
g protein-coupled receptors  are capable of recognizing an extraordinary structural variety of extracellular signals including inorganic and organic molecules.
here, we assessed whether ligand-induced conformational changes within the gpcr helix bundle can be utilized to control the activity of an integrated enzyme.
