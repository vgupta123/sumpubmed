the goal of our study was to investigate both stages of the completion process by localizing both brain regions involved in processing the physical features of the stimulus as well as brain regions representing the completed stimulus.
using fmri adaptation we reveal clearly distinct regions in the visual cortex of humans involved in processing of amodal completion: early visual cortex – presumably v <dig> -processes the local contour information of the stimulus whereas regions in the inferior temporal cortex represent the completed shape.
furthermore, our data suggest that at the level of inferior temporal cortex information regarding the original local contour information is not preserved but replaced by the representation of the amodally completed percept.
psychophysical investigations suggest that the process of completion starts from a representation of the  physical features of the stimulus and ends with a completed representation of the stimulus.
this phenomenon is called visual amodal completion.
these findings provide neuroimaging evidence for a multiple step theory of amodal completion and further insights into the neuronal correlates of visual perception.
