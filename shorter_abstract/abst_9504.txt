these results indicated that m. citriodora harbors a rich fungal endophytic community with anticancer and antimicrobial activities.
this is the first report of diversity of fungal endophytes isolated from m. citriodora.
the isolated endophyte mc-24 l  has the potential to be a source of novel cytotoxic/antimicrobial compounds.
anticancer and antimicrobial potential of isolated endophytes have also been investigated.
75% of the extracts showed antimicrobial activities in agar disc-diffusion assay and 27% in the tube dilution method  respectively against the tested pathogens.

a total of twenty eight fungal endophytes belonging to  <dig> different genera were isolated from this plant.
out of  <dig> fungal species, 72% endophytic extracts were found cytotoxic against one or more human cancer cell lines.
all the endophytic fungi belonged to the ascomycota phylum.
present study focuses on diversity and distribution analysis of endophytic fungi associated with different tissues of the monarda citriodora cerv.
