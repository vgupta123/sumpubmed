tyrosine hydroxylase  staining of the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta revealed that edaravone might exert neuroprotective effects on nigrostriatal dopaminergic systems.
this study clarifies the neuroprotective effects of edaravone , which has already been used for the treatment of cerebral ischemia in japan, on th-positive dopaminergic neurons using pd model both in vitro and in vivo.
free radicals induced by oxidative stress are involved in the mechanisms of cell death in pd.
the number of surviving th-positive neurons and the degree of cell damage induced by free radicals were analyzed.
the number of apoptotic cells and het-positive cells significantly decreased, thus indicating that the neuroprotective effects of edaravone might be mediated by anti-apoptotic effects through the suppression of free radicals by edaravone.
in parallel, edaravone or saline was intravenously administered for pd model of rats receiving intrastriatal 6-ohda lesion with subsequent behavioral and histological analyses.
edaravone exerts neuroprotective effects on pd model both in vitro and in vivo.
in vivo study demonstrated that edaravone-administration at  <dig> minutes after 6-ohda lesion reduced the number of amphetamine-induced rotations significantly than edaravone-administration at  <dig> hours.
in vitro study showed that edaravone significantly ameliorated the survival of th-positive neurons in a dose-responsive manner.
edaravone might be a hopeful therapeutic option for pd, although the high therapeutic dosage remains to be solved for the clinical application.
