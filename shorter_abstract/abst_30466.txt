this study suggests that the targeted construction of chimeric enzymes is an alternative to point mutational engineering efforts as long as parent enzymes with the wanted properties are available.
the archeaon sulfolobus solfataricus p <dig> encodes a thermoacidophilic cellulase which shows an extreme acid and thermal stability with a ph optimum at  <dig>  and a temperature optimum at 80°c.
the refolded active chimeric enzyme shows a temperature optimum of approximately 85°c and a ph optimum of approximately ph  <dig> thus retaining the advantageous properties of the sulfolobus parent enzyme.
we constructed two hybrid proteins after bioinformatic analysis: both hybrids are expressed insoluble in e. coli, but one hybrid enzyme was successfully refolded from washed inclusion bodies.
this extraordinary enzyme could be useful for biotechnological exploitation but the expression and purification in expression hosts like e. coli is unsatisfactory due to the high aggregation tendency of the recombinant enzyme.
in contrast to sso <dig> this enzyme is expressed partially soluble in e. coli.
recombinant expression in e. coli, acidophily and thermophily.
the thermophilic cellulase cela from thermotoga maritima belongs to the same glycoside hydrolase family  but has a neutral ph optimum.
we aimed to constructed a hybrid enzyme based on these two beta-endoglucanases which should successfully combine the advantageous properties of both cellulases, i.e.
