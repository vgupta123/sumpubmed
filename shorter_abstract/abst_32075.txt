we present a sound framework for evaluating the quality of seeds for oligonucleotide design.
it will be useful in improving the algorithms for oligonucleotide design.
dna oligonucleotides are a very useful tool in biology.
the best algorithms for designing good dna oligonucleotides are filtering out unsuitable regions using a seeding approach.
single spaced and transition seeds are very close whereas, as expected, contiguous seeds come last.
an exception is that single spaced and transitions-constrained seeds are both more accurate and more efficient than contiguous ones.
