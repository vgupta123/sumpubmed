we now demonstrate that in lava, by contrast, the vntr domain determines mobilization efficiency in the context of domain swaps between active and inactive elements.
vntr  composite retrotransposons - sva , lava , pva  and fva  - are specific to hominoid primates.
here we provide evidence that the organization of the vntr is non-random, with conserved repeat unit  arrays at both the 5’ and 3’ ends of the vntrs of human, chimpanzee and orangutan sva and gibbon lava.
the central domain of vntr composites evolves in a lineage-specific manner which gives rise to distinct structures in gibbon lava, orangutan sva, and human/chimpanzee sva.
our analysis revealed that a microhomology-driven mechanism mediates expansion/contraction of the vntr domain at the dna level.
their assembly, the evolution of their 5’ and 3’ domains, and the functional significance of the shared 5’ alu-like region are well understood.
the central vntr domain, by contrast, has long been assumed to represent a more or less random collection of 30-50 bp gc-rich repeats.
in case of sva, key determinants of mobilization are found in the 5’ hexameric repeat/alu-like region.
