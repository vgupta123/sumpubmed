interestingly, its phosphorylation pattern differs between cytoplasm and nucleus and changes upon erk activation.
genetic interactions show that corto and dmp <dig> act together to antagonize rolled  in the future intervein cells, thus promoting intervein fate.
functional relationships during wing development between a chromatin regulator, the enhancer of trithorax and polycomb corto, erk and its scaffold protein dmp <dig>  are examined here.
in drosophila, dmp <dig>  that encodes an erk scaffold protein, regulates erk signaling during wing development and contributes to intervein and vein cell differentiation.
these kinase modules are associated with scaffold proteins that control their activity.
furthermore, corto, erk and dmp <dig> co-localize on several sites on polytene chromosomes, suggesting that they regulate gene expression directly on chromatin.
