the functions of three zona glycoproteins, zp <dig>  zp <dig> and zp <dig> during the sperm-zona pellucida  interaction are now well established in mice.
the hzp of fertilised oocytes retained their ability to bind sperm , to induce an intraspermatic calcium influx through voltage-dependent channels similar to that observed with hzp from unfertilised oocytes and to promote the acrosome reaction at a rate similar to that induced by the zp of unfertilised oocytes .
we investigated the various functions of human zp  during the interaction of spermatozoa with fertilised and unfertilised oocytes.
the expression of an additional zona glycoprotein, zpb/ <dig>  in humans, led us to reconsider the classical mouse model of gamete interaction.
our results suggest a zona blocking to polyspermy based at the sperm penetration level in humans.
we investigated the status of zp <dig> in the oocytes used in the functional tests, and demonstrated that sperm binding and acrosome reaction induction, but not zp penetration, occurred whether or not zp <dig> was cleaved.
