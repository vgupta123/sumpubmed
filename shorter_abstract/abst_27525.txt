we have annotated  <dig>  different sequences, an almost 5-fold increase in annotated sequences compared to the available wheat public databases.
over 43% of the unique sequence set was annotated and classified into functional categories according to gene ontology.
to circumvent this obstacle and identify genes involved in cold acclimation and associated stresses, a large scale est sequencing approach was undertaken by the functional genomics of abiotic stress  project.
wheat is an excellent species to study freezing tolerance and other abiotic stresses.
we generated  <dig>  quality-filtered ests from eleven cdna libraries constructed from wheat plants exposed to various abiotic stresses and at different developmental stages.
digital expression analysis combined with gene annotation helped in the identification of several pathways associated with abiotic stress.
digital expression analyses indicated that the fgas dataset is enriched in stress-regulated genes compared to the other public datasets.
however, the sequence of the wheat genome has not been completely characterized due to its complexity and large size.
