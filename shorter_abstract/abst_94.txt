taken together, these results suggest that p. aeruginosa vesicles can interact with and be internalized by lung epithelial cells and contribute to the inflammatory response during infection.
to investigate how p. aeruginosa-derived vesicles may contribute to lung disease, we explored their ability to associate with human lung cells.
cf isolates of p. aeruginosa abundantly secrete paap , an aminopeptidase that associates with the surface of vesicles.
vesicles from a cf isolate exhibited a 3- to 4-fold greater association with lung cells than vesicles from the lab strain pao <dig>  vesicle internalization was temperature-dependent and was inhibited by hypertonic sucrose and cyclodextrins.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major pathogen associated with chronic and ultimately fatal lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis .
surface-bound vesicles rarely colocalized with clathrin.
purified vesicles associated with lung cells and were internalized in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
these data reveal that paap promotes the association of vesicles with lung cells.
