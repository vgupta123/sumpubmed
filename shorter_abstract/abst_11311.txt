protein-dna complex structures in current pdb were processed and analyzed with our pda program and the analysis results were stored in a database.
the pda program is freely available at .
data from the pda analysis can also facilitate the classification of protein-dna complexes and provide insights into rational design of benchmarks.
in addition, current approaches to comparison of protein-dna complexes are mainly based on protein sequence similarity while the dna sequences are not taken into account.
pda is a computational tool for structural annotations of protein-dna complexes.
a dataset useful for studying protein-dna interactions involved in gene regulation was generated using both protein and dna sequences as well as the contact information of the complexes.
pda takes pdb files as inputs and performs structural analysis that includes 1) whole protein-dna complex structure restoration, especially the reconstruction of double-stranded dna structures; 2) an efficient new approach for dna base-pair detection; 3) systematic annotation of protein-dna interactions; and 4) extraction of dna subsequences involved in protein-dna interactions and identification of protein-dna binding units.
knowledge of protein-dna interactions at the structural-level can provide insights into the mechanisms of protein-dna recognition and gene regulation.
although over  <dig> protein-dna complex structures have been deposited into protein data bank , the structural details of protein-dna interactions are generally not available.
it provides a useful resource for investigating protein-dna interactions.
with the number of experimentally-determined protein-dna complex structures increasing, there is a need for an automatic program to analyze the protein-dna complex structures and to provide comprehensive structural information for the benefit of the whole research community.
