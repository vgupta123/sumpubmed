finally, there is a comprehensive high-throughput blast output viewer  and annotation engine components, which provides comprehensive exportation of blast hits to text files, annotated fasta files, tables, or association files.
w.nd-blast displays close to 100% performance efficiency when distributing tasks to  <dig> remote computers of the same performance class.
this paper describes a software application we have termed windows .net distributed basic local alignment search toolkit , which enhances the blast utility by improving usability, fault recovery, and scalability in a windows desktop environment.
w.nd-blast is a comprehensive windows-based software toolkit that targets researchers, including those with minimal computer skills, and provides the ability increase the performance of blast by distributing blast queries to any number of windows based machines across local area networks .
this software also provides several layers of fault tolerance and fault recovery to prevent loss of data if nodes or master machines fail.
our goal was to develop an easy to use, fault tolerant, high-throughput blast solution that incorporates a comprehensive blast result viewer with curation and annotation functionality.
