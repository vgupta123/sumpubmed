the present study was undertaken to further explore the connections between peripheral inflammation, anorexia and hypothalamic serotonin metabolism and signaling pathways.
in vitro, we showed that hypothalamic neurons responded to inflammatory mediators by releasing cytokines.
this inflammatory response was associated with an increased serotonin release.
overall, our results underline that peripheral inflammation reaches the hypothalamus where it affects hypothalamic serotoninergic metabolism.
next, we studied transcriptomic changes and serotonergic activity in the hypothalamus of mice after intraperitoneal injection with tnfα, il- <dig> or a combination of tnfα and il- <dig>
increasing evidence suggests that inflammation plays a major role, along with a hypothalamic dysregulation characterized by locally elevated serotonin levels.
mice injected with tnfα and il- <dig> showed decreased food intake, associated with altered expression of inflammation-related genes in the hypothalamus.
these hypothalamic changes in serotonin pathways are associated with decreased food intake, providing evidence for a role of serotonin in inflammation-induced anorexia.
