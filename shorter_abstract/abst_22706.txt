the good balance between solution's quality and computational effort makes it a valuable tool.
we analyze this strategy in two aspects: 1) from an optimization point of view the strategy is tested on two different datasets, obtaining an error of  <dig> % and  <dig> %  with respect to optimal values; thus leading to high accurate solutions in a simpler and less expensive way than exact algorithms; 2) in terms of protein structure classification, we conduct experiments on three datasets and show that is feasible to detect structural similarities at scop's family and cath's architecture levels using normalized overlap values.
although this problem may be solved using exact algorithms, researchers require approximate algorithms that obtain good quality solutions using less computational resources than the formers.
moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the max-cmo measure is tested at scop's fold and cath's architecture levels with encouraging results.
there exist several methods for doing protein comparison, being the solution of the maximum contact map overlap problem  one of the alternatives available.
protein structure comparison is a key problem in bioinformatics.
