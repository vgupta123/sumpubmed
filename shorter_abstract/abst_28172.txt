hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension occurring in poorly vascularized areas of the tumor associated with poor prognosis.
we utilized this algorithm to classify nb-patients on the bases of the following risk factors: age at diagnosis, inss stage, mycn amplification and nb-hypo.
furthermore, we were interested in classifiers outputting explicit rules that could be easily translated into the clinical setting.
the novelty of our work is to identify stability, explicit rules and blending of molecular and clinical risk factors as the key features to generate classification rules for nb patients to be conveyed to the clinic and to be used to design new therapies.
the good performance of the classifier was validated in an independent dataset.
about fifty percent of high risk patients die despite treatment making the exploration of new and more effective strategies for improving stratification mandatory.
this workflow generated a stable classifier very accurate in predicting good and poor outcome patients.
we wanted to develop a prognostic classifier of neuroblastoma patients' outcome blending existing knowledge on clinical and molecular risk factors with the prognostic nb-hypo signature.
shadow clustering  technique, which leads to final models called logic learning machine , exhibits a good accuracy and promises to fulfill the aims of the work.
we derived, through llm, a set of four stable rules identifying a new class of poor outcome patients that could benefit from new therapies potentially targeting tumor hypoxia or its consequences.
through an iterative procedure we identified and removed from the dataset those examples which caused instability in the rules.
