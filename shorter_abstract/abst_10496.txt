differentiation of f <dig> embryonal carcinoma  cells into parietal endoderm  provides a tractable model system for studying molecular events during early and inaccessible stages of murine development.
in addition, pe cells have elevated levels of the retinoblastoma protein rb, which is known to bind and repress tfiiib.
in proliferating cells, pol iii transcription is stimulated by the proto-oncogene product c-myc and the mitogen-activated protein kinase erk, both of which bind to tfiiib.
the low activity of tfiiib in pe can be attributed to a combination of changes, any one of which could be sufficient to inhibit pol iii transcription.
the diminished abundance of tfiiib is therefore likely to be compounded by changes to these positive regulators that are required for its full activity.
this has been attributed to changes in activity of tfiiib, a factor that is necessary and sufficient to recruit pol iii to promoters.
three essential subunits of tfiiib decrease in abundance as f <dig> cells differentiate; these are brf <dig> and bdp <dig>  which are pol iii-specific, and tbp, which is also used by pols i and ii.
these events provide fail-safe guarantees to ensure that pol iii output is appropriate to the diminished metabolic requirements of terminally differentiated cells.
pe formation is accompanied by extensive changes in gene expression both in vivo and in culture.
the decreased levels of brf <dig> and bdp <dig> proteins can be explained by reduced expression of the corresponding mrnas.
