the prophenoloxidase-activating  system plays an important role in the crustacean innate immunity, particularly in wound healing and pathogen defense.
here we report on a ppae of white shrimp, litopenaeus vannamei , which showed 94% similarity to ppae <dig> of penaeus monodon.
although lvppae <dig> was down-regulated in fluid hemocytes by vibrio challenge, its expression increased significantly in gill after bacteria injection, which is the primary bacteria-clearance tissue.
we found that lvppae <dig> in fluid hemocytes was down regulated after challenge by vibrio harveyi but was enhanced when shrimps were exposed to a bacteria-rich environment for long-term.
in vivo gene silence of lvppae <dig> by rnai can significantly reduce the phenoloxidase activity  and increase the susceptibility of shrimps to v. harveyi.
suppressed expression in fluid hemocytes and enhanced expression in gill indicates selectively enhanced expression at the bacterial clearance site.
the results will contribute to our understanding of the po activating system in crustaceans.
