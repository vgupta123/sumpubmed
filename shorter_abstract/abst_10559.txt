therefore, we propose pre-clustering of input expression samples to approximate condition-specific grouping of samples and individual network construction of each group as a means for dynamic significance thresholding.
in comparison, network construction without pre-sorting of input samples yielded only  <dig>  genes  and  <dig>  relationships.
finally, this method is applicable to any large expression profile collection for any organism and is best suited where a knowledge-independent network construction method is desired.
in some cases networks may be constructed from input samples that measure gene expression under a variety of different conditions, such as for different genotypes, environments, disease states and tissues.
the overall gene count across all gils reached  <dig>  genes  and  <dig>  unique co-expression relationships.
we term each pre-sorted network a gene interaction layer .
when large sets of samples are obtained from public repositories it is often unmanageable to associate samples into condition-specific groups, and combining samples from various conditions has a negative effect on network size.
in genomics, highly relevant gene interaction  networks have been constructed by finding significant pair-wise correlations between genes in expression datasets.
because rmt ensures only highly significant interactions are kept, the gil compendium consists of  <dig>  unique high quality a. thaliana co-expression relationships across almost all of the measurable genes on the ath <dig> array.
for a. thaliana, these networks represent the largest compendium to date of significant gene co-expression relationships, and are a means to explore complex pathway, polygenic, and pleiotropic relationships for this focal model plant.
here we show that pre-clustering of microarray samples helps approximate condition-specific networks and allows for dynamic thresholding using un-supervised methods.
