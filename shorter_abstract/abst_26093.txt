one of the major issues in the fight against infectious diseases is the notable increase in multiple drug resistance in pathogenic species.
firstly, known antibiotics are mainly originating from natural products of microorganisms targeting other microorganisms.
from a biological perspective, most essential proteins  or highly conserved proteins  are potential drug targets.
for that reason, newly acquired high-throughput data on virulent microbial agents attract the attention of many researchers seeking potential new drug targets.
many of them are well-known drug targets in bacteria.
thus, we have hypothesized that good drug targets are evolutionary constrained and are subject of evolutionary selection.
in this study we show that pn/ps ratio of genes coding for known drug targets is significantly lower than the genome average and also lower than that for essential genes identified by experimental methods.
both analyzes suggest that drug targets tend to evolve slowly and that the rate of evolution is a better predictor of drugability than essentiality.
evolutionary rate can be used to score and find potential drug targets.
ribosomal proteins comprise such an example.
similar results are observed in the case of dn/ds analysis.
the results presented here may become a useful addition to a repertoire of drug target prediction methods.
this means that mutations in such proteins are deleterious and removed by selection, which makes them less susceptible to random development of resistance.
