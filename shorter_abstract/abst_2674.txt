however, serum or ultroser g proved to be essential for ebec differentiation on membrane inserts at ali.
however, because isolation and characterization of ebec cultures has been limited, we modified and optimized techniques of generating and culturing ebecs from healthy horses to mimic in vivo conditions.
differentiated primary equine bronchial epithelial cells  in culture that closely mimic the airway cells in vivo would be useful to investigate the contribution of bronchial epithelium in inflammation of airway diseases.
these ebec cultures can be used to study the formation of tight junction or to identify epithelial-derived inflammatory factors that contribute to lung diseases such as asthma.
horses develop recurrent airway obstruction  that resembles human bronchial asthma.
large numbers of ebec were obtained by trypsin digestion and successfully grown for up to  <dig> passages with or without serum.
a pseudo-stratified muco-ciliary epithelium with basal cells was observed at differentiation.
