often there is no single best approach to periodicity detection and a combination of different methods may improve the prediction accuracy.
here we investigate the application of dft method to identify and study alphoid higher order repeats.
we used method based on dft with mapping of symbolic into numerical sequence to identify and study alphoid higher order repeats .
discrete fourier transform  has been extensively used to study primary periodicities in dna sequences.
in general, nmer hor-pattern contains equidistant secondary periodicity peaks, having a pronounced subset of equidistant primary periodicity peaks.
our case study was the  <dig> mer hor tandem in ac <dig>  from human chromosome  <dig>  very long array of equidistant peaks at multiple frequencies  is based on fundamental frequency of  <dig> mer hor.
pronounced subset of equidistant peaks is based on multiples of the fundamental hor frequency  and higher harmonics.
the 1/fβ – noise and periodicity three pattern are missing from power spectra in alphoid regions, in accordance with expectations.
the number of lower frequency peaks  below the frequency of the first primary periodicity peak reveals the size of nmer hor, i.e., the number n of monomers contained in consensus hor.
this hierarchical pattern as signature for hor detection is robust with respect to monomer insertions and deletions, random sequence insertions etc.
