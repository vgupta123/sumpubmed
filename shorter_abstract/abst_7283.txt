in the present study, mitogenome sequence of p. leo persica deduced, using ion torrent pgm to assess phylogeny and evolution which may play an increasingly important role in conservation biology.
the mtdna sequence of p. leo persica is  <dig>  bp in length with  <dig> % gc content.
phylogenetic analysis based on whole mitogenome, suggests panthera pardus as a neighbouring species to p. leo with species divergence at ~ <dig>  mya.
there have been different opinions regarding the phylogenetic status of panthera leo, as well as classifying lions of different geographic regions into subspecies and races.
the result compared and evaluated with earlier reports of felidae shows alteration of phylogenetic status and species evolution.
the present surviving lions of the genus panthera comprise of eight sub-species inclusive of asiatic lion panthera leo persica of india's gir forest.
this work presents first report on complete mitogenome of panthera leo persica.

this study may provide information on genetic diversity and population stability.
except for the asiatic lion, the other seven subspecies are found in different parts of africa.
it sheds light on the phylogenetic and evolutionary status within and across felidae members.
