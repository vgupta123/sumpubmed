here we introduce a graph-kernel method for computing the similarity between metabolic networks in polynomial time, and use it to profile metabolic pathways and to construct phylogenetic trees.
to construct the phylogenetic trees, we used an unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean, i.e., a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
this method may yield further information about biological evolution, such as the history of horizontal transfer of each gene, by studying the detailed structure of the phylogenetic tree constructed by the kernel-based method.
however, evaluating the similarities or differences between metabolic networks is a computationally challenging problem, and systematic methods of doing this are desirable.
conventional phylogenetic analysis based on genomic sequences provides information about the genetic relationships between different organisms.
in contrast, comparative analysis of metabolic pathways in different organisms can yield insights into their functional relationships under different physiological conditions.
the results show that one may obtain a global view of the tree of life by comparing the metabolic pathway structures using meta-level information rather than sequence information.
the resulting phylogenetic hierarchies generally support the tripartite scheme of three domains rather than the two domains of prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
we applied the kernel-based network profiling method in a comparative analysis of nine carbohydrate metabolic networks from  <dig> biological species encompassing archaea, eukaryota, and eubacteria.
to compare the structures of metabolic networks in organisms, we adopted the exponential graph kernel, which is a kernel-based approach with a labeled graph that includes a label matrix and an adjacency matrix.
