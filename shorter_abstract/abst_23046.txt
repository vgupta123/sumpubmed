second, substituting the commonly used perforating antibiotic amphotericin b with Î²-escin allowed efficient cytosol harvest without loosing the giga seal.
however, harvesting of whole cells from primary pituitary cultures regularly produced false positives, probably due to rna leakage from cells ruptured during the dispersion of the pituitary cells.
two different cell harvesting methods were assessed using both the gh <dig> prolactin producing cell line from rat, and primary cell culture from fish pituitaries.
to reduce rna contamination affecting the results, we optimized the conditions by harvesting only the cytosol through a patch pipette, subsequent to electrophysiological experiments.
first, silanizing the patch pipette glass prevented foreign extracellular rna from attaching to charged residues on the glass surface.
the incidence of false positives is a potential problem in single-cell pcr experiments.
depending on the cell type and preparation, validation of the harvesting technique is extremely important as contaminations may give false positives.
harvesting whole cells followed by cell lysis and qpcr performed satisfactory on the gh <dig> cell line.
