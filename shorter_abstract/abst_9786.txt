this finding was a result of non-dominant left hand movement in right-handed participants.
it is unclear however if the effect depends upon non-dominant hand movement or if this is a generalized phenomenon across the upper-limbs.
this study tests the effect of dominant and non-dominant hand movement upon contralateral frontal and parietal somatosensory evoked potentials  and further tests if this relationship persists in left hand dominant participants.
the n <dig> is facilitated during non-dominant hand movement in both right and left hand dominant individuals.
there was no effect for dominant hand movement in either group.
n <dig> amplitude increase may be a result of altered sensory gating from motor areas known to be specifically active during non-dominant hand movement.
previous literature has shown that the frontal n <dig> is increased during movement of the hand contralateral to median nerve stimulation.
participants were required to volitionally squeeze  a pressure-sensitive bulb every ~ <dig> seconds with the hand contralateral to median nerve stimulation.
median nerve seps were elicited from the wrist contralateral to movement in both right hand and left hand dominant participants alternating the movement hand in separate blocks.
