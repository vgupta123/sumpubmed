because of lateral gene transfer between apodanthaceae and their hosts it has been difficult to infer the family's true closest relatives.
apodanthaceae and the seven families of the order cucurbitales form a clade with 100% bootstrap support from matr and 56% from  <dig> s. in addition, the apodanthaceae and cucurbitales matr gene sequences uniquely share two non-synonymous codon changes and one synonymous change, as well as a codon insertion, already found by barkman et al.
the occurrence of apodanthaceae in the americas, africa, the near east, and australia, and their adaptation to distantly related host species in the fabaceae and salicaceae suggest a long evolutionary history.
apodanthaceae belong in the cucurbitales with which they share inferior ovaries, parietal placentation and a dioecious mating system, traits that are ancestral in cucurbitales and which can now be interpreted as possible synapomorphies of an enlarged order cucurbitales.
