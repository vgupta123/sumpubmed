we used cultured human lung epithelial cells, fetal rat lung fibroblasts and a neonatal tgf-β <dig> transgenic mouse model.
in addition, since we observed increased expression of tgf-β <dig> by epithelial cells on exposure to hyperoxia, we used a tgf-β <dig> transgenic mouse model to determine the role of jnk activation in tgf-β <dig> induced effects on lung development and on exposure to hyperoxia.
we noted that, in this model, inhibition of jnk signaling significantly improved the spontaneously impaired alveolarization in room air and decreased mortality on exposure to hyperoxia.
we demonstrate that hyperoxia inhibits cell proliferation, activates cell death mediators and causes cell death, and promotes myofibroblast transdifferentiation, in a dose-dependent manner.
when viewed in combination, these studies demonstrate that hyperoxia-induced cell death, myofibroblast transdifferentiation, tgf-β1- and hyperoxia-mediated pulmonary responses are mediated, at least in part, via signaling through the jnk pathway.
we hypothesized that the jnk pathway is an important regulator of hyperoxia-induced pulmonary responses in the developing murine lung.
transforming growth factor-beta  <dig>  has been implicated in hyperoxia-induced cell death and impaired alveolarization in the developing lung.
except for fibroblast proliferation, the effects were mediated via the jnk pathway.
