using  <dig> features and training and test datasets of constitutive and alternative nagnags, we trained a classifier to predict the splicing outcome at nagnag tandem splice sites .
by generation of more transcript evidence from a next-generation sequencing platform , we found additional evidence for nagnag as, with altogether  <dig> alternative nagnags being detected in p. patens using all currently available transcript evidence.
using sanger data, we found  <dig> alternatively used nagnag acceptors in p. patens.
nagnag as is just as common in the moss p. patens as it is in the seed plants a. thaliana and o. sativa , and can be predicted with high accuracy.
our results suggest that the mechanism behind nagnag as in plants is similar to that in animals and is largely dependent on the splice site and its immediate neighborhood.
the most informative features are the nucleotides in the nagnag and in its immediate vicinity, along with the splice sites scores, as found earlier for nagnag as in animals.
alternative splicing  involving tandem acceptors that are separated by three nucleotides  is an evolutionarily widespread class of as, which is well studied in homo sapiens  and mus musculus .
subsequently, a classifier trained exclusively on data well supported by transcript evidence was used to make genome-wide predictions of nagnag splicing outcomes.
