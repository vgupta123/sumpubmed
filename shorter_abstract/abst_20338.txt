gene ontology analysis highlighted the following ontology groups: cell migration, cell motility and localization of cells, structural constituent of cytoskeleton, cell-cell adhesion, oxidoreductase, protein folding and mrna processing.
the results suggested that folr <dig> gene ablation and abnormal folate homeostasis altered gene expression in developing heart and conotruncal tissues.
as with the situation for neural tube defects , it has been demonstrated that women who use multivitamins containing folic acid peri-conceptionally have a reduced risk for delivering offspring with conotruncal heart defects  <cit> .
these changes affected normal cytoskeleton structures, cell migration and motility as well as cellular redox status, which may contribute to cardiovascular abnormalities in mouse embryos lacking folr <dig> gene activity.
in order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the failure to complete development of outflow tract and aortic arch arteries in the folr <dig> knockout mouse model, we examined tissue-specific gene expression difference between folr <dig> nullizygous embryos and morphologically normal heterozygous embryos during early cardiac development , heart tube looping , and outflow track septation .
we have observed cardiovascular abnormalities including outflow tract and aortic arch arterial defects in genetically compromised folr <dig> knockout mice.
defective function of the folr <dig>  gene in mice results in inadequate transport, accumulation, or metabolism of folate during cardiovascular morphogenesis.
heart anomalies are the most frequently observed among all human congenital defects.
