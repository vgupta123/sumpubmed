this study examined the wings of the noctuid moth oraesia excavata, which closely resemble leaves with a leaf venation pattern.
using geometric morphometrics combined with network analysis, we found that each of the modules in the leaf pattern integrates the constituent components of the leaf venation pattern .
previous studies demonstrated that individuality of the ngp facilitates the decoupling of associated common elements, leading to divergence.
based on a comparative morphological procedure, we found that this leaf pattern was formed by the ngp common elements.
moreover, the detected modules were established by coupling different common elements and decoupling even a single element into different modules.
the modules of the o. excavata wing pattern were associated with leaf mimicry, not with the individuality of the ngp common elements.
quantitative analysis demonstrated that the modules of the t. juno wing pattern regularly corresponded to the individuality of the ngp common elements, unlike those in the o. excavata wing pattern.
we propose that this evolution has been facilitated by a versatile characteristic of the ngp, allowing the association of freely modifiable subordinate common elements to make modules.
in contrast, recent studies on the concept of modularity have argued the importance of a combination of coupling and decoupling of the constituent elements.
the results suggest that the evolution of this pattern involves coupling and decoupling processes to originate these modules, free from the individuality of the ngp system.
this study provides the first evidence for modularity in a leaf mimicry pattern.

for comparison, we also investigated the modularity of a nonmimetic pattern in the noctuid moth thyas juno.
