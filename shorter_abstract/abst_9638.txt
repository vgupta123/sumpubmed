here we describe the sequence, genomic organization and circadian expression of cycle in the crepuscular/nocturnal hematophagous sandfly lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the americas.
unlike drosophila, the molecular clock of insect vectors is poorly understood, despite the importance of circadian behavior in the dynamic of disease transmission.
sequence and expression analysis of cycle in l. longipalpis show interesting differences compared to drosophila suggesting that hematophagous vector species might present interesting new models to study the molecular control of insect circadian clocks.
deduced amino acid sequence revealed that sandfly cycle has a c-terminal transactivation domain highly conserved among eukaryotes but absent in d. melanogaster.
interestingly, while cycle expression in drosophila and other diptera is constitutive, in sandflies it is rhythmic in males and female heads but constitutive in the female body.
