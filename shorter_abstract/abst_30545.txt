we test the performance of the proposed approach on synthetic data sets with different number of individuals and snps, and compare the performances with the state-of-the-art xor-haplotyping methods ppxh and xor-haplogen.
given the xor-genotypes of a group of unrelated individuals, it is possible to infer the haplotype pairs for each individual with the aid of a small number of regular genotypes.
we propose a framework of maximum parsimony inference of haplotypes based on the search of a sparse dictionary, and we present a greedy method that can effectively infer the haplotype pairs given a set of xor-genotypes augmented by a small number of regular genotypes.
experimental results show good inference qualities for the proposed method under all circumstances, especially on large data sets.
results on a real database, cftr, also demonstrate significantly better performance.
recent methods developed for haplotype inference have aimed at finding the solution based on xor-genotype data.
the proposed algorithm is also capable of finding accurate solutions with missing data and/or typing errors.
