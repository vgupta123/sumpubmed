the bioavailability of internalized mrna depends on its intracellular routing and its potential accumulation in dynamic sorting sites for storage: stress granules and processing bodies.
at this point, the mrna is dissociated from its carrier and localized in stress granules, but not in cytoplasmic processing bodies.
our study focused on the pharmacokinetics of the transposition process mediated by the piggybac transposase mrna transfection.
our results shed light on processes of exogenous mrna trafficking, which are crucial to estimate the mrna bioavailability, and increase the biosafety of transgene integration mediated by transposition.
some weaker signals have been observed in stress granules at  <dig> h and  <dig> h without causing prolonged production of the transposase.
this question is of particular significance when a secure transposon-based system able to integrate a therapeutic transgene into the genome is used.
the mrna prototype designed in this study provides a very narrow expression window of transposase, which allows high efficiency transposition with no cytotoxicity.
by contrast, the mode of internalization and the intracellular routing of an exogenous mrna in transfected cells are poorly investigated and remain to be elucidated.
exogenous mrna internalization and trafficking were investigated towards a better apprehension and fine control of the piggybac transposase bioavailability.
up to now, the different uptake pathways and the subsequent intracellular trafficking of plasmid dna have been largely explored.
transposon vectors usually require two components: a plasmid dna, carrying the gene of interest, and a source of transposase allowing the integration of the transgene.
the principal drawback is the lasting presence of the transposase, which could remobilize the transgene once it has been inserted.
