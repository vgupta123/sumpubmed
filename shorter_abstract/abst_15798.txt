nevertheless, the relatively mild phenotype observed in the kidney, as well as other organ systems, indicates a striking evolutionary divergence of pygopus function between mammals and drosophila.
pygo <dig> homozygous mutants, with rare exception, died shortly after birth, with a phenotype including lens agenesis, growth retardation, altered kidney development, and in some cases exencephaly and cleft palate.
the mammalian pygopus genes are required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud during kidney development.
the bat-gal transgene reporter of canonical wnt signaling showed reduced levels of expression in pygo1-/-/pygo2-/- mutants, with tissue-specific variation in degree of diminution.
the pygopus gene of drosophila encodes an essential component of the armadillo  transcription factor complex of canonical wnt signaling.
to better understand the functions of pygopus-mediated canonical wnt signaling in kidney development, targeted mutations were made in the two mammalian orthologs, pygo <dig> and pygo <dig>
in mammals, the pygo1/pygo <dig> genes are not absolutely required for canonical wnt signaling in most developing systems, but rather function as quantitative transducers, or modulators, of wnt signal intensity.
confocal analysis of the double mutant kidneys showed disturbance of both the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme-derived compartments.
microarray analysis showed changed expression of several genes, including cxcl <dig>  slc5a <dig>  klk <dig>  ren <dig> and timeless, which represent candidate wnt targets in kidney development.
branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud was altered, with expanded tips and reduced tip density, probably contributing to the smaller size of the mutant kidney.
in addition, there was an expansion of the zone of condensed mesenchyme capping the ureteric bud.
