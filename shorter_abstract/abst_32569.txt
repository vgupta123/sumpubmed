biochemical experiments were performed to determine whether the aaxabc genes from c. trachomatis strains were transcribed, and mutagenesis was used to identify nucleotide substitutions that prevent protein maturation and activity.
the aaxabc genes were co-transcribed in c. trachomatis l2/ <dig>  during the mid-late stage of cellular infection.
the independent loss of aaxb activity in all sequenced c. trachomatis strains indicates continual gene inactivation and illustrates the difficulty of recognizing recent bacterial pseudogenes from sequence comparison, transcriptional profiling or the analysis of nucleotide substitution rates.
the ancestor of the chlamydiaceae had a functional arginine:agmatine exchange system that is decaying through independent, parallel processes in the c. trachomatis lineage.
all of the chlamydiaceae have homologs of the aaxabc gene cluster that encodes a functional arginine:agmatine exchange system in chlamydia pneumoniae.
differences in arginine metabolism among chlamydiaceae species may be partly associated with their tissue tropism, possibly due to the protection conferred by a functional arginine-agmatine exchange system against host nitric oxide production and innate immunity.
however, chlamydia trachomatis serovar l <dig> strains have a nonsense mutation in their aaxb genes, and c. trachomatis serovar a and b strains have frameshift mutations in their aaxc homologs, suggesting that relaxed selection may have enabled the evolution of aax pseudogenes.
the aaxc gene from the d/uw- <dig> strain encoded an active arginine:agmatine antiporter protein, while the l2/ <dig> homolog was unexpectedly inactive.
replacing that ochre codon with its ancestral tryptophan codon rescued the activity of this self-cleaving enzyme.
despite their different tissue tropisms, chlamydial strains share a large number of common genes and have few recognized pseudogenes, indicating genomic stability.
