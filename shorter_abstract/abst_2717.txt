we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to categorize genes based on their differential expression and their alternative splicing status across time by binning genes based on their transcriptional kinetics.
we found de novo transcription of genes whose transcripts were exclusively found in the nuclear transcriptome at p <dig>  further analysis showed that these genes enriched for functions that are known to be executed during postnatal development, thus showing that the p <dig> nuclear transcriptome is temporally ahead of that of its cytoplasm.
this in turn could enable us to find patterns in gene expression across time to reveal transition in biological processes.
using our pipeline on rna-seq data obtained from fractionated  developing retina at embryonic day   <dig> and postnatal day   <dig>  we captured high-resolution as in the difference between the cytoplasm and the nucleus at the same developmental time.
genes within same bins were then leveraged to query gene annotation databases to discover molecular programs employed by the developing retina.
the retina as a model system with extensive information on genes involved in development/maintenance is of great value for investigations employing deep sequencing to capture transcriptome change over time.
indeed, histological manifestation of vasodilation has been reported at a later time point .
we extended our strategy to perform temporal analysis comparing p <dig> data to either p21-nrl-wildtype  or p21-nrl-knockout  retinae, which predicted that the ko retina would have compromised vasculature.
