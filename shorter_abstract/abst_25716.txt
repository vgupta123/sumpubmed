in this study we used a combination of comparative genomics, cloning and transfection assays to evaluate potential regulatory elements located in intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene.
we have also demonstrated that two of these regions can regulate transcriptional activity in vitro.
no homologous sequences have been found at the recombination regions; but dnase i hypersensitive sites  have been mapped to the areas of the genes involved in t. presence of dhs sites is commonly associated with regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers and silencers, among others.
taken together our results suggest that intron  <dig> of the runx <dig> gene contains multiple potential cis-regulatory elements.
our results demonstrate that the identified regions can indeed regulate transcription of a reporter gene in a distance and position independent manner; moreover, their transcriptional effect is cell type specific.
human runx <dig> gene is one of the most frequent target for chromosomal translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia  and acute lymphoid leukemia .
