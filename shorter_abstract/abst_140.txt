the lightweight software solution allows the user to easily take advantage of advanced back-end database structures by providing a programming and graphical user interface to answer biological questions.
the jcoast software tool was primarily designed to analyse and compare genome sequences of prokaryotes.
jcoast is available at the project homepage.
jcoast offers individual, cross genome-, and metagenome analysis, and assists the biologist in exploration of large and complex datasets.
based on a pre-computed gendb database project, jcoast offers a flexible graphical user interface , as well as an application programming interface  that facilitates back-end data access.
jcoast combines all functions required for the mining, annotation, and interpretation of genomic data.
