finally, gene ontology analysis of this early stage shows that dis <dig> regulates transcripts related to extracellular structure and remodelling, neurogenesis, and nucleotide metabolism.
this study inquires whether dis <dig> is required for drosophila development and viability and how dis <dig> regulates the transcriptome in the developing fly.
in order to determine whether dis3kd fly phenotypes were a consequence of disrupting developmentally regulated rna turnover, we performed rna deep sequencing analysis on total rna isolated from developmentally staged animals.
we conclude that dis <dig> is essential for early drosophila melanogaster development and has specific and important stage-specific roles in regulating rna metabolism.
using transgenic flies, we show that dis <dig> knock down  retards growth, induces melanotic tumor formation, and ultimately results in 2nd instar larval lethality.
in showing for the first time that dis <dig> is required for the development of a multicellular organism, our work provides mechanistic insight into how dis3—either independent of or associated with the rna processing exosome—participates in cell type-specific rna turnover in metazoan development.
