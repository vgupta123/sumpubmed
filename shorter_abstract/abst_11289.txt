finally, using pca, multi-trait gs prediction models were developed.
principle component scores as representatives of multi-trait gs prediction models produced surprising results where negatively correlated traits could be concurrently selected for using pca <dig> and pca <dig>
while the within-site gs prediction accuracies were high, the results clearly indicate that single-site gs models ability to predict other sites are unreliable supporting the utilization of multi-site approach.
genomic selection  in forestry can substantially reduce the length of breeding cycle and increase gain per unit time through early selection and greater selection intensity, particularly for traits of low heritability and late expression.
the incorporation of genomic information in quantitative genetics analyses produced more realistic heritability estimates as half-sib pedigree tended to inflate the additive genetic variance and subsequently both heritability and gain estimates.

genotyping-by-sequencing was used to genotype  <dig>  interior spruce trees representing  <dig> open-pollinated families planted over three sites in british columbia, canada.
gs prediction accuracies for multi-site were high and better than those of single-sites while multi-site predictability produced the lowest accuracies reflecting type-b genetic correlations and deemed unreliable.
prediction accuracies obtained for all traits greatly support the integration of gs in tree breeding.
affordable next-generation sequencing technologies made it possible to genotype large numbers of trees at a reasonable cost.
the rr-blup gs prediction model produced better accuracies than the grr indicating that the genetic architecture for these traits is complex.
single- and multi-site gs prediction models were developed using the ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor  and the generalized ridge regression  to test different assumption about trait architecture.
four imputation algorithms were compared , singular value decomposition , expectation maximization , and a newly derived, family-based k-nearest neighbor ).
principle component scores provided an opportunity for the concurrent selection of traits with different phenotypic optima.
