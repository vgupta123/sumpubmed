fr4d <dig> was found to be predominantly expressed in cd4+cd25+ treg cells.
overexpression of fr4d <dig> in cd4+cd25+ treg cells in vitro stimulated proliferation, which may modulate the ability of these cells to bind and incorporate folic acid.
our results suggested that high levels of fr4d <dig> may be critical to support the substantial proliferative capacity of treg cells.
folate receptor  <dig>  is expressed at high levels in transforming growth factor-beta -induced tregs and natural tregs.
regulatory t cells  are required for proper maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis.
