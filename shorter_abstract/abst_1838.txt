in this study, we offer a rapid and simple method to extract sufficient amounts of high quality total rna from approximately  <dig> Î¼l of whole blood collected via a fingerstick using a modified protocol of the commercially available qiagen paxgene rna blood kit.
recently, there have been significant improvements in whole blood rna isolation techniques which, through stabilization of rna at the time of sample collection, avoid bias and artifacts introduced during sample handling.
mice, where larger sample collections often require sacrificing the animal.
the clinical and field testing advantages of obtaining reliable and reproducible gene expression data from a fingerstick are many; it is less invasive, time saving, more mobile, and eliminates the need of a trained phlebotomist.
from two sets of fingerstick collections, about  <dig> ul whole blood collected via finger lancet and capillary tube, we recovered an average of  <dig>  ng total rna with an average rin of  <dig> .
our comparisons of rna quality and gene expression data of the fingerstick method with traditionally processed sample workflows demonstrate excellent rna quality from the capillary collection as well as very high correlations of gene expression data.
the cdna hybridized to affymetrix hg-u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechips had an average % present call of  <dig> %.
despite these improvements, current human whole blood rna stabilization/isolation kits are limited by the requirement of a venous blood sample of at least  <dig>  ml.
furthermore, this method could also be employed in small animal studies, i.e.
while fingerstick blood collection has been used for many different assays, there has yet to be a kit developed to isolate high quality rna for use in gene expression studies from such small human samples.
whole genome gene expression profiling has revolutionized research in the past decade especially with the advent of microarrays.
both fingerstick collections were highly correlated with r <dig> values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .
similarly both fingerstick collections were highly correlated to the venous collection with r <dig> values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for fingerstick collection  <dig> and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for fingerstick collection  <dig>
the post-amplification yields for  <dig> ng of total rna averaged at  <dig>  ug cdna.
