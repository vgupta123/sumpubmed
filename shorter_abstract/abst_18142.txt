here we examine the impact of male receptivity-suppressing factors and nutrient donations on female longevity and lifetime reproductive output in the bushcricket requena verticalis.
consumption of male nutrient donations does not appear to ameliorate this longevity cost, and there was no effect of nutrient provisioning on female lifetime fecundity.
males of many species transfer compounds in the ejaculate that manipulate female reproductive physiology to increase male reproductive success.
in contrast, in some species ejaculates also contain nutrients used by females for somatic maintenance and increased reproductive output.
these results indicate that nutrient provisioning does not provide a resolution to sexual conflict over female receptivity in this bushcricket species.
