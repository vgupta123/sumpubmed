the identified lung-specific mirnas from this work will facilitate functional studies of mirnas during normal physiological and pathophysiological processes of the lung.
<dig> selected mirnas were verified by northern blot analysis.
these small rnas play important roles in tissue development, cell differentiation and proliferation, lipid and fat metabolism, stem cells, exocytosis, diseases and cancers.
statistical analysis using significant analysis of microarray  and tukey honestly significant difference  revealed  <dig> mirnas  expressed specifically in the lung and  <dig> mirnas co-expressed in the lung and another organ.
in this study, we utilized a rat mirna microarray containing  <dig> mirna probes, printed in-house, to detect the expression of mirnas in the rat lung compared to the rat heart, brain, liver, kidney and spleen.
