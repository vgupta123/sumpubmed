human rhinoviruses  and enteroviruses  which are frequent causes of fri. resequencing pathogen microarray technology has demonstrated potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously, but a high confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking.
the results demonstrated that the newly designed rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> can provide comprehensive and specific analysis of hrv and hev samples which implicates that this design strategy will be applicable for other genetically diverse viruses.
febrile respiratory illness  has a high impact on public health and global economics and poses a difficult challenge for differential diagnosis.
using hrv and hev as test cases, we assess a general design strategy for detecting and serotyping genetically diverse viruses.
this study provides a fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection and differential identification of genetically diverse rna viruses with a minimal number of prototype sequences.
all strains were successfully detected and identified at least to species level.
<dig> hrv strains and  <dig> hev strains could be further differentiated to serotype level.
a minimal number of probe sequences , which were potentially capable of detecting all serotypes of hrv and hev, were determined and implemented on the resequencing pathogen microarray rpm-flu v.30/ <dig> .
