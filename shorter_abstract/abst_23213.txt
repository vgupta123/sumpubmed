our experiments reveal that teleost-specific duplicated hif-α genes played different roles under hypoxic conditions, and hif-1αb may be the most important regulator in the adaptation of schizothoracine fish to the environment of the tibetan plateau.

each hif-1αb was found to significantly upregulate luciferase activity under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, which indicated that the hif-1αb protein was more stable than other hif-αs.
in addition, a schizothoracine-specific mutation was observed in the codd domain of the specialized and highly specialized schizothoracine fish hif-1αb, which is the proline hydroxylation motif mutated into pxxlap.
all the deduced hif-α proteins contain the main domains , also found in humans.
all deduced hif-α proteins of schizothoracine fish contain important domains, like their mammalian counterparts, and each hif-α is shorter than that of human.
hypoxia-inducible factor  is a master regulator that mediates major changes in gene expression under hypoxic conditions.
evidence suggests a cyprinidae-specific deletion, specifically, a conserved proline hydroxylation motif lxxlap, in the nodd domain of schizothoracine fish hif-1αa.
though hif family has been identified in many organisms, little is known about this family in schizothoracine fish.
duplicated hif-α  genes were identified in schizothoracine fish.
standard and stochastic branch-site codon model analysis indicated that only hif-1αb has undergone positive selection, which may have led to changes in function.
to confirm this hypothesis, hif-αs tagged with myc were transfected into hek 293 t cells.
