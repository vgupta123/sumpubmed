to explore the limitations to finishing a poxvirus genome from short reads, we first analyze the repetitive regions in a monkeypox genome and evaluate genome assembly on the simulated reads.
to date the large, complete poxvirus genomes have not been studied comprehensively in terms of applying wgs techniques and evaluating genome assembly algorithms.
we also report on procedures and insights relevant to the assembly  of genomes.
finally, we propose a neural network method  to “finish” the process by closing gaps remaining after conventional assembly, as the final stage in a protocol to elucidate clinical poxvirus genomic sequences.
such finished sequences may enable clinicians to track genetic distance between viral isolates that provides a powerful epidemiological tool.
this work highlights the feasibility of finishing real, complex genomes by systematically analyzing genetic characteristics, thus remedying existing assembly shortcomings with a neural network method.
the notorious smallpox disease has been eradicated and the virus contained, but its simian sister, monkeypox is an emerging, untreatable infectious disease, killing  <dig> to 10 % of its human victims.
the protocol may prove useful in any clinical viral isolate  and especially useful in genomes confounded by many global and local repetitive sequences embedded in them.
