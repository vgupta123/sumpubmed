anti-ftsz pnas resulted in swelling of bacterial cells.
anti-meca pna at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm reduced meca mrna in mrsa and mrsp .
clinical mrsa and mrsp strains of high oxacillin resistance were treated with pnas and assayed for reduction in colony forming units on oxacillin plates, reduction in target gene mrna levels, and cell size.
scrambled pna controls did not affect mrsa but sensitized mrsp moderately to oxacillin without affecting mrna levels.
anti-ftsz pna at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm reduced ftsz mrna in mrsa and mrsp, respectively .
antibiotic resistance genes can be targeted by antisense agents, which can reduce their expression and thus restore cellular susceptibility to existing antibiotics.
antisense inhibitors can be gene and pathogen specific, or designed to inhibit a group of bacteria having conserved sequences within resistance genes.
antisense pnas specific for conserved regions of the mobilisable gene meca, and the growth essential gene, ftsz, were designed.
the antisense pnas effects observed provide in vitro proof of concept that this approach can be used to reverse β-lactam resistance in staphylococci.
