to identify new genetic variants and further elucidate the genetic basis of fl, a meta-analysis was performed of the top  <dig> snps associated with fl risk from two gwas in the us, denmark and sweden , with independent validation in  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls.
rs <dig> and rs <dig> in the hla class ii region were validated and inversely associated with fl risk .
b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma represents a diverse group of hematological malignancies, of which follicular lymphoma  is one of the most common subtypes.
our results add further support to the major role of hla genetic variation in the pathogenesis of fl.
follicular lymphoma genome-wide association studies human leukocyte antigen meta-analysis
in recent genome-wide association studies  of fl, several genetic susceptibility loci have been identified on chromosome 6p <dig>   and 6p <dig>   in the human leukocyte antigen class i and class ii regions.
rs <dig>  which is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs <dig> , was no longer associated with fl after conditioning on rs <dig>  the rs <dig> association was independent of established fl snps, but not of the hla-dpb1* <dig> allele.
