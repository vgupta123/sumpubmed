the egf-cfc family member cryptic, that functions as a co-receptor for some tgf-beta ligands, is developmentally expressed in higher mammals and mutations in the gene cause loss or change in left-right axis asymmetry.
using promoter-analyses tools, we found strong evidence that the developmentally essential transcription factor snail binds to the human cryptic-promoter.
we cloned the promoter-region of human cryptic in a reporter gene and observed decreased cryptic-promoter activation upon increasing snail expression.
snail represses the expression of human cryptic and therefore, might affect the signaling via nodal that has previously been demonstrated to specify the left-right axis using the egf-cfc co-receptors.
finally, we demonstrate using gel-shift assay that snail in nuclear extract of panc <dig> cells interacts with the promoter-construct bearing putative snail binding sites and confirm this finding using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
further, the expression of cryptic is down-regulated upon exogenous snail expression, validating the reporter assays and the previously identified role of snail as a transcriptional repressor.
