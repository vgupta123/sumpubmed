through n and c-terminal truncations, targeted internal deletions, and specific amino acid mutations of the piggybac tpase open reading frame, we found that not only is the psortii-predicted nls required for the tpase to enter the nucleus of s <dig> cells, but there are additional requirements for negatively charged amino acids a short length upstream of this region for nuclear localization.
a psortii analysis of the tpase amino acid sequence predicts a bipartite nuclear localization signal  near the c-terminus, just upstream of a putative znf .
the piggybac transposable element is a popular tool for germ-line transgenesis of eukaryotes.
we fused the piggybac tpase upstream of and in-frame with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein  in the drosophila melanogaster inducible metallothionein protein.
