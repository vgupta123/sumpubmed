the mass sequence data for wheat–fungus interaction generated in this study provides a powerful platform for future functional and molecular research on wheat–fungus interactions.
the main objective of our study was to identify co-regulated mrnas that show a change in expression pattern after inoculation with pst or bgt, and to identify mrnas specific to the fungal stress response.
infection by bgt triggered a more robust alteration in gene expression in n <dig> compared with the response to pst infection.
similar mechanisms and gene transcripts are assumed to be involved in the host defense response because both pathogens are biotrophic fungi.
the transcriptome of the hexaploid wheat line n <dig> inoculated with the chinese pst race cyr  <dig> was compared with that of the same line inoculated with bgt race e <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  and 3 days post-inoculation.
an array of overlapping gene clusters with distinctive expression patterns provided insight into the regulatory differences in the responses to bgt and pst infection.
genomic analysis revealed that the wheat genome shared some microbial genetic fragments, which were specifically induced in response to bgt and pst infection.
in the plant–pathogen interaction pathway, n <dig> activated a higher number of genes and pathways in response to bgt infection than in response to pst invasion.
