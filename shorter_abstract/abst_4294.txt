several features are known to correlate with the gc-content in the human genome, including recombination rate, gene density and distance to telomere.
we use partial correlations to construct partially directed graphs for the following four variables: gc-content, recombination rate, exon density and distance-to-telomere.
recombination rate and exon density are unconditionally uncorrelated, but become inversely correlated by conditioning on gc-content.
this pattern indicates a model where recombination rate and exon density are two independent causes of gc-content variation.
causal inference and graphical models are useful methods to understand genome evolution and the mechanisms of isochore evolution in the human genome.
