by analyzing mitochondrial dna sequences and nuclear microsatellite loci, we show that there are at least six genealogically distinct lineages of giraffe in africa, with little evidence of interbreeding between them.
however, geographic variation in traits such as pelage pattern is clearly evident across the range in sub-saharan africa and abrupt transition zones between different pelage types are typically not associated with extrinsic barriers to gene flow, suggesting reproductive isolation.
some of these lineages appear to be maintained in the absence of contemporary barriers to gene flow, possibly by differences in reproductive timing or pelage-based assortative mating, suggesting that populations usually recognized as subspecies have a long history of reproductive isolation.
our results have significant implications for giraffe conservation, and imply separate in situ and ex situ management, not only of pelage morphs, but also of local populations.
further, five of the six putative lineages also contain genetically discrete populations, yielding at least  <dig> genetically distinct populations.
