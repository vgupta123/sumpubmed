for an evolutionary comparison, we now studied the arrangements of chromosome territories and centromere regions in six mouse cell types  with fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
the distribution of chromosome territories and pericentromeric heterochromatin changed during differentiation, leading to distinct cell type specific distribution patterns.
notably, the position of chromosome territories relative to each other was very variable.
all mouse cell types showed non-random correlations of radial chromosome territory positions with gene density as well as with chromosome size.
positional differences in mouse cell nuclei were less pronounced compared to human cell nuclei in agreement with smaller differences in chromosome size and gene density.
chromosome territory arrangements according to chromosome size and gene density provide common, evolutionary conserved themes in both, human and mouse cell types.
similarities as well as differences in higher order chromatin arrangements of human cell types were previously reported.
both species evolved pronounced differences in karyotypes after their last common ancestors lived about  <dig> million years ago and thus seem particularly suited to elucidate common and cell type specific themes of higher order chromatin arrangements in mammals.
we exclude a strict dependence of these differences on nuclear shape.
our findings are incompatible with a previously reported model of parental genome separation.
