nearly  <dig>  assembled transcript sequences are used to identify genes and obtain polymorphic snp and microsatellite markers.
the sex phenotype maps to sablefish lg <dig> of the male map.
the first genomic resources for sablefish provide a foundation for further studies.
sex-specific markers and sequence insertions are identified immediately upstream of the gene gonadal-soma derived factor , the master sex determinant locus in the medaka species oryzias luzonensis.
the identification of sex-specific insertions immediately upstream of a known master sex determinant implicates gsdf as an excellent candidate for the master sex determinant for sablefish.
the observed level of conserved synteny and comparative mapping will allow the use of the stickleback genome in future genetic studies on sablefish and other related fish, particularly as a guide to whole-genome assembly.
the development of genetic tools, including polymorphic markers and a linkage map will allow for the successful development of future broodstock and mapping of phenotypes of interest.
over  <dig>  transcripts are presented, and the genetic map represents, as far as we can determine, the first linkage map for a member of the scorpaeniformes.

the sablefish  is an economically important species in commercial fisheries of the north pacific and an emerging species in aquaculture.
<dig> transcribed polymorphic loci from two sablefish families produce a map of  <dig> linkage groups.
aside from a handful of sequences in ncbi and a few published microsatellite markers, little is known about the genetics of this species.
we show significant conserved synteny and conservation of gene-order between the threespine stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus and sablefish.
