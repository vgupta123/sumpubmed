moreover, the pathway-based approach had a clinical advantage in terms of discriminating the high-risk subgroup  among patients  with small hcc .
in relation to the public hbv- and public hepatitis c virus -positive hcc datasets, we detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  common recurrence-associated pathways, respectively.
through multivariate analysis, these recurrence-associated pathways were identified as an independent prognostic factor  along with tumor number, tumor size and edmondsonâ€™s grade.
the pathways identified were additionally successfully applied to discriminate subgroups depending on recurrence risk within the public hcc datasets.
to overcome the limitations of individual gene-based analysis, we applied a pathway-based approach for analysis of hcc recurrence.
by implementing a permutation-based semi-supervised principal component analysis algorithm using the optimal principal component, we selected sixty-four pathways associated with hepatitis b virus -positive hcc recurrence , from our microarray dataset composed of  <dig> hbv-positive hccs.
non-supervised clustering of the  <dig> recurrence-associated pathways facilitated the classification of hcc patients into high- and low-risk subgroups, based on risk of recurrence .
using pathway-based analysis, we successfully identified the pathways involved in recurrence of hbv-positive hcc that may be effectively used as prognostic markers.
despite the recent identification of several prognostic gene signatures, the lack of common genes among experimental cohorts has posed a considerable challenge in uncovering the molecular basis underlying hepatocellular carcinoma  recurrence for application in clinical purposes.
however, overlap of recurrence-associated genes between datasets was rare, further supporting the utility of the pathway-based approach for recurrence analysis between different hcc datasets.
