they are classified among the six major biological warfare agents by the centers for disease control.
in this study, starting from a macaque immunized with the recombinant heavy chain of bont/a <dig> , an immune antibody phage-display library was generated and antibody fragments  with nanomolar affinity were isolated and further characterized.
after a three-round panning,  <dig> antibody fragments with affinity better than 10Â nm were isolated.
botulism specific treatment requires injections of antitoxins, usually of equine origin and thus poorly tolerated.
botulism is a naturally occurring disease, mainly caused by the ingestion of food contaminated by the botulinum neurotoxins .
botulinum neurotoxins are the most lethal.
the neutralization capacities of these scfvs were analyzed in the mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm assay.
this exocytosis inhibition induces a flaccid paralysis progressively affecting all the muscles and generally engendering a respiratory distress.
three of them neutralized bont/a <dig> efficiently and two cross-neutralized bont/a <dig> and bont/a <dig> subtypes in the mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm assay.
bonts are also utilized in medicine, mainly for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders, preventing large scale vaccination.
