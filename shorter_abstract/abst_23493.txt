here we introduce vector analysis  as a simple, yet principled, approach to comparing expression responses in different experimental backgrounds.
vector analysis is a flexible, easy-to-use technique to compare gene expression patterns in different experimental backgrounds.
the application of va to a real dataset, comparing nutrient starvation responses in wild type and mutant arabidopsis plants, reveals that consistent patterns of expression behavior are present in the data and are reliably detected by the algorithm.
by focusing on dynamic responses rather than a direct comparison of static expression levels, this type of study allows a finer dissection of primary and secondary regulatory effects in the various backgrounds.
usually, results of such experiments are presented in the form of venn diagrams, which are intuitive and visually appealing, but lack a statistical foundation.
gene expression studies increasingly compare expression responses between different experimental backgrounds .
