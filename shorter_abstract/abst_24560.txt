we tested our aligner on synthetic data, a bisulfite-converted arabidopsis library, and human libraries generated from two different experimental protocols.
the results demonstrate that among the aligners tested, bs seeker is more versatile and faster.
we have developed bs seeker, an approach that converts the genome to a three-letter alphabet and uses bowtie to align bisulfite-treated reads to a reference genome.
when mapping to the human genome, bs seeker generates alignments significantly faster than rmap and bsmap.
furthermore, bs seeker is the only alignment tool that can explicitly account for tags which are generated by certain library construction protocols.
bs seeker provides fast and accurate mapping of bisulfite-converted reads.
bisulfite sequencing using next generation sequencers yields genome-wide measurements of dna methylation at single nucleotide resolution.
we evaluated the performance of our approach and compared it to other bisulfite aligners.
