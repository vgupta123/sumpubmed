for instance, we showed that one of the misassembled regions mapped to the poll locus, which affected the annotation of positional candidate genes in a gwas case study for polledness in nellore .
although this represents a small fraction of the reference sequence, these poorly assembled segments can lead to severe implications to local genome context.
we developed a heuristic process to identify misassembly signatures, applied it to the bovine reference genome assembly  and presented the consequences of misassemblies in two case studies.
additionally, we found that poorly performing markers in imputation mapped to putative misassembled regions, and that correction of marker positions based on ld was capable to recover imputation accuracy.
this heuristic approach can be useful to cross validate reference assemblies and to filter out markers located at low confidence genomic regions before conducting downstream analyses.
