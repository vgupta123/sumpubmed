we generated a drosophila strain that expresses e-apc  tagged with green fluorescent protein  and we analysed its junctional association with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  experiments in live embryos.
here, we ask whether the junctional association of e-apc is stable, or whether e-apc shuttles between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.
in drosophila epithelial cells, the predominant apc relative  is concentrated at the apicolateral adherens junctions.
this revealed that the junctional association of gfp-e-apc in epithelial cells is highly dynamic, and is far less stable than that of the structural components of the adherens junctions, e-cadherin, Î±-catenin and armadillo.
finally, we show that gfp-e-apc forms dynamic patches at the apical plasma membrane of late embryonic epidermal cells that form denticles, and that it shuttles up and down the axons of the optic lobe.
genetic analysis indicates that this junctional association is critical for the function of e-apc in wnt signalling and in cellular adhesion.
the shuttling of gfp-e-apc to and from the plasma membrane is unaltered in mutants of drosophila glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> , which mimic constitutive wingless signalling.
however, the stability of e-apc is greatly reduced in these mutants, explaining their apparent delocalisation from the plasma membrane as previously observed.
