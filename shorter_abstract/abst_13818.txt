to meet these needs, we enhanced the labkey server platform, formerly known as cpas.
diverse research organizations have adopted and adapted labkey server, including consortia within the global hiv enterprise.
atlas is an installation of labkey server that has been tailored to serve these consortia.
it is in production use and demonstrates the core capabilities of labkey server.
the atlas installation of labkey server demonstrates the utility of the labkey platform for collaborative research.
stable, supported builds of labkey server are freely available for download at http://www.labkey.org.
recent enhancements support:  submitting specimens requests across collaborating organizations  graphically defining new experimental data types, metadata and wizards for data collection  transitioning experimental results from a multiplicity of spreadsheets to custom tables in a shared database  securely organizing, integrating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing diverse data types, from clinical records to specimens to complex assays  interacting dynamically with external data sources  tracking study participants and cohorts over time  developing custom interfaces using client libraries  authoring custom visualizations in a built-in r scripting environment.
atlas now has over  <dig>  active user accounts originating from approximately  <dig> countries and  <dig> organizations.
these tools must enable researchers to organize and integrate heterogeneous data early in the discovery process, standardize processes, gain new insights into pooled data and collaborate securely.
sharing data, analysis tools and infrastructure can speed the efforts of large research consortia by enhancing efficiency and enabling new insights.
new, end-to-end software tools for data and specimen management are necessary to achieve the ambitious goals of such alliances.
