therefore, computational methods for predicting ppis have an important role.
high-throughput biological technologies can be used to identify new ppis, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and tedious.
for the past years, an increasing number of computational methods such as protein structure-based approaches have been proposed for predicting ppis.
therefore, it is of much significance to develop computational methods which only use the information of protein amino acids sequence.
protein-protein interactions  are essential to most biological processes.

in addition, the prediction performance in the comparison experiments shows the well cooperation between the combined feature and wsrc.
this method, cross-validated on the ppis datasets of saccharomyces cerevisiae, human and h. pylori, achieves an excellent results with accuracies as high as  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, significantly better than previously proposed methods.
the outstanding results yield by our model that the proposed feature extraction method combing two kinds of descriptors have strong expression ability and are expected to provide comprehensive and effective information for machine learning-based classification models.
the main improvements come from the use of a novel protein sequence representation by combining continuous wavelet descriptor and chou’s pseudo amino acid composition , and from adopting weighted sparse representation based classifier .
