using mirna context-specific influence as a functional signature is promising to identify functional associations between mirnas and other gene signatures, and thus advance our understanding of mirna mode of action.
a useful step for understanding their functional role is characterizing their influence on the protein context of the targets.
elastic-net regression was used to build functional associations between context-specific effect of mirnas and other gene signatures  by identifying mirnas whose targets are enriched in gene lists.
as a proof of concept, elastic-net regression was applied on lists of genes downregulated upon pre-mirna transfection, and successfully identified the treated mirna.
elastic-net regression is used as a model to construct functional associations between mirna signatures and other gene signatures.
in the current study we utilized the power of regularized regression models to construct functional associations between gene signatures.
mirna functional signatures can greatly facilitate mirna research to uncover new functional associations between mirnas and diseases, drugs or pathways.
the combined direct and indirect mirna influence is defined as context-specific effects of mirnas, and is used to identify regulatory effects of mirnas on curated gene signatures.
integrating context-specific effects of mirnas on a protein network reveals more significant mirna enrichment in prostate gene signatures compared to mirna direct targets.
defining mirna context-specific functional gene signature by integrating the downstream effect of mirnas demonstrates better performance compared to the mirna signature alone .
