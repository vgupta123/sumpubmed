analysis of the proteomic signatures of stressed c. violaceum indicates that nutrient-starvation and ph stress can cause changes in the expression of the c. violaceum receptors, transporters, and proteins involved with biosynthetic pathways, molecule recycling, energy production.
chromobacterium violaceum grew best in ph neutral, nutrient-rich medium ; however, the total protein mass recovered from stressed bacteria cultures was always higher than the total protein mass recovered from our reference culture.
the diversity of proteins expressed  was seen to be highest in the reference cultures, suggesting that stress reduces the overall range of proteins expressed by c. violaceum.
our findings complement the recent publication of the c. violeaceum genome sequence and could help with the future commercial exploitation of c. violeaceum.
stress-related expression changes were noted for c. violaceum proteins related to the previously characterized bacterial proteins: dnak, groel- <dig>  rhs, ef-tu, ef-p; mcp, homogentisate  <dig> -dioxygenase, arginine deiminase and the atp synthase β-subunit protein as well as for the ribosomal protein subunits l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  the ability of c. violaceum to adapt its cellular mechanics to sub-optimal growth and protein production conditions was well illustrated by its regulation of ribosomal protein subunits.
chromobacterium violaceum  occurs abundantly in a variety of ecosystems, including ecosystems that place the bacterium under stress.
