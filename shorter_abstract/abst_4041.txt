the cell broadband engine , a heterogeneous multi-core processor, provides power-efficient and cost-effective high-performance computing.
we show how a typical image analysis and visualisation problem, the multimodal registration of 2d cross-sections and 3d datasets, benefits from the multi-core based implementation of the alignment algorithm.
the results demonstrate that the cbe processor in a playstation  <dig> accelerates computational intensive multimodal registration, which is of great importance in biological/medical image processing.
we discuss several cbe-based optimisation methods and compare our results to standard solutions.
we evaluate the cbe-driven playstation  <dig> as a high performance, cost-effective computing platform by adapting a multimodal alignment procedure to several characteristic hardware properties.
recent trends in processor architecture combine multiple cores into a single chip to improve overall performance.
one application area is image analysis and visualisation, in particular registration of 2d cross-sections into 3d image datasets.
the playstation  <dig> as a low cost cbe-based platform offers an efficient option to conventional hardware to solve computational problems in image processing and bioinformatics.
the optimisations are based on partitioning, vectorisation, branch reducing and loop unrolling techniques with special attention to 32-bit multiplies and limited local storage on the computing units.
