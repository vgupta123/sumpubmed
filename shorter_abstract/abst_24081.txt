with these new signature proteins,  <dig> bacteria and archaea were found that utilized these proteins, likely as part of the new se utilization trait.
these studies suggest the occurrence of a third se utilization trait in bacteria and archaea.
in this study, we conducted comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses to characterize genes involved in se utilization.
candidate genes identified included sela/selb and ybbb that define sec and seu pathways, respectively, and nadh oxidoreductase that is predicted to generate a seld substrate.
selenophosphate synthetase  is required for both utilization traits.
metabolic labeling of one organism containing an orphan seld, enterococcus faecalis, with 75se revealed a protein containing labile se species that could be released by treatment with reducing agents, suggesting non-sec utilization of se in this organism.
investigation of seld neighboring genes in these organisms revealed a sira-like protein and two hypothetical proteins hp <dig> and hp <dig> that were strongly linked to a novel se utilization.
