in this study, we investigated the most common close range vocalisation of lar gibbons , the ‘hoo’ call.
our study provides evidence that lar gibbons are able to generate significant, context-dependent acoustic variation within their main social call, which potentially allows recipients to make inferences about the external events experienced by the caller.
we found that ‘hoo’ calls were emitted by both sexes in a variety of contexts, including feeding, separation from group members, encountering predators, interacting with neighbours, or as part of duet songs by the mated pair.
in this sense, this study is of direct relevance for the on-going debate about the nature and origins of vocally-based referential communication and the evolution of human speech.
acoustic analyses revealed that ‘hoo’ calls varied in a number of spectral parameters as a function of the different contexts.
communicating about different events by producing subtle acoustic variation within some call types appears to be a general feature of primate communication, which can increase the expressive power of vocal signals within the constraints of limited vocal tract flexibility that is typical for all non-human primates.

close range calls are produced by many animals during intra-specific interactions, such as during home range defence, playing, begging for food, and directing others.
