we performed a large scale study of barley mirnas through deep sequencing of small rnas extracted from leaves of two barley cultivars.
in addition, we found that the use of a large dataset of almost  <dig> million reads permits the use of read abundance distributions along putative precursor sequences as a practical tool for isolating mirnas in a large background of reads originating from other non-coding and coding rnas.
this study therefore provides a generic approach for discovering novel mirnas where no genome sequence is available.
systematic investigations performed in species with sequenced genomes such as arabidopsis, rice, poplar and brachypodium have provided insights into the evolutionary relationships of this class of small rnas among plants.
our study, the first large scale investigation of small rnas in barley, has identified up to  <dig> mirnas.
