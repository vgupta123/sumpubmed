primary annotations based on sequence similarity are linked to networks of systematic annotation in gene ontology  and the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and can be queried and computationally utilized in downstream analyses.
resources such as mass-produced microarrays and the computational tools linking these data to functional annotation at the system and pathway level are rarely available for non-model species.
in a case study, a set of genes, that had statistically significant regression between gene expression levels and environmental temperature along the atlantic coast, shows a statistically significant  enrichment in genes associated with amine metabolism.
the methods described have application for functional genomics studies, particularly among non-model organisms.
the web interface for funnybase can be accessed at .
this type of "systems-level" analysis is critical to the understanding of patterns of gene expression that underlie biological processes.
