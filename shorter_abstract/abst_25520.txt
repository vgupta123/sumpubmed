in rediscovery experiments, we deleted  <dig>  cassette instances over  <dig> experiments and correctly relabelled  <dig> % , with no false positives.
the method is complementary to existing automatic annotation systems which operate at the sequence level.
gene discovery algorithms typically examine sequence data for low level patterns.
the system achieved Îº =  <dig>  annotation agreement with an expert gold standard of  <dig> sequences.
using grammars we were able to represent heuristic background knowledge about large and complex structures in dna.
the discovery and annotation of antibiotic resistance genes in such cassettes is essential for effective monitoring of antibiotic resistance patterns and formulation of public health antibiotic prescription policies.
the algorithm was applied to the discovery of gene cassettes associated with integrons.
we discovered two new putative gene cassettes using the method, from  <dig> integron features and  <dig> genbank sequences.
importantly, we were also able to use the context embedded in the model to discover new putative antibiotic resistance gene cassettes.
a novel method to computationally discover higher order dna structures is presented, using a context sensitive grammar.
