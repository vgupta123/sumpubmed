the present study investigated the role of gata <dig> protein in the control of the cellular and molecular response of human keratinocytes exposed to a  <dig> cgy dose of x-rays.
taken together, these data indicate that gata <dig> is an important regulator of the cellular and molecular response of epidermal cells to very low doses of radiation.
functional annotation revealed enrichment in genes known to be involved in chaperone activity, tgfÎ² signalling and stress response.
even if the biological effects of low-level radiation have been intensely debated and investigated, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular response to low doses remain largely unknown.
the impact of gata <dig> knock-down on the transcriptome of x-ray irradiated cells was also investigated, using oligonucleotide microarrays to assess changes between  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-irradiation in normal vs gata <dig> knock-down backgrounds; transcriptome response was found to be completely altered in gata <dig> knock-down cells, with a strong induction/repression peak  <dig> h after irradiation.
to go further into the role of gata <dig> after ionizing radiation exposure, we studied the cellular and molecular consequences of radiation in gata <dig> knock-down cells.
the general population is constantly exposed to low levels of radiation through natural, occupational or medical irradiation.
