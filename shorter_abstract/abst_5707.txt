in this work, we have used a recently described melon microarray for transcriptome profiling of two melon cultivars infected with two strains of melon necrotic spot virus  that only differ on their 3′-untranslated regions.
the go categories that were significantly affected were clearly different for the different virus/host combinations.
melon plant tissues from the cultivars tendral or planters jumbo were locally infected with either mnsv-mα <dig> or mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> and analysed in a time-course experiment.
likewise, mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> specifically deregulated  <dig> and  <dig> genes in tendral and planters jumbo, respectively.
grouping genes according to their patterns of expression allowed for the identification of two groups that were specifically deregulated by mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> with respect to mnsv-mα <dig> in tendral, and one group that was antagonistically regulated in planters jumbo vs. tendral after mnsv-mα5/3’ <dig> infection.
strain-specific changes, as well as cultivar-specific changes, were identified by profiling the transcriptomes of plants from two melon cultivars infected with two mnsv strains.
genes in these three groups belonged to diverse functional classes, and no obvious regulatory commonalities were identified.
when data on mnsv-mα5/tendral infections were compared to equivalent data on cucumber mosaic virus or watermelon mosaic virus infections, cytokinin-o-glucosyltransferase <dig> was identified as the only gene that was deregulated by all three viruses, with infection dynamics correlating with the amplitude of transcriptome remodeling.
no obvious regulatory features shared among deregulated genes have been identified, pointing toward regulation through differential functional pathways.
