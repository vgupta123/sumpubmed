genome-wide association studies  are becoming routine in human, animal and plant genetics to understand the connection between naturally occurring genotypic and phenotypic variation.
both qualitative and quantitative phenotypes can be generated and it is possible to partition phenotypic variation between additive effects and epistatic interactions between causal variants.
coalescent simulations are commonly used in population genetics to simulate genotypes under different parameters and demographic models.
here, we present phenosim, a software to add a phenotype to genotypes generated in time-efficient coalescent simulations.
by using the coalescent approach to generate genotypes and phenosim to add phenotypes, the data sets can be used to assess the influence of various factors such as demography, genetic architecture or selection on the statistical power of association methods to detect causal genetic variants under a wide variety of population genetic scenarios.
phenosim is freely available from the authors' website http://evoplant.uni-hohenheim.de
there is a great interest in understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits in natural populations.
