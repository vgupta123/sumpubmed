to further explore pulmonary activin a regulation, we examined ams in bronchoalveolar lavage  from wild-type c57bl/ <dig> compared to gm-csf knockout mice which exhibit a pap-like histopathology.
both ifnγ and activin a were also reduced in gm-csf knockout mice in vivo after intratracheal instillation of lentivirus-pparγ compared to control lentivirus vector.
examination of other m <dig> markers in gm-csf knockout mice indicated intrinsic elevation of the ifnγ-regulated gene, inducible nitrogen oxide synthetase , ccl <dig>  and interleukin - <dig> compared to wild-type.
data point to ifnγ as the primary upregulator of activin a in gm-csf knockout mice which in addition, exhibit a unique mix of m1-m <dig> macrophage phenotypes.
both human pap and mouse gm-csf knockout ams are deficient in the transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma .
in sharp contrast to human pap, activin a mrna was elevated in mouse gm-csf knockout ams, and activin a protein was increased in bal fluid.
in vitro studies confirmed that ifnγ stimulated activin a in wild-type ams while antibody to ifnγ reduced activin a in gm-csf knockout ams.
investigation of potential causative factors for activin a upregulation revealed intrinsic overexpression of ifnγ, a potent inducer of the m <dig> macrophage phenotype, in gm-csf knockout bal cells.
healthy human alveolar macrophages  constitutively express activin a, but ams of patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis  are deficient in activin a. pap is an autoimmune lung disease characterized by neutralizing autoantibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor .
