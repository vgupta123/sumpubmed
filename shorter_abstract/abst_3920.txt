an analysis of homozygosity in the gs:sfhs sample revealed a very similar pattern to other european populations.
the generation scotland scottish family health study  includes  <dig>  participants from across scotland with records for many health-related traits and environmental covariates.
these findings illuminate the history of the scottish population and have implications for further analyses such as the study of the contributions of common and rare variants to trait heritabilities and the evaluation of genomic and phenotypic prediction of disease.
we combined the genotypic information of gs:sfhs with  <dig> individuals from the  <dig> genomes project and estimated their genomic relationships.
in this study we developed a suite of analyses to disentangle the genomic differentiation within gs:sfhs individuals to describe and optimise the sample and methods for future analyses.
then, we performed principal component analyses of the resulting relationships to investigate the genomic origin of different groups.
the cohort was designed as a resource for genetic and health related research and the study of complex traits.
