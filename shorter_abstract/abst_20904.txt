funestus, and will be useful in identifying candidate genes that affect diverse ranges of phenotypes that impact on vector control, such as resistance insecticide, mosquito behavior and vector competence.
the mosquito anopheles funestus is one of the major malaria vectors in africa and yet, prior to this study, no snps have been described for this species.
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most common source of genetic variation in eukaryotic species and have become an important marker for genetic studies.
here we report a genome-wide set of snp markers for use in genetic studies on this important human disease vector.
this set of snp markers represents a useful tool for genetic studies in an.
synonymous sites within coding regions showed a higher polymorphism rate than non-coding introns or 3' and 5'flanking dna with most of the substitutions in coding regions being observed at the 3rd codon position.
transitions outnumbered transversions, at a ratio of 2: <dig>  the increased frequency of transition substitutions in coding regions is likely due to the structure of the genetic code and selective constraints.
a positive correlation in the level of polymorphism was observed between coding and non-coding regions within a gene.
dna fragments from  <dig> genes were amplified and sequenced from  <dig> specimens of an.
