consequently, we have used this algorithm to explore the erbb regulated g1/s transition pathway in certain breast cancer cells to understand the molecular mechanisms which cause these cells to become drug resistant.
additionally, it identified some molecular interactions which promote drug resistance in breast cancer cells.
however, the use of these data to reverse engineer biochemical networks has remained a challenging problem.
we propose a computational algorithm which combines a deterministic network inference method termed modular response analysis  and a statistical model selection algorithm called bayesian variable selection, to infer functional interactions in cellular signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks.

many methods have been proposed to infer biochemical network topologies from different types of biological data.
using computer simulated perturbation responses of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks from the dream challenge, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust against noise and scalable to large networks.
here, we focus on unraveling network topologies from steady state responses of biochemical networks to successive experimental perturbations.
in cases where not all network components are known, our method reveals functional interactions which are not direct but correspond to the interaction routes through unknown elements.
we also show that our method can infer network topologies using incomplete perturbation datasets.
the algorithm successfully inferred many well characterized interactions of this pathway by analyzing experimentally obtained perturbation data.
the proposed algorithm provides a robust, scalable and cost effective solution for inferring network topologies from biological data.
