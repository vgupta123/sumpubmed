lipophilic antioxidants play dual key roles in edible seeds  as preservatives of cell integrity and seed viability by preventing the oxidation of fats, and  as essential nutrients for human and animal life stock.
fabaceae have the greatest number of crop species of all plant families, and most of them are cultivated for their highly nutritious edible seeds.
an undirected change in the contents of tocopherols and fatty acids was found, with contents increasing in some species and decreasing in others, independently of the changes in carotenoids.
in some species, polyunsaturated fatty acids , α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol decreased following domestication.
the changes in carotenoids, tocopherols and fatty acids are likely side-effects of the selection for other desired traits such as the loss of seed dormancy and dispersal mechanisms, and selection for seed storability and taste.

it has been well documented that plant domestication and post-domestication evolution frequently resulted in increased seed size and palatability, and reduced seed dormancy.
here, we evaluate whether evolution of plants under cultivation has altered the integrated system formed by membranes  and lipophilic antioxidants , in the ten most economically important grain legumes and their closest wild relatives, i.e.
