only five putative nb-lrrs  showed significant increases greater than two-fold as a local response to c. polonica.
nb-lrr resistance proteins are involved in recognizing pathogens and other exogenous stressors in plants.
resistance proteins are the first step in induced defence responses and a better understanding of their regulation is important to understand the mechanisms of plant defence.
overall, local and systemic expression changes were evident only for the established resistance marker genes and palrr <dig>  the minor expression changes observed both for the followed mirnas and their predicted nb-lrr targets suggest that the expression of most nb-lrr genes are maintained close to their constitutive levels in stressed and healthy norway spruce plants.
the five mirnas showed indications of an initial local and systemic down-regulation at day  <dig>  followed by a later increase up to and beyond the constitutive levels at day  <dig>  however, the initial down-regulation was significant only for mir <dig> and mir <dig>
