three generations of barcode microarrays at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm features sizes independently identified the primary target of tunicamycin to be alg <dig>
we demonstrate that barcode microarrays with smaller features are equally capable of detecting variation in dna barcode intensity when compared to larger feature sizes within a specific microarray platform.
we show that the data obtained with  <dig> μm feature size is of comparable quality to the  <dig> μm size and propose that further shrinking of features could yield barcode microarrays with equal or greater resolving power and, more importantly, higher density.
