as a member of the phylum arthropoda, the pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vannamei has to adapt to the complex water environments with various symbiotic or parasitic microorganisms, which provide a platform for horizontal gene transfer .
in this study, we analyzed the genome-wide hgt events in l. vannamei.
through homology search and phylogenetic analysis, followed by experimental pcr confirmation,  <dig> genes with hgt event were identified:  <dig> of them were transferred from bacteria and two from fungi.
hgt events from bacteria or fungi were happened in the genome of l. vannamei, and these horizontally transferred genes can be transcribed in shrimp.
furthermore, around other three bacteria-originated genes, there were three large dna segments inserted into the shrimp genome.
functional prediction of these  <dig> genes showed that  <dig> of them might be related to energy metabolism, and  <dig> others related to defense of the organism.
importantly, most of these genes are exposed to a negative selection pressure and appeared to be functional.
