as shown in previous investigations, in many primates and rodents this class of elements has remained transpositionally active, as reflected by increased copy number and high sequence diversity within and among taxa.
the erv-l complement in this group is even more diverse than previously suspected, and there is sequence evidence for active expansion, particularly in elephantids.
as a test we characterized erv-ls occurring in a sample of extant members of superorder uranotheria .
