this implies that intestinal epithelial cells in first contact with the pathogen may play an important role in innate immunity to p. aeruginosa infection.
we demonstrate that prolonged infection by p. aeruginosa results in suppression of il- <dig> but enhancement of hbd- <dig>  either protein secretion and mrna expression, in sw <dig> cells.
intracellular signaling pathways and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain   <dig> protein expression were analyzed by western blot in sw <dig> cells in the presence or absence of inhibitors or transfected with sirna.
human beta–defensins- <dig>  and interleukin- <dig>  are crucial for host defense at mucosa but il- <dig> may give rise to characteristic pathology of colitis.
fever and diarrhea are the two most common initial symptoms in p. aeruginosa sepsis in previously healthy infants and children.
the human opportunistic pathogen, pseudomonas aeruginosa  carries the highest case fatality rate of all gram-negative infections.
the p. aeruginosa-induced antimicrobial peptide in iecs continuously protect the host against prolonged infection, while modulation of proinflammatory responses prevents the host from the detrimental effects of overwhelming inflammation.
pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pao <dig> was used to infect sw <dig>  an intestinal epithelial cell.

il- <dig> and hbd- <dig> mrna expression and protein secretion were then assessed in sw <dig> cells using rt-pcr and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , respectively.
thus, p. aeruginosa-induced innate immunity in iecs represents a host protective mechanism, which may provide new insight into the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.
inhibitors of erk suppressed but inhibitor of pi3k enhanced p. aeruginosa-induced il- <dig> mrna expression in sw <dig> cells while both signaling had no effect on p. aeruginosa-induced hbd- <dig> expression in sw <dig> cells.
on the other hand, nod  <dig> was illustrated to get involved in p. aeruginosa-induced hbd- <dig> mrna expression and protein production in sw <dig> cells.
