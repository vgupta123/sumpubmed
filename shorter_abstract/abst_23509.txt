while previous studies were mostly aimed at detecting coherent modules only, our results show that coherent responses are often part of a more general module type with independent response profiles under different conditions.
2) coherent modules with similar responses under all conditions occurred frequently, too, and were often contained within these modules.
for an integrative analysis, several time-series datasets can be joined into a three-dimensional gene-condition-time dataset, to which standard clustering or biclustering methods are, however, not applicable.
analysis of microarray datasets has lead us to define three biologically relevant module types: 1) we found modules with independent response profiles to be the most prevalent ones.
3) a third module type, which covers a response specific to a single condition was also detected, but rarely.
after subsequent analysis of the resulting modules, the edisa helped to shed light on the global organization of transcriptional control.
in this work, we present the edisa , a novel probabilistic clustering approach for 3d gene-condition-time datasets.
a subsequent extension step ensures gene and condition maximality.
based on mathematical definitions of gene expression modules, the edisa samples initial modules from the dataset which are then refined by removing genes and conditions until they comply with the module definition.
we applied the algorithm to a synthetic dataset and were able to successfully recover the implanted modules over a range of background noise intensities.
