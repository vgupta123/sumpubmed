the hrms analysis determined the hyp content of maize-derived rciα1-oh as  <dig> %, which is comparable to the hyp level of yeast-derived rciα1-oh  and the native human cia <dig> , respectively.
the increased hyp percentage was correlated with a markedly enhanced thermal stability of maize-derived rciα1-oh when compared to the non-hydroxylated rciα <dig>
high-resolution mass spectrometry  analysis revealed that nearly half of the collagenous repeating triplets in rciα <dig> isolated from rp4h co-expressing maize line had the pro residues changed to hyp residues.
a recombinant human collagen type i α- <dig>  with high percentage of hydroxylated prolines  was produced in transgenic maize seeds when co-expressed with both the α- and β- subunits of a recombinant human p4h .
this work shows that maize has potential to produce adequately modified exogenous proteins with mammalian-like post-translational modifications that may be require for their use as pharmaceutical and industrial products.
