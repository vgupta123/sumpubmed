two non-homologous forms of fructose bisphosphate aldolase  are characteristic of eukaryotes and prokaryotes respectively.
here, we show that abundant marine cyanobacteria in the related genera synechococcus and prochlorococcus acquired a key calvin cycle/glycolytic enzyme from a eukaryote.
in particular, gene flow from eukaryotes to prokaryotes is rarely documented with strong support, which is unusual since prokaryotic genomes appear to readily accept foreign genes.
its current distribution in prochlorococcus and synechococcus is punctate, suggesting a complex history since its introduction to this group.
the eukaryotic gene is most closely related to the plastid-targeted fba from red algae.
a gene for plastid-targeted fba has been transferred from red algae to cyanobacteria, where it has inserted itself beside its non-homologous, functional analogue.
this eukaryotic-type fba once replaced the plastid/cyanobacterial type in photosynthetic eukaryotes, hinting at a possible functional advantage in calvin cycle reactions.
in one lineage this new gene has replaced the ancestral gene altogether.
however, a eukaryotic gene has been inserted immediately upstream of the ancestral prokaryotic gene in several strains  of synechococcus and prochlorococcus.
