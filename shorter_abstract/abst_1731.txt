the full source code is available, allowing to extend the software.
microarray data are often used for patient classification and gene selection.
they are valuable tools for applied biomedical researchers, specially for exploratory work with microarray data.
methodologically, such a tool would be of greater use if it incorporates state-of-the-art computational approaches and makes source code available.
all source code is available from bioinformatics.org or the launchpad.
an appropriate tool for end users and biomedical researchers should combine user friendliness with statistical rigor, including carefully avoiding selection biases and allowing analysis of multiple solutions, together with access to additional functional information of selected genes.
we have developed genesrf, a web-based tool, and varselrf, an r package, that implement, in the context of patient classification, a validated method for selecting very small sets of genes while preserving classification accuracy.
the r package is also available from cran.
clickable tables link to additional information for each gene , and output can be sent to pals for examination of pubmed references, go terms, kegg and and reactome pathways characteristic of sets of genes selected for class prediction.
varselrf and genesrf implement a validated method for gene selection including bootstrap estimates of classification error rate.
