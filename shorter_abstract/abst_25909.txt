a sister group relationship to remipedia appears compatible with the observed features of thylacocephala but more fossil evidence is required to test this assertion.
new details observed on thylacocephalans from the jurassic solnhofen lithographic limestones include antennulae and antennae of mayrocaris bucculata, and endites on the raptorial appendages and an elongate last trunk appendage in clausocaris lithographica.
as in other thylacocephalans the large bivalved shield encloses much of the entire body.
sp., bears compound eyes and raptorial appendages that are relatively small compared to those of other representatives of the group.
the raptorial appendages of thylacocephala most likely projected  <dig> degrees abaxially instead of directly forward as previously reconstructed.
we also present details of younger, jurassic specimens, from the solnhofen lithographic limestones, which are crucial to our interpretation of the systematic position of thylacocephala.
while the new features reported here are consistent with a eucrustacean affinity, most previous hypotheses for the position of thylacocephala within eucrustacea  are shown to be unlikely.
our results indicate that some ‘typical’ thylacocephalan characters are unique to the group; these autapomorphies contribute to the difficulty of determining thylacocephalan affinities.
the shield lacks a marked optical notch.
preserved features of the internal morphology in c. lithographica include the muscles of the raptorial appendage and trunk.
head appendages, which may represent antennulae, antennae and mandibles, appear to be present.
