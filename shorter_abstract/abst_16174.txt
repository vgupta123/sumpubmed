this requires surgical implantation of intracranial electrodes and subsequent chronic stimulation in individual animals for several weeks.
electrical stimulation of brain structures has been widely used in rodent models for kindling or modeling deep brain stimulation used clinically.
bipolar electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the hippocampal ca <dig> area for electrical stimulation and electroencephalographic recordings.
we suggest that the glue-based, screw-free method is reliable for chronic brain stimulation and high-quality electroencephalographic recordings in mice.
however, such an approach is limited when carried out in mouse models as the thin mouse skull may not be strong enough to accommodate the anchoring screws.
the technical aspects described this study may help future studies in mouse models.
using the glue-based implantation method, we implanted bilateral bipolar electrodes in  <dig> mice.
we describe here a screw-free, glue-based method for implanting bipolar stimulating electrodes in the mouse brain and validate this method in a mouse model of hippocampal electrical kindling.
anchoring screws and dental acrylic have long been used to secure implanted intracranial electrodes in rats.
the locations of implanted electrodes were verified by hippocampal electrographic activities and later histological assessments.
male c <dig> black mice  were used in the present experiments.
the electrodes were secured onto the skull via glue and dental acrylic but without anchoring screws.
