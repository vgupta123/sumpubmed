the purpose of this study was to identify proteins in the testis that interact with kifc <dig> using a yeast  <dig> hybrid screen of a testis cdna library.
in addition to the leucine-rich repeats, tlrr contains a consensus-binding site for protein phosphatase- <dig> .
tlrr is homologous to a class of regulatory subunits for pp <dig>  a central phosphatase in the reversible phosphorylation of proteins that is key to modulation of many intracellular processes.
