we describe a reverse genetics process that combines the random mutagenesis of agrobacterium-mediated transformation with screening techniques to identify targeted gene disruptions in a collection of insertion mutants.
isolation of the desired mutant is accomplished by arraying individual clones from a pool and employing a pcr-addressing method.
application of this procedure facilitated the isolation of a cbp <dig> mutant in a north american type  <dig> strain, a histoplasma strain recalcitrant to gene knock-outs through homologous recombination.
the procedures described are widely applicable to many fungal systems and will be of particular interest to those for which homologous recombination techniques are inefficient or do not currently exist.
