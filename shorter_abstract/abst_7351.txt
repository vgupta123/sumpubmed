no significant difference  was detected between the cell counts of the two methods.
comparison between automated cell counts and the mean manual cell counts on  <dig> darc images showed significant correlation between the two methods , r squared =  <dig> .
this may prove to be a valuable method of quantifying apoptosing retinal cells, with particular relevance to translation in the clinic, where a phase i clinical trial of darc in glaucoma patients is due to start shortly.
the intraclass correlation coefficient was  <dig>  , and cronbach’s alpha measure of consistency =  <dig> , confirming excellent correlation and consistency.
a semi-automated algorithm was developed which enabled automated identification of apoptosing rgcs labeled with fluorescent annexin- <dig> on darc images.
the darc  technology enables in vivo real-time non-invasive imaging of single apoptosing retinal cells in animal models of glaucoma and alzheimer’s disease.
apoptosing retinal cells were counted by  <dig> masked operators, generating ‘gold-standard’ mean manual cell counts, and were also counted using the newly developed automated algorithm.
