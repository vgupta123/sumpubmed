increasing prevalence of inh resistance, especially in high tuberculosis  prevalent countries is worsening the burden of tb control programs, since similar transmission rates are noted for inh susceptible and resistant m. tuberculosis strains.
our data suggests that genetic screening for the s315t katg mutation may provide rapid information for anti-tb regimen selection, epidemiological monitoring of inh resistance and, possibly, to track transmission of inh resistant strains.
a few studies with limited sample sizes have separately evaluated mutations in katg, ahpc and inha genes that are associated with isoniazid  resistance.
mutations in katg were observed in  <dig>  of the isolates of which  <dig>  was contributed by the katg s315t mutation.
the s315t katg mutation was significantly more likely to be associated with mic for inh ≥ <dig> μg/ml.
the s315t katg mutation was also more frequent in haarlem family strains than lam  and t strain families.
we, therefore, conducted a comprehensive evaluation of inh resistant m. tuberculosis strains  from three south american countries with high burden of drug resistant tb to characterize mutations in katg, ahpc and inha gene loci and correlate with minimal inhibitory concentrations  levels and spoligotype strain family.
