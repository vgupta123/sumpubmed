the proposed framework identifies dysregulated interactions and pathways enriched in dysregulated interactions; points out interactions that are perturbed across pathways; and moreover, based on the biological annotation of each type of dysregulated interaction gives clues about the regulatory logic governing the systems level perturbation.
here, we present a novel method called gene interaction enrichment and network analysis  to identify dysregulated gene interactions, i.e., pairs of genes whose relationships differ between disease and control.
four functions are defined to model the biologically relevant gene interactions of cooperation , competition , redundancy , or dependency  among the expression levels.
to address this challenge, gene set enrichment analysis  and others have been developed, which focus on alterations of individual properties of the entities .
we showed that giena identifies dysregulated pathways that are missed by traditional enrichment methods based on the individual gene properties and that use of traditional methods combined with giena provides coverage of the largest number of relevant pathways.
