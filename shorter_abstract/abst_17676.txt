while many are intronic, this association is not evolutionarily stable across the eukaryote tree; ongoing intragenomic mobility has erased signal of their ancestral gene organization, and neither introns-first nor evolved co-expression adequately explain our results.
to gain insight into the evolutionary origins of this genetic organization, we examined the antiquity of snorna families and the stability of their genomic location across  <dig> eukaryote genomes.
we report that dozens of snorna families are traceable to the last eukaryotic common ancestor , but find only weak similarities between the oldest eukaryotic snornas and archaeal snorna-like genes.
the location of some snornas within the introns of ribosomal protein genes has been suggested to belie an rna world origin, with the exons of the earliest protein-coding genes having evolved around snornas after the advent of templated protein synthesis.
moreover, many of these leca snornas are located within the introns of host genes independently traceable to the leca.
we therefore present a third model — constrained drift — whereby individual snornas are intragenomically mobile and may occupy any genomic location from which expression satisfies phenotype.
consistent with ongoing mobility across broadly-expressed genes, we report a case of recent migration of a non-leca snorna from the intron of a ubiquitously expressed non-leca host gene into the introns of two leca genes during the evolution of primates.
alternatively, this intronic location may reflect more recent selection for coexpression of snornas and ribosomal components, ensuring rrna modification by snornas during ribosome synthesis.
comparative genomic analyses reveal the intronic location of leca snornas is not ancestral however, suggesting the pattern we observe is the result of ongoing intragenomic mobility.
analysis of human transcriptome data indicates that the primary requirement for hosting intronic snornas is a broad expression profile.
