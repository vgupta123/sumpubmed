among other functions, sybil currently provides efficient methods for flux-balance analysis , moma, and room that are about ten times faster than previous implementations when calculating the effect of whole-genome single gene deletions in silico on a complete e. coli metabolic model.
based on its highly efficient communication with different mathematical optimisation programs, sybil facilitates the exploration of high-dimensional optimisation problems on small time scales.
publicly available implementations tend to be slow, impeding large scale analyses such as the genome-wide computation of pairwise gene knock-outs, or the automated search for model improvements.
furthermore, available implementations cannot easily be extended or adapted by users.
constraint-based analyses of metabolic networks are widely used to simulate the properties of genome-scale metabolic networks.
