the hypodiploid peak started to become prominent  <dig> hours after the treatment.
in particular, the course of apoptotic events induced by microtubule-interfering agents such as taxanes is poorly understood.
a very similar time-course of apoptotic events was found after treatment of a myelomonocytic cell line with the same drug.
after discussing some characteristics of the methods employed and their limitations, a succession of apoptotic events over time is suggested, in which the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential  is the earliest sign of apoptosis.
within a few hours, drug treatment had induced mitochondrial membrane transition, cell shrinkage and a decrease in granularity.
dna fragmentation was subsequently detected by tunel assay.
despite the great advances in the understanding of programmed cell death, little attention has been paid to the sequence of the events that characterise it.
cell cycle was almost completely blocked in g2/m phase within  <dig> hours.
over time, cell membranes became permeable to propidium iodide.
in order to increase such knowledge, we studied a number of independent biochemical and cytological modifications using cytometric methods in a bladder cancer cell line treated with the second generation taxane, docetaxel.
