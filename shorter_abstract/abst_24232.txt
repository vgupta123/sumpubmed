furthermore, oil had significantly lower levels of linoleic acid  and significantly higher levels of oleic acid .
previously, we generated soybean lines with knockout mutations within fatty acid desaturase 2-1a  and fad2-1b genes, resulting in oil with increased levels of monounsaturated oleic acid  and decreased levels of linoleic  and linolenic acid .
commodity soybean oil contains high levels of polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acid, which contribute to oxidative instability – a problem that has been addressed through partial hydrogenation.
here, we stack mutations within fad2-1a and fad2-1b with mutations in fatty acid desaturase 3a  to further decrease levels of linolenic acid.
oil from fad2-1a fad2-1b fad3a plants had significantly lower levels of linolenic acid , as compared to fad2-1a fad2-1b plants .
the resulting product comprised oleic acid levels above 80 % and linoleic and linolenic acid levels below 3 %.

the ability to modulate levels of individual fatty acids within soybean oil has potential to increase shelf-life and frying stability and to improve nutritional characteristics.
mutations were introduced into fad3a by directly delivering talens into fad2-1a fad2-1b soybean plants.
the methods presented here provide an efficient means for using sequence-specific nucleases to stack quality traits in soybean.
transgene-free fad2-1a fad2-1b fad3a soybean lines were identified.
however, partial hydrogenation increases levels of trans-fatty acids, which have been associated with cardiovascular disease.
