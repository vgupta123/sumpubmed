the objectives of this study were to develop robust functional marker assays for high-throughput selection of scn resistance and to differentiate the sources of resistance.

peking and pi  <dig> are the two major sources of scn resistance with peking requiring both rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> alleles and pi  <dig> only the rhg <dig> allele.
three functional snp markers  were identified that could provide genotype information for the selection of scn resistance and differentiate peking from pi  <dig> source for most germplasm lines.
in most contexts, use of one or two of these markers is sufficient for high-throughput marker-assisted selection of plants that will exhibit scn resistance.
based on the genomic dna sequences of  <dig> soybean lines with known scn phenotypes, we have developed kompetitive allele specific pcr  assays for two single nucleotide polymorphisms  from glyma08g <dig> for the selection of the rhg <dig> resistance allele.
these snp markers have been validated and a strong correlation was observed between the snp genotypes and reactions to scn race  <dig> using a panel of  <dig> soybean lines, as well as a bi-parental population, f5–derived recombinant inbred lines  from g00- <dig> x lg04- <dig>
moreover, the genomic dna of glyma18g <dig> at the rhg <dig> locus from  <dig> soybean lines and cdna of forrest, essex, williams  <dig> and pi  <dig> were fully sequenced.
using the same  <dig> soybean lines, we identified one snp that can be used to select the rhg <dig> resistance allele and another snp that can be employed to differentiate peking and pi 88788-type resistance.
