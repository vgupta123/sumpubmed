heart rate variability is the variation of the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.
yet, due to the high number of potential parameter combinations, further investigations of entropy for heart rate variability data will be necessary.
this study describes the results of tests conducted to support parameter selection, towards the goal of enabling further biomarker discovery.
the results were tested for normality using lilliefors' composite goodness-of-fit test.
the results for the weighting parameters n for the fuzzy membership function show different behavior when coupled with different r values, therefore the weighting parameters have been chosen independently for the different threshold values.
consequently, the p-value was calculated with either a two sample t-test or a wilcoxon rank sum test.
five tests were defined and conducted to examine the influence of: varying the threshold value r , the data length n, the weighting factors n for fuzzy and fuzzy measure entropies, and the thresholds rf and rl for fuzzy measure entropy.
the tests concerning rf and rl showed that there is no optimal choice, but r = rf = rl is reasonable with r = rchon or r =  <dig> σ.
all data were obtained from physionet, a free-access, on-line archive of physiological signals, and represent various medical conditions.
n should be at least  <dig> data points for r =  <dig>  σ and should even exceed a length of  <dig> for r = rchon.
the first test shows a cross-over of entropy values with regard to a change of r. thus, a clear statement that a higher entropy corresponds to a high irregularity is not possible, but is rather an indicator of differences in regularity.
