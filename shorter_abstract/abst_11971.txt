supplementation of rapamycin to nutrient rich cultivation medium led to an increase in lipid yield of up to 38% g/l.
significant changes in growth characteristics included a 19% increase in maximum cell density and a 12% higher maximum growth rate.
lipid accumulation is mainly induced by limitation of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus or sulfur.
uncoupling growth from lipid accumulation is key for the industrial process applicability of oleaginous yeasts.
this work serves as a basis for further investigation regarding the control and induction of lipid accumulation in oil yeasts.
the oleaginous yeast trichosporon oleaginosus accumulates up to 70% w/w lipid under nitrogen stress, while cultivation in non-limiting media only yields 9% w/w lipid.
this study evaluates the effects of rapamycin on tor specific signaling pathways associated with lipogenesis in trichosporon oleaginosus for the first time.

we confirm, that target of rapamycin complex  <dig>  is involved in control of lipid production and cell proliferation in t. oleaginosus and present a homology based signaling network.
t. oleaginosus only has one tor gene much like the oleaginous yeast rhodosporidium toruloides.
interestingly, the fatty acid spectrum resembled that observed with cultivation under nitrogen limitation.
consequently, we analyzed the effect of rapamycin on t. oleaginosus specific torc signaling using bioinformatic methodologies.
this effect plateaued at 40 μm rapamycin.
