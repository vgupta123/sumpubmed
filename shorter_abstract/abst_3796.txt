in these animals the posterior part of the body becomes an epitoke and is later detached as a distinct unit named stolon.
accelerated stolonization, masculinization and the occurrence of aberrant stolons.
the detailed anatomy of aberrant stolons is described.
the ventricle and the caeca are composed of glandular tissue but they are not involved in the reproductive and regenerative processes.
a histological study of the proventricle revealed no signs of glandular or secretory structures.
when the proventricle region is absent, anterior and posterior regeneration are considerably deviated from the general patterns.
the removal of the anterior end including the proventricle implies an incomplete anterior regeneration as well as severe deviations from the usual reproductive pattern, i.e.
the prostomium and the proventricle, a modified foregut structure, have been proposed to have a control function during this process, though the concrete mechanisms behind it have never been elucidated.
by using different experimental set-ups, histology and immunohistochemistry combined with subsequent clsm analyzes, we investigate and document the regeneration and stolonization in specimens of typosyllis antoni that were amputated at different levels throughout the antero-posterior body axis.
as in other investigated syllids, the proventricle region has a significant role during stolonization and reproduction processes in typosyllis antoni.
