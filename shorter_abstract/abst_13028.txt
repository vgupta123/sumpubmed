we have developed an application termed dovis that uses autodock  as the docking engine and runs in parallel on a linux cluster.
furthermore, in dovis, the docking session is fully integrated and automated in that the inputs are specified via a graphical user interface, the calculations are fully integrated with a linux cluster queuing system for parallel processing, and the results can be visualized and queried.
dovis removes most of the complexities and organizational problems associated with large-scale high-throughput virtual screening, and provides a convenient and efficient solution for autodock users to use this software in a linux cluster platform.
in addition to the selection of a sound docking strategy with appropriate scoring functions, another technical challenge is to in silico screen millions of compounds in a reasonable time.
molecular-docking-based virtual screening is an important tool in drug discovery that is used to significantly reduce the number of possible chemical compounds to be investigated.
