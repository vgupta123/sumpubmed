isolates from europe and the united states, including b. burgdorferi sensu stricto , b. afzelii , b. garinii , b.
phylogeny-based pan-genome analysis showed that the rate of gene acquisition was higher between species than within species, suggesting adaptive speciation.
to reconstruct the evolution of b. burgdorferi s.l.
and identify the genomic basis of its human virulence, we compared the genomes of  <dig> b. burgdorferi s.l.
robust b. burgdorferi s.s. and b. burgdorferi s.l.
intra- and inter-specific pan-genome sizes of b. burgdorferi s.l.
genome adaptation of b. burgdorferi s.l.
new genomic groups are likely to emerge if the current trend of b. burgdorferi s.l.
lyme disease is caused by spirochete bacteria from the borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato  species complex.
is driven predominantly by copy-number and sequence variations of lipoprotein genes.
