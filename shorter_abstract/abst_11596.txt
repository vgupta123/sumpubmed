in this study we have confirmed that the ring finger  <dig> protein , a poorly understood transcriptional regulator, influences the expression of both mitochondrial and immune-related genes.
muscle development and remodelling, mitochondrial physiology and inflammation are thought to be inter-related and to have implications for metabolism in both health and disease.
the effect of both constructs was significantly different to the control samples .
they assigned similar probability to mammalian rnf <dig> playing a regulatory role in mitochondrial and immune gene expression.
cluster analyses revealed that transfection with the two rnf <dig> constructs yielded discrete expression signatures from each other, but in both cases a substantial set of genes annotated as encoding proteins related to immune function were perturbed.
these included cytokines and interferon regulatory factors.
