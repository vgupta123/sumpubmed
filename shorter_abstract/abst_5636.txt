in this article, we present a new β-d-galactosidase as a candidate to be applied in the above mentioned biotechnological processes.
the protein was also produced extracellularly by p. pastoris in high amounts giving approximately  <dig> mg and  <dig> mg of purified enzyme from  <dig> l of p. pastoris culture for the aox <dig> and a constitutive system, respectively.
the development of a new cold-active β-d-galactosidases and microorganisms that efficiently ferment lactose is of high biotechnological interest, particularly for lactose removal in milk and dairy products at low temperatures and for cheese whey bioremediation processes with simultaneous bio-ethanol production.
32cβ-d-galactosidase suggest that this enzyme could be useful for low-cost, industrial conversion of lactose into galactose and glucose in milk products and could be an interesting alternative for the production of ethanol from lactose-based feedstock.
the gene encoding this β-d-galactosidase has been isolated from the genomic dna library of antarctic bacterium arthrobacter sp.
although, the maximum activity of the enzyme was determined at ph  <dig>  and 50°c, 60% of the maximum activity of the enzyme was determined at 25°c and 15% of the maximum activity was detected at 0°c.
