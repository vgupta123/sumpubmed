tonoplast intrinsic proteins  are widely used as markers for vacuolar compartments in higher plants.
tip isoforms whose expression overlapped appeared to localise to the tonoplast of the central vacuole, vacuolar bulbs and smaller, uncharacterised structures.
analysis by confocal microscopy revealed that tip distribution varied between different cell layers within the root axis, with extensive co-expression of some tips and more restricted expression patterns for other isoforms.
we generated fluorescent protein fusions to the genomic sequences of all members of the arabidopsis tip family whose expression is predicted to occur in root tissues  and expressed these fusions, both individually and in selected pairwise combinations, in transgenic arabidopsis.
ten tip isoforms are encoded by the arabidopsis genome.
we have produced a comprehensive atlas of tip expression in arabidopsis roots, which reveals novel expression patterns for not previously studied tips.
