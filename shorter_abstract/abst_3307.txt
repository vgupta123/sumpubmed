incubation with chemokine results in almost complete immobilization of flotillins.
different types of membrane microdomains  have been postulated to be present in the rear and front of polarized migrating t-lymphocytes.
reggie/flotillin- <dig> and - <dig> are two highly homologous proteins that are thought to shape membrane microdomains.
our data suggest that stable flotillin cap formation in the rear of polarized t-lymphocytes requires flotillin heterooligomer formation, as well as direct f-actin interactions of flotillin- <dig> and raft/membrane association of flotillin- <dig>  but not - <dig>  our data also implicate flotillin-rich actin-dependent membrane microdomains in t-lymphocyte uropod formation.
we studied flotillin reorganization and lateral mobility at the plasma membrane using immunofluorescence staining and frap .
lateral mobility of coexpressed flotillins at the plasma membrane is already partially restricted in the absence of chemokine.
capping is abolished when wild-type flotillin- <dig> is coexpressed with a mutant of flotillin- <dig>  that is unable to interact with the plasma membrane, or with a deletion mutant of flotillin- <dig> that lacks a putative actin-binding domain.
we have previously demonstrated the enrichment of flotillins in the uropod of human neutrophils.
transfection of t-lymphocytes with flotillin-2-g2a reduces cell polarization and uropod recruitment of endogenous flotillin- <dig> and psgl- <dig>
we show that flotillins redistribute early upon chemokine stimulation, and form very stable caps in the uropods of human peripheral blood t-lymphocytes, colocalizing with the adhesion molecule psgl- <dig> and activated ezrin/radixin/moesin  proteins.
chemokine-induced formation of stable flotillin caps requires integrity and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, but is not abolished by inhibitors suppressing rho-kinase or myosin ii activity.
