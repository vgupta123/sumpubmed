in addition, phosphorylated camp-response element binding protein  and brain derived neurotrophic factor  was significantly decreased in the d-galactose treated group, whereas exercise increased their expression in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in both the vehicle- and d-galactose-treated groups.

in the present study, we used senescent mice induced by d-galactose to examine neural stem cells, cell proliferation, and neuronal differentiation with or without exercise treatment.
these results suggest that treadmill exercise attenuates the d-galactose-induced reduction in neural stem cells, cell proliferation, and neuronal differentiation by enhancing the expression of pcreb and bdnf in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
aging negatively affects adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and exercise attenuates the age-related reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
body weight and food intake did not change significantly after d-galactose administration with/without treadmill exercise, although body weight and food intake was highest after treadmill exercise in adult animals and lowest after treadmill exercise in d-galactose-induced senescent model animals.
