these cnvs encompass  <dig> mb  of the chicken genome.
although chicken genome is approximately one third the size of a typical mammalian genome, the pattern of chicken cnvs is similar to that of mammals.
some cnv loci involve genes or conserved regulatory elements.
whereas most small sized cnvs reside in none coding sequences, larger cnv regions involve genes .
these results suggest that chicken cnvs potentially affect agricultural or disease related traits.
a map of chicken cnvs provides new information on genetic variations for the understanding of important agricultural traits and disease.
ninety six cnvs were identified in three lines of chickens  using whole genome tiling array.
