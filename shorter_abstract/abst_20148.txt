applying the method on a large set of dna and rna psba clones from the mediterranean sea, we studied the distribution of cyanobacterial psba genes and transcripts in their natural environment.
the classification method presented in this paper could be applied further to classify other genes amplified from the environment, for which training data is available.
thus, mapping genomic data extracted directly from the environment to its taxonomic origin is necessary for a better understanding of phage-host relationships and dynamics.
our method has been applied successfully to classify core-photosystem-ii gene fragments, including partial sequences coming directly from the ocean, to seven different taxonomic classes.
using our approach, we were able to simultaneously examine taxonomic and ecological distributions in the marine environment.
to achieve an accurate and rapid taxonomic classification, we employed a computational approach combining a multi-class support vector machine  with a codon usage position specific scoring matrix .
