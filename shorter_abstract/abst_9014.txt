data compression is one of the effective solutions, where reference-based compression strategies can typically achieve superior compression ratios compared to the ones not relying on any reference.
this is comparable or superior to other state-of-the-art lossless ngs data compression algorithms.
lw-fqzip is a program that enables efficient lossless fastq data compression.
the three processed data streams are then packed together with some general purpose compression algorithms like lzma.
to handle the short reads, lw-fqzip uses a novel light-weight mapping model to fast map them against external reference sequence and produce concise alignment results for storage.
the exponential growth of next generation sequencing  data has posed big challenges to data storage, management and archive.
lw-fqzip was evaluated on eight real-world ngs data sets and achieved compression ratios in the range of  <dig> - <dig> .
the three components of any given input, i.e., metadata, short reads and quality score strings, are first parsed into three data streams in which the redundancy information are identified and eliminated independently.
this paper presents a lossless light-weight reference-based compression algorithm namely lw-fqzip to compress fastq data.
it contributes to the state of art applications for ngs data storage and transmission.
