even if the comparison between clustering algorithms is a complex task, we observed that k-means approach is more efficient to conserve gene associations.
these improvements have been observed also on the imputation of extreme values, the most difficult predictable values.
we showed that the imputed mvs have still important effects on the stability of the gene clusters.
in a previous study, we have shown the interest of k-nearest neighbour approach for restoring the missing gene expression values, and its positive impact of the gene clustering by hierarchical algorithm.
however, a common tendency can be found between the quality of the imputation method and the gene cluster stability.
the em_array approach constitutes one efficient method for restoring the missing expression gene values, with a lower estimation error level.
<dig> independent simulations have assessed the quality of  <dig> imputation methods on five very different biological datasets.
our study highlights the need for a systematic assessment of imputation methods and so of dedicated benchmarks.
since, numerous replacement methods have been proposed to impute missing values  for microarray data.
