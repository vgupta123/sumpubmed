using phenotypic data available for mouse, a possible association between the ovarian transcriptome, reproductive records and spontaneous ovarian tumor rates was investigated in four mouse inbred strains.
in contrast, no associations were detected between otf and litter size , the latter a measure of ovulation events in a single estrous cycle.
we speculate that repetitive cycling instead of repetitive ovulations represent the actual link between ovarian tumorigenesis and reproductive records.
literature text-mining pointed to post-transcriptional control of ovarian processes including oocyte maturation, folliculogenesis and angiogenesis as possible causal relationships of observed tumor and reproductive phenotypes.
linear regression analysis with multiple-test control  resulted in ovarian tumor frequency  and number of litters  as the top-correlated among five tested phenotypes.
nia15k-dna microarrays were employed to obtain expression profiles of balbc, c57bl <dig>  fvb and swr adult ovaries.
