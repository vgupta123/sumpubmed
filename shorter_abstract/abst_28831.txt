eighty-five pre-used non-sterile pharmaceuticals collected from random consumers in egypt were examined for the eventual presence of bacterial contaminants.
forty-one bacterial contaminants were isolated from  <dig> of the tested preparations.
these isolates were subjected to biochemical identification by both conventional tests as well as api kits, which were sufficient for the accurate identification of only  <dig> out of the  <dig> bacterial contaminants  to the species level.
moreover, polymerase chain reaction  assays were compared to standard biochemical methods in the detection of pharmacopoeial bacterial indicators in artificially-contaminated pharmaceutical samples.

the remaining isolates were inconclusively identified or showed contradictory results after using both biochemical methods.
using molecular methods,  <dig> isolates  were successfully identified to the species level.
microbial contamination of pharmaceuticals poses a great problem to the pharmaceutical manufacturing process, especially from a medical as well as an economic point of view.
