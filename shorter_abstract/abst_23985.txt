inactivation of gamma-synuclein gene led to the improvement of working memory in mice as revealed by passive and active avoidance tests.
our previous study revealed that gamma-synuclein knockout mice are characterized by high habituation scores.
gamma-synuclein is a member of the synuclein family of cytoplasmic, predominantly neuron-specific proteins.
at the same time behavioral tests, designed to assess spatial learning and memory , showed no differences between gamma-synuclein knockouts and wild type mice.
our results suggest that gamma-synuclein is directly involved in the regulation of cognitive functions.
since a number of processes including spatial memory of the environment may affect habituation, in the present study we have carried out behavioral evaluation of spatial and working memory in gamma-synuclein knockout mice.
these findings indicate that young mice with targeted inactivation of gamma-synuclein gene have improved working memory, but not spatial learning and memory.
