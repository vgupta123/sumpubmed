however, our evaluation on amplicon-based data shows that most of the current tools are not able to remove all adapter sequences and that adapter contamination may even lead to spurious variant calls.
trimming of adapter sequences from short read data is a common preprocessing step during ngs data analysis.
when performing paired-end sequencing, the overlap between forward and reverse read can be used to identify excess adapter sequences.
seqpurge can detect very short adapter sequences, even if only one base long.
compared to other adapter trimmers specifically designed for paired-end data, we found that seqpurge achieves a higher sensitivity.
here we present seqpurge , a highly-sensitive adapter trimmer that uses a probabilistic approach to detect the overlap between forward and reverse reads of illumina sequencing data.
the number of remaining adapter bases after trimming is reduced by up to 90Â %, depending on the compared tool.
seqpurge achieves a very high sensitivity and a high error-tolerance, combined with a specificity and runtime that are comparable to other state-of-the-art adapter trimmers.
