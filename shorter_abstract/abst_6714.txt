fungi are asexually and sexually reproducing organisms that can combine the evolutionary advantages of the two reproductive modes.
the study included  <dig> pac species and >  <dig>   <dig> strains that represented populations from different hosts, continents and ecosystems.
the signature of sex was found in worldwide populations of pac species and functionality of mat genes is likely preserved by purifying selection.
despite their abundance in many ecosystems of the northern hemisphere, no sexual state has been identified to date and little is known about their reproductive biology, and how it shaped their evolutionary history and contributes to their ecological role in forest ecosystems.
we hypothesize that cryptic sex regularely occurs in the pac and that further field studies and in vitro crosses will lead to the discovery of the sexual state.
nevertheless, there are indirect approaches to assess the occurrence of sex in a species, such as population studies, expression analysis of genes involved in mating processes and analysis of their selective constraints.
mat genes were shown to evolve under strong purifying selection.
moreover, in > 80% of the populations a 1: <dig> mating type ratio and gametic equilibrium were found.
the members of the phialocephala fortinii s. l. - acephala applanata species complex  are ascomycetes and the predominant dark septate endophytes that colonize woody plant roots.
we therefore aimed at assessing the importance of sexual reproduction by indirect approaches that included molecular analyses of the mating type  genes involved in reproductive processes.
however, for many fungi the sexual cycle has never been observed in the field or in vitro and it remains unclear whether sexual reproduction is absent or cryptic.
