yope also caused reduced uptake of yeast particles.
the actin polymerization response upon camp stimulation was impaired, although chemotaxis was unaffected.
the phenotype elicited by yope in dictyostelium can be explained, at least in part, by inactivation of one or more rho family gtpases.
we also found that yope predominantly associates with intracellular membranes including the golgi apparatus and inhibits the function of moderately overexpressed rach.
no severe effect was observed for yoph, yopj and yopm, but expression of yope, which is a gtpase activating protein for rho gtpases, was found to be highly detrimental.
it further demonstrates that the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum can be used as an efficient and easy-to-handle model organism in order to analyze the function of a translocated gap protein of a human pathogen.
dictyostelium discoideum has been recently used to study the effects of bacterial virulence factors produced by internalized pathogens.
