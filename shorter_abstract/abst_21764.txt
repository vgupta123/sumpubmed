ph in the range 7â€“ <dig> and salinity both have no major effect on the extent of photoinactivation or sub-lethal injury.
the results showed that turbidity has a major influence on solar photocatalytic inactivation of a. hydrophila.
the use of antibiotics or chemical disinfection cannot provide a healthy aquaculture system without residual effects.
this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the tffbr in the inactivation of aeromonas hydrophila under the influence of several water quality variables at high solar irradiance, providing an opportunity for the application of solar photocatalysis in aquaculture systems, as long as turbidity remains low.
humic acids appear to decrease tio <dig> effectiveness under full sunlight and reduce microbial inactivation.
the level of inactivation of aeromonas hydrophila atcc  <dig> was determined using a tffbr with a photocatalytic area of  <dig>  m <dig> under the influence of various water quality variables  under high solar irradiance conditions , at a flow rate of  <dig>  l h- <dig> through the reactor.
this study has investigated the impact of several key aspects of water quality on the inactivation of the pathogenic bacterium aeromonas hydrophila using a pilot-scale thin-film fixed-bed reactor  system.
water quality is also important in determining the success or failure of fish production.
