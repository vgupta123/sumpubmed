reduction in this intracellular parasite has affected major cellular machinery, including the loss of over fifty core spliceosomal components compared to s. cerevisiae.
we also describe the first case of alternative splicing in a microsporidian, an unexpected complexity given the reduction in spliceosomal components.
to identify expression changes throughout the parasiteâ€™s life cycle and also to assess splicing in the context of this reduced system, we examined the transcriptome of e. cuniculi using illumina rna-seq.
although several rna decay genes are encoded in e. cuniculi, the lack of a few key players could be reducing decay levels and therefore increasing the proportion of unspliced transcripts.
we observed that nearly all genes are expressed at three post-infection time-points examined.
this is dramatically lower than splicing levels found in two other fungal species examined.
low levels of splicing observed are likely the result of an inefficient spliceosome; however, at least in one case, splicing appears to be playing a functional role.
