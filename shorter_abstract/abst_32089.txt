in previous studies, using f <dig> c57bl/6j × a/j and c57bl/6j × balb/cj mouse resource populations, trypanotolerance qtl were mapped within a large genomic intervals of 20- <dig> cm to chromosomes mmu <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and denoted tir <dig>  tir <dig> and tir <dig> respectively.
trypanosomosis is the most economically important disease constraint to livestock productivity in africa.
subsequently, using f <dig> c57bl/6j × a/j and c57bl/6j × balb/cj f <dig> advanced intercross lines , tir <dig> was fine mapped to a confidence interval  of less than  <dig> cm, while tir <dig> and tir <dig>  were mapped within 5- <dig> cm.
tir <dig> was fine mapped to less than  <dig> cm ci while tir <dig> was mapped to three intervals named tir3a, tir3b and tir3c with 95% confidence intervals  of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, respectively.
an f <dig> c57bl/6j × a/j ail population, fixed for the resistant alleles at tir <dig> qtl was also generated to provide an additional estimate of the gene effect of tir <dig>  the ail populations homozygous for the resistant and susceptible tir <dig> alleles and the parental controls were challenged with t. congolense and followed for survival times over  <dig> days.
tir <dig> represents the major trypanotolerance qtl.
in this context, high resolution mapping in mouse models are a promising approach to identifying the genes associated with trypanotolerance.
