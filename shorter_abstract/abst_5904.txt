although cats predominantly responded to fruit galls of the silver vine plant, some also responded positively to its wood.
in agreement with previous studies, one out of every three cats did not respond to catnip.
the best known example of olfactory enrichment is the use of catnip, a plant that can cause an apparently euphoric reaction in domestic cats and most of the pantherinae.
it has long been known that some domestic cats and most tigers do not respond to catnip.
we tested catnip, silver vine, tatarian honeysuckle and valerian root on  <dig> domestic cats and observed their response.
nearly all domestic cats responded positively to olfactory enrichment.
almost 80% of the domestic cats responded to silver vine and about 50% to tatarian honeysuckle and valerian root.
unlike domestic cats, tigers were either not interested in silver vine or responded disapprovingly.
silver vine powder from dried fruit galls and catnip were most popular among domestic cats.
silver vine and tatarian honeysuckle appear to be good alternatives to catnip for domestic cats that do not respond to catnip.
olfactory enrichment for cats may have great potential.
each cat was offered all four plant materials and a control, multiple times.
the plant materials were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to quantify concentrations of compounds believed to exert stimulating effects on cats.
of the cats that did not respond to catnip, almost 75% did respond to silver vine and about one out of three to tatarian honeysuckle.
the amount of nepetalactone was highest in catnip and only present at marginal levels in the other plants.
catnip and silver vine also were offered to nine tigers.
silver vine contained the highest concentrations of all other compounds tested.
olfactory stimulation is an often overlooked method of environmental enrichment for cats in captivity.
