previous studies have begun to reveal relationships within the subfamily, but largely lack resolution and/or robust support for certain tribal and subtribal groups.
a robust panicoideae topology largely congruent with previous studies was obtained, but with some incongruences with previously reported subtribal relationships.
the phylogenomic analysis returned a topology that largely supports previous studies.
a mitochondrial dna  to plastid dna  transfer was discovered in the paspalum lineage.
additionally, evidence for mtdna to ptdna transfer was identified in both paspalum fimbriatum and p. dilatatum, and suggests a single rare event that took place in a common progenitor.
<dig> newly sequenced panicoideae plastomes were combined in a phylogenomic study with  <dig> other species:  <dig> panicoideae and  <dig> from outgroups.
