semantic web services allow automated discovery of conceptual links between remote data analysis servers.
we have developed a program  that allows biologists to intuitively and seamlessly chain together web services using a data-centric, rather than the customary service-centric approach.
underlying the familiar web-browser interaction is an xml data engine based on extensible xslt style sheets, regular expressions, and xpath statements which import existing user data into the moby-s format.
instead of biologists copying, pasting and reformatting data between various web sites, semantic web service protocols such as moby-s hold out the promise of seamlessly integrating multi-step analysis.
traditional html interfaces for input to and output from bioinformatics analysis on the web are highly variable in style, content and data formats.
in stark contrast to other moby-s clients, in seahawk users simply load web pages and text files they already work with.
as an easily accessible applet, seahawk moves beyond standard web browser interaction, providing mechanisms for the biologist to concentrate on the analytical task rather than on the technical details of data formats and web forms.
