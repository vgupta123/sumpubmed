focusing on influences between pairs of genes in which one partner encodes a transcription factor  we derived a network which contains  <dig> tf - gene interactions of which  <dig> are known according to regulondb.
mutual information based approaches are most useful for large-scale network inference.
for the validation of our approach, one of them, the regulation of lipoate synthase  by the pyruvate-sensing pyruvate dehydrogenate repressor , was experimentally checked and confirmed.
dti values were calculated on a set of gene expression profiles from  <dig> time course experiments extracted from the many microbes microarray database.
we used a three-step approach in which we combined gene regulatory network inference based on directed information  and sequence analysis.
we predicted a set of five novel tf - target gene interactions in e. coli.
in the last step, we checked the  <dig> of the  <dig> interactions not yet included in regulondb for functional relationships between the regulator and the target and, thus, obtained ten tf - target gene interactions.
furthermore, we developed dtinfer, a new r-package for the inference of gene-regulatory networks from microarrays using directed information.
although escherichia coli is one of the best studied model organisms, a comprehensive understanding of its gene regulation is not yet achieved.
