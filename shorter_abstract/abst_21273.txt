ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, is associated with the massive infiltration of neutrophils.
in this study, we investigated the role of dcir <dig> in intestinal inflammation using an experimental colitis model induced with dextran sodium sulfate .
a murine c-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell immunoreceptor  <dig> , is expressed on cd11b+ myeloid cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils.
dcir <dig> deficiency caused a reduced accumulation of neutrophils in the inflamed colon on day  <dig> of dss colitis compared with wt mice.
consistently, the production of a neutrophil-attracting chemokine, mip- <dig>  was also decreased in the dcir1−/− colon compared with the wt colon on day  <dig>  there were fewer myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in the inflamed colon of dcir1−/− mice than in that of wt mice.
moreover, bone marrow neutrophils from dcir1−/− mice produced less reactive oxygen species  by lipopolysaccharide stimulation than those from wt mice.
in contrast to wild type  mice, dcir1−/− mice exhibited mild body weight loss during the course of dss colitis accompanied by reduced colonic inflammation.
this suggests that dcir <dig> deficiency decreases the accumulation of tissue destructive neutrophils during dss colitis.
dcir <dig> enhances the pathogenesis of dss colitis by altering neutrophil recruitment and their functions.

it was reported that dcir <dig> is required to maintain homeostasis of the immune system to prevent autoimmunity, but it is also involved in the development of infectious disease resulting in the enhanced severity of cerebral malaria.
