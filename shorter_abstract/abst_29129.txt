extracellular tat is mitogenic for mammary and amniotic epithelial cells and stimulates the expression of genes of pathogenetic interest in hiv infection.
small concentrations of tat  stimulated cell proliferation.
these effects may favor virus replication and may facilitate the mother-to-child transmission of virus.
the activity of two-exon  and synthetic  tat was studied on mammary and amniotic epithelial cells cultured under low serum conditions.
up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines , a hallmark of other persistent viral infections, was a remarkable feature of tat-treated epithelial cell lines.
changes of gene expression in tat-treated cells were evaluated by rt-pcr and gene-array methods.
