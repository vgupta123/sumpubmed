significant sequence coverage on one or more bac clone was also identified for  <dig> of the genes to provide better local sequence information and easy updating of genomic locations as the zebrafish genome assembly continues to evolve.
there is no known cure for muscular dystrophy, nor have all causative genes been identified.
to aid in the identification of new causative genes, this study identifies and maps zebrafish orthologs for all known human muscular dystrophy genes.
zebrafish sequence databases were queried for transcripts orthologous to human dystrophy-causing genes, identifying transcripts for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes of interest.
in addition, the genomic locations of all  <dig> genes have been found, allowing rapid candidate gene discovery during genetic mapping of zebrafish dystrophy mutants.
human muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders which cause decreased muscle strength and often result in premature death.
this resource supports zebrafish as a dystrophy model, suggesting maintenance of all known dystrophy-associated genes in the zebrafish genome.
<dig> genes show conservation of syntenic relationships with humans and at least two genes appear to be duplicated in zebrafish.
