we show that the selection for factor binding generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies at different positions of a binding site.
we study a theoretical model for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations.
experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms and phylogenies of sites are discussed.
hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and selection.
the regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the gene.
the approach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to dna.
we demonstrate the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given transcription factor by point mutations.
furthermore, we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal integration through binding cooperativity between different sites.
the evolutionary time required is estimated in terms of the neutral  mutation rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective population size.
the generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex regulatory networks.
the efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and the promoter region must be long enough.
