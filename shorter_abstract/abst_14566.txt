a specific signal was detected in six out of six available serum samples from bse-positive cattle.
detection of the aggregates was carried out by flow cytometry.
infectivity studies indicate that prpsc may also be present in body fluids, even at presymptomatic stages of the disease, albeit at concentrations well below the detection limits of currently available analytical methods.
we developed a highly sensitive method for detecting prion protein aggregates that takes advantage of kinetic differences between seeded and unseeded polymerization of prion protein monomers.
the definite diagnosis of prion diseases such as creutzfeldt-jakob disease  in humans or bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in cattle currently relies on the post mortem detection of the pathological form of the prion protein  in brain tissue.
we have developed a method based on seed-dependent prp fibril formation that shows promising results in differentiating a small number of bse-positive serum samples from healthy controls.
this method may provide the basis for an ante mortem diagnostic test for prion diseases.
