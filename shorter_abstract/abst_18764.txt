we performed an integrated characterization of copy number, mutation and expression analyses of four head and neck cancer cell lines - nt8e, ot <dig>  aw <dig> and aw8507-- by applying a filtering strategy to prioritize for genes affected by two or more alterations within or across the cell lines.
in overall, we present the first comprehensive genomic characterization of four head and neck cancer cell lines established from indian patients.
however, studies involving smaller sample sizes are inherently restrictive due to their limited statistical power to identify low frequency genetic variations.
several statistical tools have been developed to identify genes mutated at rates significantly higher than background, indicative of positive selection, involving large sample cohort studies.
besides identifying tp <dig>  pten, hras and met as major altered hnscc hallmark genes, this analysis uncovered  <dig> novel candidate genes altered.
of these, we find a heterozygous truncating mutation in nuclear receptor binding protein, nrbp <dig> pseudokinase gene, identical to as reported in other cancers, is oncogenic when ectopically expressed in nih-3Â t <dig> cells.
