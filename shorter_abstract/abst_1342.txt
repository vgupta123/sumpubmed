the localization of osacos12-gfp demonstrated that osacos <dig> protein is accumulated in tapetal cells and anther locules.
acos <dig> and osacos <dig> are conserved for pollen wall formation in monocot and dicot species.
in situ hybridization shows that osacos <dig> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores at the transcript level.
osacos <dig> driven by the acos <dig> promoter could partially restore the male fertility of the acos <dig> mutant in arabidopsis.
sequence analysis showed that osacos <dig> shares  <dig> Â % amino acid sequence identity with acos <dig>  the osacos <dig> mutation caused by a pre-mature stop codon in loc_os04g <dig> exhibits defective sexine resulting in a male sterile phenotype in rice.
osacos <dig> is an orthologue of acos <dig> that is essential for sporopollenin synthesis in rice.
