in the study reported herein, by using strand-specific rna-seq analysis and in silico srna predictions, we describe the srna pool of pectobacterium atrosepticum and reveal numerous srna candidates, including those that are induced during starvation-activated stress responses.
conservation analysis using blast showed that most of the identified srnas are conserved within the sre.
subsequently, we identified  <dig> novel srnas within the p. atrosepticum genome.
since many of the identified srnas are starvation-induced, the results of our study suggests that srnas play key roles in bacterial adaptive response.
consequently, strand-specific rna-seq enabled detection of  <dig> srnas and srna candidates under starvation conditions;  <dig> of these srnas were predicted for this bacterium in silico.

small rnas  have emerged as important regulatory molecules and have been studied in several bacteria.
the expression of srnas in p. atrosepticum was compared under growth-promoting and starvation conditions:  <dig> srnas were differentially expressed with  <dig> srnas up-regulated under nutrient-deficient conditions.
