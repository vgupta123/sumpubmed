mlgo  is a web tool for the reconstruction of phylogeny and/or ancestral genomes from gene-order data.
to the best of our knowledge, it is the first web tool for analysis of large-scale genomic changes including not only rearrangements but also gene insertions, deletions and duplications.
the web tool is available from http://www.geneorder.org/server.php.
the rapid accumulation of whole-genome data has renewed interest in the study of using gene-order data for phylogenetic analyses and ancestral reconstruction.
current software and web servers typically do not support duplication and loss events along with rearrangements.
