an increased knowledge of genes regulating the pathological mechanisms in trauma will help to find future treatment targets.
osteopontin and one of its receptors, cd- <dig>  were both upregulated showing a local mrna- and immunoreactivity pattern in and around the injury site.
this study was aimed at analysing gene expression patterns following cerebral cortical contusion in rat using high throughput microarray technology with the goal of identifying genes involved in an early and in a more delayed phase of trauma, as genomic responses behind secondary mechanisms likely are time-dependent.
the different patterns of gene expression, with little overlap in genes,  <dig> and  <dig> days post injury showed time dependence in genomic responses to trauma.
an early induction of factors involved in transcription could lead to the later inflammatory response with strongly upregulated cd- <dig> and osteopontin expression.
among the upregulated genes  <dig> day post injury, were transcription factors and genes involved in metabolism, e.g.
notably, genes with biological function clustered to immune response were significantly upregulated  <dig> days after injury, which was not found following  <dig> day.
stat- <dig>  c/ebp-δ and cytochrome p <dig>  at  <dig> days post injury we observed increased gene expression of inflammatory factors, proteases and their inhibitors, like cathepsins, α-2-macroglobulin and c1q.
since trauma is a risk factor for development of neurodegenerative disease, this knowledge may also reduce late negative effects.
