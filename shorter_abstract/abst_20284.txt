here we determine the gene expression profile associated with this phenotype and define a transcriptional basis for differential actin related gene expression and cytoskeletal function.
further analysis of actin and cytoskeletal related genes from patients with diabetic nephropathy suggests recapitulation of this programme during the development of renal disease.
from a panel of genes regulated by tgfβ and ccn <dig>  we used co-inertia analysis to identify and then experimentally verify a subset of transcription factors, e2f <dig> and creb, that regulate an expression fingerprint implicated in altered actin dynamics and cell hypertrophy.
tgfβ and ccn <dig> attenuate creb and augment e2f <dig> transcriptional activation with the likely effect of altering actin cytoskeletal and cell growth/hypertrophic gene activity with implications for cell dysfunction in diabetic kidney disease.
