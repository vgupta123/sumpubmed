this functional insight can be used to improve the annotation of related organisms and provides a route to evaluate the evolution of this important and diverse group of transporter proteins.
the expressed set of transporters mediates cellular metabolic capabilities and influences signal transduction pathways and regulatory networks.
these assignments provide unique insight for the metabolic capabilities of this organism and are consistent with the ecological niche of strain isolation.
the functional annotation of most transporters is currently limited to general classification into families.
to improve the utility of the functional annotation for abc transporters, we expressed and purified the set of solute binding proteins from rhodopseudomonas palustris and characterized their ligand-binding specificity.
the collection of binding ligands is representative of common functionalities associated with many bacterial organisms as well as specific capabilities linked to the ecological niche occupied by r. palustris.
the functional screen identified specific ligands that bound to abc transporter periplasmic binding subunits from r. palustris.
the development of capabilities to map ligands with specific transporters would improve our knowledge of the function of these proteins, improve the annotation of related genomes, and facilitate predictions for their role in cellular responses to environmental changes.
transporter proteins are one of an organismâ€™s primary interfaces with the environment.
