gene ontology analysis was performed against differentially expressed genes and gene ontology terms related to vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis were found to be significantly affected at the early stage at which megamitochondria were not formed  after sps <dig> knockdown.
levels of pyridoxal phosphate, an active form of vitamin b <dig>  were decreased by sps <dig> knockdown.
although sps <dig> does not contain selenophosphate synthesis activity, it was found to be essential for cell growth and embryogenesis in drosophila.
these results indicate that sps <dig> regulates vitamin b <dig> synthesis, which in turn impacts various cellular systems such as amino acid metabolism, defense and other important metabolic activities.
interestingly, genes related to defense and amino acid metabolism were affected at a later stage  following knockdown.
differentially expressed genes in drosophila sl <dig> cells were identified using two-way analysis of variance methods and clustered according to their temporal expression pattern.
