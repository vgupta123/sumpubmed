in our model, regulation drives metabolism toward a region of flux space that allows nearly optimal growth.
yet fba models exhibit persistent mathematical degeneracy that generally limits their predictive power.
accounting for suboptimal solutions can improve the predictive power of metabolic fba models.
flux balance analysis is a theoretically elegant, computationally efficient, genome-scale approach to predicting biochemical reaction fluxes.
near-optimal flux configurations within this region are considered equally plausible and not subject to further optimizing regulation.
we propose a novel objective function for cellular metabolism that accounts for and exploits degeneracy in the metabolic network to improve flux predictions.
because fluctuations of enzyme and metabolite levels are inevitable, tolerance for suboptimality may support a functionally robust metabolic network.
