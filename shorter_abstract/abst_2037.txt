snppicker optimizes the selection of tag snps from common bin-tagging programs to design custom genotyping panels.
linkage disequilibrium  bin-tagging algorithms identify a reduced set of tag snps that can capture the genetic variation in a population without genotyping every single snp.
however, existing tag snp selection algorithms for designing custom genotyping panels do not take into account all platform dependent factors affecting the likelihood of a tag snp to be successfully genotyped and many of the constraints that can be imposed by the user.
the application uses a multi-step search strategy in combination with a statistical model to maximize the genotyping success of the selected tag snps.
snppicker can also optimize tag snp selection for a panel tagging multiple populations.
