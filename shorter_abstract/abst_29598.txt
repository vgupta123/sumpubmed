cross-genome phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify eight major groups of gpcrs dividing them into  <dig> clusters of  <dig> human and  <dig> drosophila proteins  and reveal unexpected levels of evolutionary conservation across human and drosophila gpcrs.
similarly, a group of drosophila gpcrs , associated in aging, is not present in humans.
a higher level of phylogenetic organization was revealed in which clusters with common domain architecture or cellular localization or ligand structure or chemistry or a shared function are evident across human and drosophila genomes.
such analyses will prove valuable for identifying the natural ligands of drosophila and human orphan receptors that can lead to a better understanding of physiological and pathological roles of these receptors.
phylogenetic clustering methods were used to elucidate the chemical nature of receptor ligands, which led to the identification of natural ligands for many orphan receptors.
we have clustered human and drosophila receptors with known ligands and orphans through cross genome phylogenetic analysis and hypothesized higher relationship of co-clustered members that would ease ligand identification, as related receptors share ligands with similar structure or class.
a large number of putative gpcrs are 'orphans' with no identified natural ligands.
our analysis suggests ligand class association to  <dig> unknown drosophila receptors and  <dig> unknown human gpcrs.
the first step in understanding the function of orphan gpcrs is to identify their ligands.
we also observe that members of human chemokine receptors, involved in immune response, and most of nucleotide-lipid receptors  do not have counterparts in drosophila.
