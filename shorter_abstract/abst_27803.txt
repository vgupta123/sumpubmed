an extensive transcriptome dataset was obtained by rna-seq, giving a comprehensive overview of the root transcriptomes at tillering and heading stages in a heterotic rice cross and providing a useful resource for the rice research community.
using comparative transcriptome analysis, we detected dghp and identified a group of potential candidate transcripts.
several significant dghp that could be mapped to quantitative trait loci  for yield and root traits are also involved in carbohydrate metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction pathways.
the changes in the expression of the candidate transcripts may lay a foundation for future studies on molecular mechanisms underlying root heterosis.
heterosis is a phenomenon in which hybrids exhibit superior performance relative to parental phenotypes.
approximately  <dig> million high-quality paired-end reads  were generated and aligned against the nipponbare reference genome.
in addition to the heterosis of above-ground agronomic traits on which most existing studies have focused, root heterosis is also an indispensable component of heterosis in the entire plant and of major importance to plant breeding.
consequently, systematic investigations of root heterosis, particularly in reproductive-stage rice, are needed.
at the heading stage, the dghp were significantly enriched in pathways related to processes such as carbohydrate metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction, with most of the key genes that are involved in the two pathways being up-regulated in the hybrid.
