the detection of low abundance toxins, as observed in this and other studies, indicates a greater compositional similarity of venoms  among advanced snakes than has been previously recognized.
we have constructed a cdna library of the venom gland of a threatened rattlesnake , sistrurus catenatus edwardsii , and sequenced  <dig> ests.
we also observed polyadenylated ribosomal rnas in the venom gland library, an interesting preliminary obsevation of this unusual phenomenon in a reptilian system.
in addition to the transcripts encoding common venom proteins, we detected two varieties of low abundance unique transcripts in the library; these encode for three-finger toxins and a novel toxin possibly generated from the fusion of two genes.
snake venoms are complex mixtures of pharmacologically active proteins and peptides which belong to a small number of superfamilies.
the presence of a fused toxin indicates that in addition to gene duplication and accelerated evolution, exon shuffling or transcriptional splicing may also contribute to generating the diversity of toxins and toxin isoforms observed among snake venoms.
our results demonstrate a high abundance of serine proteinase and metalloproteinase transcripts, indicating that the disruption of hemostasis is a principle mechanism of action of the venom.
global cataloguing of the venom transcriptome facilitates the identification of new families of toxins as well as helps in understanding the evolution of venom proteomes.
the three-finger toxins are characteristic of most elapid venoms but are rare in viperid venoms.
