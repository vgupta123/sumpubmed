in this study, transcriptome changes were analyzed using a 21â€‰k oligonucleotide microarray and qpcr in the distal intestine of atlantic salmon fed diets based on five plant protein sources combined with soybean saponins.
diets with corn gluten, sunflower, rapeseed or horsebean produced minor effects while the combination of saponins with pea protein concentrate caused enteritis and major transcriptome changes.
use of plant ingredients in aquaculture feeds is impeded by high contents of antinutritional factors such as saponins, which may cause various pharmacological and biological effects.
impairment of digestion was further suggested by expression changes of nutrient transporters and regulators of water balance .
marked down-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism was also observed, possibly increasing vulnerability of the intestinal tissue.
a hallmark of metabolic changes was dramatic down-regulation of lipid, bile and steroid metabolism.
multiple gene expression profiling further characterised the inflammation and described the intestinal pathology at the molecular level.
annexin- <dig>  with important anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective properties, was markedly up-regulated.
the current study promoted understanding of salmon intestinal pathology and establishment of a model for feed induced enteritis.
furthermore, augmented synthesis of polyamines needed for cellular proliferation  and increased mucus production  could participate in mucosal healing and restoration of normal tissue function.
