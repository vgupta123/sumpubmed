the asian rice gall midge  is a destructive insect pest of rice.
southern hybridization analysis indicated that oodad <dig> was present as a single copy in the genomes of the asian rice gall midge biotypes   <dig>   <dig> and 4 m. in the interactions involving gmb <dig> with jaya  the expression level of oodad <dig> in feeding maggots gradually increased to 3-fold at 96hai  and peaked to  <dig> -fold at 96hai when compared to that at  <dig> hai.
the cdna coding for the dad <dig> orthologue in the rice gall midge  consisted of  <dig> nucleotides with one intron of 85 bp and two exons of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides.
the results indicate that the expression of oodad <dig> is triggered in the feeding maggots probably due to the host resistance response and therefore, is likely an important molecule in the initial stages of the interaction between the midge and its rice host.
the deduced amino acid sequence of oodad <dig> showed a high degree of homology  with dad <dig> orthologue from the hessian fly  —a major dipteran pest of wheat.
gall midge infestation in rice triggers either compatible or incompatible interactions leading to survival or mortality of the feeding maggots, respectively.
in incompatible interactions, generation of plant allelochemicals/defense molecules and/or inability of the maggots to continue feeding on the host initiate apoptosis within the maggots.
unraveling these molecular events, triggered within the maggots as a response to feeding on resistant hosts, will enable us to obtain a better understanding of host resistance.
