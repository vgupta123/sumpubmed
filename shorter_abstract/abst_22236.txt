structures were predicted for exon <dig>  two domains of exon <dig> and the full hotair sequence.
phylogenetic analysis revealed discrete evolutionary dynamics for orthologous sequences of hotair exons.
hotair exists in mammals, has poorly conserved sequences and considerably conserved structures, and has evolved faster than nearby hoxc genes.
exons of hotair show distinct evolutionary features, and a  <dig> bp domain in the  <dig> bp exon <dig> is especially conserved.
like the well-characterised lncrna xist, hotair binds to polycomb proteins to methylate histones at multiple hoxd loci, but unlike xist, many details of its structure and function, as well as the trans regulation, remain unclear.
to identify conserved domains in hotair and study the phylogenetic distribution of this lncrna, we searched the genomes of  <dig> mammalian and  <dig> non-mammalian vertebrates for matches to its  <dig> exons and the two conserved domains within the  <dig> bp exon <dig> using infernal.
there was just one high-scoring hit for each mammal, but many low-scoring hits were found in both mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates.
these hits and their flanking genes in four placental mammals and platypus were examined to determine whether hotair contained elements shared by other lncrnas.
structure prediction identifies two fragments in the 5' end exon <dig> and the 3' end domain b of exon <dig>  with sequence and structure invariably occurring in various predicted structures of exon <dig>  the domain b of exon <dig> and the full hotair.
the sequence and structure of two fragments, in exon <dig> and the domain b of exon <dig> respectively, were identified to robustly occur in predicted structures of exon <dig>  domain b of exon <dig> and the full hotair in mammals.
different from all the others that function in cis to regulate local gene expression, the newly identified hotair is located between hoxc <dig> and hoxc <dig> in the human genome and regulates hoxd expression in multiple tissues.
these features, together with the absence of some exons and sequences in mouse, rat and kangaroo, suggest ab initio generation of hotair in marsupials.
