the global ppgpp-mediated stringent response in pathogenic bacteria plays an important role in the pathogenesis of bacterial infections.
to understand the control of virulence genes by ppgpp in s. typhimurium, agarose 2-dimensional electrophoresis  combined with mass spectrometry was used and a comprehensive 2-de reference map of amino acid-starved s. typhimurium strain sh <dig>  a derivative of atcc  <dig>  was established.
using a mouse infection model, we further identified a novel virulence-associated factor, stm <dig>  from the ppgpp-regulated and salmonella-specific proteins.
a proteomic approach using a 2-de reference map can prove a powerful tool for analyzing virulence factors and the regulatory network involved in salmonella pathogenesis.
in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium , several genes, including virulence genes, are regulated by ppgpp when bacteria are under the stringent response.
our results also provide evidence of a global response mediated by ppgpp in s. enterica.
in addition, salmonella strains carrying mutations in the gene encoding stm <dig> showed growth defects and impaired growth within macrophage-like raw <dig>  cells.
