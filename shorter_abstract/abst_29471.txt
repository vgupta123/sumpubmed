wounding, uv treatment and meja application on c. roseus leaves resulted in the transcript accumulation of crmpk <dig> as well as activation of mapk in c. roseus leaves.
immuno-precipitation followed by immunoblot analysis revealed that wounding, uv treatment and methyl jasmonate  activate crmpk <dig>  transient over-expression of crmpk <dig> in c. roseus leaf tissue showed enhanced expression of key mia biosynthesis pathway genes and also accumulation of specific mias.
results from our study suggest a possible involvement of crmpk <dig> in abiotic stress signal transduction towards regulation of transcripts of key mia biosynthetic pathway genes, regulators and accumulation of major mias.
crmpk <dig> expressed in bacterial system is an active kinase as it showed auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylation of myelin basic protein.
