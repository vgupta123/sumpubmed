our results strengthened the implication of apoptosis and autophagy processes in symbiont elimination and recycling.
functional analysis of the host differentially expressed genes by rna sequencing showed that the main transcriptional changes occur during endosymbiont growth phase and affect cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, phagocytosis, and metabolism of fatty acids and nucleic acids.
we performed rna sequencing analysis on weevil midguts at three representative phases of the endosymbiont dynamics .
we show that endosymbiont dynamics parallels numerous transcriptional changes in weevil developing adults and affects several biological processes, including metabolism and development.
the endosymbiont population load undergoes changes along with insect development.
we also showed that symbiont dynamics alters the expression of several genes involved in insect development.
to screen genes which transcriptional changes are specifically related to symbiont dynamics and not to the intrinsic development of the midgut, we further have monitored by rt-qpcr sixteen gene transcript levels in symbiotic and artificially non-symbiotic  weevils.
strikingly, immunity is repressed during the whole process, presumably avoiding tissue inflammation and allowing insects to optimize nutrient recovery from recycled endosymbiont.
in the cereal weevil sitophilus oryzae, the midgut endosymbionts sodalis pierantonius drastically multiply following adult metamorphosis and rapidly decline until total elimination when the insect achieves its cuticle synthesis.
