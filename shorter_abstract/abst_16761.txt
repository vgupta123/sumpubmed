six models with different minor allele frequencies  and different sample sizes were used to generate the six simulation data sets.
comparison of results from the simulation data and real data sets showed that fmdr identified significant geneâ€“gene interaction with less computational complexity than the mdr in high-order interaction analysis.
however, the astronomical number of high-order combinations makes mdr a highly time-consuming process which can be difficult to implement for multiple tests to identify more complex interactions between genes.
a real data set was obtained from the mitochondrial d-loop of chronic dialysis patients.
this study proposes a new framework, named fast mdr , which is a greedy search strategy based on the joint effect property.
