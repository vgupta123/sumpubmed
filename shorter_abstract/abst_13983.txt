in this paper, we describe the ontology-based mediator developed in the amine system project () using the infrastructure of semantic directories, and how this system has been used to solve a case related to amine metabolism-related protein structures.
for this purpose, a multidisciplinary group has started an ontology-based system named the amine system project  for which amine-related information is the validation bench.
amines are biogenic amino acid derivatives, which play pleiotropic and very important yet complex roles in animal physiology.
