embryonic and fetal hemoglobin have higher oxygen affinities than the adult hemoglobin, sustaining the oxygen demand of the developing organism.
during development, humans and other jawed vertebrates  express distinct hemoglobin genes, resulting in different hemoglobin tetramers.
three hemoglobin genes are specifically expressed in the embryo, four genes in the filter feeding larva , and nine genes correspond to the adult hemoglobin chains.
we further showed the differential expression of other globin genes: myoglobin  <dig> is most highly expressed in the reproductive adult, myoglobin  <dig> expression peaks in the larva.
during the development from the parasitic to the reproductive adult, the composition of hemoglobin changes again, with a massive increase of chain ahb <dig>  a single hemoglobin chain is expressed constitutively in all stages.
globin x <dig> is restricted to the embryo; globin x <dig> was only found in the reproductive adult.
little is known about the expression of hemoglobins during development of jawless vertebrates .
because the hemoglobins of jawed and jawless vertebrates evolved independently from a common globin ancestor, hemoglobin switching must also have evolved convergently in these taxa.
we identified three hemoglobin switches in the life cycle of the sea lamprey.
notably, the ontogeny of sea lamprey hemoglobins essentially recapitulates their phylogeny, with the embryonic hemoglobins emerging first, followed by the evolution of larval and adult hemoglobins.
cytoglobin is expressed at low levels throughout the life cycle.
