this paper presents protopia, a biological tool that offers a way of searching for proteins and their interactions in different protein interaction web databases, as a part of a multidisciplinary initiative of our institution for the integration of biological data .
protein-protein interactions can be considered the basic skeleton for living organism self-organization and homeostasis.
the tool accesses the different databases , and results are expressed with biological protein names or databases codes and can be depicted as a vector or a matrix.
results are compatible with the most important network analysers, so that they can be compared and analysed by other world-wide known tools and platforms.
