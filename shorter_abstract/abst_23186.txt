in this study we have conducted a genome-scale survey of medium-length ncrnas from the protozoan parasites giardia intestinalis and trichomonas vaginalis.
results indicate that giardia intestinalis and trichomonas vaginalis, like their distant multicellular relatives, contain a rich infrastructure of rna-based processing.
we have also uncovered  <dig> new h/aca box snornas, expanding our knowledge of the h/aca family of snornas.
