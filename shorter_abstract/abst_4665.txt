specific gene expression analysis of the putative inner cell mass  and the trophectoderm  revealed that pig and mouse pre-implantation embryos share regulatory networks during the first lineage segregation and primitive endoderm differentiation, but not during ectoderm commitment.
this activation was delayed to the 8-cell stage in scnt embryos.
in addition, the global gene expression patterns in the pig scnt embryos were different from those in in vivo-derived pig embryos.
pig zygotic genome activation was confirmed to occur at the 4-cell stage via genome-wide gene expression analysis.
also, fatty acid metabolism appears to be a unique characteristic of pig pre-implantation embryonic development.
we identified and analyzed the genome wide transcriptomes of pig in vivo-derived and somatic cell nuclear transferred  as well as mouse in vivo-derived pre-implantation embryos at different stages using mrna deep sequencing.
our results provide a resource for pluripotent stem cell engineering and for understanding pig development.
comparison of the pig embryonic transcriptomes with those of mouse and human pre-implantation embryos revealed unique gene expression patterns during pig ped.
