void networks were stripped down until their essential connectivity features remained.
we isolated neighboring cells in 3d images of apple and pear cortex tissues, and constructed a virtual sieve to discard incorrectly segmented cell particles or unseparated clumps of cells.
3d high-resolution x-ray imaging methods have emerged over the last years for visualising the anatomy of tissue samples without substantial sample preparation.
statistical analysis of structural parameters showed significant differences between genotypes in the void and cell networks that relate to differences in aeration properties of the tissues.
a new model for effective oxygen diffusivity of parenchyma tissue is proposed that not only accounts for the tortuosity of interconnected voids, but also for significant diffusion across cells where the void network is not connected.
we present here an automated procedure for processing high-resolution x-ray images of parenchyma tissues of apple  and pear  as a rapid objective method for characterizing 3d plant tissue anatomy at the level of single cells and intercellular spaces.
quantitative analysis of cells and intercellular spaces in these images has, however, been difficult and was largely based on manual image processing.
