in this study, a novel reporter virus-based system was developed for measuring neutralization and ade activity.
dengue virus  still poses a global public health threat, and no vaccine or antiviral therapy is currently available.
the newly developed assay was finally validated with clinical samples from infected animals and individuals.
antibody plays distinct roles in controlling denv infections.
neutralizing antibody is protective against denv infection, whereas sub-neutralizing concentration of antibody can increase denv infection, termed antibody-dependent enhancement .
luciferase value analysis using various known denv-specific monoclonal antibodies showed good repeatability and a well linear correlation with conventional plaque-based assays.
this reporter virus-based assay for neutralizing and enhancing antibody evaluation is rapid, lower cost, and high throughput, and will be helpful for laboratory detection and epidemiological investigation for denv antibodies.
