conjugation of the ubiquitin-like modifier nedd <dig> to cullins is critical for the function of scf-type ubiquitin ligases and thus facilitates ubiquitin conjugation and ultimately degradation of scf substrates, including several cell cycle regulators.
here we show that in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe, the yuh <dig> orthologue, uch <dig>  is not the sole nedd <dig> processing enzyme.
several enzymes contribute to nedd <dig> precursor processing including a number of deubiquitylating enzymes.
in saccharomyces cerevisiae this is carried out exclusively by the enzyme yuh <dig>
