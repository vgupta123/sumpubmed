furthermore, we provide a solution to apply the fed-batch strategy in shake flasks.
by this way the fed-batch strategy can be applied from the early screening steps also in laboratories which do not have access to high-cost and complicated bioreactor systems.
optimization of processes using the aox <dig> promoter in p. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed-batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon/energy starvation.
the recommended standard protocol for methanol addition in shake flasks using pulse feeding is non-optimal and leads to repeated long phases of methanol starvation.
by using the human collagen ii as an example we show that a quasi-continuous feeding profile, being the simplest way of a fed-batch fermentation, results in a higher production level of human collagen ii.
by applying on-line po <dig> monitoring we demonstrate that the widely used pulse feeding of methanol results in long phases of methanol exhaustion and consequently low expression of aox <dig> controlled genes.
here we describe a new technical solution for optimization of pichia pastoris shake flask cultures with the example of production of stable human type ii collagen.
production of recombinant proteins in p. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong aox <dig> promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol.
