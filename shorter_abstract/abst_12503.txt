one parent  was stressed, the other  carried a genetic event detector.
in the progeny of older plants , while effects were also infrequent, those that were seen followed a consistent pattern: rates of all five genetic events were lowest at 12 °c and highest at 32 °c, i.e.
plants exposed to environmental stresses draw upon many genetic and epigenetic strategies, with the former sometimes modulated by the latter.
some evidence has led to proposals that  genetic changes can be both selective and sustainably heritable, while other evidence suggests that changes are effectively stochastic, and important only because they induce genetic variation.
while the infrequency of effects suggests the need for cautious inference, the consistency of responses in the progeny of older plants, indicate that in some circumstances the level of stochasticity in inherited genetic responses to heat or cold stress can be context-dependent, possibly reflecting life-cycle stages in the parental generation that are variably stress sensitive.
collectively, they do not point to any consistent patterns.

studies of how heat and cold affect the rates of meiotic recombination  and somatic mutations  report increases, decreases, or no effect.

one type of stress with an arguably high level of stochasticity in its effects is temperature stress.
