we predicted h3k4me <dig> target sequences by using the n- score model and found that the prediction accuracy is indeed high in es cells.the software to compute the mim is freely available at: https://github.com/lucapinello/mim.
an important question is to what extent such interactions are regulated at the dna sequence level.
we present a simple, unbiased quantitative measure for dna sequence specificity called the motif independent measure .
our method provides a unified framework for quantifying dna sequence specificity and serves as a guide for development of sequence-based prediction models.
by analyzing both simulated and real experimental data, we found that the mim measure can be used to detect sequence specificity independent of presence of transcription factor  binding motifs.
however, current investigation is hampered by the lack of computational methods for systematic evaluating sequence specificity.
genome-wide mapping of protein-dna interactions has been widely used to investigate biological functions of the genome.
