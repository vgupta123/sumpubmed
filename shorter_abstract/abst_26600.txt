in order to generate more accurate consensus sequences from ests, tools are needed to reduce or eliminate errors from de novo assemblies.
iassembler employs mira and cap <dig> assemblers to generate initial assemblies, followed by identifying and correcting two common types of transcriptome assembly errors: 1) ests from different transcripts  are incorrectly assembled into same contigs; and 2) ests from same transcripts fail to be assembled together.
we present iassembler, a pipeline that can assemble large-scale ests into consensus sequences with significantly higher accuracy than current existing assemblers.
however current de novo est assembly programs often generate large number of assembly errors that will negatively affect the downstream analysis.
we compared performances of iassembler and several other de novo est assembly programs using both roche- <dig> and sanger est datasets.
it demonstrated that iassembler generated significantly more accurate consensus sequences than other assembly programs.
expressed sequence tags  have played significant roles in gene discovery and gene functional analysis, especially for non-model organisms.
iassembler can be used to assemble ests generated using the traditional sanger method and/or the roche- <dig> massive parallel pyrosequencing technology.
