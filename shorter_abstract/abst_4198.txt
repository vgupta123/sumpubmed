in particular, photosynthetic cyanobacteria are capable of directly converting carbon dioxide into ffa.
pcc  <dig>  we further show that the top ranked cyanobacterial strains are unicellular and primarily include prochlorococcus  and marine synechococcus  that cluster phylogenetically.
moreover, two principal categories of enzymes were shown to influence ffa production the most: those ensuring precursor availability for the biosynthesis of lipids, and those involved in handling the oxidative stress associated to ffa synthesis.
here we present the ffa sc , an in silico screening method that evaluates the potential for ffa production and excretion of cyanobacterial strains based on their proteomes.
among  <dig> cyanobacterial strains, ffasc identified  <dig> candidate chassis strains that rank in their ffa producing and excreting potential above the specifically engineered reference strain, synechococcus sp.
a literature search allowed for the compilation of  <dig> proteins, most of which influence ffa production and a few of which affect ffa excretion.
although more than  <dig> cyanobacterial genomes are sequenced, the natural potential of these strains for ffa production and excretion has not been systematically estimated.
the proteins are classified into  <dig> orthologous groups  that helped create rules used in the scoring/ranking of algorithms developed to estimate the potential for ffa production and excretion of an organism.
to our knowledge ffasc is the first in silico method to screen cyanobacteria proteomes for their potential to produce and excrete ffa, as well as the first attempt to parameterize the criteria derived from genetic characteristics that are favorable/non-favorable for this purpose.
