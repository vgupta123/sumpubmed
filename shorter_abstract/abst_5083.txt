endogenous prodh <dig> expression was not able to overcome pro sensitivity of prodh <dig> mutants, but overexpression of a gfp-tagged form of prodh <dig> enabled the utilisation of pro as single nitrogen source for growth.
we demonstrate vasculature specific expression of the arabidopsis prodh <dig> gene  as well as enzymatic activity and mitochondrial localisation of the encoded protein.
we hypothesise that prodh <dig> plays an important role in pro homeostasis in the vasculature, especially under stress conditions that promote pro accumulation.
expression levels of prodh <dig> are generally low, but increased in senescent leaves and in the abscission zone of floral organs.
while p5cdh is a single copy gene in arabidopsis, two prodh genes have been identified in the genome.
while prodh <dig> appears to be the dominant isoform under most conditions and in most tissues, prodh <dig> was specifically upregulated during salt stress, when prodh <dig> was repressed.
proline  accumulation is a widespread response of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells subjected to osmotic stress or dehydration.
the characterisation of prodh <dig> as a functional gene requires a careful re-analysis of mutants with a deletion of prodh <dig>  which were so far considered to be devoid of prodh activity.
arabidopsis possesses two functional prodhs, which have non-redundant, although partially overlapping physiological functions.
