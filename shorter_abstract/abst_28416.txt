we designed a pan-microbial detection array  to detect all known viruses , bacteria and plasmids and developed a novel statistical analysis method to identify mixtures of organisms from complex samples hybridized to the array.
the mda can be used to identify the suite of viruses and bacteria present in complex samples.
identifying the bacteria and viruses present in a complex sample is useful in disease diagnostics, product safety, environmental characterization, and research.
in clinical fecal, serum, and respiratory samples, the mda was able to detect and characterize multiple viruses, phage, and bacteria in a sample to the family and species level, as confirmed by pcr.
family-specific probes were selected for all sequenced viral and bacterial complete genomes, segments, and plasmids.
