we used the orfeome rnai library to identify genes that interact with c. elegans lin- <dig> rb and identified  <dig> genes that showed synthetic or enhanced rnai phenotypes in lin- <dig> mutants as compared to rrf- <dig> and eri- <dig> rnai hypersensitive mutants.
partial inactivation of specific spliceosome components revealed further similarities with lin- <dig> rb functions in cell-cycle control, transgene expression and restricted expression of germline granules.
based on characterizations of a deletion allele, the synthetic lin- <dig> interactor zfp- <dig> was found to suppress rnai and to cooperate with lin- <dig> rb in somatic gonad development.
for instance, lin- <dig> rb is a synthetic multivulva  class b gene, which causes a multivulva phenotype when inactivated simultaneously with a class a or c synmuv gene.
we identified an extensive series of candidate lin- <dig> rb interacting genes and validated zfp- <dig> as a novel lin- <dig> synthetic lethal gene.
our data support novel hypotheses about possibilities for anti-cancer therapies and multilevel regulation of gene expression.
interestingly, ten splicing-related genes were found to function similar to lin- <dig> rb, as synmuv b genes that prevent inappropriate vulval induction.
the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor  acts in a conserved pathway that is deregulated in most human cancers.
