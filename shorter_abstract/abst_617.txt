methods for cultivation of honeybee embryonic cells are discussed here.
in vitro cultivation of cells allows novel investigation of in vivo- mechanisms and is a helpful tool in developmental biology, biochemistry and functional genomics.
pre-gastrula stage embryos were used to initiate cultures, and cells were reared on 96-wells microplates with grace insect medium, supplemented with fetal bovine serum.
results represent a highly useful in vitro-system for studying a model organism of increasing importance in areas such as aging, sociality and neurobiology.
however, this is not the case for successful long-term cultivation of cells in honeybees.
we report here, for the first time, long-term cultivation of honeybee cells.
