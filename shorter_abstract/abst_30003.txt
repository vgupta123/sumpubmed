these results also provide further evidence that the eutherian x-chromosome has actively recruited sex and reproductive-related genes during mammalian evolution.
these genes have not been characterised in any non-eutherian mammals.
tammar tgif <dig> shared a similar expression pattern during embryogenesis, sexual differentiation and in adult tissues to that of tgif <dig> in eutherian mammals, suggesting it has been functionally conserved.
the distribution and localization of tgif <dig> in tammar adult gonads suggest that there has been an ultra-conserved function for the tgif family in fertility and that tgif <dig> already functioned in spermatogenesis and potentially folliculogenesis long before its retrotransposition to the x-chromosome of eutherian mammals.
tgif <dig> was detected for the first time in the ovary with mrna produced in the granulosa and theca cells, suggesting it may also play a role in folliculogenesis.
there was no mrna detected in mature spermatozoa.
tammar tgif <dig> was ubiquitously expressed throughout early development as in the human and mouse, but in the adult, it was expressed only in the gonads and spleen, more like the expression pattern of human tgiflx and mouse tex <dig>  tammar tgif <dig> mrna was specifically detected in round and elongated spermatids.
we therefore studied the tgif family in the tammar wallaby  to investigate their roles in reproduction and how and when these genes may have evolved their functions and chromosomal locations.
human tgiflx and its orthologue, tex <dig> in the mouse, are x-linked genes that are only expressed in the adult testis.
tgif <dig> protein was specifically located in the cytoplasm of spermatids, and in the residual body and the mid-piece of the mature sperm tail.
