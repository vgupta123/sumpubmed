various strategies, including the use of inosine bases at the sites of divergence of the target sequences were investigated.
duplex rna were designed to have incomplete complementarity with the 3'utr sequences of both target genes.
the emphasis so far in sirna therapeutics has been the design of one sirna with complete complementarity to the intended target.
use of a cyan fusion reporter with target sites constructed in its 3'utr demonstrated that the repression of vegf and icam- <dig> by codemir- <dig> was indeed due to interaction with the target sequence.
an exhaustive analysis of sequence variants of codemir- <dig> demonstrated a clear positive correlation between activity against vegf  and the length of the contiguous complementary region .
we have investigated the possibility of using a single short synthetic duplex rna to suppress the expression of vegf-a and icam-1; genes implicated in the progression of ocular neovascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.
