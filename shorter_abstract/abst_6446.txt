furthermore, we have shown that the sequencing depth obtained is adequate for credible snp genotyping analysis at uniplex, duplex and pentaplex levels.
we undertook a genotyping study and were successful in the discovery of novel snp alleles in all samples at uniplex, duplex and pentaplex levels.
after localisation of the linkage region, efficient genetic dissection of the disease linked loci requires that functional variants are identified across the loci.
our work describes the successful combination of a targeted enrichment method and index barcode multiplexing to reduce costs, time and labour associated with processing large sample sets.
