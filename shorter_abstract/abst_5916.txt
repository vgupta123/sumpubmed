binding of a cross-reactive anti-sirp fab fragment to sirpγ stabilises a conformation that favours sirp dimer formation in the crystal structure, though this interaction does not appear sufficiently stable to be observed in solution.
here we describe the first full length structure of the extracellular region of human sirpγ.
the three-domain extracellular regions of sirps are structurally conserved but show conformational flexibility in the disposition of the amino terminal ligand-binding ig domain relative to the two membrane proximal ig domains.
comparison of the three domain structures of sirpγ and sirpα showed that these receptors can adopt different overall conformations due to the flexibility of the linker between the first two domains.
we obtained crystals of sirpγ by making a complex of the protein with the fab fragment of the anti-sirp antibody, ox <dig>  which also binds to sirpα and sirpβ.
