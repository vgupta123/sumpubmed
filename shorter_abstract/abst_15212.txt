on the “request” night, an increase in oxy-hb level in the right prefrontal cortex and a decrease in δ power were observed in the “success” group around  <dig> min before self-awakening, whereas no such changes were observed in the “failure” group.
on the “surprise” night, no significant changes were observed in oxy-hb level or δ power in either group.
these findings demonstrate a correlation between self-awakening and a pre-awakening increase in hemodynamic activation in the right prefrontal cortex, suggesting the structure’s contribution to time estimation ability.
fifteen healthy right-handed male volunteers with regular sleep habits participated in a consecutive two-night crossover study.
no significant differences were observed in the amounts of sleep in each stage between conditions or between groups.
some people can subconsciously wake up naturally  at a desired/planned time without external time stimuli.
this study sought to examine the relationship between hemodynamic changes in oxyhemoglobin  level in the prefrontal cortex and sleep structures during sleep in subjects instructed to self-awaken.
