moreover, recurrent correlations from the epigenetic to the translational level are identified.
similarity scoring allows the identification of global patterns in dynamic heterogeneous data.
here, a potential new role for the gene lsm14a in cytokinesis is suggested.
thus, software that is able to bring the network, phenotypic and temporal information together is needed.
version  <dig>  introduces novel features that allow handling time course data in a phenotypic context.
gene expression levels or other measures can be loaded and visualized at different time points and phenotypic comparison is facilitated through clustering and correlation display or highlighting of impacting changes through time.
first, we analyze a medium scale dataset that looks at perturbation effects of the pluripotency regulator nanog in murine embryonic stem cells.
