a dramatically diminished interaction was shown to correlate with a decrease in vipb stability and a loss of hemolysin co-regulated protein  secretion and rendered the bacterium unable to compete with escherichia coli in a competition assay.
many gram-negative bacteria rely on a type vi secretion system  to infect eukaryotic cells or to compete against other microbes.
this confirms the biological relevance of the vipa-vipb interaction, which is essential for the t6ss activity of many important human pathogens.
common to these systems is the presence of two conserved proteins, in vibrio cholerae denoted vipa and vipb, which have been shown to interact in many clinically relevant pathogens.
