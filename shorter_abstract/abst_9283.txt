we compare the sashimi plots available in the igv viewer, the dexseq splicing plots and spliceseq to the manananggal interface and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these tools.
we show that sashimi plots  offer a practical solution for simple ases, but also indicate short-comings for highly complex genes.
in contrast to spliceseq and the dexseq splicing plot, manananggal does not obscure the gene structure by showing full transcript models that makes it easier to determine which isoforms are expressed and which are not.
manananggal includes a web application for visual inspection and a command line tool that allows for ase detection.
manananggal is an interactive web application that offers functions specifically tailored to the identification of alternative splicing events that other tools are lacking.
