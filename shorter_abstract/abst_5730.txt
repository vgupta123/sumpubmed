here we present biochemical characterization and crystal structure determination of the periplasmic ribose-binding protein  from the hyperthermophile thermotoga maritima in its ribose-bound and unliganded state.
polar ligand interactions and ligand-induced global conformational changes are conserved among ecrbp and tmrbp; however local structural rearrangements involving side-chain motions in the ligand-binding site are not conserved.
the t. maritima rbp  has 39% sequence identity and is considerably more resistant to thermal denaturation  than the mesophilic escherichia coli homolog  .
biological responses are typically mediated by ligand-induced conformational changes in which the binding event is coupled to a hinge-bending motion that brings together two domains in a closed form.
understanding the mechanistic details of pbp conformational changes, both global  and local , therefore is not only important for understanding their biological function but also for protein engineering experiments.
