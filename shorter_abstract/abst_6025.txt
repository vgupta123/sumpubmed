polymeric alkylpyridinium salts , are chemical defences produced by marine sponges including reniera sarai.
acute application of poly-aps , reduced membrane potential, input resistance and suppressed action potential firing.
poly-aps evoked inward cation currents with linear current-voltage relationships similar to actions of pore formers on other cell types.
synthetic structurally related oligomers were not potent pore formers when compared to poly-aps and affected a smaller percentage of the hippocampal neurone population.
poly-aps  also produced ca2+ transients in ~41% of neurones.
of the synthetic oligomers tested compounds  <dig>  and tetrameric  <dig>  induced small transient currents and  <dig>  and  <dig>  produced significant ca2+ transients in hippocampal neurones.
the dose-dependence of poly-aps actions were complex, such that at  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps produced varying magnitudes of membrane permeability depending on the order of application.
using electrophysiology, calcium imaging and  <dig> -diphenyl- <dig> ,5-hexatriene imaging, the pore forming properties of poly-aps and four related synthetic oligomers have been tested on primary cultured rat hippocampal neurones.
poly-aps induced pore formation in hippocampal neurones and such pores were transient, with neurones recovering from exposure to these polymers.
even at 10– <dig> fold higher concentrations, none of the synthetic compounds produced changes in electrophysiological characteristics of the same magnitude as poly-aps.
poly-aps may have potential as agents for macromolecular delivery into cns neurones however; the smaller synthetic oligomers tested in this study show little potential for such use.
