when chondroitinase abc was used to abolish the function of endogenous cspgs on npcs, it induced a series of biological responses including the proliferation, differentiation and migration of npcs, indicating that cspgs may play a critical role in npc development and differentiation.
neural precursor cells  are defined by their ability to proliferate, self-renew, and retain the potential to differentiate into neurons and glia.
in the present study, we demonstrated that cspgs were constitutively expressed on the npcs isolated from the e <dig> rat embryonic brain.
the present study investigating the influence and mechanisms of cspgs on the differentiation and migration of npcs should help us to understand the basic biology of npcs during cns development and provide new insights into developing new strategies for the treatment of the neurological disorders in the cns.
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans  are prominent components of the extracellular matrix  in the central nervous system  and are assumed to play important roles in controlling neuronal differentiation and development.
