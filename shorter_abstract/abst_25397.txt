one of these proteins, ceacam <dig>  exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding n domain of ceacam <dig>  but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail.
the direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the possibility that ceacam <dig> evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species-specific pathogens.
thus, ceacam <dig> and ceacam <dig> are the first paired immune receptors identified within the cea gene family, which are expressed on t cells and are most likely involved in the fine-tuning of t cell responses.
since little is known about the cea gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging cea family by analyzing the cea family of the dog.
comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the ceacam <dig> n domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine ceacam1-related ceacams.
we found that the gene coding for the itim-bearing immunoregulatory molecule ceacam <dig> gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine cea gene family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice.
here we describe the complete cea gene family in the dog.
in addition, ceacam <dig> shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as ceacam <dig>  however, upon activation ceacam <dig> mrna and ceacam <dig> mrna are differentially regulated.
