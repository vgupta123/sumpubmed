candidate genes including interleukin receptors and fucosyltransferase have been found to be physically linked with these genetic markers and may play an important role in the differential immune response against this pathogen.
knowledge concerning the architecture of the resistance trait is needed before deciding on the most appropriate approach to enhance artificial selection for p. salmonis resistance in atlantic salmon.
linear regression and logistic regression models were tested.
<dig>  atlantic salmon smolts were experimentally challenged against p. salmonis by means of intra-peritoneal injection.
pisciricketssia salmonis is the causal agent of salmon rickettsial syndrome , which affects salmon species and causes severe economic losses.
the purpose of the study was to dissect the genetic variation in the resistance to this pathogen in atlantic salmon.
due to the small amount of variance explained by each significant marker we conclude that genetic resistance to this pathogen can be more efficiently improved with the implementation of genetic evaluations incorporating genotype information from a dense snp array.
a genome wide association analysis was performed on data from the challenged fish.
genome wide association analysis indicated that resistance to p. salmonis is a moderately polygenic trait.

the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by each marker is small, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .
selective breeding for disease resistance represents one approach for controlling srs in farmed atlantic salmon.
