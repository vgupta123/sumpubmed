the model was used for simulating the yeast metabolism under four different growth conditions and experimental data from these four conditions was integrated to the model.
further, the model was used as a scaffold for integrating transcriptomics, and flux data from four different conditions in order to identify transcriptionally controlled reactions, i.e.
we present a new yeast model that represents a comprehensive up-to-date collection of knowledge on yeast metabolism.
the model was constructed based on two earlier reconstructions, namely iin <dig> and the consensus network, and then improved and expanded using gap-filling methods and by introducing new reactions and pathways based on studies of the literature and databases.
since then continuous efforts have been made in order to improve and expand the yeast metabolic network.
here we present ito <dig>  a comprehensive genome-scale metabolic model that contains more reactions, metabolites and genes than previous models.
the model together with experimental data is a useful tool to identify condition-dependent changes of metabolism between different environmental conditions.
the genome-scale metabolic model of saccharomyces cerevisiae, first presented in  <dig>  was the first genome-scale network reconstruction for a eukaryotic organism.
