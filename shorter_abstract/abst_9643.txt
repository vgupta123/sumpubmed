accuracy of dsb repair in mammalian cellsepisomal model of nhejend- processing and re-ligationmetnase nucleasejoint accuracy
double stranded breaks  are the most serious form of dna damage and are repaired via homologous recombination repair  or non-homologous end joining .
we employed pcr and southern blot to follow the kinetics of repair and formation of processing intermediates, and replica plating to screen for plasmids with altered joints resulting in loss of chloramphenicol resistance.
moreover, quantitative pcr and southern blotting revealed less accurately repaired plasmids in metnase expressing cells.
metnase is only found in humans and primates and is a key component of the nhej pathway, but its function is not fully characterized in intact cells.
we found that repair of episomes by end-joining was highly accurate in 293 t cells that lack metnase.
here, we used ebv-based episomes carrying  <dig> resistance marker genes in repair studies where a single dsb is generated with virally-encoded ho endonuclease cleaving rapidly at high efficiency for a brief time post-infection.
however, the background of the cells is important in establishing accuracy; with human cells perhaps surprisingly much more prone to generate deletions at the repaired junctions, if/when metnase is abundantly expressed.
nhej predominates in mammalian cells at most stages of the cell cycle, and it is viewed as ‘error-prone’, although this notion has not been sufficiently challenged due to shortcomings of many current systems.
our careful re-examination of fidelity of nhej repair in mammalian cells carrying a 3′ cohesive overhang at the ends revealed that the repair is efficient and highly accurate, and predominant over hrr.
