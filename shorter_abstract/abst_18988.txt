asyn fibrils are the main component of inclusions called lewy bodies  which are found mainly in the surviving neurons of the substantia nigra.
the mathematical model presented here successfully simulates the dynamic phenomena of asyn overexpression and oligomerization and predicts the biological system’s behavior in a number of scenarios not used for model calibration.
in addition, it can help form new hypotheses for intervention that could be tested experimentally.
using a systems biology approach, we develop a biomolecular reactions model that describes the intracellular asyn dynamics in relation to overexpression, post-translational modification, oligomerization and degradation of the protein.
despite the accumulated knowledge regarding the involvement of asyn in molecular mechanisms underlying the development of pd, there is much information missing which prevents understanding the causes of the disease and how to stop its progression.
the model is validated by simulation studies of known experimental overexpression data from sh-sy5y cells and the unknown model parameters are estimated either computationally or by experimental fitting.
the calibrated model is then tested under three hypothetical intervention scenarios and in all cases predicts increased cell viability that agrees with experimental evidence.
especially for the proteolysis of asyn, the model takes into account the biological knowledge regarding the contribution of chaperone mediated autophagy , macro-autophagic and proteasome pathways in the protein’s degradation.
