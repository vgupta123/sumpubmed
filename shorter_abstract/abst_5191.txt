compared with the sham-control group, the number of differentially expressed genes was  <dig> in the acute phase ,  <dig> in the subacute phase , and  <dig> in the chronic phase , with an adjusted p-value < <dig>  by deseq.
kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis showed that the most enriched pathways included ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, axon guidance, dopaminergic synapses, glutamatergic synapses, gabaergic synapses, tnf, hif- <dig>  toll-like receptor, nf-kappa b, nod-like receptor, camp, calcium, oxytocin, rap <dig>  b cell receptor and chemokine signaling pathway.
spinal cord injury  results in fatal damage and currently has no effective treatment.
rna-seq results were obtained from total rna harvested from the spinal cords of sham control rats and rats in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases of sci .
these results will expand our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in sci and provide a foundation for future studies of spinal cord tissue damage and repair.
gene ontology  enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were most enriched in immune response, mhc protein complex, antigen processing and presentation, translation-related genes, structural constituent of ribosome, ion gated channel activity, small gtpase mediated signal transduction and cytokine and/or chemokine activity.
the transcriptomes were systematically characterized to identify the critical genes and pathways that are involved in sci pathology.
this study has not only characterized changes in global gene expression through various stages of sci progression in rats, but has also systematically identified the critical genes and signaling pathways in sci pathology.
