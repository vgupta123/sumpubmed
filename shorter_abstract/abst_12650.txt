in some simple cases, analytic solutions for binding equilibrium of ligand on clusters of receptors are provided, and supported by simulation results.
cellular response to changes in the concentration of different chemical species in the extracellular medium is induced by ligand binding to dedicated transmembrane receptors.
changing membrane receptors clustering could be a simple mechanism that allows cells to change and adapt its affinity/sensitivity toward a given stimulus.
