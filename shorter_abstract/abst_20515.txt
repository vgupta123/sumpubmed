we suggest that the co <dig> barcoding region, the universal dna barcode, is preferred among the mitochondrial protein-coding genes as a molecular diagnostic at least for eutherian species identification.
however, there is no compelling a priori reason for the exclusive focus on this region, and it has been shown that it performs poorly for certain animal groups.
based on  <dig>  mitochondrial genomes of eutherians, we found that the universal co <dig> barcoding region is a good representative of mitochondrial genes as a whole because the high species-recovery rate  was similar to that of other mitochondrial genes, and there were no significant differences in intra- or interspecific variability among genes.
our results also demonstrated that any choice of mitochondrial gene for dna barcoding failed to offer significant resolution at higher taxonomic levels.
to explore alternative mitochondrial barcoding regions, we compared the efficacy of the universal co <dig> barcoding region with the other mitochondrial protein-coding genes in eutherian mammals.
however, an overlap between intra- and interspecific variability was still problematic for all mitochondrial genes.
four criteria were used for this comparison: the number of recovered species, sequence variability within and between species, resolution to taxonomic levels above that of species, and the degree of mutational saturation.
