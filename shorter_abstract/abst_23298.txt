mirnas regulate multiple genes at the post-transcriptional level and therefore play an important role in many biological processes.
we identified  <dig> novel equine mirnas expressed in seven solid tissues, blood and serum.
we therefore aimed to identify novel equine mirnas for tissue types and breed in serum.
consequently, circulating mirnas are of particular interest and are promising biomarkers for many diseases.
additionally, our approach evidenced that such data supported identification of specific mirnas as markers of functions related to breeds or disease tissues.
the different mirnas profiles, as well as the differences in their expression levels provide a foundation for more hypotheses based on the novel mirnas discovered.
the number of mirnas annotated in the horse genome is much lower compared to model organisms like human and mouse.
a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were identified.
