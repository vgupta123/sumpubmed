one major impediment is the difficulty in large-scale production of cells of interest with reproducibility.
automated robotic cultivation of stem or progenitor cells in clinical trials has not been reported till date.
we observed similar characteristics by both the culture methods in terms of the growth rate, gene expression profile, cell surface profile by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, surface glycan profile, and genomic dna stability.
these results indicate that autocultureÂ® is a feasible method for the cultivation of human cells for regenerative medicine.
cell-based regeneration therapies have great potential for application in new areas in clinical medicine, although some obstacles still remain to be overcome for a wide range of clinical applications.
current protocols of cell therapy require a time-consuming and laborious manual process.
an automated cell-processing machine will play important roles in cell therapy and have widespread use from application in multicenter trials to provision of off-the-shelf cell products.
