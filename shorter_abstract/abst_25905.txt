the information theory approach presented in this paper is able to infer the dependence networks between snps and transcripts, which in turn can identify cis- and trans-eqtls.
the task requires an integrated analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism  data and gene expression data, raising a new computational challenge due to the tremendous size of data.
we use information theory to simultaneously interrogate snp and gene expression data, resulting in a transcriptional information map  which captures the network of transcriptional information that links genetic variations, gene expression and regulatory mechanisms.
the method represents eqtls as information flux between genetic variants and transcripts.
the application of our method to the leukemia study explains how genetic variants and gene expression are linked to leukemia.
