we have previously shown that a mutant allele of the homeodomain transcription factor prospero , presents several developmental defects including abnormal growth and altered taste responses.
the antenno-maxilary complex  forms the chemosensory system of the drosophila larva and is involved in gustatory and olfactory perception.
in order to identify these functions, we used microarray analysis of larval amc and cns tissue isolated from the wild type, and three other previously characterised prospero alleles, including the v <dig> mutant, considered as a null allele for the amc.
additional manual annotation using all the computed information on the attributed role of these genes in the drosophila larvae nervous system, enabled us to identify one functional category of potential prospero target genes known to be involved in neurite outgrowth, synaptic transmission and more specifically in neuronal connectivity remodelling.
to determine those genes affected by loss of pros function, we calculated a discriminating score reflecting the differential expression between v <dig> mutant and other pros alleles.
in addition, many neural tracts connecting the amc to the central nervous system  were affected.
interestingly, egfr and notch pathways were represented in all of these three functional categories.
our earlier reports on larval amc did not argue in favour of a role of pros in cell fate decision, but strongly suggested that pros could be involved in the control of other aspect of neuronal development.
the current data contribute to the clarification of the prospero function in the larval amc and show that pros regulates different function in larvae as compared to those controlled by this gene in embryos.
the second category of genes found to be differentially expressed between the null mutant amc and the other alleles concerned the development of the sensory organs and more particularly the larval olfactory system.
