these are generally directly or indirectly connected to ribosome biosynthesis such as the general secretory pathway, cytoskeleton, cell cycle delay, ribosome synthesis and translation quality control.
network analysis shows a coherent and tight network of genetic interactions among the don and ttc resistance conferring gene products.
many sensitive mutants have a "slow growth" gene expression signature.
genes isolated by systematic genetic array analysis as contributing to toxin resistance function in ribosome quality control, translation fidelity, and in transcription.
to focus the genetic analysis on intracellular consequences of toxin action we eliminated the pdr <dig> gene coding for a potent pleiotropic drug efflux protein potentially confounding results.
don-exposed yeast cells increase transcripts of ribosomal protein and histone genes indicating an internal signal for growth enhancement.
we report a systematic functional investigation of the effect of don and ttc on the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae using genetic array, network and microarray analysis.
we therefore used a knockout library with a pdr5Î” strain background.
mutants in the e <dig> ligase hel <dig>  involved in ribosome quality control, and several members of the rpd <dig> histone deacetylase complex were highly sensitive to don.
our analysis highlights ribosome quality control and a contribution of a histone deacetylase complex as main sources of resistance against don and ttc.
the combination of gene expression profiling and analysis of mutants reveals cellular pathways which become bottlenecks under don and ttc stress.
gene expression profiling points to an increased demand of ribosomal components and does not reveal activation of stress pathways.
the networks exhibited topological properties commonly associated with efficient processing of information.
