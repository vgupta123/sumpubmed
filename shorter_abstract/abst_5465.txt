additionally, primersnp provides a feature for designing common primers that can amplify all the homologous sequences of multiple strains/species of microorganisms.
the increasing number of genomic sequences of bacteria makes it possible to select unique snps of a particular strain/species at the whole genome level and thus design specific primers based on the snps.
primersnp is an online tool to design primers based on strain specific snps for multiple strains/species of microorganisms at the whole genome level.
the allele-specific primers could distinguish query sequences of one strain from other homologous sequences by standard pcr reaction.
experimental validation showed that this software had a successful prediction rate of  <dig>  â€“ 100% for strain specific primer design.
primersnp attempts to identify reliable strain-specific markers, on which specific primers are designed for pathogen detection purpose.
the high similarity of genomic sequences among phylogenetically-related bacteria requires the identification of the few loci in the genome that can serve as unique markers for strain differentiation.
