next generation sequencing provides detailed insight into the variation present within viral populations, introducing the possibility of treatment strategies that are both reactive and predictive.

for insertions and deletions median error rates within the  <dig> data  were significantly higher than those within the illumina data .
segminator ii was developed to allow for the efficient comparison of data sets derived from different sources.
we demonstrate its usage by comparing large data sets from  <dig> influenza h1n <dig> samples sequenced on both the  <dig> life sciences and illumina platforms, permitting quantification of platform error.
we have used this approach to quantify the amount of error present within the  <dig> and illumina platforms in relation to genomic location as well as location on the read.
we have demonstrated, using segminator ii, that it is possible to distinguish platform specific error from biological variation using data derived from two different platforms.
given that next generation data is increasingly important in the analysis of drug-resistance and vaccine trials, this software will be useful to the pathogen research community.
