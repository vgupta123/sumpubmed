surprisingly, we found in the disagv genome a g protein-coupled receptor related to lepidopteran and other insect virus genes and a gp <dig> homolog, which is likely a product of horizontal gene transfer from group  <dig> alphabaculoviruses.
the complete genome sequence of disagv was determined using the 454-pyrosequencing method.
a phylogenetic analysis indicated that disagv is a member of betabaculovirus genus and that it is a sister group to a cluster formed by chocgv, erelgv, piragv isolates, clangv, calgv, cpgv, crlegv, adorgv, phopgv and epapgv.
it had a g + c content of  <dig>  % encoding  <dig> putative open reading frames .
disagv represents a distinct lineage of the genus betabaculovirus.
a group of  <dig> putative genes was not found in any other baculovirus genome sequenced so far.
remarkably, we found a homolog of gp <dig>  which was reported solely in group  <dig> alphabaculovirus genomes so far.
a betabaculovirus  was isolated from diatraea saccharalis , one of the most important insect pests of the sugarcane and other monocot cultures in brazil.
