also, as was shown in silico, ethanol molecule, while binding to the cyp2e <dig> active site, prevents its interaction with hsp <dig>  thus resulting in accumulation of cyp2e <dig> in cell.
posttranslational stabilization of cyp2e <dig> seems to be the main mechanism of its regulation in living cell.
this may be one of the mechanisms of substrate-dependent regulation of the cyp2e <dig> expression in the cell.
it is known that degradation of cyp2el takes part in cytoplasmic proteasome system.
but the processes that involve hsp <dig> in the degradation of cyp2e <dig> and the mechanisms of transfer of microsomal cyp2e <dig> to the proteasome system remain unknown.
cytoplasmic hsp <dig> and membrane-bound cyp2e <dig> may directly interact with each other as partner proteins, leading to the dissociation of the cyp2e <dig> from the membrane.
the efficiency of such degradation depends on the presence of molecular chaperones  as was shown from in vitro experiments.
the twofold increase of both cyp2e <dig> and hsp <dig> in the mouse liver under the constant alcohol administration was shown using wb methods.
the ethanol molecule inhibits the interaction of hsp <dig> with cyp2e <dig> leading to the suppression of its proteasome degradation, thus increasing level of this protein in the cell.
microsomal cyp2e <dig> metabolizes about  <dig> hydrophobic exogens, many of which are environmental pollutants.
