gene ontology analysis placed the mirna-regulated genes  in key biological processes that included cell survival/apoptosis, ecm-cytoskeleton signaling, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding,
we focused on two over-expressed mirnas , and functionally validated seven of their predicted gene targets using rt-qpcr and luciferase assays to confirm mirna-mrna binding.
we used microarrays to analyse and integrate the mrna and microrna  expression profiles of zebrafish retina after optic nerve crush to identify potential regulatory mechanisms that underpin central nerve regeneration.
although many studies have described differences in gene expression in zebrafish during cns regeneration, the regulatory mechanisms underpinning the differential expression of these genes have not been examined.
our results suggest a key role for mir-29b and mir- <dig> in zebrafish regeneration.
we then combined inverse correlations between our mirna expression and mrna expression, and integrated these findings with target predictions from targetscan fish to identify putative mirna-gene target pairs.
the identification of mirna regulation in aÂ zebrafish injury model provides a framework for future studies in which to investigate not only the cellular processes required for cns regeneration, but also how these mechanisms might be regulated to promote successful repair and return of function in the injured mammalian brain.
