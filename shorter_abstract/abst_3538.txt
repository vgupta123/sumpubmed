a novel method for a large-scale preparation of active caspase- <dig> was developed by a strategic engineering to lack auto-activation during expression with amino acid sequences susceptible to thrombin, facilitating high-level expression in e. coli.
however, previous efforts to express the full-length caspase- <dig> gene in e. coli have been unsuccessful.
the engineered precursors were highly expressed as soluble proteins in e. coli and easily purified by affinity chromatography, to levels of 10– <dig> mg from  <dig> l of e. coli culture, and readily activated by thrombin digestion.
caspase- <dig>  a principal apoptotic effector that cleaves the majority of cellular substrates, is an important medicinal target for the treatment of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.
kinetic evaluation disclosed that thrombin digestion enhanced catalytic activity  of the precursor proteins by two orders of magnitude.
the precursor protein was easily purified and activated through specific cleavage at the engineered sites by thrombin, generating active caspase- <dig> in high yields.
large amounts of the protein are required for drug discovery research.
