the survival of embryos through unfavorable periods is a key factor in the persistence of their populations.
classification of proteins according to their known and putative functions revealed the complexity of the eggshell structure.
enzymes with peroxidase, laccase and phenoloxidase activities also were identified, and their likely involvements in cross-linking reactions that stabilize the eggshell structure are discussed.
mosquito eggshells show remarkable diversity in physical properties and structure consistent with adaptations to the wide variety of environments exploited by these insects.
odorant-binding and cysteine-rich proteins that may be structural components of the eggshell were identified.
a total of  <dig> proteins were identified from the combined mass spectrometric analyses of eggshell preparations.
aedes aegypti population density is low during cold and dry seasons and increases immediately after rainfall.
we applied proteomic, transcriptomic, and hybridization in situ techniques to identify gene products and pathways that participate in the assembly of the aedes aegypti eggshell.
