not only as the union of relevant molecules in each of these layers, but as a complex molecular signature containing proteins, mrnas and mirnas, all of which must be directly associated in the results of analyses that are able to capture inter-layers connections and complexity.
the integration of multiple layers of omics can bring more information than analysis of single layers alone.
here, high-throughput screens for mrna, mirna and proteins are jointly analyzed using factor analysis, combined with linear discriminant analysis, to identify the molecular characteristics of cancer.

in particular, the integrated approach gives a more complete picture of the set of mirnas identified and the wnt pathway, which represents an important surrogate marker of melanoma progression.
