the mutation of the cre <dig> locus has specifically occurred in rut c <dig>  some of the genes that are lacking in rut c <dig> could be correlated with pronounced alterations in its phenotype, such as poor growth on Î±-linked oligo- and polyglucosides , or disturbance of osmotic homeostasis.
in the present paper we show that h. jecorina rut c <dig> lacks an  <dig> kb genomic fragment, and consequently misses additional  <dig> genes comprising transcription factors, enzymes of the primary metabolism and transport proteins.
the hypercellulolytic mutant hypocrea jecorina  rut c <dig> is the h. jecorina strain most frequently used for cellulase fermentations and has also often been employed for basic research on cellulase regulation.
our data place a general caveat on the use of h. jecorina rut c <dig> for further basic research.
this strain has been reported to contain a truncated carbon catabolite repressor gene cre <dig> and is consequently carbon catabolite derepressed.
