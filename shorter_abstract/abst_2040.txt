the comprehensive prediction logics that are included in planttfcat are based on relationships between gene families and conserved domains from  <dig> published plant tf/tr/cr families.
an understanding of plant gene regulatory mechanisms at a systems level requires the identification of these regulatory elements on a genomic scale.
planttfcat provides an analysis tool to identify and categorize plant tf/tr/cr genes on a genomic scale.
plants regulate intrinsic gene expression through transcription factors , transcriptional regulators , chromatin regulators , and the basal transcription machinery.
our systematic performance evaluations indicate that planttfcat annotates known tf/tr/cr families with high coverage and sensitivity.
these prediction logics effectively distinguish tf/tr/cr families with common conserved domains.
here, we present planttfcat, a high-performance web-based analysis tool that is designed to identify and categorize plant tf/tr/cr genes from genome-scale protein and nucleic acid sequences by systematically analyzing interproscan domain patterns in protein sequences.
