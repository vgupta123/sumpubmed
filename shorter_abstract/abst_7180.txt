finding epistatic interactions in large association studies like genome-wide association studies  with the nowadays-available large volume of genomic data is a challenging and largely unsolved issue.
few previous studies could handle genome-wide data due to the intractable difficulties met in searching a combinatorial explosive search space and statistically evaluating epistatic interactions given a limited number of samples.
experimental results on both simulated data and real genome-wide data show that knn-mdr has interesting properties in terms of accuracy and power, and that, in many cases, it significantly outperforms its recent competitors.
after describing the approach, a comparison of our method  to a set of the other most performing methods  is carried on to detect interactions using simulated data as well as real genome-wide data.
we propose a novel approach combining k-nearest neighbors  and multi dimensional reduction  methods for detecting gene-gene interactions as a possible alternative to existing algorithms, e especially in situations where the number of involved determinants is high.
