in addition, a universal substrate that can be used to determine the directionality of both 3'→ 5' and 5'→ 3' helicases was developed.
most helicases translocate along one strand of the duplex while displacing the complementary strand .
as a proof of concept, it was shown that the substrates substantially improve helicase activity and directionality determination for several dna helicases in comparison to more traditional substrates.
the method described is simpler that the currently available techniques.
the directionality of helicases with low activity or of those that cannot initiate duplex unwinding from a substrate that contains only one single-stranded overhang region is difficult to determine.
it is shown here that the use of a biotin-streptavidin complex as a helicase substrate improves helicase activity and the determination of helicase directionality.
an improved assay to determine helicase directionality was developed that uses a substrate containing biotinylated oligonucleotides.
