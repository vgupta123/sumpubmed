we present proof of the principle that a mechanistically based model can be fit to observations from a single pcr amplification.
the more elaborate mechanistic models require many more parameters than can be fit from a single amplification, while the empirical models provide little insight and are difficult to tailor to specific reactants.
the efforts have included both fitting empirical sigmoid curves and more elaborate mechanistic models that explore the chemical reactions taking place during each cycle.
we directly estimate the initial amount of amplicon using a simplified mechanistic model based on chemical reactions in the annealing step of the pcr.
by modelling the amount of taqman probe digested and matching that with the observed fluorescence, the conversion factor between the number of fluorescing dye molecules and observed fluorescent emission can be estimated, along with the absolute initial amount of amplicon and the rate parameter for re-annealing.
initial amounts of amplicon are well estimated without using a standard solution.
using the ratio of the predicted initial amounts of amplicon from  <dig> pcrs is shown to work well even when the absolute amounts of amplicon are underestimated in the individual pcrs.
the basic model includes the duplication of dna with the digestion of taqman probe and the re-annealing between previously synthesized dna strands of opposite orientation.
the additional process is helpful in most cases where the initial primer concentration exceeds the initial probe concentration.
the model is applied to several pcr reactions with known amounts of amplicon and is shown to work reasonably well.
