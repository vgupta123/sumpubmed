copy number variations , which are important source for genetic and phenotypic variation, have been shown to be associated with disease as well as important qtls, especially in domesticated animals.
the cnvs covered  <dig> Â mb, which is about  <dig> % of the entire silkworm genome.
this study provided insight into the evolution of the silkworm genome and an invaluable resource for insect genomics research.
furthermore, the silkworm cnvs may play important roles in reproduction, immunity, detoxification and signal recognition.
the genes in cnvs are mainly related to reproduction, immunity, detoxification and signal recognition, which is consistent with the observations in mammals.
using next-generation sequencing as well as quantitative pcr , we identified ~ <dig> cnvs in total and almost half of them  were distributed on uncharacterized chromosome.
in this study, we have constructed the first cnvs map based on genome-wide analysis of cnvs in domesticated silkworm.
an initial cnvs map for silkworm has been described in this study.
