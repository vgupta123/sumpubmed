although classical "housekeeping" genes, such as gapdh, hprt <dig>  and beta-actin have been widely used in the past, their accuracy as reference genes for lung tissues has not been proven.
the accurate normalization of differentially expressed genes in lung cancer is essential for the identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers by real time rt-pcr and microarrays.
further analysis showed that ipo <dig> had a very low mean of |Δct| , with no statistically significant differences between normal and malignant samples and with excellent expression stability.
systematic comparison between candidates led us to the identification of a subset of suitable reference genes for clinical samples: ipo <dig>  actb, polr2a, 18s, and ppia.
gene expression was measured by quantitative real time rt-pcr and expression stability was analyzed with the softwares genorm and normfinder, mean of |Δct|  ± sem, and correlation coefficients among genes.
we thus propose ipo <dig> as a novel reference gene for lung cancer samples.
we have conducted a thorough analysis of a panel of  <dig> candidate reference genes for lung specimens and lung cell lines.
our data show that ipo <dig> is the most accurate reference gene for clinical lung specimens.
in addition, we demonstrate that the commonly used genes gapdh and hprt <dig> are inappropriate to normalize data derived from lung biopsies, although they are suitable as reference genes for lung cell lines.
