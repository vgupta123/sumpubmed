the goals of the research reported here were to establish a baseline analysis of current ctd curation, develop a text-mining prototype from readily available open source components, and evaluate its potential value in augmenting curation efficiency and increasing data coverage.
these terms were used to re-rank documents for curation, resulting in increases in mean average precision , and in the correlation coefficient of rank vs. number of curatable interactions per document .
the comparative toxicogenomics database  is a publicly available resource that promotes understanding about the etiology of environmental diseases.
it provides manually curated chemical-gene/protein interactions and chemical- and gene-disease relationships from the peer-reviewed, published literature.
we performed a baseline assessment of the inter-curator consistency and coverage in ctd, which allowed us to measure the potential of these integrated tools to improve prioritization of journal articles for manual curation.
preliminary results indicated that the prototype found 80% of the gene, chemical, and disease terms appearing in curated interactions.
our study presents a feasible and cost-effective approach for developing a text mining solution to enhance manual curation throughput and efficiency.
prototype text-mining applications were developed and evaluated using a ctd data set consisting of manually curated molecular interactions and relationships from  <dig>  documents.
