in addition, we found close co-localization of the g-csf receptor and its ligand g-csf.
here we have conducted a systematic expression analysis of g-csf receptor and its ligand in the developing embryo.
outside the central nervous system  we found g-csf receptor expression in blood vessels, muscles and their respective precursors and neurons.
the expression of the g-csf receptor in the developing cns was most prominent in radial glia cells.
we also described expression in neurogenic regions of the adult brain, such as the subventricular zone and the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus.
