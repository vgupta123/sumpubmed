cwss induction is coordinated by the vrasr two-component system, which senses an unknown signal triggered by diverse cell wall active agents.
we have constructed a highly sensitive luciferase reporter gene system, using the promoter of sas <dig> , which detects very subtle differences in expression as well as measuring >  <dig> log-fold changes in cwss activity, to compare the concentration dependence of cwss induction kinetics of antibiotics with different cell envelope targets.
induction characteristics, such as the rate of cwss induction once initiated and maximal induction reached, were strongly antibiotic dependent.
we observed a clear correlation between the inhibitory effects of specific antibiotic concentrations on growth and corresponding increases in cwss induction kinetics.
cwss induction profiles were unique for each antibiotic.
differences observed in optimal induction conditions for specific antibiotics should be determined and taken into account when designing and interpreting cwss induction studies.
induction kinetics were both strongly antibiotic- and concentration-dependent.
inactivation of vrar increased susceptibility to the antibiotics tested from 2- to 16-fold, with the exceptions of oxacillin and d-cycloserine, where no differences were detected in the methicillin susceptible s. aureus strain background analysed.
staphylococcus aureus activates a protective cell wall stress stimulon  in response to the inhibition of cell wall synthesis or cell envelope damage caused by several structurally and functionally different antibiotics.
there was no apparent correlation between the induction capacity of the various antibiotics and the relative importance of the cwss for the corresponding resistance phenotypes.
