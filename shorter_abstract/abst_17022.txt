in this study, we evaluated whether aepec strains expressing other intimin sub-types are also invasive using the quantitative gentamicin protection assay.
some aepec strains may invade intestinal cells in vitro with varying efficiencies and independently of the intimin sub-type.
we have recently demonstrated that aepec strain 1551- <dig>  invades hela cells by a process dependent on the expression of intimin sub-type omicron.
in addition, disruption of tight junctions enhanced its invasion efficiency in t <dig> cells, suggesting preferential invasion via a non-differentiated surface.
we also showed that invasion of hela cells by aepec 1551- <dig> depended on actin filaments, but not on microtubules.
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  produce attaching/effacing  lesions on eukaryotic cells mediated by the outer membrane adhesin intimin.
invasiveness was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.
