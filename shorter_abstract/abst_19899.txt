moreover, these methods often cannot cope with irregular and sparse measurements.
it combines different scores to capture fast and transient dynamics as well as slow expression changes, and performs well in the presence of low replicate numbers and irregular sampling times.
the results are given in the form of tables including links to figures showing the expression dynamics of the respective transcript.
the existing methods for detecting significant expression dynamics often fail when the expression dynamics show a large heterogeneity.
an extension of the method allows the analysis of the expression dynamics of functional groups of genes, providing a quick overview of the cellular response.
these allow to quickly recognise the relevance of detection, to identify possible false positives and to discriminate early and late changes in gene expression.
