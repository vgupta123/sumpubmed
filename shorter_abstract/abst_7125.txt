when pooling breast cancer datasets, we observed a synergetic effect on the classification performance in 73% of the cases.
we also observe a significant positive correlation between the number of datasets that is pooled, the validation performance, the number of genes selected, and the enrichment of specific functional categories.
on a higher level, breast cancer datasets collected by different institutions can be considered as resamplings from the underlying breast cancer population.
pooling datasets results in more accurate classification and a convergence of signature genes.
the limited overlap of current signature genes can be attributed to small sample size.
the genes most frequently identified in the separate resamplings were put forward as a 'gold standard'.
six breast cancer datasets, totaling  <dig> samples, all measured on the affymetrix platform, are currently available.
