these inducible nucleosome-depleted regions  and also those constitutively present in the genome overlap precisely with clusters of binding sites for transcription factors  specific for meiosis and for different functional classes of genes, respectively.
our results show that the nucleosomal profile in s. pombe is largely maintained under different physiological conditions and patterns of gene expression.
a detailed description of the nucleosomal organization under different transcriptional programmes is essential to understand their contribution to genomic regulation.
deletion of two tfs affects only a small fraction of all the ndrs to which they bind in vivo, indicating that tfs collectively contribute to ndr maintenance.
to visualize the dynamics of individual nucleosomes under different transcriptional programmes we have generated high-resolution nucleosomal maps in schizosaccharomyces pombe.
nucleosomes facilitate the packaging of the eukaryotic genome and modulate the access of regulators to dna.
