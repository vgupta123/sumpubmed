these cells are thought to be primarily responsible for postnatal muscle growth and injury-induced muscle regeneration.
taken together, these results provide insight into jak/stat signaling in human skeletal muscle development, and confirm recent observations in rodents.
the aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the expression profile of jak/stat family members, using cultured primary human skeletal muscle cells.
a population of satellite cells exists in skeletal muscle.
in rodent skeletal muscle, stat <dig> is essential for satellite cell migration and myogenic differentiation, regulating the expression of myogenic factors.
we demonstrate the phosphorylation of jak <dig> and stat <dig> only during myoblast proliferation, while jak <dig> and stat <dig> phosphorylation increases during differentiation.
during these developmental stages, members of the jak/stat family were examined, along with factors known to regulate myogenesis.
