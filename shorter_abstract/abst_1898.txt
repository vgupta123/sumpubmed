furthermore, the achieved performance is highly competitive in comparison to optimized xeon phi and gpu implementations.
it also exhibits good scalability in terms of sequence length and size, and number of compute nodes for both database scanning and multiple sequence alignment.
our approach uses a three-level parallelization scheme to take full advantage of the compute power available on this type of architecture; i.e.
this paper presents new approaches to high performance biological sequence database scanning with the smith-waterman algorithm and the first stage of progressive multiple sequence alignment based on the clustalw heuristic on a xeon phi-based compute cluster.

furthermore, we re-organize the sequence datasets and use xeon phi shuffle operations to improve i/o efficiency.
evaluations show that our method achieves a peak overall performance up to  <dig> gcups for scanning real protein sequence databanks on a single node consisting of two intel e5- <dig> cpus and two intel xeon phi 7110p cards.
