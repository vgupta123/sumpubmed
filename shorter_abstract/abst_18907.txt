all blactx-m- <dig> positive isolates also contained the isecp <dig> insertion element.
our results highlight the dissemination of multidrug resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates in antananarivo.
forty-nine e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca and e. cloacae esbl-producing isolates were studied.
these findings underline the need for a rational use of antibiotic and for appropriate methods of screening esbl in routine laboratories in antananarivo.
in antimicrobial susceptibility analyses, many of the isolates exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
we investigated the molecular characteristics of multidrug-resistant, extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase -producing enterobacteriaceae isolated in community settings and in hospitals in antananarivo, madagascar.
phylogenetic grouping and virulence genotyping of the e. coli isolates revealed that most of them belonged to group a <dig>  one isolate assigned to group b <dig> harbored blactx-m- <dig> and five virulence genes  and was related to the o25b-st <dig> clone.
