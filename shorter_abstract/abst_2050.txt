in the search for novel promoter sequences in the human bcl2l <dig> locus, we have identified previously unrecognized genomic sequences displaying promoter activity and e2f responsiveness, and driving the expression of bcl2l <dig> coding transcripts.
in hek <dig> cells, this novel candidate promoter originates bcl2l <dig> transcripts whose expression can be modulated by a known modulator of bcl2l <dig> expression  and by e2f, a characterized transcriptional regulator of bcl2l <dig> expression.
