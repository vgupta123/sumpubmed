the data provide clues for tissue-specific and species-specific properties of human on that will help in design of therapeutic models.
an un-normalized cdna library was constructed from pooled human on tissues and was used in expressed sequence tag  analysis.
we conclude that the new cdna library is a faithful representation of human on and est data provide an initial overview of gene expression patterns in this tissue.
the optic nerve is a pure white matter central nervous system  tract with an isolated blood supply, and is widely used in physiological studies of white matter response to various insults.
our analyses revealed a profile similar in many respects to other white matter related tissues, but significantly different from previously available on cdna libraries.
we examined the gene expression profile of human optic nerve  and, through the neibank online resource, to provide a resource of sequenced verified cdna clones.
immune/inflammatory markers were abundant in the new on library.
several known eye disease genes are abundantly expressed in on.
