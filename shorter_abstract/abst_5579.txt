the ed group showed relatively fewer severe dna methylation abnormalities  but more abnormal histone h <dig> acetylations  and more abnormal expression  of the selected genes compared to the ld group.
deaths of clones may be ascribed to abnormal expression of a very limited number of genes.
to assess the extent of abnormal epigenetic modifications and gene expression in clones, we simultaneously examined dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and expression of six genes  and a repetitive sequence  in five organs  from two cloned cattle groups that had died at different stages.
aberrant reprogramming of donor somatic cell nuclei may result in many severe problems in animal cloning.
the cattle in the ld group  died after the perinatal period.
in the ed group , the cloned cattle died in the perinatal period.
aberrant dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression were observed in both cloned groups.
however, our data also suggest no widespread gene expression abnormalities in the organs of the dead clones.
