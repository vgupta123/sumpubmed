unspecific amplification was observed with neither lsdv-negative samples  nor nucleic acid preparations from orf virus, bovine papular stomatitis virus, cowpoxvirus, peste des petits ruminants and blue tongue virus .
the clinical sensitivity of the lsdv rpa assay matched  <dig> %  to real-time pcr results.
the lsdv rpa assay was performed at  <dig> Â°c and detected down to  <dig> dna copies/reaction in a maximum of  <dig> min.
in addition, the lsdv rpa assay detected sheep and goat poxviruses.
the lsdv rpa assay is a rapid and sensitive test that could be implemented in field or at quarantine stations for the identification of lsdv infected case.
laboratory diagnostics including virus isolation, sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction  are performed at well-equipped laboratories.
