accordingly, in the current study we have examined the contribution of mirna in the developing rat telencephalon and mesencephalon from just after neural tube closure till birth using a genome-wide microarray strategy.
micrornas  play a pivotal role in coordinating messenger rna  transcription and stability in almost all known biological processes, including the development of the central nervous system.
we identified temporally distinct expression patterns in both the telencephalon and mesencephalon for both mirnas and their target genes.
despite our broad understanding of their involvement, we still have a very sparse understanding of specifically how mirna contribute to the strict regional and temporal regulation of brain development.
