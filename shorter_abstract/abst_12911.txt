we also utilized the anti-selection gene hsv-tk, which results in cell death in strains grown on the drug 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine .
fission yeast is one of the most commonly used model organisms for studying genetics.
the plasmid constructs and techniques described here are invaluable tools for sequential gene targeting and will simplify construction of fission yeast strains required for study.
the newly created selection cassettes did not recombine with the tef-containing mx <dig> cassettes already present in the genome, allowing for sequential gene targeting using the pcr-based method.
finally, utilizing the negative selectable markers, we showed efficient induction of point mutations in an endogenous gene by a two-step transformation method.
however, the currently available cassettes all share the same tef promoter and terminator sequences.
we achieved this by swapping the tef promoter and terminator sequences in the established antibiotic resistance mx <dig> cassette series for alternative promoters and/or terminators.
however, a number of dna replication checkpoint and homologous recombination mutants, including rad3∆, cds1∆, rad54∆ and rad55∆, exhibited sensitivity to fdu even though those strains did not carry the hsv-tk gene.
here we have generated new selection cassettes that do not recombine with those traditionally used.
to remove counter-selectable markers, we introduced the cre-loxp irreversible recombination method.
