increasing age, several co-morbidities, environmental contamination, antibiotic exposure and other intestinal perturbations appear to be the greatest risk factors for c. difficile infection .
the main objective of this study was to evaluate and follow the prevalence of c. difficile in  <dig> elderly care home residents weekly during a 4-month period.
a c. difficile microbiological detection scheme was performed along with an overall microbial biodiversity study of the faeces content by 16s rrna gene analysis.
seven out of  <dig>  residents were  positive for c. difficile.
c. difficile was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> diarrhoeal samples .
the most common pcr-ribotype identified was  <dig>  mlva showed that there was a clonal dissemination of c. difficile strains within the nursing home residents.
significant changes were observed in c. difficile positive individuals in the relative abundance of a few bacterial populations, including lachnospiraceae and verrucomicrobiaceae.
a high c. difficile colonisation in nursing home residents was found, with a predominance of the hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig>  positive c. difficile status is not associated with microbiota richness or biodiversity reduction in this study.
the link between akkermansia, gut inflammation and c. difficile colonisation merits further investigations.

therefore, elderly care home residents are considered particularly vulnerable to the infection.
a decrease of akkermansia in positive subjects to the bacterium was repeatedly found.
