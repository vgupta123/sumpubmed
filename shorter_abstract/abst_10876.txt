orphan nuclear receptor estrogen related receptor β  is well known in stem cells and early embryonic development.
gene ontology analyses showed altered genes are related to transcription and translation regulation, cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation, and cellular metabolism.
our results characterized mrna profiles in du <dig> prostate cancer cells driven by esrrb expression and esrrb ligand dy <dig>  and provided multiple markers to characterize esrrb’s function in esrrb research.
we investigated the mrna profile alterations induced by esrrb expression and its synthetic ligand dy <dig> in human prostate cancer du <dig> cells via rna-seq analysis.
