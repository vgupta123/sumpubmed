ppars are important transcription factors regulating multiple functions including fat metabolism and immune responses.
to avoid negative impact of obesity, food additives that stimulate fat metabolism and immune function are of high interest.
the expression patterns revealed that a large proportion of genes regulated by tta were related to lipid metabolism and increased mitochondrial β-oxidation.
the immune stimulatory effect of tta in macrophages involves increased lipid metabolism and suppressed inflammatory status.
thus, suggesting that tta directs the macrophage-like cells towards alternative, anti-inflammatory, activation.
tta, tetradecylthioacetic acid, is a synthetic fatty acid that stimulates mitochondrial β-oxidation most likely by activation of peroxysome proliferator-activated receptors .
this, together with the results from qrt-pcr showing an increased transcription of anti-inflammatory il <dig> by tta, indicates anti-inflammatory effects.
atlantic salmon experiments have shown that tta supplemented diets significantly reduce mortality during natural outbreaks of viral diseases, suggesting a modulatory role of the immune system.
to gain new insights into tta effects on the atlantic salmon immune system, a factorial, high-throughput microarray experiment was conducted using a 44k oligo nucleotide salmon microarray siq <dig>  and the atlantic salmon macrophage-like cell line ask.
