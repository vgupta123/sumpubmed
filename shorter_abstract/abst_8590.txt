our results illustrate that sniper can be used to increase call rates on the 10k genechipÂ® without sacrificing accuracy, thereby increasing the amount of valid data generated.
the affymetrix algorithm was trained on a database of ethnically diverse dna samples to create snp call zones that are used as static models to make genotype calls for experimental data.
these snps represent on average  <dig> % of the total snps on each chromosome with chromosome  <dig>  the most gene-rich chromosome, containing the highest proportion of poor performers .
we describe here the implementation of clustering algorithms on large training datasets resulting in improved snp call rates on the 10k genechip.
the correct calling of poor performing snps may prove to be key in future linkage studies performed on the 10k genechip.
