in this report, we aimed to evaluate in vivo multiplex imaging of mouse embryonic stem  cells labeled with qtracker delivered quantum dots .
in summary, this is the first demonstration of in vivo multiplex imaging of mouse es cells labeled qds.
these results provide a promising tool for imaging stem cell therapy non-invasively in vivo.
upon further improvements, qds will have a greater potential for tracking stem cells within deep tissues.
murine embryonic stem  cells were labeled with six different qds using qtracker.
afterward, labeled es cells were injected subcutaneously onto the backs of athymic nude mice.
es cell viability, proliferation, and differentiation were not adversely affected by qds compared with non-labeled control cells .
these labeled es cells could be imaged with good contrast with one single excitation wavelength.
with the same excitation wavelength, the signal intensity, defined as /exposure time in millisecond was  <dig> ±  <dig> for cells labeled with qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> for qd  <dig>  finally, we have shown that qd  <dig> offers greater fluorescent intensity than the other qds tested.
semiconductor quantum dots  hold increasing potential for cellular imaging both in vitro and in vivo.
