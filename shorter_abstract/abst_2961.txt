the results showed that a total of  <dig> genes involved in various functions and physiological pathways were activated.
insect cuticle plays essential roles in many physiological functions.
data from the present study provide, for the first time, a comprehensive expression profile of genes in silkworm epidermal tissues and evidence that putative elements exist to allow massive production of mrnas from specific cuticular protein genes.
the vast majority  of cuticular protein genes were expressed in selected stages with varying expression patterns.
there was no correlation between expression patterns and the presence of conserved motifs.
the  <dig> kb upstream regions of these genes were further analyzed and three putative elements were identified.
twenty-six rr genes distributed in chromosome  <dig> were co-expressed at the larval and wandering stages.
in an effort to determine their expression profiles, a microarray-based investigation was carried out using mrna collected from larvae to pupae.
