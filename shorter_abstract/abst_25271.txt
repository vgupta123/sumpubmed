sequencing quality assessment on various criteria is important at the stage preceding clustering and contig assembly.
preassemble is a tool allowing to perform quality assessment of sequences generated by automatic sequencing equipment.
depending on the size of a sequencing project the number of trace files can vary from just a few to thousands of files.
consequently preassemble can be used as efficiently for just several trace files as for large scale sequence processing.
the staden package pregap <dig> module and base-calling program phred are utilized in the pipeline, which produces detailed and self-explanatory output that can be displayed with a web browser.
preassemble is flexible since both interactive jobs on the preassemble server and the stand alone downloadable version are available.
