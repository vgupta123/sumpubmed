by combining pharmdb, an integrated tripartite database, with shared neighborhood scoring  algorithm, we developed a knowledge platform to rationally identify new indications for known fda approved drugs, which can be customized to specific projects using manual curation.
the data in pharmdb is open access and can be easily explored with phexplorer and accessed via biomart web service .

the process of drug discovery and development is time-consuming and costly, and the probability of success is low.
and to facilitate exploration of tripartite  network, we developed a graphical data visualization software program called phexplorer, which allows us to browse pharmdb data in an interactive and dynamic manner.
