intravenous injection of monoclonal antibodies against cd <dig>  icam- <dig> and cd11a also blocked tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation.
the potency of tm-n <dig> in induction of skin edema appeared similar potency of bradykinin and histamine.
tm-n <dig> is a potent stimulus for skin edema, mast cell activation and accumulation.
it has been recognized that phospholipase a <dig>  is a crucial component of snake venom, which contributes greatly to snake venom induced inflammation in man.
the results showed that tm-n <dig> provoked a dose dependent increase in microvascular leakage in the skin of rats.
ginkgolide b and cyproheptadine, but not terfenadine and quinacrine, inhibited tm-n <dig> elicited microvascular leakage when they were co-injected with the stimulus to rat skin.
pretreatment of rats with compound 48/ <dig> diminished tm-n <dig> induced skin reaction and reduced mast cell numbers in rats.
tm-n <dig> induced mast cell accumulation in the peritoneum of mice, which was inhibited by co-injection of ginkgolide b, cyproheptadine and terfenadine.
moreover, tm-n <dig> was found to induce histamine release from human colon, lung and tonsil mast cells, and both metabolic inhibitors and pertussis toxin were capable of inhibiting tm-n <dig> elicited histamine release.
