the advent of gene therapy has generated excitement in the medical world for the possible application of gene therapy in the treatment of diabetes.
the glucagon-like peptide- <dig>  promoter, which is recognised by gut l-cells, is an appealing candidate for gene therapy purposes.
in conclusion, glp- <dig> promoter and l-cell could be potential candidates for diabetes gene therapy agents.
in this study, l-cells were isolated from a primary intestinal cell line to create suitable target cells for insulin expression studies.
our data showed that l-cells efficiently produced the mature insulin protein.
the secretion tests revealed that an increase in glucose concentration from  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm induced insulin gene expression in the l-cells by  <dig> -fold.
next, the isolated l-cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid consisting of an insulin gene located downstream of the glp- <dig> promoter.
diabetes mellitus is a complicated disease with a pathophysiology that includes hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and other metabolic impairments leading to many clinical complications.
furthermore, l-cells quickly responded to the glucose stimulation; the amount of insulin protein increased 2-fold in the first  <dig> minutes and then reached a plateau after  <dig> minutes.
in addition, the insulin protein secretion was positively regulated with glucose induction.
