finally, we combine the existing evidence to propose a model for the formation of ctcf loops in which partner sites are brought together by chromatin template reeling through stationary rna polymerases, consistent with the transcription factory hypothesis.
to facilitate cell type-specific ctcf loop identification, we develop an algorithm to predict ctcf loops from chip-seq data alone by exploiting the ctcf motif directionality in loop anchors.
we use ctcf chia-pet data from the encode project to show that ctcf-associated chromatin loops have a tendency to enclose regions of enhancer-regulated stimulus responsive genes, insulating them from neighboring regions of constitutively expressed housekeeping genes.
we apply this algorithm to a hundred encode cell line datasets, confirming the universality of our observations as well as identifying a general distinction between primary and immortal cells in loop-enclosed gene content.
