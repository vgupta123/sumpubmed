we here identify intrinsic distinctions between genomic features, and argue that the distinctions imply that a certain variation in the representation of features as genomic tracks is warranted.
four core informational properties of tracks are discussed: gaps, lengths, values and interconnections.
we also find, in contrast to the xml formats, that none of the existing tabular formats are conveniently extendable to support all track types.
from this we delineate fifteen generic track types.
based on the track type distinctions, we characterize major existing representational formats and find that the track types are not adequately supported by any single format.
the defined track types are shown to capture relevant distinctions between genomic annotation tracks, resulting in varying representational needs and analysis possibilities.
we thus propose two unified formats for track data, an improved xml format, bioxsd  <dig> , and a new tabular format, gtrack  <dig> .
