chloroplast sequences were analyzed and annotated for all the three species.
however, the domestication of tk is complicated by its colocation with two weedy dandelion species, taraxacum brevicorniculatum  and the common dandelion .
to discriminate these species at the molecular level, and facilitate gene flow studies between the potential rubber crop, tk, and its weedy relatives, we generated genomic and marker resources for these three dandelion species.
the availability of chloroplast genomes of these three dandelion species, as well as chloroplast and nuclear molecular markers, will provide a powerful genetic resource for germplasm differentiation and purification, and the study of potential gene flow among taraxacum species.
complete chloroplast genome sequences of tk , to , and tb  were obtained using the illumina gaii and miseq platforms.
by sequencing multiple genotypes for each species and testing variants using gel-based methods, four chloroplast single nucleotide polymorphism  variants were found to be fixed between tk and to in large populations, and between tb and to.
rubber dandelion  is being developed as a domestic source of natural rubber to meet increasing global demand.
phylogenetic analysis within asteraceae showed that tk has a closer genetic distance to tb than to to and taraxacum species were most closely related to lettuce .
