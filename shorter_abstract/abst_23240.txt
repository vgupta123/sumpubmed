although the e. coli pol iii php domain has lost metal-coordinating residues, the structure of the domain has been conserved to a remarkable degree when compared to that of metal-binding php domains.
the php domains of some bacterial replicases are active metal-dependent nucleases that may play a role in proofreading.
in e. coli dna polymerase iii, however, the php domain has lost several metal-coordinating residues and is likely to be catalytically inactive.
genomic searches show that the loss of metal-coordinating residues in polymerase php domains is likely to have coevolved with the presence of a separate proofreading exonuclease that works with the polymerase.
we also show that pol iii, a large multi-domain protein, unfolds cooperatively and that mutations in the degenerate metal-binding site of the php domain decrease the overall stability of pol iii and reduce its activity.
while the presence of a php domain in replicative bacterial polymerases is strictly conserved, its ability to coordinate metals and to perform proofreading exonuclease activity is not, suggesting additional non-enzymatic roles for the domain.
our results show that the php domain is a major structural element in pol iii and its integrity modulates both the stability and activity of the polymerase.

this is demonstrated by our ability to restore metal binding with only three point mutations, as confirmed by the metal-bound crystal structure of this mutant determined at  <dig>  Ã… resolution.
