although the etiology of pd remains unclear, increasing evidence has shown that oxidative stress plays an important role in its pathogenesis and that of other neurodegenerative disorders.
mpp+ significantly decreased mtt levels in a concentration-dependent manner.
nox <dig>  a cytochrome subunit of nox, transports electrons across the plasma membrane to generate ros, leading to physiological and pathological processes.
mpp+ treatment up-regulated both nox <dig>  and ho- <dig>  mrna levels.
co-treatment with hemin or atx significantly up-regulated ho- <dig> expression and decreased nox <dig> expression with considerable fluorescence intensity .
pretreatment with atx , caused intracellular ros production in the mpp+ group to decrease by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.
astaxanthin , a carotenoid with antioxidant properties, is 100â€“ <dig> times more effective than vitamin e. the present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of atx on mpp+-induced oxidative stress in pc <dig> cells.
heme oxygenase- <dig>  can be rapidly induced by oxidative stress and other noxious stimuli in the brain or other tissues.
mpp+ increased nox <dig> and ho- <dig> expression with considerable fluorescence extending out from the perinuclear region toward the periphery; this was attenuated by dpi.
atx suppresses mpp+-induced oxidative stress in pc <dig> cells via the ho-1/nox <dig> axis.
