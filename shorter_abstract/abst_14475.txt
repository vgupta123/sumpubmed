in addition, complete extrusion of internalized cn cells can lead to the formation of a massive vacuole which may be a sign of damage to the host macrophage.
c. neoformans can escape the intracellular confines of macrophages in an actin dependent manner by cell-to-cell transfer of the yeast leading to infection of adjacent cells.
these observations document new outcomes for the interaction of c. neoformans with host cells that provide precedents for cell biological effects that may contribute to the pathogenesis of cryptococcal infections.
the interaction between macrophages and cryptococcus neoformans  is critical for containing dissemination of this pathogenic yeast.
live imaging of cryptococcus neoformans interactions with murine macrophages revealed cell-to-cell spread of yeast cells from infected donor cells to uninfected cells.
both events result in live extracellular yeasts capable of reproducing and disseminating in the extracellular milieu.
although this phenomenon was relatively rare its occurrence documents a new capacity for this pathogen to infect adjacent cells without exiting the intracellular space.
in addition, we noted that cryptococcal phagosomal extrusion was followed by the formation of massive vacuoles suggesting that intracellular residence is accompanied by long lasting damage to host cells.
