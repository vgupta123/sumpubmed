the results of the present study suggest that language deprivation in early childhood alters the cerebral organization of syntactic language processing mechanisms for l <dig>  semantic language processing instead was unaffected.
after syntactic violations, native german speakers and native signers of german sign language  with german as second language  showed a left anterior negativity  followed by a p <dig>  whereas no lan but a negativity over the right hemisphere instead was found in deaf participants with a delayed onset of first language  acquisition.
to examine which language function depends on early experience, the present study compared deaf native signers, deaf non-native signers and hearing german native speakers while processing german sentences.
the results showed a similar erp pattern after semantic violations  in all three groups.
the p <dig> of this group had a smaller amplitude and a different scalp distribution as compared to german native speakers.
