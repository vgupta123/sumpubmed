our results demonstrated that there are several adequate ofp genes available for plant transformation, including the new pporrfp, an unaltered tetramer from the hard coral porites porites.
congruent results were observed between transient and stable assays.
each of these, as well as endoplasmic reticulum -targeted versions, were stably expressed in transgenic nicotiana tabacum and arabidopsis thaliana.

from our empirical data, and a search of the literature, it appears that tdtomato-er and morange-er are the two highest fluorescing fps available as reporters for transgenic plants.
the ofps dsred <dig>  tdtomato, morange and pporrfp were all expressed under the control of the camv 35s promoter in agroinfiltration-mediated transient assays in nicotiana benthamiana.
