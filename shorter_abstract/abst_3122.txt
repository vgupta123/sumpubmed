our findings reveal striking structural and functional similarities among proteins encoded by mitochondrial orfans in freshwater mussels, and strongly support a role for these genes in the dui mechanism.
despite a rapid rate of evolution, strong structural and functional similarities were found for m-orf proteins compared among species, and among the f-orf and h-orf proteins across the studied species.
however, the large evolutionary distance among these taxa prevented a meaningful comparison of orfan properties among these divergent lineages.
unionoid species typically have separate sexes, but hermaphroditism also occurs, and hermaphroditic species lack the m-type mtdna and possess a highly mutated version of the f-orf in their maternally transmitted mtdna .

under this system, species have two distinct, sex-linked mitochondrial genomes: the m-type mtdna, which is transmitted by males to male offspring and found in spermatozoa, and the f-type mtdna, which is transmitted by females to all offspring, and found in all tissues of females and in somatic tissues of males.
our results also support either a viral or a mitochondrial origin for the orfans.
dui orfan proteins have previously been characterized in silico in a taxonomically broad array of bivalves including four mytiloid, one veneroid and one unionoid species.
many species of bivalves exhibit a unique system of mtdna transmission named doubly uniparental inheritance .
in silico analyses suggest that m-orfs have a role in transport and cellular processes such as signalling, cell cycle and division, and cytoskeleton organisation, and that f-orfs may be involved in cellular traffic and transport, and in immune response.
