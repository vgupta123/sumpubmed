we found that compared to that of wild type grown to stationary phase, the toxr expression was lower in an aphb mutant strain.
extensive studies reveal that complicated regulatory cascades regulate expression of virulence genes, the products of which are required for v. cholerae to colonize and cause disease.
when expressed constitutively, aphb is able to activate the toxr promoter.
furthermore, gel shift analysis indicates that aphb binds toxr promoter region directly.
our data indicate that v. cholerae possesses an additional regulatory loop that use aphb to activate the expression of two virulence regulators, toxr and tcpp, which together control the expression of the master virulence regulator toxt.
