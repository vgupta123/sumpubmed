nov.. phylogenetic analysis places pentecopterus at the base of the megalograptidae, united with the two genera previously assigned to this family by the shared possession of two or more pairs of spines per podomere on prosomal appendage iv, a reduction of all spines except the pair on the penultimate podomere of appendage v, and an ornamentation of guttalate scales, including angular scales along the posterior margin of the dorsal tergites and in longitudinal rows along the tergites.
eurypterids either underwent an explosive radiation soon after their origination, or earlier representatives, perhaps cambrian in age, remain to be discovered.
the new eurypterid species is described as pentecopterus decorahensis gen. et sp.
the morphology of pentecopterus reveals that the megalograptidae are representatives of the derived carcinosomatoid clade and not basal eurypterids as previously interpreted.
the relatively derived position of megalograptids within the eurypterids indicates that most eurypterid clades were present by the middle ordovician.
the available instars of pentecopterus decorahensis suggest that eurypterids underwent extreme appendage differentiation during development, a potentially unique condition among chelicerates.
the middle ordovician  fauna of the winneshiek lagerst√§tte includes a new eurypterid species represented by more than  <dig> specimens, including some juveniles, preserved as carbonaceous cuticular remains.
