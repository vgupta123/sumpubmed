leaf senescence is an important developmental programmed degeneration process that dramatically affects crop quality and yield.
of  <dig>  genes detected by mapping the tags to gossypium genomes,  <dig>  genes were identified as differentially expressed during leaf senescence.
these data are the most comprehensive dataset currently available for cotton leaf senescence, and will serve as a useful resource for unraveling the functions of many specific genes involved in cotton leaf development and senescence.

here, the senescence process in cotton  leaves was investigated over a time course including young leaf, mature leaf and leaf samples from different senescence stages using rna-seq.
in addition,  <dig> genes involved in the metabolism and regulation of eight hormones were identified, of which many genes involved in the abscisic acid, brassinosteroid, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and ethylene pathways were upregulated, indicating that these hormone-related genes might play crucial roles in cotton leaf development and senescence.
quantitative real-time pcr was used to evaluate the results of rna-seq for gene expression profiles.
however, most auxin, cytokinin and gibberellin pathway-related genes were downregulated, suggesting that these three hormones may act as negative regulators of senescence.
most of the genes related to photosynthesis, chlorophyll metabolism and carbon fixation were downregulated; whereas those for plant hormone signal transduction were upregulated.
this is the first high-resolution, multiple time-course, genome-wide comprehensive analysis of gene expression in cotton.
