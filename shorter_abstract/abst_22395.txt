we have found that the activation kinetics of p38α sapk in response to these insults is different and also leads to a complex gene pattern response specific for a given stress with a restricted set of overlapping genes.
here, we report a whole genome expression analyses on mouse embryonic fibroblasts  treated with three different p <dig> sapk activating-stimuli, namely osmostress, the cytokine tnfα and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin.
cells have the ability to respond and adapt to environmental changes through activation of stress-activated protein kinases .
although p <dig> sapk signalling is known to participate in the regulation of gene expression little is known on the molecular mechanisms used by this sapk to regulate stress-responsive genes and the overall set of genes regulated by p <dig> in response to different stimuli.
thus, activation of p <dig> sapk is critical to elicit the early gene expression program required for cell adaptation to stress.
our genome-wide transcriptional analyses shows a selective response to specific stimuli and a restricted common response of up to 20% of the stress up-regulated early genes that involves an important set of transcription factors, which might be critical for either cell adaptation or preparation for continuous extra-cellular changes.
