both molecular evolution and population genetics support the hypothesis that conservation of mirna binding sites is maintained by purifying selection through elimination of deleterious alleles.
nucleotide mutations play a major role in the gain/loss of mirna binding sites during evolution.
most  of the gains/losses were due to nucleotide mutation.
these possibilities were distinguished by separating mirnas conserved in both dicots and monocot plants from rice-specific mirnas and by phylogenetic analysis of mirna target gene families.
micrornas  posttranscriptionally down-regulate gene expression by binding target mrnas.
of the  <dig>  pairs of duplicate genes from the wgd,  <dig> genes  were computationally predicted to be mirna targets.
this could be due to either gain of a mirna binding site after the wgd or because one of the duplicated genes has escaped from being a mirna target after the wgd .
to understand this process in plants a comparative analysis of mirna-targeted duplicated gene pairs derived from a well-documented whole genome duplication  event in combination with a population genetics study of six experimentally validated mirna binding sites in rice  was carried out.
of the  <dig> duplicated gene pairs,  <dig> have only one paralog been targeted by a mirna.
