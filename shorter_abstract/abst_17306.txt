super-resolution fluorescence microscopy performed via 3d structured illumination microscopy  is well established on flat, adherent cells.

scanning whole mount mammalian embryos with 3d-sim is prone to failure due to the movement during scanning and the large distance to the cover glass.
however, blastomeres of mammalian embryos are non-adherent, round and large.
here we present a highly detailed protocol that allows performing 3d-sim on blastomeres of mammalian embryos with an image quality comparable to scans in adherent cells.
to our knowledge, this protocol presents for the first time a highly detailed and practical way to perform 3d-sim on mammalian embryos and spermatozoa.
this protocol was successfully tested on mouse, rabbit and cattle embryos and on rabbit spermatozoa.
