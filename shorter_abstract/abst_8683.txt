this might be mediated by diverse gtpase activity, since the isoform differences predominate near the predicted gtp-binding site.
phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> psbo sequences from  <dig> land plant species revealed that psbo duplication occurred many times independently, generally at the roots of modern angiosperm families.
our analysis of psbo sequences showed that many angiosperm species express two psbo paralogs, but the pairs of isoforms in one species were not orthologous to pairs of isoforms in distant species.
comparison of these differences with the location of differences between psbos from diverse angiosperm families indicated various selection pressures in psbo evolution and potential interaction surfaces on the psbo structure.
in spite of this, the level of isoform divergence was similar in different species.
it plays a crucial role in the stabilisation of the water-splitting mn4cao <dig> cluster, which catalyses the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen by using light energy.
the analyses suggest that similar subfunctionalisation of psbo isoforms occurred parallelly in various lineages.
we speculate that the presence of two psbo isoforms helps the plants to finely adjust the photosynthetic apparatus in response to variable conditions.
moreover, mapping of the differences on the protein tertiary structure showed that the isoforms in individual species differ from each other on similar positions, mostly on the luminally exposed end of the Î²-barrel structure.
psbo, the manganese-stabilising protein, is an indispensable extrinsic subunit of photosystem ii.
