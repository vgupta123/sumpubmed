the results also indicate that redundancy is a minor aspect of the srf family.
the results provide evidence that srf <dig> is a positive regulator of leaf size.
sequence comparisons show overall conservation but also divergence in predicted functional domains among srf proteins.
in general, functional analysis of gene family members by reverse genetics is often obscured by several issues, such as redundancy, subtle or difficult to detect phenotypes in mutants, or by decision problems regarding suitable biological and biochemical assays.
they also indicate that complementing reverse genetics with bioinformatical data mining of genome-wide expression data aids in inferring hypotheses on possible functions for members of a gene family.
ectopic expression of several srf genes, using the 35s promoter, resulted in male sterility.
the bioinformatic analyses raise the possibility that some srf genes affect different aspects of cell wall biology.
in addition, they suggest that the srf family is characterised by functional diversity and that some srf genes may function in cell wall biology.
furthermore, srf <dig> is characterised by a high degree of polymorphism between the ler and col accessions.
we performed global expression profiling, coexpression analysis, and an analysis of the enrichment of gene ontology terms among coexpressed genes.
receptor-like kinases are a prominent class of surface receptors that regulate many aspects of the plant life cycle.
as a result, srf <dig> is predicted to exist in a standard receptor configuration and in a membrane-anchored receptor-like version that lacks most of the intracellular domain.
