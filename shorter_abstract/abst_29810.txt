moreover, an increase of immunoregulatory compounds were observed in the co-culture through the expression of cd11b+cd86+ activation markers on apcs, as well as the frequency of treg cells expressing cd4+cd3+ and cd4+cd25hi.
heat shock proteins  are stress-induced proteins with immunoregulatory properties.
the change of a th <dig> phenotype into a pattern of regulatory t cells  is extremely important in controlling autoimmune diseases.

the non-obese diabetic nod mouse develops insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus spontaneously as a consequence of an autoimmune process in the presence of pathogenic cd4+ t cells that typically exhibit th <dig> cell phenotypes.
in the current study, the capacity of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> mycobacterial hsps and a constructed dna encoded hsp <dig>  to transform the pattern of the immune response from th <dig> into treg cells has been studied in vitro using co-cultures of antigen presenting cells  and t cells in nod mice.
the valuable role of immunotherapy in treating autoimmune diseases is increasingly recognized by those involved in the research and clinical application of new biopharmaceuticals products.
cells harvested from nod mice and cultured for 48 h  presented with th1/th <dig> patterns and secretions of il- <dig>  ifn-γ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokines.
the in vitro observation of th <dig> cells differentiating into tregs in nod mice could raise the hypothesis that the immune regulatory activity of hsps could be an efficient strategy for diabetes prevention and treatment.
an up-regulation was observed in the supernatants from the co-cultures of nod cells that were stimulated with dnahsp <dig>  hsp <dig> or hsp <dig> through increased levels of il- <dig> secretion and the suppression of il- <dig>  ifn-γ and il- <dig> production.
