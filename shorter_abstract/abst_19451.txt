these findings underscore the diversity of gut microbiota across geographic regions, and suggest that strategic modulation of gut microbiota composition could decrease the risk of p. falciparum infection in malaria-endemic areas, potentially as an adjunct to partially effective malaria vaccines.
age-adjusted cox regression analysis revealed a significant association between microbiota composition and the prospective risk of p. falciparum infection; however, no relationship was observed between microbiota composition and the risk of developing febrile malaria once p. falciparum infection was established.
we assayed these samples using massively parallel sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna gene to identify the composition of the gut bacterial communities in these individuals.
here we collected stool samples from a cohort composed of  <dig> malian children and adults just prior to an intense p. falciparum transmission season.
consistent with prior studies, stool microbial diversity in the present cohort increased with age, although the overall microbiota profile was distinct from cohorts in other regions of africa, asia and north america.
during the ensuing 6-month p. falciparum transmission season we examined the relationship between the stool microbiota composition of individuals in this cohort and their prospective risk of both p. falciparum infection and febrile malaria.
in humans it is unknown if the composition of the gut microbiota alters the risk of plasmodium falciparum infection or the risk of developing febrile malaria once p. falciparum infection is established.
