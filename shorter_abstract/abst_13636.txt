the expression levels are lower for genes in the vicinity of  <dig> of  <dig>  mirnas as compared to genes far from such mirnas.
we found decreased messenger rna  abundance, localized within a  <dig> kb of chromosomal distance of some mirnas, in c. elegans germline.
we analyzed gene expression levels around the  <dig> of  <dig> know mirnas for which there are nearby gene that were measured in the data in two independent c. elegans expression data sets.
mirnas are increasingly implicated in tissue-specific transcriptional control and particularly in development.
because there is mounting evidence for the localized component of transcriptional control, we investigated if there is a distance-dependent effect of mirna.
