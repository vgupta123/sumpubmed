the nae.s <dig> twin-ribozyme intron was gained early in the naegleria evolution with subsequent vertical inheritance.
nagir <dig> is responsible for intron excision, exon ligation, and full-length intron rna circularization, reactions typical for nuclear group i intron ribozymes.
phylogenetic analyses performed on separate data sets representing nagir <dig>  nagir <dig>  naheg, and its1- <dig> s-its <dig> ribosomal dna are consistent with an overall vertical inheritance pattern of the intron within the naegleria genus.
the intron  has a complex organization of two ribozyme domains  and a homing endonuclease gene .
the intron was lost in the majority of isolates , leaving a widespread but scattered distribution pattern.
structural variabilities were noted within both the ribozyme domains and provide strong comparative support to the intron secondary structure.
why the apparent asexual naegleria amoebae harbors active intron homing endonucleases, dependent on sexual reproduction for its function, remains a puzzle.
