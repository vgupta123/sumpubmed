in this study, eeg recording and loreta source reconstruction were performed.
four square-wave gratings  were randomly presented in the  <dig> quadrants of the visual field.
karns and knight   <cit>  demonstrated by using erp and gamma band oscillatory responses that intermodal attention modulates visual processing at the latency of the early phase of the c <dig> response  thought to be generated in the primary visual cortex.
however, the timing of attentional modulation of visual cortex during object-based attention remains a controversial issue.
loreta, within its spatial resolution limits, identified the neural generators of this effect in the striate cortex , among other areas.
a large number of subjects  and of trial repetitions were used .
participants were instructed to pay conjoined attention to a given stimulus quadrant and spatial frequency.
