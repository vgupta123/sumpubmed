kraken scales linearly with the number of targeted genomes, n, which allows for including large numbers of genomes in analyses.
on a nucleotide level,  <dig> to 83% of exons match exactly at both splice junctions, and up to 97% on at least one junction.
not limited to protein coding genes, kraken also identifies thousands of newly identified transcribed loci, likely non-coding rnas that are consistently transcribed in human, chimpanzee and gorilla, and maintain significant correlation of expression levels across species.
unambiguously identifying the orthology relationship between copies across multiple genomes can be resolved by synteny, i.e.
however, a comprehensive analysis of duplication events and their contributions to evolution would require all-to-all genome alignments, which increases at n <dig> with the number of available genomes, n.
