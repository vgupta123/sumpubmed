when the chromosomes from the male parent are doubled, the genes contributing to normal embryo developmentare more abundant.
in contrast, genes related to senescence and cell death were down-regulated in the c. morifolium × tetraploid c. nankingense cross.
a previously performed cross, c. morifolium × diploid c. nankingense, was compared to our results and revealed that transcription factors , hormone-responsive genes , genes and proteins related to metabolism  and other genes reported to contribute to embryo development  had higher expression levels in the c. morifolium × tetraploid c. nankingense cross.
rna-seq and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation  were used to investigate differentially expressed genes and proteins during key embryo development stages in the latter cross.
cross breeding is the most commonly used method in chrysanthemum  breeding; however, cross barriers always exist in these combinations.
