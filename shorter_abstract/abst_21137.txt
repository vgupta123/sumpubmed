the enriched categories included the go category immune response , and the kegg pathways natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity  and leukocyte transendothelial migration .
the data provide valuable insight for future studies to dissect the pathogenesis of human aaa.
affymetrix and illumina arrays included  <dig>  genes in common;  <dig>   of these genes were considered to be expressed in either aneurysmal or normal abdominal aorta.
previous studies have provided evidence for the involvement of the immune system in aaa.
a large number of genes involved in immune function were differentially expressed in aaa, and the pathway analysis gave these results a biological context.
analysis of biological pathways, including gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , indicated extreme overrepresentation of immune related categories.
we used illumina and affymetrix microarray platforms to generate global gene expression profiles for both aneurysmal  and non-aneurysmal abdominal aorta, and identified genes that were significantly differentially expressed between cases and controls.
the current expression analysis extends these findings by demonstrating broad coordinate gene expression in immunological pathways.
