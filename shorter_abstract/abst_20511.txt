abundant transcripts encoding three secreted cystein-rich toxin-like peptides whose function remains to be explored were also identified.
our aim was here to identify the major protein components of the venom injected at oviposition by aphidius ervi to ensure successful development in its aphid host, acyrthosiphon pisum.
our data further support the role of γ-gts as key players in a. ervi success on aphid hosts.
however, despite the increased interest on aphid interaction networks, only sparse information is available on the factors used by parasitoids to modulate the aphid physiology.
two of the γ-gts most likely correspond to alleles of the same gene, with one of these alleles previously described as involved in host castration.

finally, this study also shed light on the quick evolution of venom components through processes such as duplication and convergent recruitment of virulence factors between unrelated organisms.
a combined large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic approach allowed us to identify  <dig> putative venom proteins among which three γ-glutamyl transpeptidases  were by far the most abundant.
among the other abundant proteins in the venom, several were unique to a. ervi such as the molecular chaperone endoplasmin possibly involved in protecting proteins during their secretion and transport in the host.
