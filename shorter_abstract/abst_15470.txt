today, microrna target prediction remains challenging since very few have been experimentally validated and sequence-based predictions have large numbers of false positives.
the combined databases obtained using both algorithms described in this paper outperform each of the existing predictive algorithms that were considered for the combination.
our approaches are a useful way to integrate predicted interactions from different databases.
