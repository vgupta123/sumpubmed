an ssr-based intraspecific linkage map was constructed using an f <dig> population derived from a cross between k  <dig>  and gkbspsc  <dig>  in the b-genome species a. batizocoi.
interspecific populations have been used widely for genetic mapping in diploid species of arachis.
to develop intraspecific reference linkage maps and gain insights into karyotypic evolution within the genus, we comparatively mapped the a- and b-genome diploid species using intraspecific f <dig> populations.
both the low level of genetic variation within the cultivated gene pool and its polyploid nature limit the utilization of molecular markers to explore genome structure and facilitate genetic improvement.
the newly developed est-ssr markers will enrich current molecular marker resources in peanut.
nevertheless, a wealth of genetic diversity exists in diploid arachis species , which represent a valuable gene pool for cultivated peanut improvement.
our findings will contribute to understanding tetraploid peanut genome origin and evolution and eventually promote its genetic improvement.
a high degree of macrosynteny was observed when comparing the homoeologous linkage groups between a  and b  genomes.
