this network is translated into a boolean network .
the model is validated by comparing it to experimental data from kinetics of cytochrome c release and caspase activation in wildtype and bid knockout cells grown on different substrates.
it produces semi-quantitative predictions on the activity of individual nodes, agreeing with experimental data.
this study centers on fas ligand -mediated apoptosis, and a complex and internally strongly linked network is assembled around the central fasl-mediated apoptosis cascade.
system stability is dynamically sampled and investigated using the software squad.
pathophysiological modifications such as input from cytomegalovirus proteins m <dig> and m <dig> again produces output behavior that well agrees with experimental data.
different bioinformatical techniques are employed and different crosstalk possibilities including the integrin pathway are considered.
testing a number of alternative crosstalk possibilities and networks we find that there are four stable system states, two states comprising cell survival and two states describing apoptosis by the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways, respectively.
a network model for apoptosis and crosstalk in hepatocytes shows four different system states and reproduces a number of different conditions around apoptosis including effects of different growth substrates and viral infections.
