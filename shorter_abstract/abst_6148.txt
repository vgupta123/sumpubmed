the use of catalogs of compositions  of characteristic oligoribonucleotides for microbial identification appears extremely promising.
the resulting catalogs of masses can subsequently be compared to the masses known to occur in previously-sequenced 16s rrnas allowing organism identification.
ribonuclease t <dig> and ribonuclease a digestion patterns were calculated for  <dig>  complete 16s rrnas.
rnase t <dig> is more useful than ribonuclease a in generating characteristic masses, though rnase a produces oligomers which are more readily distinguished due to the large mass difference between a and g. identification of multiple species in mixtures is also feasible.
combinations of just two and three oligoribonucleotide masses allowed 54% and 72% of the specific strains to be identified, respectively.
the public availability of over  <dig>  bacterial 16s ribosomal rna  sequences has facilitated microbial identification and classification using hybridization and other molecular approaches.
in this regard,  <dig> strains out of  <dig>  organisms  could be identified by the presence of a unique rnase t1-generated oligoribonucleotide mass.
sample nucleic acids are digested with a nuclease of known specificity and the products characterized using mass spectrometry.
in addition, individual fragments or combinations thereof can be used to recognize the presence of specific organisms in a complex sample.
an initial algorithm for recovering likely organisms present in complex samples is also described.
alternatively, if the organism is not in the existing database, it will still be possible to determine its genetic affinity relative to the known organisms.
