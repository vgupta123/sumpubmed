mutant strains were constructed for seven of the nine genes and their influence upon lps sialylation and resistance of the bacteria to the killing effect of normal human serum were assessed.
the commensal and pathogenic behaviour of h. influenzae involves lps sialylation that can be influenced by a complex regulatory interplay of sialometabolism genes.
sialic acid has been shown to be a major virulence determinant in the pathogenesis of otitis media caused by the bacterium haemophilus influenzae.
mutations in the neu5ac uptake  genes decreased virulence in the chinchilla model of otitis media, but the attenuation was strain dependent.
in contrast, mutations in catabolism genes and genes regulating sialic acid metabolism  did not attenuate virulence.
we show that these uptake and catabolic genes, including a sialic acid regulatory gene , are highly conserved in the h. influenzae natural population.
this study aimed to characterise the expression of genes required for the metabolism of sialic acid and to investigate the role of these genes in virulence.
