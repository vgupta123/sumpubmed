overall, our data elucidated the effects of a pst mutation on the transcriptional response, and further support the role of the pho regulon as part of a complex network contributing to phosphate homeostasis, adaptive stress responses, and e. coli virulence.
phenotypic tests also established that the pst mutant was impaired in its capacity to produce type  <dig> fimbriae, as demonstrated by western blotting and agglutination of yeast cells, when compared to wild-type apec strain χ <dig>
the global mechanisms contributing to the attenuation and decreased resistance of the apec pst mutant to environmental stresses have not been investigated at the transcriptional level.
accordingly, the k <dig> strain was less resistant to reactive oxygen species  than the wild-type strain.
to determine the global effect of a pst mutation on gene expression, we compared the transcriptomes of apec strain χ <dig> and its isogenic pst mutant  grown in phosphate-rich medium.
the pstscab-phou operon belongs to the pho regulon and encodes the phosphate specific transport  system.
interestingly, the pst mutant not only induced systems involved in phosphate acquisition and metabolism, despite phosphate availability, but also modulated stress response mechanisms.
in addition, the pst mutant demonstrated reduced expression of genes involved in lipopolysaccharide modifications and coding for cell surface components such as type  <dig> and f <dig> fimbriae.
indeed, transcriptional changes in genes associated with the general stress responses, including the oxidative stress response were among the major differences observed.
