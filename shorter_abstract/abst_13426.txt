the differentially expressed genes included those involved in developmental processes and cell differentiation.
these findings reinforce the concept that the main role of ca ix is not the regulation of ph in the stomach mucosa.
ca ix is an exceptional member of this family because in addition to the basic ca function, it has been implicated in several other physiological and pathological processes.
therefore, we wanted to study the effect of ca ix deficiency on whole-genome gene expression in gastric mucosa.
ca ix deficiency caused the induction of  <dig> genes and repression of  <dig> genes in the gastric mucosa.
microarray analysis identified several potential genes whose altered expression could explain the disturbed cell lineage phenotype in the car9-/- gastric mucosa.
in addition, ca ix likely regulates cell proliferation and differentiation, which was demonstrated in car9-/- mice.
there was  <dig> % concordance between the results obtained by microarray analysis and qrt-pcr.
the results also indicated a novel role for ca ix in the regulation of immunologic processes and digestion.
instead, it is needed for proper function of several physiological processes.
functions suggested for ca ix include roles in cell adhesion and malignant cell invasion.
in addition, ca ix deficiency altered the expression of genes responsible for immune responses and downregulated the expression of several digestive enzymes.
carbonic anhydrases  are a family of enzymes that regulate ph homeostasis in various tissues.
these mice had gastric pit cell hyperplasia and depletion of chief cells; however, the specific molecular mechanisms behind the observed phenotypes remain unknown.
the expression of several genes with notable fold change values was confirmed by qrt-pcr.
