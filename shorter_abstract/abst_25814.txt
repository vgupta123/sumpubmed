there is a great need to analyze archaeal microbiomes from a broad range of host species in order to establish causal relationships between the structure of methanogen communities and their potential for methane emission.
as reported in other host species, methanobrevibacter was the dominant genus in the alpaca, representing  <dig> % of clones.
however, the alpaca archaeal microbiome was different from other reported host species, as clones showing species-level identity to methanobrevibacter millerae were the most abundant.
methanogens that populate the gastrointestinal tract of livestock ruminants contribute significantly to methane emissions from the agriculture industry.
from our analysis, we propose a model to describe the population structure of methanobrevibacter-related methanogens in the alpaca and in previously reported host species, which may contribute in unraveling the complexity of symbiotic archaeal communities in herbivores.
