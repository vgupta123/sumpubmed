however, most often, the mtt assay and ldh assay showed the highest and lowest ec values, respectively.
to choose an appropriate assay, different parameters like test compounds, detection mechanism, specificity, and sensitivity have to be considered.
all four assays performed well in the zfl cells and led to reproducible dose-response curves for all test compounds.
model compounds were the pharmaceutical tamoxifen, its metabolite 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, the fungicide flusilazole and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzopyrene.
furthermore, tissue or cell line can influence test performance.
for zebrafish , as emerging model organism, cell lines are now increasingly used, but few studies examined cytotoxicity in these cell systems.
therefore, we compared four cytotoxicity assays in the zebrafish liver cell line, zfl, to test four differently acting model compounds.
we recommend the alamarblue and cfda-am assays for cytotoxicity assessment in zfl cells, which can be applied either singly or combined.
the ec values were not statistically different between the four assays, which is due to the assessed unspecific effects of the compounds.
effective concentrations causing 10% or 50% loss of cell viability  varied by a maximum factor of  <dig>  for the ec <dig> values and a maximum factor of  <dig>  for the ec <dig> values.
nevertheless, the ldh assay showed the highest intra- and inter-assay variabilities and the lowest signal-to-noise ratios.
a broad spectrum of cytotoxicity assays is currently used in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology.
