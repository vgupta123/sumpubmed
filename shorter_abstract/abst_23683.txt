arterial tortuosity in mra images was measured from a dfm curve and tested on numerically generated models as well as mra images from two hypertensive and three negative control populations.
the korean hypertensive population had significantly higher arterial tortuosity than its corresponding negative control population across multiple arteries.
existing images were gathered from previous studies and clinical medical systems by manually reading electronic medical records to identify hypertensives and negatives.
existing images presented challenges such as different resolutions which may affect the tortuosity measurement, different depths of the area imaged, and different artifacts of imaging that require filtering.
images of different resolutions were interpolated to similar resolutions.
comparisons were made between different resolutions, different filters, hypertensives versus negatives, and different negative controls.
tortuosity can be compared between images of different resolutions by interpolating from lower to higher resolutions.
in addition one negative control population of different ethnicity had significantly less arterial tortuosity than the other two.
the method described here detected elevated arterial tortuosity in a hypertensive population compared to the negative control population and can be used to study this relation in other populations.
the most commonly used arterial tortuosity measure is the distance factor metric .
this study tested a dfm based measurementâ€™s ability to detect increases in arterial tortuosity of hypertensives using existing images.
