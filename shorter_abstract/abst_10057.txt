here we present an analysis of rna-editing patterns from  <dig> different tissues harvested from a single mouse.
dysfunction of a-to-i rna editing can have catastrophic effects, particularly in the central nervous system.
there exists a small but remarkable amount of editing which is tissue-specific, despite comparable expression levels of the edit site across multiple tissues.
expression levels of editing enzymes and their isoforms can explain some, but not all of this variation.
together, these data suggest a complex regulation of the rna-editing process beyond transcript expression levels.
we identified a surprising enrichment of editing in intronic regions of brain transcripts, that could account for previously reported higher levels of editing in brain.
