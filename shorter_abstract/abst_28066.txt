in gene ontology, the "molecular function"  categorization is a widely used knowledge framework for gene function comparison and prediction.

we introduce a rank-based gene semantic similarity measure called intego by synergistically integrating the state-of-the-art gene-to-gene similarity measures.
its structure and annotation provide a convenient way to compare gene functional similarities at the molecular level.
by integrating three go based seed measures, intego significantly improves the performance by about two-fold in all the three species studied .
the existing gene similarity measures, however, solely rely on one or few aspects of mf without utilizing all the rich information available including structure, annotation, common terms, lowest common parents.
