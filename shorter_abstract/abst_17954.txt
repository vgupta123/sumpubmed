our present results improve our knowledge of the gene structure and the evolutionary history of the primate-specific chimeric pmchl genes.
several novel spliced pmchl transcripts have been characterized in human testis and fetal brain, identifying an additional exon and novel splice sites.
sequence analysis of the spliced pmchl transcripts identified only short orfs of less than  <dig> bp, with low  or no evolutionary conservation.
sequencing of pmchl genes in several non-human primates allowed to carry out phylogenetic analyses revealing that the initial retroposition event took place within an intron of the brain cadherin  gene, soon after platyrrhine/catarrhine divergence, i.e.
western blot analyses of human and macaque tissues expressing pmchl rna failed to reveal any protein corresponding to vmch-p <dig> and protein variants encoded by spliced transcripts.
mutations before divergence of hylobatidae led to creation of new exons and finally pmchl <dig> duplicated in an ancestor of hominids to generate pmchl <dig> at the human chromosome 5q <dig>  a complex pattern of spliced and unspliced pmchl rnas were found in human brain and testis.
brain-expressed genes that were created in primate lineage represent obvious candidates to investigate molecular mechanisms that contributed to neural reorganization and emergence of new behavioural functions in homo sapiens.
