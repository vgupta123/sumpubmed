further, we investigated the direct impact of cognitive stimuli on ripples , which showed a transient statistically significant suppression of ripples in the first second after stimuli onset in nh only.
using automated detection of ripples based on amplitude of the power envelope, we analyzed ripple rate  in the cognitive and resting period, within eh and nh.
we analyzed depth eeg recordings in  <dig> patients with intractable epilepsy, in whom hippocampal activity was recorded initially during quiet wakefulness and subsequently during a simple cognitive task.
in the present study we addressed this by investigating the effect of cognitive stimulation on interictal high frequency oscillations in the ripple range  within epileptic  and non-epileptic hippocampus .
compared to quiet wakefulness we observed a significant reduction of rr during cognitive stimulation in eh, while it remained statistically marginal in nh.
our results point to a differential reactivity of ripples within eh and nh to cognitive stimulation.
until now there has been no way of distinguishing between physiological and epileptic hippocampal ripples in intracranial recordings.
