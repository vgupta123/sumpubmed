investigation of gene expression levels revealed  <dig>  genes involved in seed development, many of which showed significant changes in the  <dig> daf sample compared with the  <dig> daf sample.
to verify unigene expression levels calculated from the transcriptome analysis results, quantitative real-time pcr was performed on  <dig> randomly selected genes from the  <dig> up-regulated genes;  <dig> showed consistency between qrt-pcr and  <dig> pyrosequencing results.
to gain greater insight into this mechanism, the transcriptome profiles of seeds at different developmental stages were analyzed by  <dig> pyrosequencing.
however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in this annual oilseed crop.
our  <dig> pyrosequencing data for the camelina transcriptome provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways of polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in camelina.
the genes characterized in our research will provide candidate genes for the genetic modification of crops.
among them,  <dig> candidate unigenes were characterized as responsible for polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis.
functional annotations showed that  <dig> genes annotated as fatty acid biosynthesis genes were up-regulated in  <dig> daf sample.
