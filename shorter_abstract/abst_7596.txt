in various contexts , read processing requires to determine the sub-collection of reads that are related to a given sequence, which is done by searching for some k-mers in the reads.
gk arrays constitute a versatile data structure that enables fast and more accurate read analysis in various contexts.
once constructed, the index structure is kept in main memory and is repeatedly accessed to answer queries like "given a k-mer, get the reads containing this k-mer ".
high throughput sequencing  is now heavily exploited for genome  sequencing, metagenomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics and requires different, but computer intensive bioinformatic analyses.
when a reference genome is available, mapping reads on it is the first step of this analysis.
we provide examples where such queries are adapted to different types of read analysis .
read mapping programs owe their efficiency to the use of involved genome indexing data structures, like the burrows-wheeler transform.
the gk arrays library is available under cecill  license from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/ngs/.
we compared our structure to other solutions that adapt uncompressed indexing structures designed for long texts and show that it processes queries fast, while requiring much less memory.
here, we present a solution, named gk arrays, to index large collections of reads, an algorithm to build the structure, and procedures to query it.
the gk arrays provide a flexible brick to design innovative programs that mine efficiently genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, or transcriptomics reads.
