myxozoa are a diverse group of metazoan parasites with a very simple organization, which has for decades eluded their evolutionary origin.
our phylogenetic results suggest that the different myxozoan sequences are the results of ancient divergences within cnidaria and not of recent specializations of the polar capsule.
here we searched genomes and transcriptomes of several myxozoan taxa for the presence of additional cnidarian specific genes and characterized these genes within a phylogenetic context.
the diversity of minicollagens was higher than previously thought, with the presence of three minicollagen genes in myxozoans.
we found that the cnidarian repertoire of nematogalectins is more complex than previously thought and we identified additional members of the nematogalectin family.
their most prominent and characteristic feature is the polar capsule: a complex intracellular structure of the myxozoan spore, which plays a role in host infection.
our results demonstrate that myxozoans possess a diverse array of genes that are taxonomically restricted to cnidaria.
for both minicollagen and nematogalectin, our results show that myxozoans possess less gene copies than their cnidarian counter parts, suggesting that the polar capsule gene repertoire was simplified with their reduced body plan.
striking morphological similarities have been found between myxozoan polar capsules and nematocysts, the stinging structures of cnidarians  leading to the suggestion that myxozoa and cnidaria share a more recent common ancestry.
characterization of these genes provide compelling evidence that polar capsules and nematocysts are homologous structures and that myxozoans are highly degenerate cnidarians.
