it then examines the effects on root production, pi uptake, pi-related gene expression and organic carbon  exudation.
seed treatment with b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig> increased root production at low environmental pi concentrations, but significantly repressed root pi uptake.
at high external pi concentrations, root production was promoted by b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig>  but pi uptake was unaffected.
whilst such bacteria promote root production in vitro, the nature of the bacteria-plant interaction in live soil, particularly concerning any effects on nutrient uptake, are not known.
the use of auxin-producing rhizosphere bacteria as agricultural products promises increased root production and therefore greater phosphate  uptake.
we conclude that, alongside promoting root production, auxin biosynthesis by b. amyloliquefaciens fzb <dig> both re-models pi transporter expression and elevates organic c exudation.
