in the studies reported here we have focused on the identification and characterization of two dctcf protein interaction modules.
the multimerization domain maps in the n-terminus of the dctcf protein and likely mediates the formation of tetrameric complexes.
transgene rescue experiments showed that a dctcf protein lacking sequences critical for cp <dig> interactions was almost as effective as wild type in rescuing the phenotypic effects of a dctcf null allele.
our results indicate that dctcf–cp <dig> interactions are less critical for the in vivo functions of the dctcf protein than the n-terminal dctcf–dctcf interaction domain.
ctcf is one of the few insulator proteins known to be conserved from flies to man.
a protein lacking the n-terminal dctcf multimerization domain incompletely rescued the zygotic and maternal effect lethality of the null and did not rescue the defects in abd-b regulation evident in surviving adult dctcf mutant flies.
finally, we show that elimination of maternally contributed dctcf at the onset of embryogenesis has quite different effects on development and abd-b regulation than is observed when the homozygous mutant animals develop in the presence of maternally derived dctcf activity.
the cp <dig> interaction module encompasses a sequence ~ <dig> amino acids long that spans the c-terminal and mediates interactions with the n-terminal btb domain of the cp <dig> protein.
insulators play a central role in gene regulation, chromosomal architecture and genome function in higher eukaryotes.
we also show that the phenotypic consequences of dctcf mutations differ depending upon when and how dctcf activity is lost.
