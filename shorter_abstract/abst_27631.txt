flux coupling analysis  is a useful method for finding dependencies between fluxes of a metabolic network at steady-state.
a corresponding software tool is freely available for non-commercial use at http://www.bioinformatics.org/ffca/.
we present ffca as a new method for flux coupling analysis and prove it to be faster than existing approaches.
we show on a set of benchmarks that for genome-scale networks ffca is faster than other existing fca methods.
we introduce a new fca algorithm, ffca , which is based on checking the feasibility of a system of linear inequalities.
