the rs <dig> snp was also 100Â % concordant with rs <dig> in a validation population that possessed an alternate form of the favorable b qtl haplotype.
splicing and ase results are consistent with the observed dominant nature of the favorable qtl allele.
gbp <dig> is known to play a role in inflammasome assembly during immune response.
all variants within the gbp <dig> transcript in ld with rs <dig> exhibited allele specific expression  in ab individuals .
rna-seq analysis confirmed this snp was associated with differential splicing by qtl genotype  and this was validated by quantitative capillary electrophoresis .
these findings demonstrate that rs <dig> is a strong candidate causal mutation for the ssc <dig> qtl that controls variation in host response to prrsv.
previously, we identified a major quantitative trait locus  for host response to porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus  infection in high linkage disequilibrium  with snp rs <dig> on sus scrofa chromosome  <dig> .
the wild-type transcript was expressed at a higher level in ab versus aa individuals, whereas the five-nucleotide insertion transcript was the dominant form in aa individuals.
