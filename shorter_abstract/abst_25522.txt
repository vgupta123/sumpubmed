subtyping methods which allow the characterization of stm are essential for effective laboratory-based stm surveillance and for recognition of outbreaks.
the highest concordance of the results was found between xbai-pfge and phage typing .
this study describes the diversity of finnish stm isolates using phage typing, antimicrobial susceptible testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis , and compares the discriminatory power and the concordance of these methods.
a total of  <dig> sporadic stm isolates were analysed.
the three most common xbai-pfge profiles  and one mlva profile with three single locus variants accounted for 56 % and 49 % of the stm isolates, respectively.
enterica serotype typhimurium  is the most common agent of domestically acquired salmonellosis in finland.
however, the discriminatory power of the 5-loci mlva varied among the phage types.
however, mlva was phage type dependent providing better discrimination of the most common phage types.
in general, the calculated discriminatory power was higher for genotyping methods  than for phenotyping methods .
thus, the laboratory-based surveillance of the finnish human stm infections has been conducted with a combination of phage typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and 5-loci mlva since january  <dig>
furthermore, 5-loci mlva was a less laborious method and easier to interpret than xbai-pfge.
in mlva, 71 % of the isolates lacked sttr <dig> and 77 % missed sttr10p loci.
the studied isolates showed a genetic similarity of more than 70 % by xbai-pfge.
