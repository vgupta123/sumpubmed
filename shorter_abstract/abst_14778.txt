most genes encoding lea proteins had abscisic acid response  and/or low temperature response  elements in their promoters and many genes containing the respective promoter elements were induced by abscisic acid, cold or drought.
the analyses indicate a wide range of sequence diversity, intracellular localizations, and expression patterns.
we present a genome-wide analysis of lea proteins and their encoding genes in arabidopsis thaliana.
we also found that 33% of all arabidopsis lea protein encoding genes are arranged in tandem repeats and that 43% are part of homeologous pairs.
there was only little overlap between genes expressed in vegetative tissues and in seeds and expression levels were generally higher in seeds.
the majority of lea proteins were predicted to be highly hydrophilic and natively unstructured, but some were predicted to be folded.
although they are widely assumed to play crucial roles in cellular dehydration tolerance, their physiological and biochemical functions are largely unknown.
the high fraction of retained duplicate genes and the inferred functional diversification indicate that they confer an evolutionary advantage for an organism under varying stressful environmental conditions.
we identified  <dig> lea protein encoding genes in the arabidopsis genome that could be classified into nine distinct groups.
this comprehensive analysis will be an important starting point for future efforts to elucidate the functional role of these enigmatic proteins.
