in this work we evaluate svmprat on several classification and regression problems including disorder prediction, residue-wise contact order estimation, dna-binding site prediction, and local structure alphabet prediction.
this toolkit developed provides practitioners an efficient and easy-to-use tool for a wide variety of annotation problems.
over the last decade several prediction methods have been developed for determining the structural and functional properties of individual protein residues using sequence and sequence-derived information.
svmprat formulates the annotation problem as a classification or regression problem using support vector machines.
we present a general purpose protein residue annotation toolkit  to allow biologists to formulate residue-wise prediction problems.
for every residue svmprat captures local information around the reside to create fixed length feature vectors.
most of these methods are based on support vector machines as they provide accurate and generalizable prediction models.
