fetal bovine serum  contains a wide range of growth factors, hormones, vitamins, amino acids, fatty acids and trace elements required for cell growth.
it was shown that animal sera contain also extracellular vesicles  with important biological properties; thus we wondered whether evs present in fbs would influence muscle cell phenotype.
qrt-pcr of relevant genes and mirna involved in proliferation, differentiation, energy metabolism and evs formation and secretion were performed.
growth of myoblasts in ev-free media during proliferation produces the most unfavorable situation for proper myotube formation, when considering c <dig> and human myoblasts.
like c2c <dig> and human cells, l <dig> formed less myotubes in evs-depleted media.
they had a reduced level of myogenin and a strong increase in myostatin expression, a negative regulator of muscle cell differentiation that affects myotube size.
researchers studying the role of muscle evs in culture conditions should consider that depleting evs from serum alters the phenotype of muscle cells.
evs in body fluids could have an unsuspected function during embryogenesis and in regulation of cellular processes such as hypertrophy and hyperplasia.
c2c <dig> and human myoblasts, grown constantly in ev-depleted media during proliferation and differentiation, formed less myotubes than in cm.

c2c <dig>  l <dig> and human primary myoblasts, were grown either in classical media  or in evs-depleted media.
this implies that evs can transfer specific signals to cells from unrelated species and that part of serum ev composition is evolutionarily conserved .
