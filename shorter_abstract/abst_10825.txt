one of the goals of modern molecular biology is the high-throughput identification of genes associated with a particular treatment or a biological process of interest.
gene expression levels in a given cell can be influenced by different factors, namely pharmacological or medical treatments.
bats successfully manages various technical difficulties which arise in time-course microarray experiments, such as a small number of observations, non-uniform sampling intervals and replicated or missing data.
recently, the authors of this paper developed a fully bayesian approach which allows one to identify differentially expressed genes in a 'one-sample' time-course microarray experiment, to rank them and to estimate their expression profiles.
it allows an user to automatically identify and rank differentially expressed genes and to estimate their expression profiles when at least 5â€“ <dig> time points are available.
the response to a given stimulus is usually different for different genes and may depend on time.
