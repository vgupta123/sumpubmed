the transcriptomic analysis revealed  <dig> non-cannonical genes besides many unexpected candidates with known biochemical functions, which have never been associated with pathostress-responsive transcriptome.
the development, detailed analysis of caest datasets and global gene expression by microarray provide new insight into the commonality and diversity of organ-specific immune-responsive transcript signatures and their regulated expression shaping the species specificity at genotype level.
despite its importance in plant evolution, role in human nutrition and stress adaptation, very little ests and differential transcriptome data is available, let alone genotype-specific gene signatures.
further, several novel transcription regulators were identified indicating their possible role in immune response.
our study establishes a comprehensive catalogue of the immune-responsive root transcriptome with insight into their identity and function.
the sequence assembly led to the identification of a caunigene set of  <dig> transcripts comprising of  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons, two-third of which represent new chickpea genes hitherto undiscovered.
we report  <dig> gene sequences of immune-response pathway that would provide genotype-dependent spatial information on the presence and relative abundance of each gene.
characterization of genetic makeup is thus crucial for understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic diversity, evolution and response to intra- and extra-cellular stimuli.
this is the first report on differential transcriptome of an unsequenced genome during vascular wilt.
