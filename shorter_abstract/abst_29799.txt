on a wholly defined dataset, the pl-lm method was able to identify 75% of the differentially expressed genes within 10% of false positives.
the proposed pl-lm  method implements a linear model applied on the probe-level data to directly estimate the treatment effect.
a finite mixture of gaussian components is then used to identify degs using the coefficients estimated by the linear model.
the identification of differentially expressed genes  from affymetrix genechips arrays is currently done by first computing expression levels from the low-level probe intensities, then deriving significance by comparing these expression levels between conditions.
