micrornas  play key roles in mammalian gene expression and several cellular processes, including differentiation, development, apoptosis and cancer pathomechanisms.
we determine functionally related gene sets, or pathways to reveal the functional correlation between differentially expressed mrnas and mirnas.
recently the biological importance of primary cilia has been recognized in a number of human genetic diseases.
numerous disorders are related to cilia dysfunction, including polycystic kidney disease .
in parallel,  <dig> mirnas were differentially regulated in pkd rats: our results suggest that several mirnas might be involved in regulating genetic switches in pkd.
our results suggest an important role of mirnas in specific pathways underlying pkd.
we find that the functional patterns of predicted mirna targets and differentially expressed mrnas are similar.
<dig> genes, classified into  <dig> functional categories, were differentially regulated between pkd and control animals.
given the emerging role of mirnas in gene expression, we explored the possibilities of mirna-based regulations in pkd.
although involvement of certain genes and transcriptional networks in pkd development has been shown, not much is known how they are regulated molecularly.
