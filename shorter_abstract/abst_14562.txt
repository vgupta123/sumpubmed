this suggested presence of regulatory networks governing expression of critical virulence genes in e. amylovora.
comparative genomic analysis of tcsts indicated that e. amylovora tcsts were closely related to those of erwinia tasmaniensis, a saprophytic enterobacterium isolated from apple flowers, and to other enterobacteria.
virulence assays revealed that five of these mutants were non-pathogenic on immature pear fruits.
our results demonstrated that tcsts in e. amylovora played major roles in virulence on immature pear fruit and in regulating amylovoran biosynthesis and swarming motility.
both negative and positive regulators of amylovoran biosynthesis were identified, indicating a complex network may control this important feature of pathogenesis.
we used a systems approach to identify tcst and related signal transduction genes in the genome of e. amylovora.
results from phenotypic characterization and gene expression experiments indicated that several groups of tcst systems in e. amylovora control amylovoran biosynthesis, one of two major virulence factors in e. amylovora.
two-component signal transduction systems , consisting of a histidine kinase  and a response regulator , represent a major paradigm for signal transduction in prokaryotes.
forty-six tcst genes in e. amylovora including  <dig> sensor kinases, three hybrid kinases,  <dig> dna- or ligand-binding rrs, four rrs with enzymatic output domain , and two kinases were characterized in this study.
positive , negative , and intermediate regulators for swarming motility in e. amylovora were also identified.
