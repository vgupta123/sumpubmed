nevertheless, ie at the sentence level has a limited effect because of the frequent references to previous entities in the discourse, a phenomenon known as 'anaphora'.
drugnerar obtains similar results to other approaches dealing with anaphora resolution in the biomedical domain, but, unlike these approaches, it focuses on documents reflecting drug interactions.
drug-drug interactions are frequently reported in the increasing amount of biomedical literature.
each possible case of anaphoric expression was looked into to determine the most effective way of resolution.
the present approach shows very promising results in the challenge of accounting for anaphoric expressions in pharmacological texts.
a key component in the success of this framework is the analysis provided by the mmtx program and the drugner system that allows to deal with the complexity of the pharmacological language.
this ad-hoc reference line was developed to check the results as there is no previous work on anaphora resolution in pharmalogical documents.
the obtained results resemble those found in related-semantic domains.
it is expected that the positive results of the resolver increases performance of our future drug-drug interaction extraction system.
drugnerar, a drug anaphora resolution system is presented to address the problem of co-referring expressions in pharmacological literature.
an f-score of  <dig>  in anaphora resolution was achieved, outperforming significantly the baseline by almost 73%.
the centering theory has proved being effective at the selection of antecedents in anaphora resolution.
semantic information provided by the unified medical language system  is also integrated in order to improve the recognition and the resolution of nominal drug anaphors.
the system uses a set of linguistic rules drawn by centering theory over the analysis provided by a biomedical syntactic parser.
