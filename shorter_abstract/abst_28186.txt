this algorithm can directly find driver pathways or gene sets de novo from somatic mutation data utilizing two combinatorial properties, high coverage and high exclusivity, without any prior information.
secondly, we present a new greedy strategy to add or remove genes for obtaining overlapping gene sets with driver mutations according to the properties of high exclusivity and high coverage.

nbm obtains optimal results in less than nine seconds on a conventional computer and the time complexity is much less than the three other methods.
introduced the maximum weight sub-matrix problem to find driver pathways and showed that it is an np-hard problem.
to further verify the performance of nbm, we apply the method to analyze somatic mutation data from five real biological data sets such as the mutation profiles of  <dig> glioblastoma tumor samples and  <dig> lung carcinoma samples.
we firstly construct gene networks based on the approximate exclusivity between each pair of genes using somatic mutation data from many cancer patients.
new gene sets with p-value less than 1e- <dig> are found from the somatic mutation data.
to assess the efficiency of the proposed nbm, we apply the method on simulated data and compare results obtained from the nbm, rme, dendrix and multi-dendrix.
results show that nbm outperforms other algorithms for detecting driver pathways or gene sets.
one key challenge is to detect functional driver pathways and to filter out nonfunctional passenger genes in cancer genomics.
to find a better solution and solve the problem more efficiently, we present a network-based method  to detect overlapping driver pathways automatically.
