nox <dig> and duox are present in all arthropod lineages but it seems that a nox2-like gene was lost in the ancestral lineage leading to ecdysozoa.
although the accessory protein p22-phox, essential for nox1- <dig> activation, was not found in any of the arthropods studied, nox4-art of aedes aegypti encodes an active protein that produces h2o <dig>  although nox4-art has been lost in a number of arthropod lineages, it has all the domains and many signature residues and motifs necessary for ros production and, when silenced, h2o <dig> production is considerably diminished in a. aegypti cells.
this gene family is present in most eukaryotes, suggesting a common ancestor.
in this study, we analyzed the evolution of this gene family in arthropods.
combining all bioinformatic analyses and laboratory work we have reached interesting conclusions regarding arthropod nox gene family evolution.

we also show that a nox gene, closely related to nox <dig> and previously found only in mosquitoes , can also be found in other taxonomic groups, leading us to rename it as nox4-art.
a thorough search of genomes and transcriptomes was performed enabling us to browse most branches of arthropod phylogeny.
to date, only a limited number of phylogenetic studies of metazoan noxes have been performed, with few arthropod genes.
we have found that the subfamilies nox <dig> and duox are present in all arthropod groups.
in arthropods, only nox <dig> and duox genes have been found and a gene called noxm was found in mosquitoes but its origin and function has not been examined.
although functional and present in the genomes of many species, nox4-art was lost in a number of arthropod lineages.
the nox4-art gene originated from a nox4-like ancestor and is functional.
