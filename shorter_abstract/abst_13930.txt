some mirnas had functional overlap in biotic and abiotic stress.
aba might increase expression of stress-related genes via mirna-mediated posttranscriptional regulation, and our results indicate that aba treatment has the potential to improve both abiotic stress tolerance and pathogen resistance.
we identified  <dig>  mirnas that respond to exogenous aba treatment with a change in expression level of |log2fc|≥ <dig> .
furthermore, stem-loop rt-pcr was applied to validate the rna-seq data.
aba mainly down-regulates mirnas that their target genes involve in abiotic stress adaption and disease resistance.
most of these mirnas were down-regulated following exposure to exogenous aba, while their related target genes were inversely up-regulated, which is consistent with their negative regulatory role in gene expression.
exogenous aba application influences the composition and expression level of tomato mirnas.
target prediction and analysis of the corresponding aba-responsive transcriptome data uncovered that differentially expressed mirnas are involved in condition stress and pathogen resistance, growth and development.
here, we identified mirnas responding to exogenous application of aba, and their predicted target genes in the model plant organism tomato .
deep sequencing of small rnas from aba-treated and untreated tomatoes revealed that mirnas can be up- or down-regulated upon treatment with aba.
among them, approximately  <dig> mirnas were predicted to target transcription factors and pathogen resistance genes.
a total of  <dig> mirnas were detected , of those,  <dig> mirnas which had an abundance over two tpm  were selected for differential expression analysis.
