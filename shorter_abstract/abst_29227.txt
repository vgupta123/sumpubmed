ubcm <dig> is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with roles in the turnover of damaged and misfolded proteins, cell cycle progression, development, and regulation of the antioxidant transcription factor, nrf <dig>  recent screens have identified binding partners of the enzyme that are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, and our previous studies have shown that ubcm <dig> is enriched in retina and brain.
in the current study, we characterized ubcm <dig> protein expression in various structures and cell types in the murine brain.
these studies represent the first protein expression profiling of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the brain and support the notion that deficits in protein degradation and proteostasis associated with neurodegenerative diseases may be, in part, attributable to age-dependent reductions in the enzymatic machinery of the ups.
as dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system  has been linked to many age-related neurological diseases, we compared ubcm <dig> expression levels in young versus aged wild-type mice and found a global decrease in expression in aged brains, with reductions of 10Â % or greater in five substructures .
