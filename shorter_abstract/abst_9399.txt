this study tested the effect of eslicarbazepine acetate , a novel antiepileptic drug, on latrunculin a-induced acute and chronic seizures, and changes in brain amino acid extracellular levels.
oral administration of esl , previous to latrunculin a microperfusion, completely prevented acute latrunculin a-induced seizures as well as chronic seizures and all eeg chronic signs of paroxysmal activity.
esl treatment prevented acute latrunculin a-induced seizures as well as chronic seizures and all eeg chronic signs of paroxysmal activity, supporting a possible anti-epileptogenic effect of esl in mice.
thereafter, mice were continuously video monitored for two months to identify chronic spontaneous seizures or behavioral changes.
esl reversed the increases in extracellular taurine, glycine and aspartate concentrations to basal levels and significantly reduced glutamate levels.

hippocampal extracellular levels of taurine, glycine and aspartate were significantly increased during latrunculin a microperfusion, while gaba and glutamate levels remained unchanged.
latrunculin a microperfusion of the hippocampus induces acute epileptic seizures and long-term biochemical changes leading to spontaneous seizures.
