these results revealed that the ccch families in arabidopsis and rice were divided into  <dig> and  <dig> subfamilies, respectively.
to date, few plant ccch proteins have been studied functionally.
the gene duplication contributed to the expansion of the ccch gene family in arabidopsis genome.
expression studies indicated that ccch proteins exhibit a variety of expression patterns, suggesting diverse functions.
a complete overview of this gene family in arabidopsis was presented, including the gene structures, phylogeny, protein motifs, and chromosome locations.
our comparative genomics analysis of ccch genes and encoded proteins in two model plant species provides the first step towards the functional dissection of this emerging family of potential rna-binding proteins.
