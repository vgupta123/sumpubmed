bioinformatics analysis suggested that the gene hp <dig>  annotated as hypothetical, was a flij homologue.
transmission electron transmission microscopy revealed that the hp <dig> mutant cells displayed a normal flagellum configuration, suggesting that hp <dig> was not essential for assembly and polar localisation of the flagella in the cell.
the biochemistry and genetics of flagellar biogenesis in h. pylori has not been fully elucidated.
however, it is required for full motility and it is involved, possibly indirectly, in expression of outer membrane proteins and adhesins involved in pathogenesis and adhesion.
interestingly, whole genome microarrays of an hp <dig> mutant revealed transcriptional changes in a number of genes associated with the flagellar regulon and the cell envelope, such as outer membrane proteins and adhesins.
ablation of the hp <dig> gene in h. pylori significantly reduced motility.
we conclude that hp <dig> is not a functional counterpart of flij in h. pylori.
consistent with the array data, lack of the hp <dig> gene significantly reduced adhesion and the inflammatory response in host cells.
however, flagellin and hook protein synthesis was not affected in the hp <dig> mutant.
helicobacter pylori is the causative agent for gastritis, and peptic and duodenal ulcers.
