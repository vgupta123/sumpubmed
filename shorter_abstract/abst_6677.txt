the streptomyces albus j <dig> strain is one of the most widely used chassis for the heterologous production of bioactive natural products.
the detailed genome and transcriptome analysis discloses its capability to serve as a premium host for the heterologous production of natural products.
to improve its capabilities for the heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters, the complete genomic sequence of s. albus j <dig> was obtained.
the fast growth and an efficient genetic system make this strain an attractive model for expressing cryptic biosynthetic pathways to aid drug discovery.
the whole transcriptomes were sequenced at different time points to identify the early metabolic switch from the exponential to the stationary phase in s. albus j <dig>
genome analysis revealed a strong tendency to reduce the number of genetic duplicates.
