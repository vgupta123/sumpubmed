to better understand the p. falciparum pp <dig>  regulatory network, we here report the use of three strategies to characterize the pfpp <dig> interactome: co-affinity purified proteins identified by mass spectrometry, yeast two-hybrid  screening and in silico analysis of the p. falciparum predicted proteome.
the present work provides a starting point for further studies on the structural basis of these interactions and their functions in p. falciparum.
co-affinity purification followed by ms analysis identified  <dig> pfpp <dig> interacting proteins  of which  <dig> contained the rvxf consensus binding,  <dig> with a fxxx motif, also shown to be a pp <dig> binding motif and one with both binding motifs.
the data reports several conserved pp <dig> interacting proteins as well as a high number of specific interactors to pfpp <dig>  their analysis indicates a high diversity of biological functions for pp <dig> in plasmodium.
the y2h screens identified  <dig> proteins of which  <dig> present the rvxf binding motif and  <dig> have the fxxx binding motif.
