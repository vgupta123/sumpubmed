we used illumina technology to sequence the genome of blochmannia associated with camponotus vafer.
with the exception of ureaplasma, b. vafer is the only sequenced bacterium to date that encodes urease but lacks the ability to assimilate ammonia into glutamine or glutamate.
comparing the b. vafer genome with b. pennsylvanicus and b. floridanus refines the core genes shared within the mutualist group, thereby clarifying functions required across ant host species.
although blochmannia vafer retains many nutritional functions, it is missing glutamine synthetase , a component of the nitrogen recycling pathway encoded by the previously sequenced b. floridanus and b. pennsylvanicus.
overall, compared to the likely gene set of their common ancestor,  <dig> genes are missing or eroded in b. vafer, compared to  <dig> in b. floridanus and four in b. pennsylvanicus.
eight b. vafer genes contain frameshifts in homopolymeric tracts that may be corrected by transcriptional slippage.
two of these encode dna replication proteins: dnax, which we infer is also frameshifted in b. floridanus, and dnag.
blochmannia perform key nutritional functions for the host, including synthesis of several essential amino acids.
loss of glna occurred in a deletion hotspot near the putative replication origin.
this third genome also allows us to track gene loss and erosion in a phylogenetic context to more fully understand processes of genome reduction.
