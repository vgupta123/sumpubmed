to increase our understanding of the genes that might be necessary for the formation and function of the germ line, we have constructed a sage library from hand dissected c. elegans hermaphrodite gonads.
additionally, the number and expression level of germ line expressed genes on the x chromosome is lower than expected based on a random distribution.
using multiple technological platforms provides a more complete picture of global gene expression patterns.
some of these stages include exiting mitosis and entering meiosis, progressing through the various stages of meiotic prophase, adopting either a male  or female  fate, and completing meiosis.
genes involved in rna metabolism are expressed at a significantly higher level in the germ line than the soma, suggesting a stronger reliance on rna metabolism for control of the expression of genes in the germ line.
ribosomal genes are highly expressed in the germ line; roughly four fold above their expression levels in the soma.
additionally, many of the factors needed to drive embryogenesis are synthesized in the germ line.
we found that  <dig> genes, roughly 21% of all known c. elegans genes, are expressed in the adult hermaphrodite germ line.
we further found that  <dig> of the germline-expressed genes have enriched expression in the germ line as compared to the soma.
we also found > <dig> fold enrichment for rna binding proteins in the germ line as compared to the soma.
germ cells must progress through elaborate developmental stages from an undifferentiated germ cell to a fully differentiated gamete.
