3d x-ray microscopy of the female and male genitalia showed that the plug material can extend far into the female genital tract and that the plug material is produced by a massive gland inside the palpal organ of the modified male pedipalps.
we investigated the factors responsible for plug production and function in the promiscuous female-cannibalistic spider micaria sociabilis .
copulation duration and plug production seem to be controlled by the female.
whereas incomplete plugs had disappeared on the day following copulation, complete plugs persisted .
sperm competition imposes a strong selective pressure on males, leading to the evolution of various physiological, morphological and behavioral traits.
sperm competition can be prevented by blocking or impeding the access to female genitalia by means of a mating plug.
our study demonstrates that the mating plug in m. sociabilis constitutes an effective male strategy to avoid sperm competition that seems to be under female control.

in matings with females with complete plugs, only a small proportion of males  were able to remove the plug, indicating the high effectiveness of plugging.
