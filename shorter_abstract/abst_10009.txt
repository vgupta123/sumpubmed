after carrying out the analysis and validation for three sequenced escherichia coli strains, cgh microarray data from  <dig> e. coli o <dig> pathogenic test strains were used to demonstrate the benefits of applying this simple and robust process to cgh microarray studies using bacterial genomes.
although there are some programmes available for interpretation of bacterial transcriptomics data and cgh microarray data for looking at genetic stability in oncogenes, there are none specifically to understand the mosaic nature of bacterial genomes.
the process involves five steps: cleaning, normalisation, estimating gene presence and absence or divergence, validation, and analysis of data from test against three reference strains simultaneously.
to address this shortfall we have produced a simple and robust cgh microarray data analysis process that may be automated in the future to understand bacterial genomic diversity.
each stage of the process is described and we have compared a number of methods available for characterising bacterial genomic diversity, for calculating the cut-off between gene presence and absence or divergence, and shown that a simple dynamic approach using a kernel density estimator performed better than both established, as well as a more sophisticated mixture modelling technique.
