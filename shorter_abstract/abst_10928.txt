in the classification of conotoxin proteins, our method, svm-freescore, features an improved sensitivity and specificity by approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, over previously reported methods.
the svm-freescore method is shown to be a useful sequence-based analysis tool for functional and structural characterization of conotoxin proteins.
conotoxin has been proven to be effective in drug design and could be used to treat various disorders such as schizophrenia, neuromuscular disorders and chronic pain.
for the generalization purpose, svm-freescore was also applied to classify superfamilies from curated and high quality database such as conoserver.
in this paper, we propose to consider suboptimal alignments of words with restricted length.
the scoring system plays the key role in the feature extraction step of support vector machine classification.
we developed a scoring system based on local alignment partition functions, called free score.
