the unambiguous identification of individual chromosomes is a key part of the genomic characterization of any species.
here, successful fluorescence chromosome banding has been achieved for the first time in perennial ryegrass , a forage and turf grass with a large genome and a symmetrical karyotype with chromosomes that are difficult to distinguish.

based on flame-dried chromosome preparations instead of squashes, a simple fluorescence q-banding technique using quinacrine mustard, unambiguously identified each chromosome and enabled the development of a banded karyotype and ideogram of the species.
by enabling the allocation of genes mapped by other methods to physically identified chromosome positions, this work will contribute to a better understanding of genomic structures and functions in grasses.
this q-banding technique was also shown to be compatible with sequential fish mapping enabling labelled genes and molecular markers to be precisely assigned to specific cytogenetic bands.
this was compatible with fish mapping and was used to anchor a single copy gene from an earlier mapped linkage group of l. perenne, thus providing a step towards integration of the genetic and cytogenetic maps.
