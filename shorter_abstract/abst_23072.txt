we present vtbuilder, a tool for constructing non-chimeric transcripts from read data that has been sequenced from sources containing isoform complexity.
additionally, improving the quality of transcripts assembled from read data will have an impact on future studies that query these data.
to demonstrate that our approach can be scaled to real world data we assembled the venom gland transcriptome of the african puff adder bitis arietans using paired-end reads sequenced on illuminaâ€™s miseq platform.
the ssts were selected to represent genes from major co-expressed toxin groups known to harbor isoform variants.
despite recent advances in assembly software, creating such transcripts from read data harboring isoform variation remains challenging.
within many research areas, such as transcriptomics, the millions of short dna fragments  produced by current sequencing platforms need to be assembled into transcript sequences before they can be utilized.
vtbuilder constructed  <dig> transcripts from  <dig> million reads and, following annotation, all major toxin genes were recovered demonstrating reconstruction of complex underlying sequence and isoform diversity.
unlike other approaches, vtbuilder strives to maintain the relationships between co-evolving sites within the constructed transcripts, and thus increases transcript utility for a wide range of research areas ranging from transcriptomics to phylogenetics and including the monitoring of drug resistant parasite populations.
this is because current approaches fail to identify all variants present or they create chimeric transcripts within which relationships between co-evolving sites and other evolutionary factors are disrupted.
we validated vtbuilder using reads simulated from  <dig> sanger sequenced transcripts  expressed in the venom gland of the saw scaled viper, echis ocellatus.
