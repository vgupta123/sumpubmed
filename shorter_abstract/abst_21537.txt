analysis of this data, in association with two previously published genome-wide gsc data sets, revealed sets of candidate genes as putatively expressed in specific cell populations.
here we report a genome-wide expression study that uses laser cutting microdissection to isolate germline stem cells, somatic niche cells, and early differentiating germ cells from female and male gonads.
investigation of one of these genes, cg <dig> the drosophila ortholog of mammalian programmed cell death  <dig> , reveals expression in female and male germline stem cells and early differentiating daughter cells.
we propose that pdcd <dig> promotes the differentiation of gsc daughter cells by relieving the eif4a-mediated inhibition of bam.
germline stem cells  are present in the gonads of drosophila females and males, and their proper maintenance, as well as their correct differentiation, is essential for fertility and fecundity.
furthermore, in females, pdcd <dig> genetically interacts with the key differentiation gene bag of marbles  and the stem cell renewal factor eif4a, suggesting a possible pathway for its function in differentiation.
