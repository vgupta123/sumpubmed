intriguingly, the level of polymorphism in genic regions of the maize genome was higher than that in intergenic regions.
of these highly polymorphic indels, we designed primer pairs for  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels with major allele differences  greater than or equal to  <dig> and 8 bp, respectively, based on the differing resolution capabilities of gel electrophoresis.
indels have been increasingly recognized as an important source of molecular markers due to high-density occurrence, cost-effectiveness, and ease of genotyping.
of  <dig> highly polymorphic indel markers, all had polymorphisms with average pic values of  <dig> .
the polymorphic indel markers developed from this study may enhance the efficiency of genetic research and marker-assisted breeding in maize.
a total of  <dig> , <dig> unique indels were identified in  <dig> maize genomes, with an overall density of  <dig>  indels/mbp, and an average allele number of  <dig> , ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  there were  <dig>  indels with polymorphism information content  values greater than or equal to  <dig> , accounting for  <dig>  % of overall indels.
the maize genome is rich in indel polymorphisms.
the accuracy of our indel markers was experimentally validated, and among  <dig> indel markers, average accuracy was approximately 90 %.
in addition, we also validated the polymorphism of the indel markers.
coupled with developments in bioinformatics, next-generation sequencing  platforms enable the discovery of millions of indel polymorphisms by comparing the whole genome sequences of individuals within a species.
