in this study we performed a comprehensive molecular evolutionary analysis of the nhx and sos <dig> families.
we propose that the different evolution histories are related with the proteinsâ€™ function and localization, and that the nhx and sos <dig> families are examples of two different evolutionary paths through which duplication events may result in adaptive evolution of stress tolerance.
our results show that, while the nhx family expanded and specialized, the sos <dig> family remained a low copy gene family that appears to have undergone neofunctionalization during its evolutionary history.
cation/proton exchangers are important for normal cell function and in plants, na+,k+/h+ antiporters have also been implicated in salt tolerance.
using available sequences from a total of  <dig> plant species, we estimated gene family phylogenies and gene duplication histories, as well as examined heterogeneous selection pressure on amino acid sites.
gene duplication events have been proposed to be involved in the adaptation of plants to stress conditions; precisely how is unclear.
two well-known plant cation/proton antiporters are nhx <dig> and sos <dig>  which perform na+ and k+ compartmentalization into the vacuole and na+ efflux from the cell, respectively.
