in situ hybridization showed that expression of notch signaling components and pro-endocrine bhlh factors is conserved to a large degree between chicken and mouse.
lastly, our results demonstrate that expression of differentiation markers can be uncoupled from the process of delamination of differentiating cells from the epithelium.
to further understand the mechanism by which notch exerts this function, we have investigated pancreatic endocrine development in chicken embryos.
we conclude that pancreatic endocrine development in the chicken relies on a conserved bhlh cascade under inhibitory control of notch signaling.
cell autonomous inhibition of notch signal reception results in significantly increased endocrine differentiation demonstrating that these early progenitors are prevented from differentiating by ongoing notch signaling.
our results also demonstrate that notch can repress ngn <dig> and neurod protein function and stimulate progenitor proliferation.
this lays the ground for further studies that take advantage of the ease at which chicken embryos can be manipulated.
genetic studies have shown that formation of pancreatic endocrine cells in mice is dependent on the cell autonomous action of the bhlh transcription factor neurogenin <dig> and that the extent and timing of endocrine differentiation is controlled by notch signaling.
