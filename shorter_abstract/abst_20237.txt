the diagnosis of dental diseases in rabbits is usually based on oral endoscopy and radiographic imaging, but detailed pathological diagnosis using these methods is frequently difficult.
micro-ct captured with a slice thickness of 60–120 mm has excellent spatial resolution, and is suitable for the clinical diagnosis of dental diseases in rabbits weighing 1–3 kg.
the aim of this study was to investigate the use of a newly developed micro-computed tomography  system for the diagnosis of oral pathologies in small animals, using the rabbit as a model.
image recording times were 18 s in normal mode and 120 s in fine mode.
micro-ct can yield more detailed data than radiography or conventional ct. this study determined that this novel imaging modality can be utilized for the accurate assessment of dental and oral diseases in rabbits.
