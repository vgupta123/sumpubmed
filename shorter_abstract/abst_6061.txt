they also lend support to the belief that there exists a substantial subset of promoter regions which share several common features including, but not restricted to, a relative abundance of cpg dinucleotides.
we successfully fitted models to reflect the non-coding sequences, and showed that the results were quite consistent for repeated training runs.
the results presented here indicate that the promoter signal is the strongest single motif-based signal in the non-coding functional fraction of the genome.
