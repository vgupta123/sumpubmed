nucleosome occupancy varies among different cell types.
dimnp is designed for sequenced reads data and includes the modules of both calling nucleosome occupancy and identifying dnrs.
we validated dimnp on dataset of the mutant strains in which the modifiable histone residues are mutated into alanine in saccharomyces cerevisiae.
we developed a tool of identifying the dnrs in multiple samples and cell types.

just by one time, dimnp is able to identify all the dnrs identified by two-sample method danpos.
identification of such variation will help to understand regulation mechanism.
the tool can be applied in studying nucleosome variation in gradual change in development and cancer.
dimnp shows a good capacity  compared with the manually identified dnrs.
here, we proposed a chi-squared test-based approach, named as dimnp, to identify differential nucleosome regions  in multiple samples.
the previous researches focused on the methods for two-sample comparison.
with dimnp, we found that promoters and telomeres are highly dynamic upon mutating the modifiable histone residues.
however, a multiple-sample comparison  is necessary, especially in studying development and cancer.
