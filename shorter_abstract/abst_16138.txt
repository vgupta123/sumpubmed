specifically in breeding applications, the sgbs approach will allow breeders to obtain a whole-genome profile of important individuals while simultaneously targeting specific genes for a range of selection strategies across the breeding program.
this open platform allows multiple, single-target loci to be assayed while simultaneously generating a whole-genome profile.
here, we report the application of sgbs on a winter wheat panel that was screened for converted kasp markers and newly-designed markers targeting known polymorphisms in the leaf rust resistance gene lr <dig>
to minimize the cost of targeted assays, we utilize a small percent of sequencing capacity available in runs of gbs libraries to “spike” amplified targets of a priori alleles tagged with a different set of unique barcodes.
