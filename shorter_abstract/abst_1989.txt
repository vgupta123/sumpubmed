strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants.
the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls:  <dig>   log <dig> vs  <dig>   cfu/g of faeces .
this study shows that two out of  <dig> strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty.
then,  <dig> lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures.
lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.delbrueckii dsm  <dig> and l. plantarum mb  <dig> were able to inhibit all coliforms strains , also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity.
infantile colic is a common disturb within the first  <dig> months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue.
strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of  <dig> colicky and  <dig> control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers, and the bbl™ enterotube™ ii system for enterobacteriaceae.
our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.
intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic.
gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source.
this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp.
