in clones of human keratinocytes carrying from a single to numerous insertions of the vitamin d <dig> sensor, a sensitive sensor read-out is detected upon exposure to even low concentrations of vitamin d <dig> analogues.
our findings demonstrate the use of the genetic sensor as a tool in first-line evaluation of new vitamin d <dig> analogues and pave the way for new types of drug delivery studies in sensor-transgenic animals.
in comparative studies, the sensor unveils superior potency of new candidate drugs in comparison with analogues that are currently in clinical use.
functional testing of new vitamin d <dig> analogues and formulations for improved systemic and topical administration is supported by sensitive screening methods that allow a comparative evaluation of drug properties.
the three expression cassettes, inserted in a head-to-tail orientation in a sleeping beauty dna transposon vector, are efficiently inserted as a single genetic entity into the genome of cells of interest in a reaction catalyzed by the hyperactive sb100x transposase.
the tri-cistronic genetic sensor encodes a drug-sensoring protein, a reporter protein expressed from an activated sensor-responsive promoter, and a resistance marker.
