we use a non-linear, information theoretic based image registration technique specifically adapted for mapping expression images to anatomical annotations and a method for extracting expression information within an anatomical region.
from this we obtain a matrix for expression characteristics with rows corresponding to genes and columns corresponding to anatomical sub-structures.
while we focus here on imagery and experiments of the mouse brain our approach should be applicable to a variety of in situ experiments.
our method consists of coarse registration, fine registration, and expression feature extraction steps.
projects creating gene expression atlases at unprecedented scales for the embryonic fruit fly as well as the embryonic and adult mouse already involve the analysis of hundreds of thousands of high resolution experimental images mapping mrna expression patterns.
