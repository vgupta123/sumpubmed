imeter scores of btls were compared with the 5′utr introns of two gene families mhx and polyubiquitin genes.
comparison of the average 5′utr intron size on three gene families in ten angiosperm species suggests that a prevalent size for a 5′utr intron is in the range of  <dig> nucleotides, and that the overall imeter score within a gene family is preserved across several angiosperms.
the imeter algorithm was developed to predict plant introns that may enhance gene expression.
promoter-gus fusion lines were used to confirm the ime effect of these 5′utr introns on gene expression.
we have identified several plant members of the btl class of e3s, which may have orthologs across eukaryotes, that contain a 5′utr intron.
in this study, we retrieved btl sequences from several angiosperm species and found that 5′utr introns showing a strong imeter score were predicted, suggesting that they may be conserved by lineage.
analysis performed in two arabidopsis btl e <dig> ligases genes indicated that the 5′utr introns were essential for gene expression in all the tissues tested.
our results indicated that gene expression dependent on a 5′utr intron is an efficient regulatory mechanism in btl e <dig> ligases that has been preserved throughout plant evolution.
introns located close to the 5′ end of a gene or in the 5′ untranslated region often exert positive effects on gene expression.
