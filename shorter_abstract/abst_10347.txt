characterization of these dna copy number changes is important for both the basic understanding of cancer and its diagnosis.
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretical and experimental exploration of a set of array cgh data, including both synthetic data and real data.
the comparison results show that our method outperforms the previous approaches.
in both synthetic and real cgh data, stationary wavelet packet transform  is the best wavelet transform to analyze cgh signal in whole frequency.
we have designed the swtp and the swpt-bi which are using the stationary wavelet packet transform with the hard thresholding and the new bivariate shrinkage estimator respectively to smooth the array cgh data.
our purpose is to remove cgh noise in whole frequency while keeping true signal by using bivariate model.
in order to develop effective methods to identify aberration regions from array cgh data, many recent research work focus on both smoothing-based and segmentation-based data processing.
in this paper, we propose stationary packet wavelet transform based approach to smooth array cgh data.
