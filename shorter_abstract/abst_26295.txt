in veterinary medicine, epilepsy in dogs is usually treated with phenobarbital, either with the standard brand name formulation luminal® or the veterinary products luminal® vet and the generic formulation phenoleptil®.
thus, the reasons for the anecdotal reports, if true, that switching from the brand to the generic formulation of phenobarbital may lead to recurrence of seizures are obviously not related to a generally lower bioavailability of the generic formulation, although single dogs may exhibit lower plasma levels after the generic formulation that could be clinically meaningful.

elimination half-life was about 50 h  without differences between the formulations.
the relative bioavailability of the two products  was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicating that both formulations resulted in about the same bioavailability.
following approval of phenoleptil® for treatment of canine epilepsy, it was repeatedly reported by clinicians and dog owners that switching from luminal®  to phenoleptil® in epileptic dogs, which were controlled by treatment with luminal®, induced recurrence of seizures.
luminal® and luminal® vet are identical 100 mg tablet formulations, while phenoleptil® is available in the form of  <dig>  and 50 mg tablets.
in the present study, we compared bioavailability of phenobarbital after single dose administration of luminal® vet vs. phenoleptil® with a crossover design in  <dig> healthy beagle dogs.
peak plasma concentrations  following luminal® vet vs. phenoleptil® were about the same in most dogs , and only one dog showed noticeable lower concentrations after phenoleptil® vs. luminal® vet.
overall, the two formulations did not differ significantly with respect to pharmacokinetic parameters when mean group parameters were compared.
