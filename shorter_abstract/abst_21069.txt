phylogenetic tree and conserved protein domain analyses showed sequence conservation and divergence.
ga metabolism genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns.
expression patterns between  <dig> and 8818- <dig> revealed that maga20ox <dig>  maga20ox <dig>  and maga20ox <dig> of the maga20ox gene family and maga2ox <dig>  maga2ox <dig>  and maga2ox <dig> of the maga2ox gene family exhibited significant differential expression and high-expression levels in false stems.

the present results revealed that maga20ox <dig>  maga20ox <dig>  maga20ox <dig>  maga2ox <dig>  maga2ox <dig>  and maga2ox <dig> were the main genes regulating ga content difference between  <dig> and 8818- <dig>  all of these genes may perform important functions in the developmental processes of banana, but each gene may perform different functions in different tissues or during different developmental stages.
early ga biosynthesis genes were constitutively expressed but presented differential regulation in different tissues in williams banana.
overall, phylogenetic evolution, tissue specificity and differential expression analyses of ga metabolism genes can provide a better understanding of ga-regulated development in banana.
ga oxidase family genes were mainly transcribed in young fruits, thus suggesting that young fruits were the most active tissue involved in ga metabolism, followed by leaves, bracts, and finally approximately mature fruits.
genome-wide screening revealed  <dig> candidate ga metabolism genes were systematically identified for the first time; these genes included  <dig> macps,  <dig> maks,  <dig> mako,  <dig> makao,  <dig> maga20ox,  <dig> maga3ox, and  <dig> maga2ox genes.
we obtained a dwarf mutant ‘8818-1’ through ems  mutagenesis of williams banana  <dig> .
these genes are likely to be responsible for the regulation of gas content in 8818- <dig> false stems.
our research have shown that gibberellins  content in 8818- <dig> false stems was significantly lower than that in its parent  <dig> and the dwarf type of 8818- <dig> could be restored by application of exogenous ga <dig>  although ga exerts important impacts on the 8818- <dig> dwarf type, our understanding of the regulation of ga metabolism during banana dwarf mutant development remains limited.
