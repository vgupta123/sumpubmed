although differences in life-history and contemporary ecological factors may explain some interspecific variation, evolutionary forces driving extra-pair  mating remain largely obscure.
mating outside the pair-bond is surprisingly common in socially monogamous birds, but rates of extra-pair paternity  vary widely between species.
nonetheless, many life-history and breeding parameters that are hypothesized to drive interspecific variation in epp are not different in the purple-crowned fairy-wren compared to its promiscuous congeners.
such radical loss of an extreme ep mating system with all associated adaptations from a lineage of biologically very similar species indicates that evolutionary inertia does not necessarily constrain interspecific variation in epp.
however, the relative importance of plasticity and phylogenetic constraints on the incidence of ep mating remains largely unknown.
phylogenetic parsimony implies that these characteristics were lost in one speciation event.
in addition, we show absence of the suite of distinctive behavioral and morphological adaptations associated with ep mating that characterize other fairy-wrens.
