anti-gbm igg <dig> was detected in all patients , with  <dig>  patients presenting with weak segmental staining and  <dig>  patients with strong linear deposition.
we observed increased inflammatory cell infiltration into the interstitium in patients with increased anti-tbm igg <dig> deposits .
igg deposition along tubular basement membrane  was also detected in  <dig>  patients.
in the current study, we investigated the deposition of the four igg subclasses using immunohistochemistry in the renal biopsy specimens from  <dig> patients with anti-gbm disease.
anti-gbm igg <dig> predominantly deposits along gbm and tbm on renal biopsy specimens from patients with anti-gbm disease, which may be involved in the development of renal injury of the disease.
to date, the distribution of anti-gbm igg subclasses on renal tissue is still unclear.
renal injury of anti-glomerular basement membrane  disease is defined by the linear deposition of igg along gbm and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
anti-gbm igg <dig> was detected in  <dig>  patients, with  <dig>  patients having weak segmental deposition and  <dig>  patients presenting strong linear staining.
among them, the igg subclass distribution was similar to that of the deposition within the gbm: igg <dig>  <dig> % , igg <dig>  <dig> % , igg <dig> 100%  and igg <dig>  <dig> % .
all four igg subclasses can be detected within the gbm.
