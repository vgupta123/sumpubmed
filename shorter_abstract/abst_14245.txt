we have demonstrated that we can effectively map the diagnosis-related terms describing a sample in tmad to the nci-t. the nci thesaurus terms have a wide coverage and provide terms for about 86% of the samples.
the tissue samples in tmad are annotated with multiple free-text fields, specifying the pathological diagnoses for each sample.
these text annotations are not structured according to any ontology, making future integration of this resource with other biological and clinical data difficult.
we developed methods to map these annotations to the nci thesaurus.
in our opinion the nci thesaurus can facilitate integration of this resource with other biological data.
the stanford tissue microarray database  is a repository of data serving a consortium of pathologists and biomedical researchers.
