moreover, it is generally assumed that the negative effects of inbreeding are exacerbated in stressful environments.
far fewer studies have tested how stressful environments only experienced during development subsequently influence the effects of inbreeding on adult traits.
we experimentally manipulated the diet  of inbred and outbred juvenile eastern mosquitofish  for three weeks  to test whether experiencing a presumably stressful environment early in life influences their subsequent growth and adult phenotypes.
thus, the long-term costs of inbreeding due to lower male reproductive success we have shown in another study appear to be unrelated to inbreeding depression for adult male size or the growth rates that are reported in the current study.
individuals did not mitigate a poor start in life by showing ‘compensatory growth’ , but they showed ‘catch-up growth’ by delaying maturation.
there was, however, no effect of inbreeding on the extent of catch-up growth.

unexpectedly, despite a large sample size  and a quantified 23 % reduction in genome-wide heterozygosity in inbred offspring from matings between full-siblings , neither inbreeding nor its interaction with early diet affected growth trajectories, juvenile survival or adult size.
there were no detectable effects of inbreeding on growth or adult size, even on a low food diet that should elevate inbreeding depression.
the control diet was a standard laboratory food regime, while fish on the low food diet received less than 25 % of this amount of food.
