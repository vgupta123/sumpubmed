crystal structures show that whilst the amino acids that comprise both the tmcbp subsite one and subsite two binding sites remain fixed in conformation regardless of which ligands are present, the rich hydrogen bonding potential of water molecules may facilitate the ordering and the plasticity of this unique pbp binding site.
a molecular level understanding of binding pocket adaptation mechanisms that simultaneously allow both ligand specificity at subsite one and promiscuity at subsite two has potentially important implications in ligand binding and drug design studies.
this paradigm of pbp ligand binding specificity was recently altered when the structure of the thermotoga maritima cellobiose-binding protein  was solved.
the identification of the roles these water molecules play in ligand recognition suggests potential mechanisms that can be utilized to adapt a single ligand binding site to recognize multiple distinct ligands.
