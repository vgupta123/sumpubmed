the domestic dog is a rich resource for mapping the genetic components of phenotypic variation due to its unique population history involving strong artificial selection.
we first identified snps that strongly associate with body mass and ear type by comparing sequence variation in a 3 mb region between  <dig> breeds with a variety of phenotypes.
the finding that variants on long haplotypes have effects on more than one trait suggests that genetic linkage can be an important determinant of the phenotypic response to selection in domestic animals.
a region on chromosome  <dig> is among those with the highest levels of genetic differentiation between dog breeds and is associated with body mass and ear morphology, a common motif of animal domestication.
these snps are in strong genetic linkage with another set of variants that correlate with body mass within the gene hmga <dig>  which affects human height.
we characterise genetically linked variants that potentially influence ear type and body mass in dog breeds, both key traits that have been modified by selective breeding that may also be important for domestication.

genome-wide association studies have revealed a number of chromosomal regions where genetic variation associates with morphological characters that typify dog breeds.
in addition we find evidence that this region has been under selection during dog domestication, and identify a cluster of snps within msrb <dig> that are highly differentiated between dogs and wolves.
