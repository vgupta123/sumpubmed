we have found surprisingly characteristic differences between simplices with atomic vertices of different types, and between the atomic neighborhoods – described also by simplices – of different ligand atoms in proteins.
after we performed a rigorous re-structuring of the whole pdb on graph-theoretical basis, we created the rs-pdb  database.
