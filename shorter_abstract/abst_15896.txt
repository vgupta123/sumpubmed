we computed the rate of alterations in  <dig> pathways and  <dig> tumours consisting of eight different cancers.
significant similarities between subgroups of different cancers on pathway and gene expression levels provide interesting hypotheses for understanding variable drug response, or transferring treatments across diseases by identifying common druggable pathways or genes, for example.
clustering analysis revealed five clinically relevant subgroups of tumours in four cancers that exhibited significant differences in survival compared to others.
the pathway aberration and gene expression profiles of the subgroups were consecutively compared across all eight cancer types to search for similar tumours crossing the standard classification.
we identified pathways and processes that were common to all cancers as well as traits that are unique to a cancer type or closely related cancers.
we extended the current classification methods by studying tumour heterogeneity at pathway level.
this study represents the first effort to extend the molecular characterizations towards pathway level descriptions across the family of cancers.
in addition to providing a proof-of-concept for single sample pathway aberration analysis in this context, we present a comprehensive pathway aberration dataset that can be used to study pathway aberration patterns within or across cancers.
studying the gene expression patterns within the pathway context suggested potential alteration mechanisms.
