additional proteins of interest include a di-heme cytochrome c peroxidase and a partner protein, the roles of which remain a mystery.
in addition, testable models for mbn transport and for methanotrophic copper regulation have emerged.
these data provide a link between precursor peptide sequence and mbn structure, facilitating predictions of new mbn structures and supporting a post-translational modification biosynthetic pathway.
the few mbns that have been structurally characterized feature copper coordination by two nitrogen-containing heterocycles next to thioamide groups embedded in a peptidic backbone of varying composition.
the potential for mbn production in a wider range of bacterial species was assessed by mining microbial genomes.
methanobactins  are a family of copper-binding natural products involved in copper uptake by methanotrophic bacteria.
beyond biosynthetic machinery, a conserved set of transporters was identified, including mate multidrug exporters and tonb-dependent transporters.
this study indicates that mbn-like compounds may be more widespread than previously thought, but are not present in all methanotrophs.
operons encoding mbn-like precursor peptides, mbnas, were identified in  <dig> new species, including both methanotrophs and, surprisingly, non-methanotrophs.
the species can be divided into five groups on the basis of their mbna and mbnb sequences and their operon compositions.
mbns are proposed to derive from post-translational modification of ribosomally synthesized peptides, but only a few genes encoding potential precursor peptides have been identified.

this distribution of species suggests a broader role in metal homeostasis.
