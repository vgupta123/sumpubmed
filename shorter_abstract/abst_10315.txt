bovine trophoblast binucleate cells  express a plethora of molecules including bovine placental lactogen  and bovine prolactin-related protein- <dig> .
the data indicates the possibility of novel kinetics of induction of the synchronously expressed bnc-specific bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> transcripts, which may aid the understanding of the intricate regulation and specific role of these important molecules in bovine placentogenesis and the progression of pregnancy.
sodium bisulfite based sequencing revealed that bcsh <dig> is hypomethylated in the cotyledonary tissue but not in the fetal skin, and this pattern was not altered with the progression of pregnancy.
recent studies, however, have demonstrated that the expression of a number of genes is controlled by the methylation status of their promoter region.
while the activity of bcsh <dig> was similar in both bt- <dig> and bovine fibroblast cells, that of bprp <dig> was specific to bt- <dig>  treatment with a demethylating agent and luciferase assays provided in vitro evidence of the positive regulation of bcsh <dig> but not bprp <dig>
analysis of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment demonstrated that bcsh <dig> expression is moderately induced in fibroblast cultures but enhanced in bt- <dig> cells.
in the present study, we examined the cell-type-specific epigenetic alterations of the 5'-flanking region of the bcsh <dig> and bprp <dig> genes to gain an insight into their regulatory mechanisms.
on the other hand, the methylation status of bprp <dig> was similar between the cotyledon and fetal skin.
