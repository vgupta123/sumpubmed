hepatic mrna content of key factors involved in lipid metabolism suggest a decreased lipogenesis , and an increased Î²-oxidation  without modification of fatty acid esterification , secretion  or intracellular transport .
fatty acid pattern is profoundly modified in hepatic phospholipids and triglycerides.
histological analysis reveals alterations of liver morphology, which can not be explained by inflammatory or oxidative stress.
moreover, long term n- <dig> pufa depletion decreases the expression of factors involved in the unfolded protein response, suggesting a lower protection against endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes upon n- <dig> pufa deficiency.
n- <dig> pufa depletion leads to a significant decrease in body weight despite a similar caloric intake or adipose tissue weight.
however, several proteins involved in the unfolded protein response are decreased in depleted mice.
