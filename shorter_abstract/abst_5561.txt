mhc class i but not mhc class ii is expressed.
the highest expressed gene is a mutated form of the mouse tumor antigen gp <dig>  of the  <dig>  non-synonymous point variations,  <dig> are both in expressed genes and in peptides predicted to bind mhc and thus potential targets for immunotherapy development.
as ct <dig> is one of the most extensively used syngeneic mouse tumor models, our data provide a map for the rationale design of mode-of-action studies for pre-clinical evaluation of targeted- and immunotherapies.
tumor models are critical for our understanding of cancer and the development of cancer therapeutics.
