npq levels between natural accessions grown under different conditions were not correlated.
compared to plants grown under field conditions, the "indoor plants" had larger leaves, modified leaf shapes and longer petioles.
their pigment composition also significantly differed; indoor plants had reduced levels of xanthophyll pigments.
in addition, lhcb <dig> and lhcb <dig> levels were up to three times higher in the indoor plants, but differences in the psi antenna were much smaller, with only the low-abundance lhca <dig> protein showing altered levels.
both isoforms of early-light-induced protein  were absent in the indoor plants, and they had less non-photochemical quenching .

our results indicate that comparative analysis of field-grown plants with those grown under artificial conditions is important for a full understanding of plant plasticity and adaptation.
the field-grown plants had a high capacity to perform state transitions.
plants exhibit phenotypic plasticity and respond to differences in environmental conditions by acclimation.
