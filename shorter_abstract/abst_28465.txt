elisa analysis of cytokines confirmed microarray results at four hours and revealed that after  <dig> hours of exposure, s. aureus biofilm induced sustained low level cytokine production compared to near exponential increases of cytokines in planktonic treated keratinocytes.
staphylococcus aureus is prevalent in cutaneous infections such as chronic wounds and is an important human pathogen.
gene ontology terms associated with responses to bacteria, inflammation, apoptosis, chemotaxis, and signal transduction were enriched in bcm treated keratinocytes.
persistent infection of the skin allows the formation of complex bacterial communities termed biofilm.
global gene expression of keratinocytes exposed to biofilm and planktonic s. aureus was analyzed after four hours of exposure.
collectively the results indicate that s. aureus biofilms induce a distinct inflammatory response compared to their planktonic counterparts.
proteomic analysis of bcm and pcm revealed differential protein compositions with pcm containing several enzymes involved in glycolysis.
the differential gene expression and production of inflammatory cytokines by biofilm and planktonic cultures in keratinocytes could have implications for the formation and persistence of chronic wounds.
chemical inhibition of mapks did not drastically reduce cytokine production in bcm-treated keratinocytes suggesting that the majority of cytokine production is mediated through mapk-independent mechanisms.
the impact of s. aureus soluble products in biofilm-conditioned medium  or in planktonic-conditioned medium  on human keratinocytes was investigated.
bacterial biofilms are a major impediment to wound healing.
