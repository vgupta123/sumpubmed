two novel mlva types 0-9-5-5-6- <dig>  and 0-8-4-5-6- <dig>   were defined in the ovine materials correlated with st <dig> and st <dig>  samples from different parts of the phylogenetic tree were associated with different hosts, suggesting host-specific adaptations.
the aim of this study is to describe the genetic diversity of c. burnetii in hungary and compare genotypes with those found elsewhere.
even with the limited number of samples analysed, this study revealed high genetic diversity among c. burnetii in hungary.
understanding the background genetic diversity will be essential in identifying and controlling outbreaks.
information about the genotypic characteristic of coxiella burnetii from hungary is lacking.
phylogenetic relationships among mst genotypes show how these hungarian samples are related to others collected around the world.
