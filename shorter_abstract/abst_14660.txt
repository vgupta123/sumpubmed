in order to understand the evolution of plastid genomes and to establish phylogenetic relationships among ferns, we sequenced the plastid genomes from three early diverging species: equisetum hyemale , ophioglossum californicum , and psilotum nudum .
plastid genome structure and content is remarkably conserved in land plants.
a comparison of fern plastid genomes showed that some lineages have retained inverted repeat  boundaries originating from the common ancestor of land plants, while other lineages have experienced multiple ir changes including expansions and inversions.
these results further demonstrate the power of using rare genomic structural changes in cases where molecular data fail to provide strong phylogenetic resolution.
these genomic structural changes support the placement of equisetales as sister to ophioglossales + psilotales and marattiales as sister to polypodiopsida.
although molecular analyses were inconsistent with respect to the position of marattiales and equisetales, several genomic structural changes have for the first time provided a clear placement of these lineages within the ferns.
this result is augmented by some molecular phylogenetic analyses that recover the same relationships, whereas others suggest a relationship between equisetales and polypodiopsida.
