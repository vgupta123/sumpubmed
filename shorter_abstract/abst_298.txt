the developed model and molecular insights are essential to understand the molecular basis of deregulated complement activity in human disease and will facilitate future design of therapeutic interventions against these critical enzymes in inflammation.
combining our results with molecular modeling explains how high c3b densities may facilitate intermolecular interactions that only occur on target surfaces.
alternative pathway  c <dig> convertases were generated on small streptavidin beads that were coated with purified c3b molecules.
in the presence of factor b and factor d, these c3b beads could effectively convert c <dig>  conversion rates of surface-bound c3b were more than 100-fold higher than fluid-phase c3b, confirming the requirement of a surface.
site-specific biotinylation of c3b via the thioester allowed binding of c3b in the natural orientation on the surface.
complement is a large protein network in plasma that is crucial for human immune defenses and a major cause of aberrant inflammatory reactions.
through development of a highly purified model system for c <dig> convertases, we here aim to provide insights into the surface-specific nature of these important protease complexes.
we determine that high surface densities of c3b, and its attachment via the thioester, are essential for c <dig> convertase formation.
so far, it has been difficult to study the exact molecular arrangement of c <dig> convertases, because their non-catalytic subunits  are covalently linked to biological surfaces through a reactive thioester.
