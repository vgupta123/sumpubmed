overexpression of snf <dig> enhances both wild-type and gain-of-function mutant trpc6-mediated whole-cell currents in hek293t cells.
here we report that snf <dig>  a component of the endosomal sorting complex for transport-ii  complex, interacts with trpc <dig>  the interaction was initially observed in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of trpc <dig> as bait, and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from eukaryotic cell extracts.
furthermore, activation of nfat-mediated transcription by gain-of-function mutants is enhanced by overexpression of snf <dig>  and partially inhibited by rnai mediated knockdown of snf <dig>  although the escrt-ii complex functions in the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of transmembrane proteins, snf <dig> overexpression does not alter the amount of trpc <dig> present on the cell surface.
the canonical transient receptor potential  <dig>  has been implicated in several pathological processes, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , cardiac hypertrophy, and pulmonary hypertension.
modulating snf <dig> expression levels alters the trpc <dig> channel current and can modulate activation of nfat-mediated transcription downstream of gain-of-function mutant trpc <dig>  taken together, these results identify snf <dig> as a novel regulator of trpc <dig>
the two large cytoplasmic segments of the cation channel play a critical role in the proper regulation of channel activity, and are involved in several protein-protein interactions.
snf <dig> is novel binding partner of trpc <dig>  binding to the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the channel.
