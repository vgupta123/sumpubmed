the results demonstrate that a scoring strategy based on hmm profiles can achieve good performance in identifying deleterious or neutral variants for different data sets, and can predict the protein functional effects of both single and multiple mutations.
insertion and deletion  variants comprise a major proportion of human genetic variation.
this paper proposed a quantitative prediction method, hmmvar, to predict the effect of genetic variation using hidden markov models.
different classes of variants in the human genome have been identified, including single nucleotide substitutions, insertion and deletion, and large structural variations such as duplications and deletions.
