periplasmic expression enables disulphide bond formation, which is a prerequisite for the sctcr to reach its correct fold.
expression without iptg induction further improved the periplasmic expression yield, while addition of sucrose to the growth medium showed little effect.
the general expression regime presented here allows for rapid production of soluble sctcrs and is applicable for 1) high yield recovery sufficient for biophysical characterization and 2) high throughput screening of such molecules following molecular engineering.
the vαβ domain orientation was far superior to the vβα domain orientation regarding monomeric yield of functionally folded molecules.
the effect of 1) over-expression of the periplasmic chaperon fkpa, 2) culture conditions and 3) molecular design was investigated.
elevated levels of fkpa allowed periplasmic soluble sctcr expression, presumably by preventing premature aggregation and inclusion body formation.
