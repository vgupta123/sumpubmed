we present an algorithm that uses local learning to select appropriate connection methods in the context of roadmap construction for protein folding.
we develop a local learning algorithm that exploits the past performance of methods within the neighborhood of the current connection attempts as a basis for learning.
we demonstrate a clear need for learning  and show that local learning is superior to global learning producing, in many cases, significantly higher quality results than the other methods.
our method removes the burden of deciding which method to use, leverages the strengths of the individual input methods, and it is extendable to include other future connection methods.
