amino acid-derived aldoximes and nitriles play important roles in plant defence.
in this study we analysed and compared the jasmonic acid-induced volatile blends of two erythroxylum species, the cultivated south american crop species e. coca and the african wild species e. fischeri.
cyp79d <dig> from e. coca and cyp79d <dig> and cyp79d <dig> from e. fischeri showed broad substrate specificity in vitro and converted l-phenylalanine, l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-tryptophan, and l-tyrosine into the respective aldoximes.
in contrast, recombinant cyp79d <dig> from e. coca exclusively accepted l-tryptophan as substrate.
the kinetic parameters of the enzymes expressed in vitro coupled with the expression patterns of the corresponding genes and the accumulation and emission of -phenylacetaldoxime, -indole-3-acetaldoxime, -3-methylbutyraldoxime, and -2-methylbutyraldoxime in jasmonic acid-treated leaves suggest that cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig> accept l-phenylalanine, l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-tryptophan as substrates in vivo and contribute to the production of volatile and semi-volatile nitrogenous defence compounds in e. coca and e. fischeri.
quantitative real-time pcr revealed that cyp79d <dig>  cyp79d <dig>  and cyp79d <dig> were significantly upregulated in jasmonic acid-treated erythroxylum leaves.
both species produced different nitrogenous compounds including aliphatic aldoximes and an aromatic nitrile.
they are well-known as precursors for constitutive defence compounds such as cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates, but are also released as volatiles after insect feeding.
however, the majority of cyp79s characterized so far are involved in cyanogenic glucoside or glucosinolate biosynthesis and only a few have been reported to be responsible for nitrogenous volatile production.
