congenital sensorineural deafness  is the most common type of deafness in dogs and it occurs in numerous canine breeds including the english bull terrier.
this study estimates prevalence, heritability and genetic correlations of csd and coat pigmentation phenotypes in the english bull terrier in england.
hearing status was assessed by brainstem auditory evoked response in  <dig> english bull terrier puppies tested at 30– <dig>  days of age as complete litters.
these results indicate that csd occurs predominantly in white english bull terriers and there is genetic variation in csd beyond that associated with coat colour.

analysis of csd in all white and white patched puppies only estimated the heritability of csd as  <dig>  and was significantly greater than zero , and the heritability of coat colour  as  <dig>  .
heritability and genetic correlations were estimated using residual maximum likelihood.
genetic correlation of csd with coat pigmentation phenotype was estimated at − <dig>  to − <dig>  , but was not significantly larger than zero .
the genetic correlation was estimated at − <dig>  to − <dig>   but was just above the statistical threshold determining significant difference to zero .
heritability of hearing status as a trichotomous trait  was estimated at  <dig>  to  <dig>  and was significantly different to zero .
the majority  of deaf puppies had a white coat ;  <dig>  % of the puppies with a white coat  were deaf.
heritability of coat pigmentation phenotype  was  <dig>  .
gender, coat and iris colour and parental hearing status were recorded.
