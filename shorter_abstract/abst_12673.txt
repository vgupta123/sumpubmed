we apply this method to uncover over  <dig>  minimal knockouts for biomass production in an in silico genome-scale model of e. coli.
biological robustness results from redundant pathways that achieve an essential objective, e.g.
unlike previous approaches, our method yields results regarding high-order epistatic relationships and is applicable at the genome-scale.
the identification of such "epistatic" essential relationships between network components is critical for the understanding and eventual manipulation of robust systems-level phenotypes.
a large majority of these "essential sets" contain  <dig> or more reactions, and thus represent complex epistatic relationships between components of the e. coli metabolic network.
the complex minimal biomass knockouts discovered with our approach illuminate robust essential systems-level roles for reactions in the e. coli metabolic network.
as a consequence, the biological roles of many genes can only be revealed through multiple knockouts that identify a set of genes as essential for a given function.
