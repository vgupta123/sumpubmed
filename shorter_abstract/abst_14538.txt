however, heterorhabditis infection alters the transcription of several genes that participate in lipidhomeostasis and metabolism, stress responses, dna/protein sythesis and neuronal functions.
here we have used next generation rna-sequencing to analyze the transcriptional profile of wild-type adult flies infected by axenic heterorhabditis nematodes , symbiotic heterorhabditis nematodes , and photorhabdus bacteria alone.
bioinformatic analysis shows that infection with photorhabdus alters the transcription of a large number of drosophila genes involved in translational repression as well in response to stress.
such large-scale transcriptomic analyses set the stage for future functional studies aimed at identifying the exact role of key factors in the drosophila immune response against nematode-bacteria complexes.
however, information on the drosophila immune response to entomopathogenic nematode infections is currently limited.
we have also identified genes in the fly with potential roles in nematode recognition, anti-nematode activity and nociception.
we have obtained approximately  <dig> million reads from the different infection treatments.
