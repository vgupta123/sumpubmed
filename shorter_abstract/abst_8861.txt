application of the technique to a set comprising aquifex aeolicus and  <dig> other thermophiles showed an important role for large genomes as 'hubs' in the gene sharing network, and suggested that genes are preferentially shared between organisms with similar optimal growth temperatures.
validation trials on simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in recovering and representing vertical and lateral relationships among genomes.
we have developed a new approach that uses linear programming to find between-genome relationships, by treating tables of genetic affinities  as an optimization problem.
microbial genomes exhibit complex sets of genetic affinities due to lateral genetic transfer.
we were also able to discover distinct and common genetic contributors to each sequenced representative of genus pseudomonas.
