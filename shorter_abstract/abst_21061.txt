in silico perturbation of network components also captured biological features of cytokine interactions .
these findings highlight the potential of network-based approaches in identifying novel cytokine pharmacological targets and in predicting the effects of their exogenous manipulation in inflammatory/immune disorders.
we employed bayesian networks to analyze cytokine-hormone interactions in vivo using murine lactation as a dynamic, physiological model system.
the resultant networks were very robust and assembled about structural hubs, with evidence that interleukin - <dig> , il- <dig> and monocyte chemoattractant protein - <dig> were the primary drivers of network behavior.
cytokine-hormone network deregulations underpin pathologies ranging from autoimmune disorders to cancer, but our understanding of these networks in physiological/pathophysiological states remains patchy.
