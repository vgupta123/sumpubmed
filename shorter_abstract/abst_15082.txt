inconsistencies were found in all public databases, which were discussed and corrected in multiple feedback rounds with the responsible curators.
the java application glycoupdatedb is also available for establishing and updating a local installation of glycomedb.
we have created a new database called glycomedb, containing all structures, their taxonomic annotations and references  for the original databases.
glycosciences.de, the consortium for functional glycomics , the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  and the bacterial carbohydrate structure database .
funding for further development of the complex carbohydrate structure database  ceased in  <dig>  and since then several initiatives have developed independent databases with partially overlapping foci.
glycomedb is a new, publicly available database for carbohydrate sequences with a unified, all-encompassing structure encoding format and ncbi taxonomic referencing.
although carbohydrates are the third major class of biological macromolecules, after proteins and dna, there is neither a comprehensive database for carbohydrate structures nor an established universal structure encoding scheme for computational purposes.
therefore, it is virtually impossible to obtain an overview of all deposited structures or to compare the contents of the various databases.
