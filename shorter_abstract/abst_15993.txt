at the same time bmp- <dig> displayed no influence on hascs proliferation, migration and susceptibility to oxidative stress.
human ascs from  <dig> healthy donors were treated or not with bmp- <dig>  and tested for gene expression , protein expression , proliferation, migration, secretory activity, immunomodulatory properties and susceptibility to oxidative stress.
bmp- <dig> activates tenogenic pathway in hascs but also affects secretory activity and impairs immunomodulatory potential of this population that can influence the clinical outcome after cell transplantation.

cell-based therapy is a treatment method in tendon injuries.
addition of bmp- <dig> significantly enhanced secretion of vegf, il- <dig>  mmp- <dig> and mpp- <dig> by hascs while had no effect on tgf-β, il- <dig>  egf and mmp- <dig>  moreover, bmp- <dig> presence in medium attenuated inhibitory effect of hascs on allo-activated lymphocytes proliferation.
bone morphogenic protein  <dig>  possesses tenogenic activity and was proposed as a differentiating factor for stem cells directed to transplantation.
therefore, the aim of this study was to determine if bmp- <dig> induces tenogenic differentiation of human adipose stem cells  and how it affects other features of this population.
rt-pcr revealed up-regulation of scx, mkh and runx <dig> genes in bmp- <dig> treated cells  and western blot revealed significant increase of coll <dig> and mhk expression after bmp- <dig> treatment.
