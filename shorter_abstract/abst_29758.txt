all ests were clustered into  <dig>  clusters, of which  <dig> % of the total ests belong to recognized toxin-coding sequences, being the sphingomyelinases d the most abundant transcript;  <dig> % include "possible toxins", whose transcripts correspond to metalloproteinases, serinoproteinases, hyaluronidases, lipases, c-lectins, cystein peptidases and inhibitors.
in order to examine the transcripts expressed in venom gland of loxosceles laeta spider and to unveil the potential of its products on cellular structure and functional aspects, we generated  <dig>  expressed sequence tags  from a cdna library.
this study provides a first global view of the gene expression scenario of the venom gland of l. laeta described so far, indicating the molecular bases of its venom composition.
the bite of spiders belonging to the genus loxosceles can induce a variety of clinical symptoms, including dermonecrosis, thrombosis, vascular leakage, haemolysis, and persistent inflammation.
