among those genes expressed were foxq <dig>  cpm, foxp <dig>  pcdh <dig>  and zmiz <dig>  which were previously reported in other endodermal tissues.
additionally, es cells are an excellent model for studies of early developmental processes.
genes that were specifically expressed in de and/or in pdx1-expressing cells were extracted and their expression patterns in normal embryonic development were studied.
we developed an efficient in vitro method to differentiate mouse es cells into the definitive endoderm  and then pdx1-expressing pancreatic lineages using mesodermal-derived supporting cells, m <dig>  using this method, resulting es cell-derived de and pdx1-expressing cells were isolated by cell sorting, and their gene expression profiles were investigated with dna microarray.
genes whose expression increased in de and pdx <dig> positive cells compared to the undifferentiated es cells were chosen and in situ hybridizations were performed.
we identified  <dig> genes, including  <dig> novel genes expressed in de and pancreatic progenitor cells during normal development using an es cell in vitro differentiation system.
these results showed that de cells and pdx1/gfp-expressing cells obtained from our m <dig> based differentiation method mimic cells during the normal developmental processes.
