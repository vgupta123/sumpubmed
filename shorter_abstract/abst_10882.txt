this project investigates document classification in the context of biological literature, making use of the textpresso markup of a corpus of caenorhabditis elegans literature.
while the classification results are currently optimized for caenorhabditis elegans papers by human-created rules, the classification engine can be adapted to different types of documents.
this clustering engine performed better on a standard test-set  compared to previously published results , while producing cluster descriptions that appear more useful.
we previously described textpresso, a text-mining system for biological literature, which marks up full text according to a shallow ontology that includes terms of biological interest.
our classification method first uses a support vector machine-trained classifier, followed by a novel, phrase-based clustering algorithm.
