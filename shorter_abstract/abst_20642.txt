the cg <dig> cells are unable to sporulate and in addition display an abnormal vacuolar morphology.
by analyzing the vacuolar morphology, growth rate and ability to sporulate we confirmed that the resulting vam <dig> protein was functionally active.
from our experiments we conclude that the dna watermarks produced by dna-crypt do not influence the translation from mrna into protein.
transformation of cg <dig> with prs <dig> vam <dig> leads to a phenotype very similar to the wildtype yeast strain cg <dig>  the integrated watermark did not influence the function of vam <dig> and the resulting phenotype of the cg <dig> cells transformed with prs <dig> vam7-tb shows no significant differences compared to the cg <dig> cells transformed with prs <dig> vam <dig>
for our investigations we used a mutant saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, called cg <dig>  which has an amber mutation within the vam <dig> sequence.
in silico analyses showed that in coding regions synonymous codons can be used to insert encrypted information into the genome of living organisms by using the dna-crypt algorithm.
