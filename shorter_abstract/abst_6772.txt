we evaluated the genome analyzer ii, hiseq and miseq and tested state-of-the-art low input library preparation methods.
in order to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches we need to be able to identify systematic sequencing errors and distinguish these errors from true genetic variation.
current error removal techniques are not designed to target the peculiarities encountered in illumina sequencing data and other sequencing-by-synthesis methods, causing biases to persist and potentially affect any conclusions drawn from the data.
we show that quality-score-based error removal strategies can on average remove  <dig> % of the substitution errors - however, the motif-bias remains.
we hypothesise that all of these biases are related to the engineered polymerase and ddntps which are intrinsic to any sequencing-by-synthesis method.
furthermore, a preferential incorporation of ddgtps was recorded.
on average the top three motifs were linked to  <dig> % of all substitution errors.
