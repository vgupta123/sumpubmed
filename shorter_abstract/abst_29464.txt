analysis of co-regulation enabled the determination of specific versus generic members of closely related gene families with respect to phosphate-starvation.
our results uncover much larger, staged responses to phosphate-starvation than previously described.
the hormone aba displayed a dominant role in regulating many phosphate-responsive candidates.
comparative analysis to atgenexpress identified cohorts of genes co-regulated across multiple stimuli.
